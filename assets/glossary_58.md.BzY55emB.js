I don't know what to make. I don't have the right ingredients. I'll feel bad if my family doesn't like it. Also, I am organizationally challenged, so making shopping lists and planning meals seemed like a huge task. Enter this book.I *love* the weekly shopping lists. My husband has been wishing I would cook more, so he is very happy to go to the store. I mark what I want on the print out and hand it to him (hint - get the one page printout from her website instead of photocopying the three pages from the book.)Now, how is the food? I immediately started a scoring system wherein everyone in the family votes on each meal. This way nobody hesitates to say what they think, because it might hurt my feelings or something. Only two meals have gotten a thumbs down to ever making them again (out of 25 or so, so far). Two have gotten two stars (our highest rating). The rest fall into the one star, pretty good category.My main complaint is that the food is just a bit bland. It needs more spices for our tastes. But, since I don't know how to cook, I don't know what spices to add. I need to do some research there. Also, I just don't find turkey to be an interesting food. I tend to subsititute pork or something for the turkey recipes."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I started a low carb diet a while back. This book has some great recipes and I really like the slow cooker recipes. I don't use the itemized menus all the time, but the recipes are easy to flip through. I also like that the recipes don't take too much time and they don't use a lot of exotic ingredients."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"My husband's diabetes is completely under control using recipes from this book. No meds...Not that I'm giving medical advice, or saying that it would be the same for everyone, but just a report. So far everything we have cooked has been very tasty and easy to prepare.

With a family history of diabetes I am now at the age where I must eat fewer simple carbs and this cookbook is perfect to help me eat healthier.One of the best things about Leanne's cookbooks is that they are not only delicious, they also have easy to find ingredients, and great tidbits of information spread throughout.Thanks Leanne for another fabulous home helper (and thanks FLYlady for introducing her to me!) :-)"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I cling to this book as though it is one of my most precious possesions...and it is! What a relief that someone else can plan my meals for me AND make out the shopping list! The meals are balanced and delicious and open to adaptations to make them low cal. There are also suggestions for side dishes and recipes to boot! It doesn't get any easier than this. This is truly an answer to the prayers of the exhausted, bedraggled cook in each family. I especially appreciate the crock pot recipes. There's nothing better than arriving home after work to a delicious, prepared meal!

Sometimes I will freeze what is left for a fast meal at a later date.The recipes are delicious. I have cooked foods that neither of us had eaten before, and we liked them all. It makes life so much easier to be able to shop with a ready made list and have recipes that are fast and easy to make.

My teenager didn't take seconds during the month that I used this. The recipes called for more red meat and pork than my family is used to eating.On the plus side, it is nicely organized and gave me tips on creating my own lists better and even she uses more meat than I do normally, she also uses a greater variety than I'm used to.

The grocery bill was 60. more than I normally spend. Also, the author makes an assumption that people who don't eat her menus must surely all be living on fast food, and says that's why our old grocery bills were lower. I wonder how she knows so much about everyone else. lol. We didn't live on fast food prior to buying this book, but we did have lower grocery bills and I'm going to go back to using common sense when planning my family's meals, which I used to do a week at a time, then keep those, and use them again in a few weeks.Also, her email customer service people were rude, but that's another story."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I have a family of four with several picky eaters, and we have had great success with the Saving Dinner Low Carb menus. As a working mom ultra-stressed for time, this is an absolute time-saver, as I can just take the menu shopping list to the store with me. Most of the meals can be on the table in 20 min. tops, which is great when you are squeezing dinner between getting home from work and rushing off to cub scouts. I've been following her LC menus for a while on line, and have given these books as gifts for time-stressed friends. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE (as they say)...since switching to Leanne's menus, not only do I SAVE TIME(planning, making lists, etc.) but I SAVE MONEY, and reduced our weekly shopping bill! Since many of the staples and meats repeat in the cycle, I can purchase economy size chicken breasts and pork chops and know that they will be used soon and not turn into prehistoric frozen wonders (i.e. wonder-what-it-was). There are weeks where all I need to purchase is produce...wow, does that feel great!All my fussy eaters have enjoyed the dinners, since it is easy to reduce or eliminate any spices that don't work for us. Best of all, we have expanded our horizons to new veggies, old veggies new styles, and multiple veggie meals. It's a pleasure having Leanne in my kitchen, she's like a member of the family!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"For those of you trying to keep low carb cooking going for your diabetic spouses, this is the best one I have tried so far.

The ingredients are easy to find in any supermarket; I use it almost every day."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I do not always follow the menus as they are in the book. We don't care for salmon, and we like to have family favorites or more \\"carby\\" meals sometimes. Having this book in my hand, as well as the previous book, Saving Dinner is such an inspiration and help when putting my weekly menu together! We rarely have the \\"I don't have any idea what's for dinner\\" issue any more. We have tried fun and healthy foods like faux-tay-tos (who'd a thought I really DID like cauliflower now that I am an adult!) and we had turnip fries too! I love them, and make them all the time now! We are not picky eaters, but we are definitely not into fancy, time consuming meals. Leanne helps us feel free to substitute or add ingredients or spices once we try the recipes pretty much as she has them. The meals are healthy, and the serving suggestions help us put it all together, something no other cookbook I have owned ever did. That is really important for the diabetic in our home. When our budget is tight I look for recipes that use ingredients we have on hand. Leanne uses interesting combinations of spices that I have never thought of. Almost all of the meals get 4 or 5 stars drawn beside them as we rate them for repeat meals. Leanne, thank you so much for the great ideas, and helping us to eat good healthy foods in new and interesting ways. We were not a \\"fast food family\\", but we were in a rut, and now we are really flying in our meals...yes, and thanks to Flylady for introducing us to you!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"Leanne Ely is a genius! First she gave us \\"Saving Dinner\\" and I used it and loved it. Menus are well-planned, organized, and delicious. With this latest book, \\"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way\\", Leanne has saved me. I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and my doctor recommended a regulated carb eating plan. When I got home from that appointment, I received notice of her new book. Perfect! I've been following it for almost two weeks now. The meals taste like \\"personal chef quality\\" and my picky husband will even eat some of them and usually he won't eat ANYTHING! I can't say enough about how happy I am with the menus, meal ideas, helpful tips, and the quality of the recipes. I have liked every recipe I've ever had from Leanne. I'm so glad that FlyLady (http://www.flylady.net) suggested her. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I love the convenience of this book, with the seasons broken down into weekly menus. Each menu features a shopping list which is helpful if you like all of the planned meals. Our family's not fond of several of the dinners (we don't like pork chops, for instance, no matter how they're made), so it still takes me a while to make out a shopping list. Also, the author uses whole wheat flour and cornstarch in the majority of recipes when other, carb-free options are available (e.g., ground pork rinds in place of flour for breading, guar gum for thickener, etc) so I still wind up adapting quite a bit to make it even more low-carb. On the plus side, there are suggestions for side dishes with each meal, both low-carb and regular, so once I find a recipe I want to try it's easy enough to make a meal that pleases everyone."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I purchased this book after trying Leanne's online menu-mailer. I wanted some extra ideas to substitute here and there. My husband likes familiar meals but he now says \\"As long as it is from this book, it is fine by me\\". He has willingly and happily tried everything I have cooked from this book. We like most of the ones I have tried. I am not a new cook. I have been doing so for 35 years and consider myself a good cook. But these recipes are tasty and most are very quick to prepare. I normally try and make enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day. But many of those times we have seconds that very night. And I am lunch-less the next day. It has helped me save money on our grocery bill each month. Leanne's book is a true winner!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I love this book and I am not a novice cook (too old for that). Entertaining is one of my hobbies and my cookbook collection numbers well over a hundred but I use this cookbook very frequently. I have been trying to live on the low-carb diet for several months and this book has been really fantastic. Everyone has to add or subtract seasonings to suit their family's taste but overall nothing has been a better help than the menus and recipes in this book. No one book can please everyone but this one should comes very close."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"At 50+ and mother of four (and fulltime worker outside of the home), I have used probably hundreds of different cookbooks. This one has got to be the best one I have ever used! Each week, all the dinners are planned and nutritionally sound; she even includes a detailed shopping list. Yesterday when I went to the store with my daughter and husband, we shopped for the items on the list and left the store knowing we'd have great dinners (and leftovers for lunch) all week. Another unexpected plus is that we are trying foods that we have never tried before (like kale and cod)... You gotta get it if you're tired of cooking the same old things for your family and detest spending hours wandering the aisles of the grocery store looking for ideas for dinner."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"Our family needs a diabetic menu for the parents and kids who still need carbs. Thank you, Leanne, for supplying the cookbook we needed! No really strange recipes (kid friendly) and we simply mark the corners of pages that everyone really likes. We occasionally play with the spices a bit, or substitute a side dish. It's not written in stone!I like to browse online, occasionally, but cooking's not my real passion. This book frees up time for those things that we ARE passionate about! Way to go!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I love to cook, and sometimes I'm too strapped for time. I'm not a big fan of prepackaged stuff, too much sodium or enriched ingredients, etc. I love this cookbook because it uses many whole foods and the amount of salt used is at my desretion. I grab this cookbook often the weeks I have limited time to prep and cook and to help us get out of the 'what do we feel like eating ruts'. Prep to table usually is about 30-35 minutes and not at all complicated.I have a picky eating family, who generally ask for seconds from the recipes here. I like the ability to download a shopping list off of the author's web site, and that author has considered what veggies are in season. All around a family winner and we're healthier eaters now too."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"This book has easy to follow recipes and everyone my husband and I have tried has been excellent.

I find it difficult to find the time to write a weekly menu, shop and cook daily. The book is arranged by season, and broken down into weekly menues AND shopping lists. So far I've completed 2 weeks of menues and they've been delicious. I have shared the meals with 3 other adults and all the recipes have been rated based on whether they'd like to have them again in the future. I am happy to say the recipes got 3 out of 4 thumbs up, and 4 out of 4 thumbs up.

I have subscribed to Leanne's menu mailer, but I find the book format easier to use. My picky family likes the recipes, and not having to think about what it fix is wonderful.

I really liked having the nutritional info on all the receipes. So far, we have not had 1 meal that we did not like. We may like some better than others, but hey that's life. I read some of the reviews & one was really funny--tomatoes are NOT low carb!!! I think some of these people take this way too seriously. I have yet to find a cookbook or lifestyle diet where I like every single receipe & ingredient. I did examine the book before I bought it to see if most of the reciepes had ingredients I have on hand or can get without going to a specialty store. As for making too much food, there are only 2 of us, & I love having the leftovers for lunch. Leanne-PLEASE keep up the good work!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"Honey? Sugar? Flour? Ohkay.....not anything that's acceptable on most low carb plans but the author acknowledges that she used them for convenience's sake because they are easy to find at the store.Not a book I'd recommend to someone first starting out, but one that an experienced low-carber can adapt. (Though I don't like having to 'translate' low carb recipes, that's what I bought the book for, to have ready to go recipes!) Overall some interesting recipes in it, and some neat tips. If you are new to LC I'd not rely on this one yet, but maybe buy it for when you know how to swap out acceptable foods. I checked on the author's web site and did enjoy her web site so it's worth a look."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I have an entire library of low carb cookbooks but when I received this one I knew it was special. Divided into seasons this one is very family friendly. I was looking for a book that would help me get a nightly dinner on the table and this one is it. It contains normal ingredients I can get at our supermarket. Short, uncomplicated recipes with suggested side dishes and grocery lists abound. Everything I have made has been very good.

Maybe not on my initial grocery bill, but on the other 3+ time I would end up going to the store to pick up just one item to make dinner with and then would end up leaving with a few extras - especially magazines!!That is where the money savings come.If you plan your meals weekly and shop once a week - this book isn't for you, you don't need it, but otherwise___Plus my husband and daughter love the recipes !"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I rarely write reviews but I had to rave about this book! I've been doing low carb on and off for years and have several good and bad cookbooks but this one outshines them all. Everything I have tried is wonderful!

Of special help is the grocery list following each recipe.Another thing I appreciate about this cookbook is that the recipes are of the \\"down home\\" variety. There are no weird-sounding recipes with equally bazaar and hard-to-find ingredients. These are delicious meals that your family will love."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"Making the adjustment to low carb has meant learning a whole new way to cook. Before I discovered this book, other recipes I've tried have been bland or required too much prep time.Not this one. From the very first page, I was able to hit the ground running, since the book comes compete with WEEKLY shopping lists and recipes that take a short time to throw together but taste like they've taken all day to cook. We enjoyed Cube steaks with onion gravy, Thai Shrimp, Skillet Chicken Mediterranean and more.Don't be scared by the \\"exotic\\" sounds of some of the recipes. This is family cooking, NOT something that you could only eat if you had the most refined of palates. If your kids aren't fish lovers, you might want to keep some simple alternatives on hand but on most nights, they should be able to eat the same menu as the \\"Low carbers\\".ONE caveat - Some of the recipes are designed for a crockpot. I don't have one and I found it simple to adjust the cooking times. It was no big deal. But do keep in mind that at least one recipe a week is designed for a crockpot. Again, this wasn't a big deal to me, even without one.In every other way, the book is perfect for our needs and we've branched out into newer, better recipes than before. Thanks, Leanne!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"Leanne Ely has done it again! She provides great family friendly recipes that are healthy and yummy! You will never feel deprived eating like this. No hard-to-find high-priced ingredients here - it's real food for real people. Even those not interested in low-carb will benefit from this book. With each recipe, she provides serving suggestions for those who aren't giving up carbs. I highly recommed this book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I bought this book along with Saving Dinner and Saving Dinner for the Holidays last year.I LOVE the concept of having the weekly menu planned out as well as the grocery list put together and ready for shopping. We went through the entire book and I have to say, it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods. Also, the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance \\"What's for dinner\\" and be ready to prepare it.The only cons I can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly, and you will need to be an open minded eater. If you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household, this may not be the book for you. Also, our grocery bill for two went up from about $75 a week to $125 because of the veggies and meats. Good, healthy quality food ingredients, but unfortunately, painful to the wallet.That said, I have NEVER seen a low carb book out there that compares to this one, the food is good, the variety is there, and it takes the low carb lifestyle above and beyond \\"bunless burgers\\" and eggs and bacon.Overall, I would recommend Leanne's Saving Dinner books. For the open minded foodie. Or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list. These books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I've been faithfully using the original Saving Dinner for quite some time and purchased SDLC about 2 months ago. I love the low carb version equally but differently than the original. For starters, I thought going low carb was a fad. Little did I know the nutritional benefits! Second, these menus serve 4 instead of 6. Since it's just me and my 1 year old DD, I use 1 week of menus to last 2 weeks. It's great and I don't have so many leftovers that I feel like I'm eating the same thing all the time! Third, I've discovered I love soup. Who knew?!? I thought I was a soup-hater. Turns out I LOVE homemade soups and have a huge distaste for the canned stuff. Finally, I've learned to embrace new vegetables. This is a big deal for me. I'm 26 and only learned to love vegetables in my 20s. Now I'm expanding my horizons even more.If you haven't checked out Leanne Ely's books, I encourage you to do so. Be adventurous! Try something new! If nothing else, learn how to plan a menu the way she does."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"Any cookbook can throw a bunch of recipes at you. But no other I know of has thought up \\"what's for dinner\\" every night for a year -- and made it so incredibly painless! The shopping list for each week is available online, too. Just print out your current week, cross off what you already have in your kitchen, and buy what the lady says to (I even once gave the list to my DH and even he couldn't screw it up - no offense!). Bang! Everything you need for a week's worth of dinner is right there & ready to go. The only *minor* problem we have has is that in a 2-person household, fresh ingredients don't always get used up before they spoil; so you may have to juggle the order of the meals a bit. This book is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED from a fulltime worker with an hour's commute each way because a healthy, tasty dinner is always at hand. Bon appetit!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I've tried maybe 10-15 of the recipes so far. Most have been big hits. No outrageous food items. Leanne Ely knows how to use combinations of spices that make your mouth sing! We are loving these recipes. Her explanations are also crystal clear so you have the feeling that you'll have success -- and you do. The plan of giving you a weekly shopping list is interesting. I don't do that each week, but it sure makes things easy going to the store (or pantry). The most wonderful thing about this book is that I don't have to cook 2 different meals for my family. I eat a moderate carb diet so I appreciate the lower carb count in the recipes, however, she gives ideas of what to add to the meal to round it out for family members who want that full-carb feeling. Ha! Each recipe has a nutritional analysis, too. I find this especially helpful as I'm not doing as much fat as the typical low-carb diet. I can tweak the recipes to lower the fat more easily than I could lower the carbs on a regular cookbook. (Ely's regular SAVING DINNER cookbook has tons more carbs but less fat.) I'm thrilled with what I'm finding in this book. My kids have given me unsolicited complements!!! That ranks!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I bought this book to replace a copy I borrowed from a friend and promptly wore out, because it was so handy. My husband is a very particular eater, and he hasn't liked most of the meals I've brought home from the meal prep places, like Super Suppers. But, he's enjoyed most of the meals I've made with Saving Dinner. And, with the menu and grocery list planned out by week, I don't spend the two hours menu planning and making up the grocery list. I even have had success with the crock-pot meals, which I haven't done well in the past with other recipes. (I do find that my slow cooker takes a lot less time than the recipe calls for, so I cut my cooking time by a couple of hours and use a meat thermometer to determine if it's done.)The recipes are easy to make. The menus are grouped by season so that you can take advantage of produce at it's height. I find the book is most effective when you make every dish for the week, rather than pick and choose recipes. Then you can optimize the menu and grocery list. We've been pleasantly surprised when we do that even the dishes that we weren't too excited reading about have turned out to be tasty.I may use this book to organize a meal planning night with friends once a month because I do miss that comaraderie you get at the meal prep places. It'll be interesting to see if that would be involved/easy or cost effective over the meal prep places.Overall, this book is a huge timesaver, we may be able to use with friends to do some prep nights, has saved us money by keeping us out of the restaurants and drive-thru's, and we are around the dinner table more! It'd be a great gift for newlyweds. I wish I'd had something like YEARS ago!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"This is a great book, just for the fast and friendly recipes.

You do need to watch the recipes closely if you are tyring to lose weight. There are ways in wich you can make the recipes even more low carb friendly!Overall, great find!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I have about 30 Low Carb Cookbooks, and along with George Stella's two (which I love), this one is getting a LOT of use. One of the things I like about it is that you don't have to buy unusual items to make these meals...no guar gum, no flax seed, no whey protein powder, no things-you've-never-heard-of-and-don't-know-where-to-buy sort of ingredients. So far, only one recipe was mediocre (sauteed scallops on spinach). But the spiced pork chops tonight were great, and the bang-bang taco soup was easy and tasty. So was the Mediterranean Chicken. I think the shopping lists are an excellent idea, and I also like the idea of the seasonal menus (though I've been bouncing around from place to place in the book, making what sounds good and what's on sale at the supermarket.)

When I first purchased it years ago, I was hesitant about many of the recipes. My fears were unfounded and my family embraced most of the meals from the book. While I no longer follow it strictly by the week, I love choosing and cooking the recipes and each week one or more will still be on the menu. Each recipe is full of flavor and easy to prepare, with plenty of leeway if you're like me and don't measure much. It may take a few shopping trips to build up your supply of basic staples needed for most of the menus. I am not a strict LC dieter....but the book is filled with healthy nutritious recipes for any eating plan. They are fast and simple to prepare with great instructions and a variety of serving suggestions for sides...both LC and regular if you want to include a few carbs, making this an everyday, year round, cookbook, not a diet cookbook. I do have to say that I did not find it cheaper to cook from the full meal plans, as we do not eat out much, but the cost was not a huge increase, and was mitigated even more when I had the staples ready and available in the house. I love variety when I cook, but not hours every day after work trying to put supper on the table. This book always inspires me!Includes: nutritional information, low carb and regular serving suggestions, shopping lists with access to online printable listsRecipes vary seasonally, making this a good choice for year round meal planning.Grocery bill each week: Average costs if you're used to cooking at home, with additional expenses until the staple items are purchased. Cheaper if your family eats out 2 or more times/week.My husband does not eat tomatoes or tomato based sauces, and these recipes seldom use tomatoes, making recipe substitutions minimal work for us."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I purchased this book because I am a terrible cook and wanted to start learning!

I love how Dr. Moore gets open and shares things to make the reader understand him as a person better. How he gives up the comforts of life to allow himself to be used greatly for the kingdom of God. Yet by doing so he gains so much by doing so.This book is an encouragement to anyone who is in ministry or has a desire to answer the call of ministry. It reminds me how blessed I truly am.

Rarely, if ever, I am sure. Yet this is exactly what this book portrays -- someone who has heard a call from God so clearly and so profoundly that together with his beloved wife and three children, he leaves his homeland for the distant shores of a poverty-stricken nation in West Africa, there to spend his life in loving labor for those to whom Jesus is a mere name, if they have heard of him at all. It is a story of sacrifice, but mysteriously that sacrifice brings not only back-breaking toil and heart-wrenching sorrow but also exhilarating joy and fulfillment beyond all imagining. On the Wings of a Dove is a reminder that human beings are made not for self-aggrandizement but for self-giving, which alone can bring true fulfillment."},{"Title":"Necessary Light: Poems (May Swenson Poetry Award Series)","review":"This collection of poetry does what truly great poetry should do -- it touches so truly and so deeply upon the human condition -- the joy and the suffering of it -- that the personal voice of the poet becomes, as Galway Kinnell once wrote, just another voice of a creature on the planet speaking. Whether speaking of difficult or joyous times, the loss of love or its fond remembrance, the naming of a child, aging, or death, the poet's words enliven, enrich and expand the reader's own experience, outwitting despair, careening toward joy, encountering pain with courage, and then letting that pain go to the &quot;dirt-borers,&quot; whose job it is to turn the dead back into the living again. This is poetry that can save your life on those dark winter nights when the only voice you can hear is the one of your own despair. If I had to choose one or two voices to have with me on such nights, voices to sail the psyche's frail ship to morning's shore, Ms. Fargnoli's would be chief among them."},{"Title":"Necessary Light: Poems (May Swenson Poetry Award Series)","review":"Amazing book of poetry.

And time-of-flight instruments having a mass range of 5000 and resolution of 200? Several years before this book was published, commercial machines were available with mass ranges well over 100,000 Da and resolutions of 10,000+. Not only poor, but misleading.

Jim Bell's new novel DEADLOCK is a book that grabs hold in the first paragraph and doesn't let go. With a riveting plot line that takes off on the premise of a Supreme Court judge converting to Christianity, it read like something right out of the front pages. I love it when I learn something from a book too, and it was fascinating to see how the Supreme Court works and all the politics involved in decisions. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"James Scott Bell has done it again, providing yet another fast-paced, riveting read, this time setting the book in the halls of the Supreme Court and Congress. Being a Marylander, I was wondering if Bell would be able to nail that &quot;inside the beltway&quot; feel of DC. He did. I learned more about the Supreme Court, and in an entertaining way, reading this novel than I've ever learned in school. The main character, Millie, a liberal justice, is written with such care and sensitivity. Though her views were diametrically opposed to my own when the novel opens, I found myself loving the woman anyway, due to the fact that Bell paints her as a human being with wonderful qualities. Deadlock takes the high road in character-development, refusing to demonize her entire character because of differing political views. Bravo, Jim, for writing a novel regarding issues without a heavy hand. The story speaks for itself."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"James Scott Bell has answered the ultimate political what-if question. What would happen if the swing voice on the United States Supreme Court, the darling of the elite eastern media and the hero of center-left Democratic party, undergoes a change of heart and becomes a dyed-in-the-wool conservative? And what if her conversion occurs just as she is appointed chief justice?In a thoroughly Christian thriller, James Scott Bell delivers a heart-pounding suspense that paints all sides of the political canvass. Bell is clearly conservative politically and yet he doesn't offer weak, straw-man arguments for the other side. Neither does he create stick-figure belivers who can only offer easy cliques. He gives a heroine who makes the slow journey towards God and a pastor whose only checkered past gives him a heart for souls in need and a compassion for the hurts of those around him.James Bell weaves the everday life of common Americans with the inside-the-beltway intrigue that makes Washington, D.C, the most suspicious place in the world.Deadlock is a solid Christian novel that asks the right questions, keeps the heart pumping, and weaves a sure, but subtle Christian theme throughout."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"The first book by James Scott Bell I read was &quot;Blind Justice&quot;. It was a fast-paced book that was heavy on action, and it held my attention. &quot;Deadlock&quot; was the second one I read, and it was a very different novel. While &quot;Blind Justice&quot; could be considered a legal thriller, &quot;Deadlock&quot; would have to be more of a character study. There's honestly not a lot of action here, nor is there a lot of courtroom action (one subplot deals with an abortion case, but it has the majority of court time in the book), but there is a lot of character growth. The change in Millie is believable and paced well, and I have to say doing it any differently would have been a little too &quot;fictionalized&quot; for my taste. I only have two complaints, one major and one minor. The only true down spot I didn't like was the ending. There was an undercurrent of unrest in the Supreme Court with her change, and she makes a decision and gets help for it...then changes her mind a few chapters later. We are set up for an awesome showdown, and then it never happens. I realize that it was making a statement about her character and belief in the court, but it still seemed to cheat us just a little. The only other minor complaint is that one of the characters is described as looking like Denzel Washington, and that just never sits well with me. I think the fun of a novel is deciding your own players for the parts in your head, and when an author goes ahead and tells us who's playing this character, it sort of robs the fun of it. It's sort of like he's saying &quot;I don't feel like describing this character, so here's who it is.&quot; I'm not saying that was Mr. Bell's intent, but it's a matter of personal preferences. Another novel I read did that for every single character (&quot;This guy looks like a young Harrison Ford,&quot; and &quot;She looked like Sharon Stone&quot;), and I haven't liked it since. Again, that's just a minor complaint and I didn't even take that into consideration while rating this book. Other than that, there's not a lot to complain about. The revealed identity of one of the characters caught me completely by surprise, and I have to give a thumbs-up for that one. It fit perfectly into the story, and it made another character's decision late in the book make sense. I'll definitely be picking up more of Mr. Bell's books in the future, and I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"And that, to me, is a good book. This was a Kindle freebie and after reading it, I wanted to read more of James Scott Bell's books.The plot was enticing...a Supreme Court Justice whose beliefs were well-formed, a change in her faith and how that impacted her position within the Supreme Court and politics surrounding that...some good twists including an \\"untypical\\" sub-ending and just a little twist for the real ending.The logic and background were interesting. I started the book and didn't put it down until I finished it. A good read!And now, I have to go read my second James Scott Bell book."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"James Scott Bell's writing has never let me down. This novel had everything: a page-turning plot, interesting history, intelligent dialogue, intriguing questions to ponder, touches of humor, and even a lovely romance tucked between the suspense and action. Most of all, it had succint, witty, crisp writing. It made me smile and it made me cry. I couldn't ask for more in a book."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"This is a what if legal thriller that demands you pay attention!This is the nightmare \\"what-if\\" scenario for the radical left. Suppose a liberal Supreme Court justice had a religous experience (or to put it blunter, she becomes a born-again, Bible-reading believer).Go further and explore the impact her conversion has on her pro-abortion, establishment clause and \\"living constitution\\" vs. original intent beliefs.Add one last goodie. While she is examining her positions, a liberal president (Al Gore, perhaps) nominates her as Chief Justice.Now you've got the pot boiling.The pro-abortion lobby has built an entire industry atop a fragile, and increasingly frail legal latticework. Should that ever truly be threatened, then are there any limits to politcal attacks or has the division between left and right gone too far?I finished this one around 2:00 AM. You might want to start this on a Friday night so you can sleep in on Saturday."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"Deadlock is a well crafted legal thriller that is hard to put down.It centers around Supreme Court Justice Milly Hollander who has some major life happenings including a near death experience that makes her examine her relationship with God. That leads to a major transformation of her legal philosophy.This happens about the same time that she is nominated to be the Chief Justice by a liberal president. Her new views cause major consternation for the president and members of Congress who share his philosophy. They make it their mission to destroy her.Along the way, the author weaves in a subplot of a young woman who has a major legal battle with the abortion industry.Overall, the story was excellent. It addresses issues of concern to all and will make the readers think. There are two things that I did not like. One is a plot twist that I would have liked to have seen done differently. Although the way it was written led to a major surprise, I think it took away from some excitement that could have occurred later on had it been done differently.The other criticism was this: One of the characters, Jack Holden, had written a legal brief exploring the big questions of life, God, etc. during his own spiritual searching. Holden shares it with the Justice. Mr. Bell only provided enough of the brief to whet the reader's appetite. I would like to see him expand on that. He could actually write a complete future novel based around that.In spite of that, this is a great book with superb character development. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"Deadlock by James Scott Bell is the story of Millicent Hollander, a Supreme Court justice who is a known atheist and liberal vote on the court. When she finds her life suddenly taking a drastic turn, she finds herself forced to face her lack of faith and re-evaluate everything she believes in. This was the first book I've read by Bell, and to me it seems a little like Randy Singer-lite. There's less emphasis on the law and characterizations and more on plot. It's very well written, and I enjoyed how Bell used coincidences to bring not just Millie but others to faith. But Millie's change of heart seemed a little forced, especially her decision at the end of the book. It also felt a bit like this was a set up for the beginning of a series (maybe I'm wrong, but that's how it felt). Bell does a good job of talking about Jesus and the Bible without proselytizing. This was definitely an enjoyable read, and I look forward to reading more of Bell's work, however if his other books are too similar to this one, I can see it would become formulaic."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"Who writes these &quot;Publisher Weekly&quot; reviews anyhow? Do they read the same books the rest of us do?Bell has given us another great read with realistic charactersand an intriguing twist. This is one I didn't want to put down until I finished it. He keeps getting better and better, and this one is his best yet!"},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"This was the first book that I have read from Mr. Bell. It is a riveting yarn about the power of politics over the duty of the Supreme Court.What happens when a liberal Justice is made Chief Justice and gives their life to Christ? This is the key question addressed in this book.Mr. Bell does an awesome job of writing about how the heart can be changed by a saving knowledge of Christ and how this change is often received by others.I plan on reading other books by this author. If you are looking for a good suspense read, with a realistic glimpse into the politic of the pro-abortion crowd, this will be an excellent read."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"I discovered Jim Bell a few years ago when a friend suggested Blind Justice.

His \\"Deadlock\\" is a direct and effective challenge to the nation's courts' continuing encroachment into the legislative branch of our government. Highly recommended!--R.C. Howe"},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"James Scott Bell tackles a fascinating dilemma: What if a Supreme Court Justice becomes a Christian right before appointment as chief justice? The one who holds tie-breaking power has changed her worldview. Bell handles the social debate with excellence and entertaining form. I meant to do a quick read, but had to peruse every word. The woman who had a knack for \\"beating God back with a stick,\\" must scramble to open herself up to faith and the perplexity of answering why she's become the bait in a vicious public battle. Great enlightenment for anyone who'd like to understand the people behind the politics."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"Deadlock is an exciting legal thriller by one of the best Christian authors today, James Scott Bell. In Deadlock, Bell tackles the hot button issue of abortion from the political and judicial point of view, pointing out just how divisive the issue is to our country.Millie Hollander is a Supreme Court Justice on the verge of being the chief justice when she is hit by a car. This experience causes her to question her own beliefs in death, the afterlife and God.Meanwhile, Senator Levering from Oklahoma (you know this is fiction because there is no way a hard drinking, womanizing, Ted Kennady-esque Senator would ever come from Oklahoma) is assuring the democratic president that Hollander would continue to keep the tenious liberal/moderate majority on the court.Charlene Moore is taken on the national abortion lobby with a teenager as a client, alleging her client was warned of all the dangers of abortion before she had the procedure.Senator Levering, his seedy operative, Anne Deveraux as well as Hollander are all great characters who at one time or another have to reconcile their actions with their belief in God.This is a great legal novel with solid insights on how the Supreme Court operates. It also has strong relationships at its core, and that is what makes it a good novel. Bell doesn't solve the abortion crisis in this novel, but does make it apparent what he believes: God is the only way to really solve the problem."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"This was a bible thumping adventure into a predictable story made up of boring characters. I can't belive I bought it and even more tragic was wasting time reading it.."},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"One of the best things about Bell's writing is that it gets you thinking about issues that matter in a way that is not preachy. This book is no exception. It has a great setup in the idea of a liberal supreme court judge suddenly having her whole life changed by God. What's that going to do to all the political calculations people have made?There are some great plot twists and the characters are true to life not stereotypes. The book also has some great insights about the legal system and the way the supreme court works. I liked the subplot, which pits a young African American lawyer against one of the biggest law firms in the South over what happens in abortion clinics. It made the book two legal thrillers in one!"},{"Title":"Deadlock","review":"this poorly veiled right wing lecture portrays all liberals as drunks and athiests and the good guys as model christians."},{"Title":"To Control the Stars","review":"Despite the fact that this book revolves around the use of \\"stargates,\\" it has nothing to do with the movie or television series of that name, as should be obvious by the publication date. Published in 1977, the book has a very \\"seventies\\" feel about it, though it is set a bit more than a thousand years in the future. Even in the seventies, it would probably have been considered little more than a collection of the standard SciFi ideas: Earth as only one planet of an ancient, fallen Empire; stargates that allow instant travel between planets; a shady, quasi-governmental conspiracy to seize control; the plucky, newly-graduated hero the conspiracy tries to silence because he Knows Too Much; etc. The writing isn't bad, just mediocre. This isn't a book that will change your life, but if you are bored it will kill a few hours relatively painlessly.The sequel, \\"To Escape the Stars,\\" is quite a bit better, both darker and yet more hopeful.From the back cover:Surrounded by armed, watchful soldiers, Shan and Luvici followed the priests down the low-ceilinged corridor. The smell of damp was everywhere. As they turned the corner, the two men had their first glimpse of the room where they would be offered as human sacrifices in some ancient, savage ritual.\\"Look!\\" Shan cried. \\"The shrine -- it's a gate!\\"The Stargate itself was unlike any construction he had ever seen; it was framed by twisting pillars of translucence. What was a Stargate doing here in this primitive place?How could these barbarians have one of the gates...the very gates which enabled Shan's civilization to move instantly from any one of their 3000 worlds to any other? How could a Stargate possibly be in this dungeon which reeked of human blood and superstition?Shan followed the steps down, down, down...his eyes riveted on the gate. Would the gate still function? That was his only hope..."},{"Title":"To Control the Stars","review":"I've reread this over the years. Although the adventure format is not intellectually challenging, it isn't predictable, and it does give a very good sense of how disjoint civilizations might get when their primary interplanetary travel is disrupted over an entended period. Not reading the 1963 short story it was based on, it's a little difficult to tell whether the confrontation between those who wish to let native civilizations evolve naturally -- or to exploit them -- is from \\"Star Trek\\", or vice versa. The descriptions of the various native worlds and locations are convincing. A few hours' of pleasant reading."},{"Title":"To Control the Stars","review":"This book and its sequel undoubtedly form the basis for the two TV series and possibly the movie. There is even a field agent (male) named Sam'l Carter who appears in the early and late chapters of the first book. There are too many other parallels between the books and the series for them not to be related. The writing is mediocre and several ideas and terms have been lifted from other franchises (e.g., the Federation - Star Trek, psychohistory - Isaac Asimov's Foundation series). Consider a few ideas from the book/series: Humans didn't evolve on Earth but rather came to Earth and displaced hominids who were rapidly advancing. Earth's gate was buried at the pole. There was a forerunner race that seeded the galaxy with stargates and people. The stargates are built out of materials that last for millions of years. There is an ancient race of people that kept their history and technology intact and that remain aloof from the rest of the galaxy's inhabitants. This race has the keys (locations and codes) for all the stargates and they give this technology and other advanced tech to a group of humans before they leave for another galaxy. Stargates can be located on ships. Stargates can't operate between each other on planets. The stargates are controlled by pedestals using a control crystal. The ancient race (Alnians) leave behind holographic copies of themselves to talk to people who go on quests to find them. They fled to another nearby galaxy and discovered too late that their genetic diversity has been compromised and that they are dying as a race. Pretty much except for the Goauld and the wraith, the major elements of SG1 and Atlantis are here. My personal opinion is that SG1 is the best science fiction series of all time. It was pretty cool to come across what appears to me to be the inspiration for the series."},{"Title":"Lifeboat Sailors","review":"This book offered a rare and informative insight into the world of US Coast Guard lifeboat stations and the sailors that man them.

I was stationed in Port Angeles for over 10 years and visited the Small boat Stations he talks about. As an Enlisted man with over 15 years, I have many friends at those stations and Dr. Noble tells it like it is. Of course this book was written pre-911 but still with all the growth for the Coast Guard and larger focus on Homeland Security, the Small Boat stations have had little change or given any more assets, but definitely have more patrol requirements. Dr. Noble's ideas and problems still remain. Search and Rescue has again taken back seat, this time to Homeland Security instead of Law Enforcement of the 80's. His prologue and epilogue tell the story of the tragic events of February 12 of 1997, when the 44 foot Motor Life Boat 44363 rolled and lost 3 of its four person crew. Dr. Noble happened to be a Station Quillayute River that night and provides us a first hand account of the events.

Fundamentally, it has been a mass-based, irrelevant pursuit where the believers are the cherished and get to sack in heaven with angels and the damned will be burnt in hell. I mean, even religion is based on what happens to one's senses which has proven time and again to be misleading. All great wars have been fought over religion and the heap of dead from time-immemorial has had generous contributions from the business of religious warfare. And all this is supposedly presided over by a monarch(read God) who sits in the heavens and is neatly using a double accounting system to be sure of his assets(believers) and liabilities(the pagans).It is in this background that an experience like Zen is extremely critical so that we just get up, see that the emperor is not wearing any clothes and get on with our lives. Watts is simply the best as far as Zen is concerned.Zen or Dhyana Budhhism is against the use of words/ symbols to describe enlightenment but believes in going for the state of pure bliss itself. This point has been brought about in this brilliant book by Alan Watts. The gist of the message is One doesn't and cannot have a map(read words and other symbols here)to know oneself. Just imagine feeling ourselves not as human beings but as skull+nerves+tendons+bones+muscles+ ego. It is impossible to get any kind of coherent picture. The same analogy applies to reaching god through prayers(more words), sacrifices(symbols), idols, magic(more symbols)etc. Definitely,reading this book is one of the most important experiences in my life."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Alan Watts' The Way of Zen, is an excellent, though somewhat dated, overview of Zen Buddhist and Taoist \\"thinking\\"."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I have recently heard various recordings of Alan Watts and am very impressed. He was a most prolific lecturer. However, this program can be regarded as a bait and switch. It is presented as a work by Alan Watts, but the majority (over 90%) is narrated by someone other than Alan Watts. In the arena of Zen, I can only describe this as the difference between fire and ice. When you hear Alan speak, most erudite, it's fire, when you hear the narrator speak... ice... the narrator lacks any effect, and leaves you listless... not able to listen to the message. Do not purchase this program... you will be disappointed. Only purchase programs that are original lectures by Alan Watts.This is the first review I have ever posted... but was compelled to do so."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I'm a secular humanist and majored in particle physics in H.S. I'm agnostic/atheistic yet very spiritual.This review is being written by someone with an M.S. in Education ,and skeptical of so-called mysticism .This book is for the most part right to the point ,avoiding polysyllabic pretentiousness and vague notions. Mr. Watts made it simple to understand a compassionate way of life that helps individuals to balance emotions and gain control over them. He takes on the false notion of reincarnation which has no place at all in Zen,Tao or original Buddhism. He shows that mortality is a reason for enjoying simple pleasures. We are not only individuals but social beings. I aim for a life that is less egocentric,balancing emotions through meditation. Alan Watts is highly responsible for making Zen concepts available to the Western world.He died yet his ideas carried on. The reader must however must eventualy close the book ,learn meditation and practice it. The notion that it is Japanese or Chinese or Indian are nonsense. Incorporate the ideas gently and make small changes in your life for yourself and the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Once I read this book as a seeking young person, one eager to know every possible way of understanding the world. And this with the hope of coming to the ' Truth'. I remember Watts book on Zen as clear and appealing if never wholly convincing. And this not because of any defect in Watts but because the fundamental thrust of Zen is different as I understand it from what I as a Jewish religious believer fundamentally understand.Zen does not speak or think about a personal God. It does not speak or think about the Covenant or meeting between God and Man .It has no conception of this kind of personal revelation.In opposite it seems to be teaching us not to look ' for this kind of thing' And to somehow leave aside the individual private and the collective communal selves and flow into the world of Nature and Being indistinguishable. And even this last phrase is probably wrong for Zen since the speaking about it in this way is again ' categorizing' and ' humanizing' . Zen as I sense Watts presents it wants us to free ourselves from these kinds of aspirations and find our way to an enlightentment which once it is called that is not enlightenment either.\\"When you say it's the wrong way, and when you don't say you don't say , so the way the real way is to say and not say, to not say and say , to not say and not say , to say and say- everyday.\\"The Jewish way is of course to pray three times a day in the very same words other Jews elsewhere and all generations of Jews have prayed\\"I am sorry. I know most of the readers of these reviews on Watts book are seeking to better understand Zen. I don't think I have helped you. I think that what I have said is that I recognize that Watts has written a very good book about Zen, but Zen is simply not my cup of chicken soup."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I give this book 3 stars b/c it was well written, and probably a good tome depending on what you are looking for. However, for me, I guess it was just the wrong book at the wrong time. I found it to be way too dry.... dare I say a bit boring, and I thought it sucked some of the fun and the life out of the subject matter. When you spend countless pages trying to logically explain how the universe can be looked at as a unified whole, it's just taking things a bit too far. Now, I guess that since this book is geared toward the logical Western mind, it makes sense to focus on logical arguments, I just felt that this book was overwrought intellectually, without enough consideration paid to the intuitive side of things. I would have rather had a bit more left to the imagination, especially given the subject matter.At the same time, I recognize that this is meant as an academic work, so I guess it doesn't make sense to expect the tone to be more juicy. And, to be fair, I stopped reading about halfway through, so take my review with a grain of salt. Perhaps one day Ill come back to this book when the time is right for me, but for now I didn't feel like finishing it just for the sake of finishing it."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I was really interested in hearing more from Alan Watts and his view on life. But once i got the CD's I found out that Alan Watts was only in for brief segments, and that the CD was actually narrated by another gentlemen. I've been searching for a long time for pieces of Alan Watts segments that he has in his life and I thought that \\"the way of zen\\" was an audio collection of his work, however, it only offers very small recordings here and there.

In other words, instead of spontenaity that Watts always has, this is cement...it is static. It is the anti-zen.

Watts seems to have considerable intellectual understanding of Zen, and equally importantly, intuition about its inner content. He writes about Zen in a somewhat Zen-like way; not with a series of enigmas and paradoxes, but with a simple and direct narrative that covers the essential history and practice of Zen, illustrated with numerous relevant and potent quotes, and conveyed throughout with an intuitive immediacy that is refreshing and indeed uplifting. It's a good book."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This is definitely the best thing I have read on &quot;Eastern&quot; thought and philosophy.

Although &quot;The Book&quot; may speak to a wider audience, this is the best English book on Eastern thought in terms of accesibility and comprehensiveness. It provides us a nice historical overview of the evolution of this type of consciousness and explains the main messages of various &quot;Eastern&quot; schools of thought in a way that most of us Western minds can comprehend. Because of this, I use this as a book as one of the texts in my class of Eastern philosophy. Another book I use for this class is a book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It is an excellent book that provides a nice bridge between Western thought and Eastern thought in a way that students can understand and appreciate. If you are truly interested in Eastern thought, I believe that these two books are two pieces of essential reading."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Alan Watts has always had the most amazing ability to speak the unspeakable, and in The Way of Zen you will feel the true essence of Zen as long as you don't get hung up on the words.To get the point, one must read without &quot;reading&quot; because Zen itself can never be put into words. But as you are taken through Zen's conception, birth, growth, and finally into the arts - you will notice that: &quot;this ain't just literature.&quot; I have adored Alan's style of writing for over 25 years now, and I must say that this is one his best books, and surely the best ever writen on the subject ( with the one possible exception of D.T. Susuki's writings.) However, I have always found Watts to be more enjoyable, because he understands the western mind and the complications we will inevitably encounter while trying to understand something so completely Chinese as Zen. As you read, you will notice an intimacy develope between author and reader, master and student, or master and master. This book is not only for the serious student of Zen, but for anyone who enjoys eastern thought and &quot;mysticism.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This book does a great job of covering the history and development of Zen, and its various divisions. It tells the chronological story of the people and places that shaped Zen into what it is today.It is very specific, using the original names of various people, places, concepts, and sects of Zen. There are hundreds of words you will encounter that you've never heard of, you will hope to retain due to intrigue, but will ultimately forget because you are not Rain Man (at least I'm no Kim Peak).Interspersed into the rich history of Zen is a large amount of what Alan Watts is known for: profound, rich, yet simple, insight.I found this book to be of use for both a history lesson and spiritual growth. Perhaps more a history lesson than a genuine spiritual guide."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I read this book in 1983 and still consider it one of the most important books I've read. Zen is a difficult concept for Western thinkers. I'm not into ritualistic behaviors. I don't sit in certain positions to do my contemplation. I don't feel a need for religious repetition of phrases, sounds, ideas, or postures. This is why I was and still am attracted to the way of zen.

It uses the culmination to explain the foundations of Zen and its 'meaning.' great informative book."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This book was my introduction to Zen Buddhism, and it is an excellent starting point for beginners seeking to understand Zen from a \\"Western perspective.\\""},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This book consists of two parts. Part I is history and Part 2 contains Zen principles and practice. This book is perfect for any\\"one\\" who is interested in Zen but is not quite sure they want to buy a Zen book that is 1000 pages long. This book is highly condensed and very easy to read and understand. The history of Buddhism is exceptionally well done since the key to understanding Zen is to understand the evolution of Buddhism. The key to understanding Chinese culture as well as their language is to understand the \\"I Ching\\" or mental power and \\"The Tao\\" or intuition/suchness/naturalness. The Tao is the opposite of \\"Confucianism\\" or logic.Buddha \\"the enlightened one\\" History covers the spread and evolution of this \\"thought system\\" from India to China to Japan.Early \\"Indian\\" Buddhism is a lengthy path to non-duality and can take many lives.Zen Buddhism is the direct path and can be \\"experienced\\" now; which is why it is so difficult for westerners to understand what Zen is. Ask a Zen Master a question and the answer will not make sense. The Zen Master points to the non dual answer which can seem like madness to us who dwell in the Hell of a dual world.A Zen Buddhist Master sees no contrast, no division, no symbols, no past and no future. The Zen Buddha only sees the NOW since everything else is an illusion. The Zen Buddha generates no karma......no bad karma AND no Good karma.......no inner world and no outer world. The Zen Buddha has balanced the mind. Once the mind is balanced, Reality is experienced. From the source of this eastern thought system, every\\"thing\\" is experienced as ONE. One Mind.Any attempt to \\"grasp\\" the Mind is an attempt to \\"cling\\" to the ego and is doomed to frustration.From the Lankavatara Sutra: For the Mind \\"is beyond all philosophical views, is apart from discrimination, it is not attainable, nor is it ever born: I say there is nothing but Mind. it is not existence and non-existence; it is indeed beyond existence and non-existence...Out of Mind spring innumerable things, conditioned by discrimination (i.e., classification) and habit energy; these things people accept as the external world.... What appears to be external does not exist in reality; it is Mind that is seen in multiplicity; the body, property and abode-all these, I say, are nothing but Mind.\\"While my goal in reading this book was to learn what is Zen. While this book contains no Zen or Buddha exercises, I did experience a glimpse of reality. While reading about the pure non-dualistic thought system of \\"The Tao\\", I was for a brief moment able to reach the state of non-dualistic reality and did not mediate to achieve it. It happened spontaneously. The best \\"I\\" can describe in words is that it was like looking out of a window for the first time.From the Zen Master Lien-teng Hui-yao, \\"Only when you have no thing in your mind and no mind in things are you vacant and spiritual, empty and marvelous.\\""},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I happen to read this book in the 70s. At the time I was reading Thomas Merton, and others talking a lot about 'contemplation' and the Catholic Mystical Tradition with a sprinkling of 'Eastern Mysticism'. So, I picked up this title, for various reasons, thinking it would be of helpful. I'd read most of Watts' books on Christianity (many of which included discussions of eastern philosophy). What a surprise! Turned out those Zen folks not only knew something about the tough questions relating to contemplation, they had such great experience at these matters and had come up with such unique ways of expressing it that it had become an art form for them. (The appreciation of this uniqueness has since worn off for reasons mentioned in some other reviews.) One reviewer also mentioned the legend of the 4th Patriarchs meeting with Fa-yung. When I first read that it was stunning! I've never forgot it and still refer to it to this day. It was here that I first met the Grand Masters of Chan, Bodhidharma, Huang Po and Zen had its madmen and poets, painters and potters, it was fascinating. Did I mention the historical perspective that forms the first part of the book? One last very important point. I had never encountered humor in my limited religious experience until I read about the Zen folks who, it seemed to me at the time, had the most hilarious answers to some of the most profound questions. I've never forgot that either. (Unfortunately, those answers don't strike people today as humorous, but seem more threatening to them. I wonder why that is...?) There may be some flaws in this book as some have suggested but I am willing to bet it will continue to be the best introduction to Zen for many years. Have fun!"},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I read this book (several times) more or less the year of it's publication.

It led me down a path of incredible simplicity and undefinable awe. It remains the single best western book about this topic."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Alan Watts' book, \\"The Way of Zen,\\" both in its subject matter and in its presentation is in my opinion uniquely wonderful.Most religions of the earth it seems to me, try to bring humankind to God. The words they use and the edicts they put forth to do this, by their very nature separate us from the \\"Ground of Being.\\" They seem to forget that neither the symbols they use, nor the practice they offer, are in fact, the actual process of the Universe itself. And thus religious teaching, as I have known it, separates us (instead of uniting us), from the \\"All\\" in the very act of trying to teach us what it is; and trying to bring us to it.Only Zen seems to recognise this. Zen focuses us on what exactly separates us from the \\"First Principle.\\" It has also been said that even many teachers of Zen, have lost their way.Watts' book is unique because it addresses the problems relating to this intersection between the awakened and the un-awakened human being, with an unusual completeness in its single small volume. Many, many books have been written about this issue, but none that I have ever read are so direct, so readable and so complete. Watts holds the magnifying glass over the problem for any student of \\"Sudden Illumination,\\" or what is also known as \\"Satori.\\" It is, I think, the great work to be read in this area; for the undoing of \\"Eastern Mystification.\\"If Watts' book is the magnifying glass, then for the very, very serious student of, \\"Awakening,\\" Hubert Benoit's book, \\"The Supreme Doctrine\\" (also available on this web site)is the final microscope. It is not for the faint of heart, being very difficult to study, but I have found that these two books together are priceless in what they bring to this area of \\"Final Awakening.\\"Paul Vereshack, B.A., M.D., D.Psych"},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I accidentaly found an old copy of this book. Before that I didn't have a slightest idea about zen, but after reading it I felt like I'd found a new, right way."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I first read this book almost 30 years ago. Coming from a martial arts background I knew what Zen was and all that but this book had such a wonderful descriptive history of Zen and described all its branches that even I learned much from it.I mostly just checked on its availability from Amazon to see if my old favorite was still available.I think Watts is even better than Suzuki at talking about Zen.. he is the best I have ever read.If anybody wants to learn about Zen and all its branches and history this book can't be beat."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Please don't be fooled by the enthusiastic reviews based on the book that... I understand that the publisher has a lot of information to present in condensing a book to an audio form, however the narration is so rapid fire and fast paced it is almost impossible to simply sit and enjoy the recording. Although academically excellent, the author's insights are lost as the narrator jumps from topic to topic, speaking as quickly as he can and bombarding the listener with concept after concept. (This seems so odd and out of place for a work on Zen). It is like trying to drink from a cup while someone is tipping the other end. It would seem fair that to get the most out of this tape, you would have to listen to it again and again, but I found this experience to be unbearable. Buy the book. Avoid the audio tape."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This Book is very nice. The shipping was fast and well packed. I would highly recomend this book as well as the seller to everyone."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I have found the best Alan Watts audio books are those where he is either recorded live or he narrates himself, which is where this title falls down.

Recently a friend of mine said I should read this book. I really enjoyed it my only complaint is that it was a little dty."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Watts was a genius with a voice of his own. Easy to read, and some real nuggets amongst what is not a very good depiction of zen. Read Dogen instead, since there are now translations widely available. Watts is lucid, but misses the mark as much as he hits it when it comes to Buddhism."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Everyone is so enthusiastic about this book; I hate to be the wet blanket. Alan Watts is hard not to like, writes attractively and gets full marks for pioneering Taoism, Vedanta and Zen in the West. As a light popular history of Buddhism I don't find much to quarrel with: I'm not aware of too many alternatives.Watts' own philosophy was expressed in \\"The Book (on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are.)\\" Pairs of contraries such as light/dark, form/space, self/other, being/non-being, are not enemies but complementaries necessary to each other. Live joyously, with the wisdom and serenity that come from understanding that everything passes, that we are masks the Universe puts on briefly. As a philosophy of life I rate this highly, but it isn't Zen.In fact Alan Watts was badly wrong about Zen and he created a durable and harmful misconception. He never practised intensively and was acidic about long periods spent \\"sitting on your (behind)\\". He saw the regimentation and hours of meditation in Japanese monasteries as the antithesis of carefree Zen, and he misconstrued Chinese Masters or quoted them out of context to prove his point. Back then, he was sure, the Master would just gently explain the contents of \\"The Book\\" to his disciple.This is all so far astray. Chinese Zen monks lived most un-carefree lives: long hours of meditation, long hours of labour, inadequate food and sleep. Zen is not about going with the flow and doin' what comes naturally, rather about uncovering our true Unconditioned nature hidden beneath layers of habit and conditioning. Prolonged meditation happens to be the best way of doing this. Intense effort must be combined with relaxed detachment.He drops a few clangers, like interpreting the saying that the Zen Master can \\"snatch away the hungry man's food, drive away the farmer's ox,\\" to mean that the Master is Above Good and Evil. But this is a technical term: it means to rob the student of comforting conceptions and rationalisations, to create a state of helpless bafflement in which true understanding can arise...Much to enjoy here, then, but also much that's misleading."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Zen is one of those things that defies description but which people want to describe anyway. Alan Watts is such a brilliant writer/teacher that he actually succeeds. In addition to an excellent discussion of the eastern theological traditions which gave rise to Zen Buddhism, he discusses Zen concepts in such a way that they make sense. But don't make sense, if you know what I mean.I am not a believer in reading about Zen, but this is one book that I recommend to anyone who is interested in Zen practice. Using prose that sets a new standard for elegance and simplicity, Watts will lead you down a lovely pathway, explaining just enough as you go along to help you appreciate what you are exploring. The book also makes a great reference, if you want to have just one title in your library about Zen."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"There are no words to express how important this book is. If you're a Westerner (as I am) this book will open up a new world, a new way of seeing for you. This is quite simply the most profound book I have read since I first read Jean Paul Sartre's \\"Existentialism and Human Emotions\\" when I was a teenager.

This book, on the other hand, is amazing. I bought it yesterday and my concecption of Zen, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucionism and Hinduism has already radically changed.Before yesterday, Zen to me seemed a bunch of people playing word games and sitting cross-legged avoiding the world. Buddhism seemed hypocritical metaphysics and ethics by special people who spent their lifetime (or many lifetimes) in the absurd pursuit of desiring not to desire.I'll reread this book a few more times and post another review ... but this is one of the best books I've ever read (...P>I've already begun, not to 'convert' to Zen Buddhism, but to incorporate it in my way of thinking.

Its the kind of book you read and think to yourself &quot;These are things I've know all along and just couldn't put into words.&quot; Every work of Alan Watts is a gem as far as I'm concerned, but every word in this book in particular gives the impression that here is a man who laughed a lot and who enjoyed every aspect of living. I can't recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This is not the easiest book to read, but it is full of information. This isn't a mystical book about an inward spiritual journey. Nor is it a philosophical book about understanding Zen mentally. It is something else entirely, whatever that is. This book, like the Zen it describes, cannot easily be categorized.I think the reason this book is so difficult to read is because Watts is so honest. He doesn't sugar coat eastern religion to make it palatable to westerners. Instead he forces you to change the way you think. A difficult read, but highly rewarding."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Buy this book! Its amazing. Watts historical preface to Buddhism aids in its practical understanding. He has a way of getting to the very nature of the Buddhist perspective. Althought not a book for instruction (\\"Buddhism: Plain & Simple\\" by Stevn Hagen is a good one) \\"Way of Zen\\" is a perfect introduction to Buddhism, its Hindu roots, and more specifically, Zen Buddhism, and its Chinese roots. BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I think the principal virtues of this text are simplicity, directness and clarity. Watts seems to have considerable intellectual understanding of Zen, and equally importantly, intuition about its inner content. He writes about Zen in a somewhat Zen-like way; not with a series of enigmas and paradoxes, but with a simple and direct narrative that covers the essential history and practice of Zen, illustrated with numerous relevant and potent quotes, and conveyed throughout with an intuitive immediacy that is refreshing and indeed uplifting. It's a good book."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This is definitely the best thing I have read on &quot;Eastern&quot; thought and philosophy.

I find that those timeswhen I am stressed out, depressed, anxious or upset will melt away into peacefulnessand tranquility if I pick up this book and read a few random chapters.It is like a deep great relaxing massage for the mind.

It taught me that one good way to understand something is to learn what it's not.

I made it about two thirds through, and then decided to wait until I read some other Buddhims books first, then come back to it."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Not only is this a great introduction into Zen (and larger philosophical problems), but also a competent critique of contemporary Zen Buddhism in Japan (of course by contemporary, I mean circa 1957). This work presents Zen as a specific historical hybrid of two similar cultural trajectories (Buddhism and Taoism). It is scholarly (including Chinese notes of the specific technical words/ideas and important passages and quotes) which allows Watts to be both an advocate for and a critic of this system of thought - at once shows the usefulness and also the contradictions inherent in Zen as a system or practice. It is never about finding a \\"new\\" system but about learning how to see one's own system as a construct that smooths over the randomness with the semblance of coherent consistency."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"There are several excellent (informative) reviews of The Way of Zen, and I won't try to duplicate them here. In my review I will briefly summarize the book, and say something about Watts' remarkable erudition.PART I: BACKGROUND AND HISTORYChapter 1: The Way of Tao. I am well-versed in philosophical Taoism so there is little new in this chapter for me, but the chapter is a fine introduction to the topic.Chapter 2: The Origins of Buddhism. This is my least favorite chapter, not because it is inferior in any way, but because the topic does not really interest me. At least not now. The chapter is notable in that it is here that Watts first mentions cybernetics (p. 48), with an example that illuminates both the Buddhist principle (avidya) and the cybernetic principle (illusion of control). There is more cybernetics to come.Chapter 3: Mahayana Buddhism. This is better, mainly because in this chapter Watts extends my understanding of Taoism (e.g., ziran) and Zen (e.g., tathata). Interesting.Chapter 4: The Rise and Development of Zen. All four of the history chapters are excellent, but this is the one that has the most to offer me, in terms of my interests and background. It is a very personal history, based on the stories of the Zen founders (e.g., Hui-neng), which I enjoyed greatly. It is also helpful to see how the various \\"flavors\\" of Zen developed, which seems to be a common characteristic of the great spiritual traditions.PART II: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICESChapter 1: \\"Empty and Marvelous\\" Here Watts takes up a basic principle of both Taoism and Zen: the power of empty space. Ames and Hall, translators of the Daodejing, address this basic principle by means of the \\"wu-forms\\" (wuwei, wushi, etc.) In Zen, this principle manifests itself as \\"suchness\\" - forget the words, just \\"point.\\" This chapter did much to enhance my understanding of this crucially important principle.Chapter 2: \\"Sitting Quietly, Doing Nothing\\" This is the chapter that quite literally \\"blew me away\\" In this chapter Watts demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of cybernetic principles, and interprets the practice of zazen in terms of these principles. Watts describes how the practice of \\"sitting quietly, doing nothing\\" helps dissolve the dualities of the Western mind (and, apparently, the Eastern mind as well!). Based on other books I have read by Alan Watts, I expected a sophisticated treatment of Zen (and I am not disappointed), but I was totally surprised to see an equally sophisticated treatment of cybernetic principles, and how they apply to Zen practice. In this regard, The Way of Zen anticipates Douglas Flemons' excellent book, Completing Distinctions, by almost forty years. In my copy of The Way of Zen, on the last page of this chapter, is written the note \\"An astonishing chapter.\\" Wow.Chapter 3: Za-zen and the Koan. Following Chapter 2, which is electric, this chapter is a bit of a let down. However, it is well written, as with the others, and I did appreciate a better understanding of these two Zen practices, and the role they play in Zen teaching.Chapter 4: Zen in the Arts. Another great chapter. As a consequence of reading this chapter, I now understand the purpose and practice of Zen poetry. And as a consequence of this new understanding, I am writing my own Haikus ... almost one every day. Sweet!The Way of Zen is a must read, although I am sure, like any great book, every reader will meet the book in a different place, in a different way. After reading Watts' Way of Zen, I recommend reading Philip Kapleau's Three Pillars of Zen: Teaching, Practice, and Enlightenment. It corrects some minor errors in Watts' book, and is a sensible next step in one's exploration of Zen."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This is good stuff. I like this man's style. A little history then a little doctrine. If you have no exposure to Zen then I highly recommend this. This is not something that is meant to be read through all novel like. Take every page and read is several times. This is more of a textbook to me. It seems small when you pick it up but what's inside could fill an endless number of books. There is so much insane wisdom in here. This is good, but what is good? Once you say something is good that makes something else bad. All I'm saying is that this will give you a lot to ponder about. Read and feel your mind expand."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Along with Suzuki's work, this book was virtually required reading for a whole generation. It is inimitable Alan Watts material. The good thing about Alan was his ability to debunk the posturing which often passes for spirituality. He made the important point that trying to justify oneself - through Zen, is un-zenlike and therefore, technically stupid.However, when it comes to practical details, this text is a trifle misleading. Somewhere in its pages, Alan categorically stated that T'ang dynasty Zen monks did not practice Za-zen, as found in Zen temples today - declaring it to be an adjunct of the Sung Confucian education system, incorporated into Japanese temple life. Though the resources at Watts' disposal were somewhat limited - when this text was first written, at least two extant translations (e.g.@Huang Po's 'Discourses' and Hui Hai's 'Treatise on Sudden Awakening') made it clear that - for Zen monks of the Tang dynasty, Za-zen was a regular part of their spiritual life. What we do find stated, in such sources, is a reminder not to take still immobility as the right state or end of the practice. Whether training in the Rinzai or the Soto tradition, few Westerners practicing Zen today will doubt that Za-zen is an essential part of the practice. If you want a readable, general introduction to Far-eastern thought - this is a good place to begin. It is best, perhaps, for its discussion of Zen in the context of Far-eastern art. In other respects, observations like those touched on above, will now make this work seem redundant."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Over a period of time, we have mistaken the map for the territory as depicted in the sciences(Aristotle, Newton, Euclid did a great disservice to the human intellect through their mechanistic/ geometric interpretation of God and reality), in Psychology(skinner and his behaviourist crowd would have us believe that we live like rats, or rather, like they think rats live), anthropology(which sees us as a linear improvement from amoeba to ape to man), nuclear sciences(sending guys to moon after blowing millions of dollars for some dirty slag/ nuclear weapons that could blow the world off) and in almost all other pursuits.Some of this is also due to our warped interpretation of religion. Fundamentally, it has been a mass-based, irrelevant pursuit where the believers are the cherished and get to sack in heaven with angels and the damned will be burnt in hell. I mean, even religion is based on what happens to one's senses which has proven time and again to be misleading. All great wars have been fought over religion and the heap of dead from time-immemorial has had generous contributions from the business of religious warfare. And all this is supposedly presided over by a monarch(read God) who sits in the heavens and is neatly using a double accounting system to be sure of his assets(believers) and liabilities(the pagans).It is in this background that an experience like Zen is extremely critical so that we just get up, see that the emperor is not wearing any clothes and get on with our lives. Watts is simply the best as far as Zen is concerned.Zen or Dhyana Budhhism is against the use of words/ symbols to describe enlightenment but believes in going for the state of pure bliss itself. This point has been brought about in this brilliant book by Alan Watts. The gist of the message is One doesn't and cannot have a map(read words and other symbols here)to know oneself. Just imagine feeling ourselves not as human beings but as skull+nerves+tendons+bones+muscles+ ego. It is impossible to get any kind of coherent picture. The same analogy applies to reaching god through prayers(more words), sacrifices(symbols), idols, magic(more symbols)etc. Definitely,reading this book is one of the most important experiences in my life."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"My Korean Zen mentor had me read this book, saying Alan Watts has the best understanding of Zen by a Westerner.

I read it years ago and let my copy slip away. But Amazon had a ready replacement fortunately. Read it and discover what real enlightenment is."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Alan Watts wrote this book at the peak of his intellectual and spiritual powers. It reflects a wonderful mastery of the subject and a maturity of thought. I was expecting an excellent overview of Zen history, philosophy, and practice. This book is that and much more. Watts takes us back to the roots of Zen through Taoism and Hinduism and brings us up through a tour of Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism on the way to Zen. He also provides the best description of the concept of Maya that I've ever read. The book is mostly scholarly in tone, but there are sporadic flashes of his mystical wit and insights. To me, this is definitely one of his masterworks."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"The author traces the development of Zen through the first four chapters. The reader can thereby gain a perspective about how the practice of Zen is so much influenced by Taoism; how the underlying philosophy can be traced back to the Upanishads; how Mahayana Buddhism derived from the original Buddhism and how it was assimilated in the Far East by the Chinese and Japanese.My overall impression is that Zen differs from other forms of Buddhism mainly in regard to its practice, and also in its emphatic discouragement of metaphysical speculation. Given the human situation - as described by the mythology of the Upanishads - of being alienated in a state of ignorance and impermanence, how does one proceed? As is evident from the spirit of Zen, one cannot proceed by ignoring the journey and strictly focusing on a goal of liberation. That only results in grasping, in egocentric actions that result in further delusion. Likewise, extensive metaphysical speculation only results in being uselessly caught up in the net of duality in space and time. Rather than such self-consious and goal-setting ego pursuits, Zen has promoted ancient Chinese teachings derived from Taoism, which is a way of liberation based on observations of Nature. It has to do with going with the flow, or a letting go of the mind, with an attentive non-grasping view of the world. It has practical implications for all those activities of regular life and is not solely confined to meditation. Intuition is involved here, divination rather than calculation, which brings the subject closer to the object.An interesting approach to this idea of \\"letting go\\" is found in the chapter \\"Sitting Quietly, Doing Nothing\\" concerning the human ability of self-reflection. The author uses the analogy of a machine having a feedback system, in which the machine as an example can be regulated for temperature. To arrive at a steady state, a series of adjustments need to be made. But in the efficient use of the machine, there is always a limit to the amount of adjustments before complexity causes a \\"jittery state\\". Likewise, in human actions excessive self-reflection can result in a kind of paralysis - a going back and forth and not knowing how to proceed - as in the case of human anxiety. To escape anxiety, there has to be a point of letting go. The essential idea is not to eliminate reflection but not to get blocked, not to reflect about reflecting, which means freeing oneself of the excessive demands of the ego, the \\"identification of the mind with its own image of itself\\". But how does one do that? How does one become unblocked? A realization of a paradox appears to be the key here. \\"The simplest cure is to feel free to block, so that one does not block at blocking.\\""},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"It's hard to recommend a specific Watts intro. Indeed, some may find this text extremely tough reading. All I can say is, \\"have a dabble\\", reading Watts is a life changing experience. Also recommend Audiobooks (from iTunes) containing his early lectures.Further book, film and music reviews, plus general shenanigans can be found at: www.mindcrash.co.uk and http://blog.myspace.com/mindcrash"},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Receiving my first copy of The Way of Zen in 1959 set me on the path of exploring both the literature and the practices of Eastern traditions for the next 47 years. My original copy became so well-worn that I recently had to relegate it to archive status and purchase a new working copy. All these years later, this title still remains for me the classic work for Western understanding of Buddhism.I am amazed at the proliferation of books on the subject to be currently found on Amazon.com. Separating the wheat from the chaff can be a daunting challenge. Many interpretations of the Dharma, especially by Western authors, often seem to be tainted by naive New Age idealism on the one hand, or dry pedantry on the other. Although Watts was academically disciplined, reading the text with appropriate reflection can be simultaneously an intellectual and experiential endeavor (although not in the \\"how-to\\" sense). Watts wisely points out, with ample historical support from past Zen masters, that while so-called techniques for enlightenment may serve as transitional supports along the path, they ultimately lead to dead ends.The Way of Zen, despite some rather petty criticisms by pedants and literalists over the years, has survived as one of the most lucid expositions of Zen specifically and Buddhism in general. Highly recommended...still."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"This can be seen as a significant book in the transmission of the dharma to the Western world, even though, or perhaps especially because, it is written by a Westerner. Consistently admired since its first publication in 1957, and reprinted many times, The Way of Zen is that rarest of books, a popular and academic success. You will not read far before seeing why. Watts's style is reasoned and reasonable, clear and authoritative, but without a hint of affectation. Watts knows what he is talking about and to whom he is speaking. Because of his perspective between two worlds, he is, more than almost any other writer on Zen, able to match the ideas of the East to the mind of the West, and in doing so make the broader outlines of Zen as clear as the polished, dustless mirror.The book is divided into two parts, \\"Background and History\\" and Principles and Practice,\\" each with four chapters. There is a bibliography also divided into two parts, the first referring to original sources and second to general works on Zen in European languages. There are 16 pages of Chinese Notes in calligraphy keyed to the text, and an Index.\\"The Way\\" in the title refers to the \\"watercourse way\\" from Taoism, a philosophy to which Zen owes much, as Watts makes clear in the first two chapters, \\"The Philosophy of the Tao\\" and \\"The Origins of Buddhism.\\" The first chapter is one of the best on Taoism that I have ever read, replete with insight and wisdom. Throughout, Watts expresses himself in an infectious style, even in the very scholarly chapters on the history of Buddhism where he traces Zen from its origin in India, through the Buddha under the Po tree, to Ch'an in China, and finally into Japan. Parallels between the unforced, natural way of Taoism and the spontaneity of Zen Buddhism are explored in a most convincing and engaging manner. Along the way we learn a little about Hinduism and Confucianism.The chapters on the principles and practices of Zen, comprising a goodly portion of the book are nothing short of marvelous, full of wit and sly observations, revealing Watts's thorough knowledge of Zen and his deep appreciation. Here are some examples of Watts at work:Referring obliquely to the rise of communism (a word he never uses in the book) he writes, \\"When the throne of the Absolute is left vacant, the relative usurps it...\\" (p. 11) Perhaps Watts is also indicating why he believes that humanism is not a complete answer.On the cosmology of the Tao: \\"...the natural universe works mainly according to the principles of growth...If the universe were made, there would of course be someone who knows &lt;how&gt; it is made...\\" He adds, \\"...the Tao does not &lt;know&gt; how it produces the universe...\\" (pp. 16-17)\\"Since opposed principles, or ideologies, are irreconcilable, wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation. But wars fought for simple greed will be far less destructive, because the aggressor will be careful not to destroy what he is fighting to capture.\\" (pp. 29-30)\\"Hindu philosophy has not made the mistake of imagining that one can make an informative, factual, and positive statement about the ultimate reality.\\" (p, 34)\\"Buddhism has frequently compared the course of time to the apparent motion of a wave, wherein the actual water only moves up and down, creating the illusion of a &lt;piece&gt; of water moving over the surface. It is a similar illusion that there is a constant &lt;self&gt; moving through successive experiences, constituting a link between them in such a way that the youth becomes the man who becomes the graybeard who becomes the corpse.\\" (p. 123)In his exploration of koans used by the Rinzai School of Zen, it becomes clear that one of the purposes of the koan is to put doubt into the mind of the young aspirant that he knows anything at all. From that redoubtable position, real learning can begin. I was reminded of a saying attributed to baseball's Earl Weaver, the very successful manager of the Baltimore Orioles in their glory years: \\"It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.\\"Here is a story from the Ch'uan Teng Lu, told by Watts about \\"a fascinating encounter between Tao-hsin and the sage Fa-yung, who lived in a lonely temple on Mount Niu-t'ou, and was so holy that the birds used to bring him offerings of flowers. As the two men were talking, a wild animal roared close by, and Tao-hsin jumped. Fa-yung commented, &lt;I see it is still with you!&gt;--referring, of course, to the instinctive &lt;passion&gt; (klesa) of fright. Shortly afterwards, while he was for a moment unobserved, Tao-hsin wrote the Chinese character for &lt;Buddha&gt; on the rock where Fa-yung was accustomed to sit. When Fa-yung returned to sit down again, he saw the sacred name and hesitated to sit. &lt;I see,&gt; said Tao-hsin, &lt;it is still with you!&gt; At this remark Fa-yung was fully awakened...and the birds never brought any more flowers.\\" (pp. 89-90).While this is an excellent introduction to Zen--and more--for the educated person, it is especially a delight for those of you who have already read a few books on Zen. There is no other book that I know of that goes as deeply into Zen as agreeably as does The Way of Zen."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Generally speaking, Watts doesn't appeal to new-age crystal fairies, channelers, and so forth, and if you prefer your Zen texts all poetical and mysterious, then this book isn't for you; but if you want a treatment of Zen as an important, credible and viable philosophical tradition, then you'll like this book. It's not an easy read, but this is good, solid, hardheaded Watts."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Scan the &quot;Eastern Philosophy&quot; racks at your local bookstoreand you'll see the problem--books with titles like &quot;The Taoof Love and Relationships&quot; or &quot;The Zen of CareerAdvancement.&quot; Much of the literature on eastern philosophywritten by westerners is distorted as it is re-focusedthrough the prism (&quot;prison,&quot; some would argue) of westernthought and language.Alan Watts appreciates and addresses these difficulties inThe Way of Zen, an excellent introduction to the ZenBuddhism. Watts explores Zen's historical background,tracing it from Buddhism's migration from India to China,where it absorbed elements of Confucian and Taoist thought,to its final development in Japan. The second half of thebook describes Zen's underlying principles and itspractices, such as the absence of &quot;self&quot; and the futilityof purpose.Rich in scholarly detail, yet accessible to the lay reader,The Way of Zen, is remarkable in its lucidity. Watts usesanalogies and allusions culled from daily life toillustrate Zen principles and does much to clear up westernmisconceptions about Zen thought. He also warns of thedifficulties many westerners face trying to understand Zen.With the English language's clear separation between theobserver and the observed, the action and the actor and itsrigid division of time into past, present and future, Zenthought often strikes westerners as mystical or moronic.While Watts may champion Zen, he never stoops to merecheer-leading. Instead he has produced a highly readablebook that explains and de-mystifies Zen."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"Watts is a scholar, first and foremost, and a brilliant writer. In this book, you'll learn where Zen came from. It has its origins in India, where Buddhism was created, and then became as fresh as a gust of wind on its way through China and Chinese Taoism. Zen reached its full fruition after it arrived in Japan.The book is separated into two sections. The first tells the history of Zen. The second describes the practice of Zen. But all the while, Watts opens your mind and you get the real FEEL of Zen. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I can tell you that Watts' way of writing works: It will change the way you look at the world. This book is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"I usually prefer to download lectures by Alan watts rather than read his books, some ofwhich seemed to just ramble along. I am not really good at critiques, but I really enjoyedthis book. Easy to read. Some concepts are so foreign to my common sense way ofthinking that it sort of turns my thinking inside-out. The idea makes sense. I cannot findfault with it. But regrettably, my mind snaps back to its usual way of thinking.For example: We tend to think of our self as an independent being inside of a separateworld. But actually there exists no separate being or outside world. The two are oppositeends of a spectrum and reality exists only between the two ends. Sort of seems to be themain point. That who you think you are is a mental construction, sort of a caricature ofitself. your true self is the entire world. One of my favorite sayings is \\"everywhere is thecenter.\\" Everywhere is everything. you are everything. I am everything and so is mycomputer. Our minds create symbols to stand for parts of the world and then we start tothink that the world is made of parts. It seems that liberation comes from dying to yoursense of self. from ceasing trying to grasp at life as though it were something \\"other\\" thatcould be grasped.I can remember some magical times in my life when instead of me acting in the world, Ilet the world take me by the hand and everything just clicked. I find these thingsfascinating, but for some reason impossible to share.There are some Zen stories which I can't seem to make any sense of, and I dunno, maybethe point is to watch your mind try to make sense of it. I really am running off at themouth now. Oh well. Have you ever been in pain and then stopped to think, am I reallyfeeling constant pain IN THIS MOMENT? And no, you weren't in this particularmoment. It was an idea that you were carrying along perhaps from one moment of pain toanother. in Zen liberation also means liberation from the idea that there exists someconstant unchanging self that some how is carried from one moment to the next to affector be affected by the world. There really is no cause and effect. One just follows the otherlike spring following winter. And the burning log does not BECOME the ashes, becauselike the previous example there is no \\"stuff\\" which was the wood and then is the ashes.First there is wood and then there are ashes.I guess zen is a method to get you to stop dreaming and wake up."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"From the get go, the book was amazing. The first two chapters that talked a lot about differences in Western vs. Eastern thought and language structures were big eye openers. There were a number of profound moments reading the book, such as when he noted contemplating what happens to us after death is like wondering what happens to your fist when you open you hand or what happens to your lap when you stand up. The writing style of the book is highly approachable, I myself a graduate engineering student found it very readible, Watts doesn't try to blow the reader away with his academic prowess but rather keeps it simple and direct, like zen itself."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"It is unfortunate in my view that the word Zen gets attached to the most frivolous things. You see books with titles such as &quot;The Zen of Motorcycle Repair&quot; or &quot;The Zen of Making Big Fat Wads of Cash&quot;. As Lao Tzu says, &quot;Those who speak do not know; those who know do not speak&quot;. With that in mind, it's clear that the modern fad of Zen-everything is not really the way of Zen. Which raises the question - what is the way of Zen? Alan Watts recognises the difficulty in explaining the concept of Zen to the West, and freely admits he's not the world's foremost expert on the subject. However humble he may have been, Watts certainly seems to know what he's talking about. &quot;The Way of Zen&quot; traces the origins of this non-religion/philosophy/ideology from ancient China and India, to its uptake in the rest of Asia (notably Japan). There's even a few chapters on Zen in the Arts, discussing the idea of haiku and how it aspires to be Zen-in-motion. Watts is lucid in his approach, and always takes the time to explain even the most perplexing concepts. Overall if you want to get one step closer to understanding the inscrutable Zen, let Watts enlighten you (pun intended)."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"So, what is a southern Christian man doing with a book about a Buddhist belief system? Well, I needed some perspective. The Christian teaching that is most familiar to me is that which says, \\"Do your best. Work hard. Don't quit trying.\\" Only, I took this to the extreme. With new ideas coming into my head at a rapid pace I struggled to write them down and struggled even more to put them into action. I know I should be developing my ideas to be published, drawing the picture I have in my head, or even becoming a more proficient cyclist, but when I don't have the time, I get frustrated. The result? A car spinning its tires. \\"Why haven't I written that yet? Why haven't I learned to paint? Why haven't I competed in a bike race?!\\" All of these things are goals that I wanted to complete last week not next year. I knew Zen was a way I could learn to be more passive in my thought processes so I read it.Zen does not look at life as something to be built like a house or attained like a graduate degree, but rather it looks at life as a flower that grows from a tiny seed. This was what I needed to hear. Instead of running and pursuing things now, I let them happen through my daily practices of writing, sketching, and cycling. Growth, inspiration, and achievement happen over time. I also wanted to read this book with my Christian glasses on. I am now interested in Biblical teachings on growth as it relates to the teachings of Zen."},{"Title":"The Way of Zen","review":"The prolific Alan Watts explains the origin, growth, development, and philosophy of Buddhism in a readable and interesting way. He explains and describes how the scripts of the Pali Cannon are put into practice and the rational behind it, and other concepts, such at the eight paths i.e.,One of the major authorities on the subject, he can write for the curious layman, student, and academic at once. Watts has an extensive background in the different forms of Buddhism and this is for anyone with an interest in the philosophy of Hinduism, Taoism, Mahayana, Therevada &amp; Zen Buddhism and other branches.

He covers the standard subjects (the influence of groups in Congress, the bureaucracy, origins and maintenance of groups, etc.). In addition, however, he discusses the impact of organized interests in state and local government. Surely this is an important area of american politics that is too often ignored by scholars of interest groups. His focus on organized interests instead of interest groups is also worth considering.His writing is always clear and often witty. He has made a number of difficult subjects easy. His discussion of the &quot;seamjob&quot; on page 115 is a great example. Until reading this book, I thought a &quot;seamjob&quot; was the same as &quot;demosclorosis.&quot; Now I know differently.If you're looking for a clear, informative and often entertaining book about organized interests in american politics, this is it."},{"Title":"Pressure and Power: Organized Interests in American Politics","review":"from the back &quot;the first title in the New Diretions in Political Behavior series, provides readers with a comprehensive understanding of interest group politics in the United States.

His classes were always fun, but I left knowing a lot more than I went in with. His book, &quot;Pressure and Power&quot; is an excellent source for info on organized interests. Nownes has written extensive amounts on this subject in the past, and continues to be an expert in the field."},{"Title":"Bride of the Dragon","review":"I read Romance novels to be swept away by the passion- made tense by intrigue- be angered by betrayal- and in the end- to be buoyed by the hope of a love that conquers all. Shameless pandering? Yes, in part. But the promise of a good romance is a few hours lifted from reality and mystified by the poetry and allure of an all-consuming love. Bride of the Dragon fulfills that promise with vitality.This novel has it all- the dark wooded hills of Pagan Wales, , the pomp, circumstance, and intrigue of Court, the tension and excitement of a tourney, and the triumph of a love that knows no limits. The heroine, Lady Isobel places her trust in Lionel, a step brother who lives for greed and ambition. He looses a tournament and cannot pay the price he wagered. As a result she is given as a prize to the Dragon, the fierce and formidable competitor who bested her brother on the tourney field. Despite her belief that she has been betrothed to a savage barbarian, she soon finds the Dragon, now known more intimately as Morgan of Nels, to be considerate, caring, and extremely handsome. What develops between them is powerful- an intense love, a deep respect, and a searing passion that few novels can match. Through intrigue, deception, and war they must learn to build a trust in one another that transcends the boundaries of country- a trust as strong as the love they share.Their story throws them into a conspiracy that involves the anger of a king, the betrayal of family, the dark days of plague, and the horror of battle. A story so masterfully woven should only be further unraveled for you by the author. Buy it, settle down with a pillow and a cup of hot chocolate- and let yourself be captivated by the Bride of the Dragon..."},{"Title":"Bride of the Dragon","review":"Bride of the Dragon is one of the least enjoyable historical romance novels I've ever read. (And I read a lot in the genre.) This book spans over a year of time, with the couple spending many months apart. When they are together, however, the romance between them rings false.For instance, the hero declares himself to have fallen deeply in love at first sight, but manages to find time to fondle and kiss a serving woman when he thinks his betrothed isn't around. He manages to talk his lady love into bed, convincing her that his fooling around meant nothing. &quot;Listen to me, Isobel. Lawri means nothing to me. No woman means anything to me --except you. Don't you think I wished it was you I kissed...and touched?&quot;. Surely, no woman would fall for this standard line of cheating men everywhere! (Lady Isobel does.)The book jacket summary of a woman won as part of a tournament prize is resolved early in the book, leaving the happy couple to fight the plague and the military threat of neighboring pagans. This ugly environment of death and despair is periodically broken into for romantic liasons, which seem unreal and inappropriate considering the terror the two are facing.The dialogue throughout is stilted and unnatural.For example, when the hero awakens from a months-long illness to find his wife looking rather ragged and dirty she exclaims, &quot;Though I realize my clothing's shabby, I'm the same inside. Out of love for you, sweetheart, I sank to this depth. You know I couldn't leave you. We belong together.&quot; He cries at her sacrifice. &quot;Thank you, darling&quot;.Historical details are often erroneous. The plot has giant holes and convenient lapses in logic, which save the couple time and again from a cast of just-plain-dumb villains. The hero proves that he is incapable of protecting anyone, leaving every fight he engages in near death and staggering around in a wash of blood. Neither he, his wife, nor the supporting cast have any human characteristics. They are broad-stroke caricatures with the sort of cheesy lines and cliched actions found in the lowest quality of soap operas.Save yourself the aggravation and avoid this book. If you are looking for a talented historical romance writer, I suggest Kathleen Woodiwiss, instead."},{"Title":"Bride of the Dragon","review":"I have read a few \\"Patricia Phillips\\" and have generally liked what I read, but, unfortunately I'm never really enthusiastic in a \\"wow, this is good!\\" way about her books. I have to agree with the reviewer who said this one was flat and uninteresting. It was the kind of book where, while you're reading it, you think about ways it could have been better. Personally, I thought the hero and heroine got together too quickly and without enough character development, & the plot did smack of a 'formula'."},{"Title":"Bride of the Dragon","review":"I tried, really tried, to like this book, but no matter how many badly written, cheesy parts I skipped, there was always another on the next page. It is clear as day that the author makes Isobel dislike Morgan in the beginning to supply the generic Romance-Novel Conflict, making the conflict, and the plot in general, uninteresting and unbelievable. These characters never feel real, they lay flat on the page, and the reader never really cares whether they get together in the end."},{"Title":"Bride of the Dragon","review":"This is a very well written story with a touching tale of love and kinship.

There is someone within their midst that cannot be trusted..a terrible evil spreads and wipes out whole villages. Lady Isolbel and Morgan of Nels (AKA Dragon Knight) are hot, hot, HOT! The descriptions of the land and the castles of the time are unbelievable.

This is my first Patricia Phillipis book and I'm searching for more!"},{"Title":"The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (MPB-32) (Monographs in Population Biology)","review":"A couple of years ago, Dr. Jim Brown (Univ. New Mexico) wrote an article in the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) website indicating that he had not seen any really significant new ideas in ecology during the last few year. Well, we have one.In the hierarchy of biological systems, ecology deals with the highest and most complex levels. Explanation for patterns of abundance and distribution of organisms have been either too specific that only applies to a few species or even one, or too general that can not be tested (remember the ghost of competition's past).Ecologists working at the community level have mostly been guided by the general principle that interactions tend to determine the diversity of communities. On the larger scale of biogeography, researchers considered that local diversity tends to be a function of a regional species pool. This debate became very contested in the early 1980's and continued for almost a decade, without any meaningful progress. Nonetheless, significant achivements in both areas of inquiry were made.Hubbell takes advantage of the increased large-scale reasearch in community ecology (like the Smithsonian-MAB biodiversity network of plots) coupled with the ever more manipulative and reductionist approach to biogeography. Is important to add here Hubbell's own contribution to biodiversity research is substantial. Furthermore, the originality of the work is what sets this monograph appart from the last few in the series. The application of random walk models (i.e., ecological drift) to the organization of communities is not a truly new approach. What make is unique is that then he incorporates immigration and extinction rates across space (classical MacArthur-Wilson), and can then predict a range of abundances and distributions. He supplies ample data from tropical systems that agree with model's predictions. The more interesting aspect is when the data doesn't agree. Here there is plenty of productive work to be performed.One point that Hubbell makes concerning the &quot;triviality&quot; of the nuetrality assumption. Can there be cases when the differential survival of individuals lead to deviations from the theory's prediction? I think that the assumption of neutrality is not as trivial as Hubbell makes it.Overall, is probably one of the most intriguing and original works of the last decade. If you are interested in ecology, biogeography, and even conservation, this book will challenge what you know and how should we look at patterns and process of biodiversity."},{"Title":"The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (MPB-32) (Monographs in Population Biology)","review":"Hubbell's work is interesting and thought-provoking. Unfortunately, his writing ability leaves a lot to be desired. As an applied mathematician working with biologists personally I think you should:1. Specify your (mathematical) model *without* examples or justifications first.Hubbell mixes his models with examples and rambling justifications. Poorly constructed ones if you ask me. This makes it hard to pull out what exactly the model is sometimes.2. Make derivations clear and concise and if complicated put them in appendices. Hubbell does none of these. His mathematical reasoning and writing is far below the standard in science and although impressive for an ecologist, substandard for anyone else. He would have strongly benefitted from having a trained mathematician co-write or at least edit his mathy sections. Many of the results are either well known or would be explained differently by someone trained in the explication of mathematics. The importance of this is huge since the result is sometimes his statements are totally unclear. For example, on page 124 he says \\"as the sample size increase towards infinity...\\" This is a sample from a finite sized population. So he should be clear and say either sample with replacement, or also taking the population size to infinity, (which is it!) otherwise it doesn't make sense.I also find his egoism (common in my experience with ecologists) disappointing. While he may have come up with a new theory of biodiversity, he did not come up with many of the underlying models. Unfortunately, he barely pays any respect to the countless other people who paved the way for his results. For example, his species abundance distribution is just the Ewen's sampling formula from population genetics, derived in 1972. In fact, the model side of the entire theory comes straight out of population genetics. Yes it explains something different, but it would be nice to see something at least some acknowledgement of that (something he is clearly aware of since he cites many of the popgen papers).Also, the reference list is incomplete and the index is one of the worst I have come across recently. Paying for a good indexer is always worth the money.In short, the ideas in this book are important, but the book itself is cluttered and not as clear as it could be. So I average 5 stars and 1 star and get 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (MPB-32) (Monographs in Population Biology)","review":"The author presents a thorough case for his neutral theory of biogeography. He gives a full historical account of its development, and presents plenty of results from publications and simulations, essentially expounding point for point the search for more precise answers to the questions, why are there so many species, and why are they distributed they way they are? Full of interesting insights, and many points are applicable to other sciences as well - economics come to mind. One thing that might have been useful is a more explicit discussion of other neutral theories, say the theories of genetic drift, which predate Hubbell's equal named \\"ecological drift\\". But within its stated scope the book is very complete and highly readable as well. Maybe I should mention that I am writing as a scientist - it is not a typical pop science book to read on the train. It truly is a science book. It does not demand much prior knowledge but it does demand attention."},{"Title":"Design of Steel Structures","review":"I found this text to be very useful to me and prefer it among other steel texts.

It was Bob Marley's passion and his way of making a living. He usually never stayed in a single relationship for a long time except on a few occasions. He loved his children and often said that his money was actually theirs. He grew up in Kingston, Jamaica where his mother abandoned him. Bob was used to seeing the gangsters, pimps, etc. because he sort of lived in a place that has lots of them. He started a band and they called themselves the \\"Wailers\\". In his songs he would talk about problems going on in Jamaica. After a while Bob adopted the Rasta religion which wasn't very popular at the time. Later it would also be adopted by higher classman. That is the reason the reason why Bob has dreadlocks because it is part of his religion. Police would often make people cut off their dreadlocks because of the influence they had on politics. Bob would also use drugs openly because that was also part of his religion. He would use them during live concerts to. Rita, who was Bob's actual wife, often would steal money from Bob and sign checks with his signature. Bob only married Rita because they had children together and she needed someone to support her. The woman Bob really loved was Cindy Breakspeare. Bob also had a child with Cindy. Then Bob's manager Don Taylor discovered that Bob had cancer and needed treatment. Bob went on the proper diet for the treatment for a while. After he got into an argument with Don Taylor he stopped the treatment and eventually the cancer spread to his brain and killed him. I recommend this book to people who like Bob Marley's music and want to find out more about him. This is an excellent book with many interesting things.I liked the book because it told me facts that I never knew about Bob Marley. I didn't know about him being really good at soccer. In fact he could have played professionally! Instead he decided to play music even though he also had a passion for soccer. I didn't know his wife was dishonest and Bob didn't really like her. Bob even said, \\"Rita can sign mi name betta dan me!\\" That is why she signed checks in his name and stole his money in everyway you can think of. Bob and Don were shot by gangsters because Bob was trying to unite Jamaica with a free concert for two rival gangs. Bob was nicked in the chest while Don was basically blocking most of the bullets from hitting Bob. Bob also usually had several girls around him all the time. They would usually just follow him around until he made them go away. Bob didn't really mind but Cindy and Rita did.Bob was a compassionate person even though his nickname was \\"Tuff Gong\\". He cared mainly for his family especially his children. He would buy them whatever they needed whenever they needed it. He would use little money for himself. He refused to travel by limo because it would make people look bad. He just wanted to live a life where he didn't look rich. He even bought a house for his mother, Rita, and Cindy. He would pay his band extra money even when they didn't ask for it. He would give money to the poor also. He tried to basically make all Jamaicans live a better life at the expense of him living with all of the expenses.Bob often showed the energy he had in him by demonstrating through his songs and everyday life. During one of his concerts the crowd went wild and Bob put the microphone down and started jumping up and down and danced. Just because of that he decided to do another song for the same crowd. He occasionally started getting angry at Rita and sometimes beat her for stealing his money. He was in such a bad mood he even pointed a gun at Don Taylor, his friend and manager. He also showed his energy on the soccer field. He was athletic and definitely could have played professionally. Bob would often go out on the soccer field in the early morning before rehearsal to have a few hours by himself to play soccer.Bob was a compassionate and interesting person. My recommendation would go to people who love Bob Marley and his music. People who would also want to learn more about him should buy this book. Bob loved music, his children, and soccer. He loved his family and tragically died of cancer in 1981. Bob was a great player and singer and helped change the world and peoples' minds everywhere about music. He was loved by many and still is. He helped unite Jamaica and made life better for everybody else.By: D.

Anyone who spent 6 years trying to stave off the leeches and hangers-on surrounding Marley's camp would have to be seriously ... or a fool to ever mess with coke.ANYWAY, on a more superficial level, the book is filled with really interesting tidbits of gossip, especially relating to Rita Marley and all the other women in the lion's life."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"Great Read, explains a lot of what went on inside his rise and death.

Some people have complained that this book is too much about Taylor himself but the title after all is \\"Marley and ME\\" not just \\"Marley\\" and that first chapter of his own harrowing growing-up years on the Kingston waterfront is riveting."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"very eye Opening Book about the Genius Bob Marley.this book puts everything into Perspective about his Life&amp;music.this book has alot of Emotion&amp;depth to it.you can't put it down.just like the Man's music it hits you straight up."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"Don Taylor, the author of Marley and Me, is one of the most influential managers in the history of the music industry. Living in Jamaica in his youth, he learned his street smarts by hustling in the villages around his home. Spontaneously, he started working for the entertainment industry, helping musicians get around Jamaica and getting them whatever they pleased. Word got around that Taylor was a good manager and sooner than later, Marley and Taylor started working together, booking shows all around Jamaica while developing a strong fan base. Eventually, Bob's music was being heard all around the world, partly due to Taylor's work in and out of the United States. As things started to slow down for Bob near the end of his career, Don and Bob began to part their seperate ways on bitter paths. Bob's death to cancer ultimatly ended their relationship, yet before he died, Taylor tried to clear things up with Bob, but it was too late. Bob had passed away.I throughly enjoyed this book. Having a view point of Bob Marley's life through the eyes of someone very close was an interesting way to understand the man and his music. This book was the best Bob Marley biography I have ever read. It clarified every aspect of his life and opened up many new doors that had been closed due to other sources that failed to offer as much information as this book had done. If your looking for a great book to unvail the life of Bob Marley, go to your local library and pick this book up."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"It was written by my dearly departed friend Don Taylor. I enjoyed the read. It was stories of his life and work in the music industry."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"The late Taylor's role in the Marley saga has always been suspect, whether pushing Bob's widow into signing a false will--and getting a kickback from the opposition for his efforts--(as disclosed in the Cayman Music court case) to reportedly embezzling Marley's tour money. A hateful book by someone undeserving of trust."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"I produced &quot;BOB MARLEY AND THE WAILERS LIVE! AT THE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY BOWL&quot; and met Don Taylor, the principal manager in Marley's career. Unlike other biographers, Taylor saw Marley as a man, not as an icon, and so his portrait of Marley is the most realistic. Devious, cunning, brilliant,destructive, Taylor rode the Marly wave on the way up from the Kingston days, took the bullits for Bob in the famous murder attempt in '77, and ultimately fell out with the legend over accusations of embezzlement. Taylor really knew Marley, and his biography of the genius has a bitter edge that makes for great and insightful reading."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"Marley's first mistake was to put his faith in Taylor. A classic tale of a manager's betrayal. The author's come off as a monster, even though he tries to build himself into someone more important even than Bob. Sadder than sad. Marley wrote a song about this guy called &quot;Bad Card.&quot;"},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"Don Taylor was Bob Marley's manager, yes. But he also stole alot of money from Bob - he lied about concert earnings to put more money in his own pocket. Anyone who buys this book is directly supporting a man who stole from Marley. Bob was pissed when he found out about Taylor's dishonesty, and he wrote Bad Card, a song off of his masterpiece, Uprising (1980). I refuse to pay for a book that will benefit a man who stole from Bob Marley. Don Taylor, you are a filthy thief, and your attempt to capitalize off of Bob makes me SICK."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"I think that anyone who has any interest in Bob Marley or Jamaica will really enjoy this book. I thought that it gave a lot of detail about Bob's life and also a lot about Jamaican culture. There were several references to the Rastafarian religion and how Bob practiced it. It is hard to say how much of the stuff that Don Taylor talked about was really true but it did seem believable. The style of writing he used was basically a journal of different events that took place in his and Bob's life. I did not realize before I read this book that Bob was actually a fairly smart businessman and tried to watch his money as carefully as he could. There were times where he could not protect his money from being taken away, like when Rita Marley would sign his name and make large withdraws there was nothing that he could do because it could not be proven. Bob Marley became popular right in the time when Jamaica was in one of its worst times. He was forced to make a choice between two different political groups, the wealthy and the poor. He never really did make a decision though he continued to remain close to people in both groups. This made me think about hard it must have been for Bob to grow up in the areas with lots of violence and poverty. Once he did become popular he did not leave his old friends behind. Overall I thought that this was a great book and I would encourage anyone interested in Bob Marley to read this and learn more about his life."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"Being a fan of Marley i found this book hard to put down. It tells the exciting story from Bob's managers point of view and shows insight to some of the songs giving you a new understanding of the King of Reggae. I would recommend this book for anyone who would like to see Bob in a new way as it follows him from his early days until his death in 1981."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"An excellent account of Bob Marley's career. Unmissable buy. This book reveals those who manipulated and exploited Bob's career and talent. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"Man, this is the unreal story. This is a nasty thing done by a guy who lived off Bob, and then he tried to take bad advantage after Bob was gone. He's just like the writer Albert Goldman was with John Lennon, acting like a backstabber, trying to bury somebody he was jealousy of after he had passed. Nobody needs to bother with this thing, it's evil to the core."},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"I have read just about every book available regarding Bob Marley. This was the last book on my list, and now that I have read it I know why. Don Taylor's version of his life with Bob is written in such negative context. He fills the pages with pats on his own back writing about those he loaned money to and never got it back. About what HE did for Bob. Definately left me feeling angry, bored and dissapointed. Don't bother!"},{"Title":"Marley And Me: The Real Bob Marley Story","review":"It is hard to get to know Bob from a Business view - this story was more of Don Taylors life and thoughts, as it should be, he did write the book. This is a great book to read, even if it is to see Bob Marley in someone else's eyes. I have been a fan of Bob's for Many years and I must say, there were more than a few new things I learned. I could have done without the ending, knowing all of his financials and all that happened to his estate. Personally, that is something the family should deal with and Don Taylor should keep that part private. Then again, it is his book and his way of seeing, knowing and loving Bob Marley. Anyone who is into Bob should read this book. ~Marleighgal"},{"Title":"Psalms, Part 1, with an Introduction to Cultic Poetry (Fotl) (Forms of the Old Testament Literature)","review":"Gerstenberger's commentary on the psalms, in keeping with the intentions of the FOTL series, seems to have three main purposes:1) to highlight, by actually working through the psalms, the importance of understanding the genre of each psalm for interpretion (i.e. \\"form criticism\\").2) to attempt to discover the historical context/setting (\\"Sitz in Leben\\") in which the psalms were (a) created and (b) used within the worshiping community.3) to comment briefly on the authorial intent of the psalm, in light of the above conclusions.Strengths:1) Gerstenberger is familiar with a great deal of secondary literature, and his conclusions regarding genre (in sifting through the opinions of lots of scholars) were quite helpful for intepretation. Also, his brief summaries of the intent of the passage aided theological reflection (other resources should be used though- see below).2) In each psalm, Gerstenberger does a good job highlighting parallel phrases in other psalms, Job, and the rest of the Old Testament (this is typically how he comes to his conclusions regarding the historical context of the psalms). This can be of great help in interpretation, if you are willing to put in some grunt work.3) The bibliographies alone are probably worth the price of the book.Some criticisms/limititations:1) Some of his conclusions regarding the historical context of the psalm seem forced- this would seem to be more from the nature of the material than anything else, though.2) The commentary--and the series as a whole--is not a line-by-line analysis and is intended to function as a supplement to other commentaries/resources. Gerstenberger focuses very little on either the theology of the psalms (typically, only as is necessary to discover genre) or on how they apply to Christians (or were applied in the New Testament). The 3 volume commentary on the psalms (Word Biblical Commentary series) by Craigie, Marvin Tate, and Leslie Allen would be a good primary set to use along with Gerstenberger, as would Weiser when he actually likes the specific psalm he's interpreting. I haven't used John Goldingay's commentary on the psalms much, but it's supposed to be really good.3) From a canonical perspective, some of Gerstenberger's are probably objectionable. For example, he links Psalm 19 to numerous hymns toward the (mainly) Egyptian god \\"El,\\" and says that the psalm is an adaptation of this kind of hymn. However, though this conclusion may be true, the psalm is clearly NOT worshiping the sun any longer, and is directed to the God who created the sun. Gerstenberger, though, seems to downplay this canonical shaping (if that is what it is), and says that \\"only thorugh the accretion of vv. 8-15 did the psalm become a Yahweh hymn.\\" Meaning, if the last half of the psalm was missing, it would be an \\"El\\" hymn again? This seems questionable.All in all though, this is a helpful commentary that should be used discerningly and with other aids. Certainly, if you want to teach yourself a fairly traditional form of form criticism, this is a pretty good place to start."},{"Title":"Psalms, Part 1, with an Introduction to Cultic Poetry (Fotl) (Forms of the Old Testament Literature)","review":"This was one of the required books at seminary. It focuses on the actual forms of the Psalms and their historical relevance.While I recognize that the word Cultic is probably technically correct, I found it difficult to accept using this word when discussing the faith of those who wrote the Psalms, and I have not really used it since it was required reading."},{"Title":"Moses: From the Mysteries of Egypt to the Judges of Israel","review":"The history of Mankind is, in larger part, the history of the transformation of consciousness.This transformation is mapped, masterfully, eloquently, by Bock.Before reading this book, Moses was a major character in the Pentateuch.After reading this book, Moses is a major character in the history of Mankind."},{"Title":"THE ITALIANS REVENGE","review":"I always like Michelle Reid's work and this one is no different. The story is about Catherine and Vito. They've been married for 6 years but they separated 3 years before. They haven't communicate since that day of the separation but now they are force to become wife and husband again because of their precious little 5 year old son Santo for the sake of becoming a family again. The story is very good, the characters are excellent.. though i find Vito's defense to another woman irritating. He's more on her side that his son. But i guess its only a small element. But i give it a 4, instead of 5 because of that."},{"Title":"THE ITALIANS REVENGE","review":"The issue that I have with this book is that Vito believed \\"the other woman\\" instead of Catherine (his wife) or his son. He never told his wife the truth about his previous relationship with \\"the other woman\\" (until the end of the book) and this allowed \\"the other woman\\" to cause trouble in his marriage. It is no surprise that Catherine had a hard time believing Vito since in essence he was lying.Some of the other readers stated that they disliked the way Catherine acted. I disagree, I think that Catherine actions were based on what she knew. Since she did not have all of the facts, granted she was wrong, but that was not her fault. At the end, when the truth came out, Catherine stated that \\"the other woman\\" knew things that only a lover would know and that knowing that Vito kept lying to his wife, gave her ammunition to hurt Catherine. Obviously it takes two people to make or break a marriage. In this case, he was more at fault than Catherine.I love Michelle's books but rated this only 4 instead of 5 because I think that Vito should have been honest with Catherine when all of their troubles started. Instead, he was only honest because the truth came out during an argument with \\"the other woman.\\""},{"Title":"THE ITALIANS REVENGE","review":"I have been reading a lot of Michelle Reid's book and I think this one was a little weak, but still ok to read. Vitto, did not have that strong chemistry that most men have in the romance books ...he tried too hard to convince his innocence to Catherine; who lived only in the past and not in the future. I love the love that was shown by both to their son; even though their was indifference between them, they tried to protect their son."},{"Title":"THE ITALIANS REVENGE","review":"I fell in love with books by Michelle Reid a while ago. I rate this book as 5 stars because like her others, it was a great read. However, I don't think it was as great as the other ones I have read of hers - but there is not real distinctions in the word great.I think what made this book a little lacking is that I've read many stories like this from her. They are not all EXACTLY the same, and if I didn't like the types of stories I wouldn't have read the books, but I sometimes hope for something a little different from Michelle, in the hopes of sparking my interest again.The only thing I can really say to anyone reading this though, is that if you liked her previous books you will definitely like this one."},{"Title":"THE ITALIANS REVENGE","review":"Michelle Reid is one of my favorite series writer and I always purchase her books. Just like her prior books, this pulled at heart strings and alot was due to the love that Vitto and Catherine shared for their son. I reccommend if you are looking for a fast pace, sensual, sometimes humourous read. Their son Santo was adorable.Just like the prior reviewer, didn't respect Vitto that much in his defense of &quot;the other woman&quot;, but felt he suffered sufficiently for his mistakes. I loved the ending, it made me smiled."},{"Title":"THE ITALIANS REVENGE","review":"I like this story,but I have a problem when the H totally took the OW side against his son. He knew the h loved their son and would do nothing to hurt him. It's the way he blackmails the h to go back to him, but yet he believes that the h would tell the son lies about the OW that causes no end of emotional drama. The H lied to the h about having a relationship with the OW before they met, he should have been honest. He forever takes the OW's side instead of his wife or his son, it's only when it's in black and white that he accepts what the OW is. No matter all the emotional trauma that was caused to his son and his wife, nothing should be worth that. If he was smart he would have realised that his wife would never hurt his son, so maybe the OW is a nasty piece of work. Trust is vital in a marriage yet he didn't trust his wife or his child. When things went wrong he went to, or the OW was there to make him feel better. It seemed to me that there was one too many people involved in the marriage. I think she would have been better off with the lawyer/friend."},{"Title":"THE ITALIANS REVENGE","review":"This book was OK but not particularly memorable. The main reason I bought it was because the hero and story appeared to be like that of a Lynne Graham book. But the hero was a let down. Though he was gorgeous, he was not as sexy or intense as a Lynne Graham's hero. Also, I did not like the heroine. Her continual disbelief in the hero's explanation of what had happened in the breakup of their marriage grated on my nerves."},{"Title":"Doctor Who and the Mutants (Doctor Who Library)","review":"This story is adapted by the series script editor at the time, Terrance Dicks. I remember watching this story on TV and finding it particularly good.The Doctor and Jo are off in the TARDIS, on a mission for the Time Lords. They arrive on Skybase One, in orbit around the planet Solos, one of many planets subjugated by Earth's empire. They must deliver small container to someone - but they don't know exactly who.There is tension between the natives of Solos and the Earth men. Earth is exploiting Solos' mineral wealth, and something else is happening. Solonians are starting to mutate into insect-like creatures...Reading this book and thinking back, I have to say that the reality is that the serial (six episodes) was probably too long. Of course, this gives the book an advantage: it can skim over the parts that may be regarded as padding and stick to the central story - which is still quite a good one."},{"Title":"Musical Composition","review":"This book is a nice sketch idea of how to compose in a small ensemble or solo setting. the examples given are of good quality and obviously very thoughtful. I would recommend this book for beginning composers. The short chapters provide enough details to understand most topics. For a more mature developing composer, I would recommend Techniques of a Modern Composer by David Cope as well as 20th Century Harmony by Vincent Persechetti. Also, nothing really helps understanding composition than just studying the masters! if you need a good book to help you get started, however, this book definately fits the bill."},{"Title":"Musical Composition","review":"I highly recommend this wonderful book. I have used it myself to teach beginning composition lessons, and used it as a reference many times for advanced analysis and composition.

Only a moderate understanding of music theory is needed to grasp concepts within the book. Great exercises in the back of the book."},{"Title":"Musical Composition","review":"This book covers almost every aspect that the composers are looking for. It is a book for composers indeed! It's a book of sound roules.

It talk in the same idiom that composers want. It gives the harmonic and composition techniques but it shows the pourpose of it. The roules that he shows are taked from his own impresions and analisis,not from other books of theorics writers.The contemporary techniques(Free pentatonic music,pandiatonicism,impresionism,polytonality, tonal contradiction,interval harmony etc.etc.) are stated very cleverly.It has,also,a chapter devoted to choir writting that explain,as I have never seen before,this technique,and is so good that you think that the choir writting is easy after that.I'm a composer,and I'm always seeking for good boks on the subyect of composition.

It does cover various essential topics and yet nothing is covered in textbook details. I suppose this book is not for learning to compose but for learning what is a composition and how it is actually done in various styles and forms etc., sort of like a reference book or dictionary. So, take it as it's and it's good enough for its purpose."},{"Title":"Musical Composition","review":"This book consists of short chapters that treat many compositional styles.

I am a composition book nut . This book plays like most composition books with chapters on theory and texture .Form and other topics are covered . The best books for tonal composition is persichetti and The Lou Harrison book . The Dallin book and Ulehla book are also good for a approach to understanding modern music in a tonal sense .Youll need a backround in harmony and preferably counterpoint to get the most out of this book . Brindle suggests the self studying student accompany this book with a harmony book . For that the best are Schachter or Payne-Kostka , or Tchaicovsky if you don't have the time to go through one of those tomes .The Piston books are exceptional .Exept for his Harmony which is unnecessarily dense and technical .The Schachter Text is The cutting edge for understanding the harmony of the 18th and 19th centuries . The work of Lerdaul has made a big impact on modern music theory . This book is really easy to read among a subject that is often very technical .I would recommend this book with the russo book for begining composers .The russo book is very practical and tells the secrets of transformations .A composer who already knows about transformations and variations will find the Russo book would be elementary but even a experienced composers can get something out of the Brindle book . Its somewhere in between a coffee book survey and a more in depth book like persichetti ."},{"Title":"Musical Composition","review":"Dr. Smith Brindle offers a very usefull text for those who alredy started in composition.

As a fan of the composition of diatonic art-music (sometimes with chromatic color added) I love the first half of this book, and the last half covering modern music composition including atonalism, etc. is also great.As a fan of melodic composition the approach given in this book is great.To get the most out of this book the student should have a knowledge of basic music notation and diatonic harmony.In my opinion, this is one of the best books on begining musical composition."},{"Title":"Musical Composition","review":"This is a great book really about musical composition. There is lots of books saying to be about composition. In fact, most of them talk about counterpoint, harmony, musical forms, etc. The point is that musical forms and counterpoint are not composition itself, they are topics of musical theory instead. Brindle's book is not about theory, is truly about composition. You will find answers for questions like: How to create distinct colors in composition, write the melody first or together with the accompaniment, how do I prepare myself for writting for several instruments, hints for my piece in entire tones not become boring, and so on. If you do not know theory deeply you can complement with specific books on the subject you need (i.e: musical forms, counterpoint)"},{"Title":"Musical Composition","review":"This book is thorough, however it assumes too much familiarity with the classical repertoire like so many other books on music composition. To utilize this book you would have had to a)perform what seems like nearly all of the classical repertoire when you were in high school and recognize the music by name, b)starting on your masters degree in music or c) be capable of performing all of the examples on sight and want to. This book is not very accessible and is only for experienced classical composers with an emphasis on the 20th centery. Too hoity toity for me.

In this work he admits to being no mystic examines accounts from a wide variety of traditions and comes up with eleven characteristics of Mysticism. As I am no mystic myself I have difficulty judging the validity of what he has done. I can say that this work is filled with insightful remarks.The eleven quintessences of the mystical state as Scharfstein defines and calls them are :\\" sameness; separation; uniqueness;inclusion;familar strangeness;depletion;aggression; conscience; mirror-rversal; humor; Reality, as the critical characteristic is put last. To a mystic, it may seem to be the only one worth emphasizing, but he inclined , after all , to dismiss many of the more interesting features of his experience, his own no less than ours.\\"I suggest the reader make an effort to understand each of these quintessences, something I did not really manage.Despite Scharfstein 's rigor in analysis, I still am mystified about mysticism- perhaps indicating that in this realm of experience as with so many others if one has not experienced it for oneself one simply cannot really understand it."},{"Title":"How to Talk to Your Cat","review":"I bought this title along with several others in earnest, seeking to better my relationship with my cat, & then honestly could not wait to finish the book...There was a small handful of nuggets of helpful information, mostly concerning a cats' body language & basic needs, that was useful. The most important concept I came away with is the advice to speak to your cat intelligently, & to treat him as a sentient being who bears personhood & with respect. I agree with the author that this is crucial. Even if your cat does not fully pick up on all of your complex human vocabulary, as Ms. Moyes elaborately fantasizes that hers do - your cat *will* pick up on your intent, the tone of your feelings towards him, & the spirit in which you speak to him. Her method of developing a call signal to find a lost cat is also of practical value. If you come away with these points, you've got the basics.That said...This author's narcissistic \\"snitty british\\" arrogant writing tone propelled by almost purely emotional reasoning drove me up a wall........ The author struck me as overly self-involved & almost completely lost in her own personal fantasies about what is going on with her cats to the point of living in a dream world, made for one. After page 20 this slowly became nauseating, & a stifling urge to scream settled in & stayed.In this book, the author haughtily purports herself to be everyone's Conscience concerning their pet. She makes striking statements that anyone who would ever opt to declaw a cat - or to solely house them indoors - is better off not having one at all. Apparently, this individual would rather see stray animals piled up dead on the floors of kill shelters, than to be adopted to live by apartment pet regulations concerning declawing, or kept safely indoors. My thought was, \\"How dare you...\\" The author needs to reach beyond a myopic, single-minded love of Siamese cats & an upper class lifestyle to develop some concept of how many hundreds of thousands of cats are left unclaimed & unadopted to die in shelters every single day, claws intact. This is reality.But then...she imagines that in spite of the plethora of feline breeds & mixes available, every person would *only* want to keep a Siamese cat, if they only knew their nature, as a matter of course. After reading her descriptions of her cats' behavior, I've never been more glad to have a DSH in my care. However, if you do keep a Siamese - get the book. It may help you realize you're not alone in your Siamese's unique antics. Most of the information here pertains only to them & does not generalize out well at all to other breeds. I could not relate at least 60% of the content to my own cat's personality, habits, feelings, & behavior. Or any other cat I've known, for that matter. Or, if you are interested in a purely anecdotal personal \\"case study\\" account of one person's experience of Siamese behavior - you may find this book's giddy ramblings entertaining. Be prepared to wade through mounds of ego & narrow subjectivity to get to the informational content you seek.However - if you are looking for a truly resourceful book on how to communicate with your cat...look elsewhere. Don't let one woman's endless egocentric carrying on bend your mind concerning your cat. Some far better suggestions for books on this topic would be:* \\"The Language of Animals: 7 Steps To Communicating With Animals\\" by Carol Gurney* \\"CatSpeak\\" by Bash Dibra, reknowned animal trainer* \\"The Cat Whisperer\\" by Claire Bessant* \\"Animal Talk\\" by Penelope Smith* \\"277 Secrets Your Cat Wants You To Know: A Catalog of Unusual & Interesting Information\\" by Paulette Cooper & Paul Noble* \\"Cat Owner's Manual\\" by Dr. Bruce Fogle - written by a Veterinarian, this is the single most helpful cat book I've found yet.There are SO MANY better titles out there on the topic of human/feline communication with helpful, useful information surpassing this stifling narration.To be perfectly honest... And I can't believe I'm saying this... I finished the book thinking, \\"I am so grateful I am not Ms. Moyes' cat.....\\" And screamed into a pillow."},{"Title":"How to Talk to Your Cat","review":"This book is a jewel.

The beginning contained some &quot;historical&quot; information, which I found sketchy considering the author had no credentials or references. The argument that this woman gave for how cats became domesticated wasn't convincing. Regardless, there was a decent section in the middle about picking a cat (if you got past her feelings about purebreds), communicating with your cat, and what the different &quot;miaows&quot; and body language mean that I found interesting and useful. Otherwise, the book is filled with stories of her Siamese cats and their world travels, unlikely circumstances involving the one cat being lost for 2 weeks, and many, many opinions.

Keith Robertson does it once again with wacky babysitting scenarios everyone can identify with. You'll be cheering by the end of the book -- I guarantee it."},{"Title":"HENRY REED'S BABY SITTING SERVICE","review":"This book, like the other books in the Henry Reed series, is very enjoyable. Kids of all ages will enjoy Henry's adventures in babysitting. These books are timeless in their ability to provoke laughter and create a sense of fun for the reader."},{"Title":"HENRY REED'S BABY SITTING SERVICE","review":"I read this book years ago when I was in sixth grade. The entire Henry Reed series is wonderful, and kids should have fun laughing at Henry's adventures."},{"Title":"HENRY REED'S BABY SITTING SERVICE","review":"Henry Reed, the thin and studious boy who likes to address problems in a logical manner, has set his sights on continuing his fledgling business. Reed and Glass, Inc. made Henry and his sometimes-obnoxious friend Midge Glass some money last year, and after a survey of the neighborhood, Henry discovers that there is a need for baby-sitters in the area. The bulk of the book focuses on the adventures that Henry faces as he tries to run a business with as many problems as rewards.Even though this might seem like a somewhat dull premise, the character of Henry Reed is so indomitable that he maintains our interest throughout. Children will be impressed with his ability to apply his skills to seemingly insurmountable obstacles, and also with the way that Henry manages to earn respect from the adults that he meets. His intelligence and Midge's creativity lead to amusing solutions for outwitting the children that are determined to be disruptive.The book is presented as Henry's journal, which allows us to experience the events through Henry's eyes. This works fabulously.The Henry Reed series was captivating to me as a child in the early eighties, and remained a favorite of mine for many years. Anyone who gives it a chance will fall in love with it."},{"Title":"HENRY REED'S BABY SITTING SERVICE","review":"This book is about a boy named Henry Reed who went to a place called Grover's Corner for the summer. He and his friend, Margaret Glass, thought about different ways to earn some money. They decided to create a babysitter's service. This book is good because it helps kids learn about the different ways to earn money for the summer. It also helps kids learn how to babysit different types of children. I loved this book. I hope you will read it."},{"Title":"HENRY REED'S BABY SITTING SERVICE","review":"These Henry Reed books were some of the first books I have ever read, and I enjoyed them much, and of course I wished there were more than three (there are, but the newer ones weren't available back then). Every time our family went to the library I would go directly to the Keith Robertson section and see if there were any new titles. They are the typical children's novels, a smart boy figures out things the adults around him are unable to. The best is *Henry Reeds Journey* - a picaresque.I recently went back and reread what I first consider the first \\"real\\" book I read while I was a child: *The Year of the Jeep* also by Keith Robertson. considered it my first real book because it didn't have any illustrations, even on the cover (in the copy I originally borrowed from the Oak Lawn Library.)I have a review of it here, somewhere.(If you are an adult) I would strongly advise going back and finding the \\"first book I ever read\\" and rereading it. Fun."},{"Title":"HENRY REED'S BABY SITTING SERVICE","review":"This was the first Henry Reed book I ever read, shown to me by my mother. Right away I got into the story, though I hadn't read the preceding books in the series. I couldn't keep my eyes off the predicaments of Henry and his best friend, Midge, as they went through their problems and misadventures while looking after children. Told from Henry's point of view in a diary format, he tells a story well and with bits of humour inserted in there additionally. Keith Robertson has made a good character."},{"Title":"HENRY REED'S BABY SITTING SERVICE","review":"I read this as a child and loved it and couldn't wait for my daughter to read it.

Reading it is like walking through a winter woods with a very knowledgeable botanist - plant lover who is willing to give you endless time to talk about plants, but without all the discomfort that involves. Black &amp; white and color drawings by the author of hundreds of familiar and unusual wild plants of the Northeast United States, in the way they look in winter. (Usually one sees drawings only of spring, summer and fall foliage and flowers)Detailed description and discussion of each plant are on the opposite page from each drawing."},{"Title":"Season Of Promise: Wild Plants In Winter, Northeastern U.S.","review":"This is a lovely book with beautiful drawings (pencil and pen), most in black and white and some in color. The drawings are both botanically accurate and lovely as a work of art.

The design of each page is a work of art in and of itself and I get a shiver just beholding each one. While ANL claims it is a report to \\"shareholders\\" it is really a collection of single page \\"jokes\\" that sometimes form a sustained narrative....It's very unlike Ware's Jimmy Corrigan book, as it can be read in no particular order and still make a load of sense. There are also some nice gimmicks included like toys you can build, mini-comics you can \\"bind\\", a glow in the dark map of the stars, a wrap-around band that contains a comic, and even the world's smallest comic included along the edge of the book. The colors, are bright, bold and rainbow like, the stories are all over the spectrum from hilarious to cringe inducing pathos, the actual Acme history is quite entertaining, and then there are the ad parodies.....You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wish they were real....basically ANL provides hours of entertainment for the price of a nice dinner, especially if ordered from Amazon.....I can hardly wait for Ware's next book which I hear is coming out in the next couple of months. Move this book to the top of your buying list...."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"Getting this book in the mail after having immensley enjoyed Jimmy Corrigan was comparable to my best xmas present-opening experiences as a kid - a feeling I assumed would not occur again, now that I'm a dried-up adult. I got it alongside acme novelty library 16 + 17, which I ordered whilst drunk and deeply regretted until recieving them. Wow! I simply cannot beleive something this amazing exists. I suggest reading 16 + 17 first, as there are secrets about Rusty Brown's fate that you may want to save until after you've got yourself into the 'Rusty-Brown-as-a-child' storyline. A large portion of this book involves middle-aged rusty, so... Well, its up to you. I can see the merit of reading it in the reverse order as well. Either way, this book is just utterly amazing - I haven't enjoyed any comics remotely this much, since reading Twisted Tales in my youth. I still have the final 3 pages left, and am quite excited! (Other reviewers say its the best ending ever, so I'm going to save it...You are a disgrace to humanity if you pass this up."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"Chris Ware's tragicomic characters are experiencing the dramas of life that most people would rather not admit even exist. Divorce, hate, ambivolence, child abandonment (a disturbing recurrence in Ware's work.), mental cruelty, substance abuse, murder, shame, self-loathing, etc. This is coupled with very dark tounge-in-cheek humor of the kind that makes you wonder if you should really be laughing or not. (You should.) Above it all is Ware's astounding design work. Nobody but NOBODY can create a world as fine and obsessively detailed as Chris Ware. Endless throwbacks to Victorian book design, Advertisments from early 20th century to comic book styles of the 50s. He has created a unique enviroment that is as dazzlingly brilliant to look at, as it is uneasy to read. I've never been dissapointed by Ware's work and this is no exception. This does collect previously released work from his Acme Novelty Library so if you already own all of those issues this may not be for you. However it is a terriffic collection and a must for fans, modern comic enthusiasts or people just interested in fantastic book design."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"Some comics might make you laugh till you cry. This one works the other way. You'll think and get depressed until you find a place to smile in. Exquisitely produced, it's like owning a piece of custom art on your bookshelf (not that it will fit) or coffee table. Astounding, perfect, unique: read it and fill in your own superlative."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"Imagine if you took every dark and self-loathing thought that a person ever had and then lumped it into a book. If you can imagine that then you might just understand this book. The art is phenominal, the writing is heart-wrenching and extremely clear and beautiful, but this book is not for the easily upset. Though Ware's comic style is often misread due to its breaking of the common left to right, top to bottom format this book is definetly worth the time it takes to read it. If you're a common reader of Graphic Novels or just starting out this is a great book for you.Warning: don't buy this for your ten year old son. Comics aren't just for kids anymore and if you don't know that yet you will soon."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"This is a phenomenal collection of Ware' s various single pages, larger format reprints and new meanderings. A frightful amount of detail and dedication.In response to the post 'you better have 20/20 vision' - I can't imagine why someone would use this space to bag a book for it's meticulious detail and give it one out of five stars [then credit Ware as a 'huge talent']. The 'detail' is part of the obsessive intrigue of the book which I think characterises Ware's respect for the reader. I can't understand why someone would deter another from buying a book based on poor eyesight over actual content. Buy a magnifying glass if ya struggling perhaps? Vent over."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"I've always enjoyed Mr. Ware's contributions to the genre, but this book....What can I say?! Amazing! Not only are the storylines dense, engaging, and complex, but the book itself is achingly gorgeous. Beautifully bound, a larger size, and with such lovely cover design, it could easily be mistaken as the manual for some ornate piece of antique machinery, or perhaps the rulebook for some vast, arcane, cabal of cannabalistic mystics, but no....it's \\"only\\" a...a what..? I guess the work could be called an underground comic (possibly more \\"etheric\\" than \\"underground\\") or a 'sequentially illustrated story,' but there's more to it than that. A more intense scrutiny exposes troves of hidden extras tucked deftly in amongst the dreamlike narrative, and re-reading brings new treasures to light. This is quite alot to add to a book that is already so beautifully and painstakingly illustrated. Chris Ware's spare, fluid style reminds me of many things...a draftsman's blueprint...early baby boom era automobile advertising...and...uh...what..? Perhaps the cover illo from a post WWII sci-fi paperback? Japanese calligraphy on a grain of rice? Not quite...This work is very evocative, yet somehow still so very hard to pin down, and yes, I do agree that it takes some effort to read some of the smaller stuff! Thank goodness for that, hunh? Otherwise, how would he ever have crammed so much work into that poor overloaded, jam-packed, wedged-in-with-a-crowbar volume? This book was barely 'street-legal' as it was! So put on your specs or borrow a good magnifying glass, and drop the sniv- -its definitely worth the effort. Mr. Ware has graciously offered us many lovely gifts, so let us not complain that some of them require more delicate handling. If it were possible, I would give this book more than 5 stars--it is beautifully drawn, possesses a storyline that snares you neatly and painlessly, contains tons of hidden treats and tricks, and is so prettily bound that it almost screams 'collectible!!'....It is rare that any book deserves this title, and rarer still to hear this word being used, but here it is: I believe this book to be A TOME."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"Ware is clearly intelligent, creative, tormented, and devoted to his work. At times he achieves real poetry, which is the highest compliment I can give any creative work. The problem is that the gems contained herein are all but lost in a dense miasma of obsessive neurotica and very uneven satire that tends toward the arch, precious, and vaguely self-congratulatory.Some of the spoof material is quite clever and I did find myself laughing out loud appreciatively a handful of times, but in general Ware pushes the same simplistic idea way too hard, over and over, and I found my eyes glazing over and my mind ardently wishing it were otherwise occupied. It doesn't help that Ware's style--graphically, narratively, and conceptually--tends to keep readers at arm's length rather than draw them in and create the illusion of intimacy. Add to this the fact that other reviewers are not exaggerating when they say you'll need a magnifying glass just to be able to read a substantial portion of the book, and the overall effect is at best ambivalent, at worst unpleasant and annoying. I couldn't escape the suspicion that Ware is resentful and perhaps even contemptuous of his readers--the self-loathing I read in his work is outweighed by anger directed at others.He fares much better with the narrative episodes in the volume. These are not only legible (which much of the spoof material is not--ironic considering that Ware seems much more of a designer than an artist, and one who seems to demonstrate a relatively developed consciousness of typographical considerations), but also far more complex,engaging, satisfying, and evocative. Even so, the overriding aesthetic is one of alienation and brutality--a fitting reflection of our dark world, perhaps, but one which stifles and maims the generosity and sympathy that make any truly great art the gift and blessing that it is. It's as though Ware were still seeking vengeance for whatever perceived transgressions were perpetrated on him during his childhood. I would find his work more compelling if he'd tone down the obsessiveness of the presentation and focus more on his very promising cast of characters."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"THE GREATEST COMIC BOOK ENDING EVER!!

Do not pass this up."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"Chris Ware is a master of his craft, and this book seems to exist in order to demonstrate that. It's a beautiful work. It is, however, miserably sad. It follows several different characters through different moments in their lives and weaves together various pathetically sad events into a somewhat less pathetic whole. Overall, a great book with some witty jokes, but don't read it if you're prone to bouts of book-induced depression."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"I read this after my first daughter was born and my wife returned to work after maternity leave. We lined up our vacations so I'd have time off after she returned to work. It was miserably hot outside. My daughter spent most days eating and crying. The rest of a difficult week was spent reading this. It was my temporary escape. It was brutally honest, but humorous at the same time. It was exactly what I needed. If I had to boil this book down to a sentence, it would be &#34;Yes, life IS that bad . . . but your life is not that bad so enjoy the ups and downs as much as possible.&#34; I suggest the book to everyone, but it has a special place in the hearts of comic book collectors and geeks such as myself."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"This book is a window into the mind of a genius.

She had studied the artist in a college course, but this particular edition captivated her--the artistry, subtlety and detail were the source of hours of enjoyment reading and studying the book. It's a work of art."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"Chris Ware consistently produces high-quality, masterfully-written art, and this volume is no exception.I was reading this book in bed when I came across a two-page spread featuring an astrological chart with various constellations... I noticed that it had glow-in-the-dark material on it, so after studying it for a few minutes I turned the reading light off - and in the darkness was presented with a glowing star chart, featuring, well, something from Ware that any true fan should experience for themselves - a true gift. It took my breath away and I found myself deeply moved by it.That moment has earned this book a place in my eternal library."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"I go back and forth between four and five for this book. A part of me wants to give it five stars because it's huge, it's amazing, it's detailed, it has so much great stuff; but another part of me just gets exhausted with how big this book is. I love Chris Ware and I always will. His illustrations really show how people suffer, real people at their best and worst. At their most naive and their most pig-headed. That's rare. But a hundred huge pages, some packed with over a thousand words each, just gets exhausting."},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"This is one of my favorite books ever, I just bought it on a whim and Chris Ware is clearly a genius, he says things I always think but I didnt know anyone else thought them... look its just brilliant ok, if you have half a brain you should definatly buy it"},{"Title":"The Acme Novelty Library","review":"This is yet another masterpiece from the wonder that is Acme Novelty. This book is a collection of assorted comics and advertisement parodies that would mortify even the most seasoned of profligates.

The book itself has thick, glossy pages with some smaller vivid pictures of certain radio models, but not all of them as that would make a huge book to lug around. As it is, this is more like a thicker magazine that can easily be taken on a trip if needed. The whole book is organized alpha by company/maker, and lists models numbers and years after that, with some details along with estimated values at the time the book was published. Now, of course, those values fluctuate, so it's more useful as a tool, not a guarantee. I do wish they had tabs for quicker look ups. Also, because there are so many models out there, they couldn't possibly fit them all in one edition, so I recommend collecting a few of these for anyone with a keen interest in radio collecting or repair."},{"Title":"Collector's Guide to Antique Radios: Identification & Values (4th ed)","review":"This is a great book to compare different old radio models.

It has an extensive catalogue of manufacturers and model numbers. It is full of factual, descriptive listings. Other books seem to fill their pages with quaint old advertisments,and other interesting but uninformative material. Bunis's books could improve on the accuracy of their descriptions. Many times in describing a radio, they list the number of knobs, number of tubes, shape of the dial, etc. The frustrating thing is, that just when you think you have identified your radio, you realize that the book forgot to list the number of knobs, or some other critical detail. The descriptions are inconsistant. The book has alot of nice photos of radios, but I find myself wishing for many more. If the Bunis's could solicit contributions from collectors and readers, maybe that would help.

Everything is listed by company. It appears to be a very comprehensive listing, but there are probably many models that do not appear. I'm certain no book has every model of all of the radios made. Items are easily located, and every major maker is included. Prices are updated for 1997. I'm a novice in this area of collectibles, but it appears to me that the book is quite comprehensive.

Attend a club swap meet, and you'll see fellow collectors with this author's book under their arms, on the seat of their vehicles, always &quot;close at hand.&quot; Just a guide, never the &quot;last word'&quot; as some antique dealers like to think, we collectors alike have always used Sluser's books as a reference to identify those radios not often seen in our geographical area. For this use alone, it is worth the price many times over. Each new edition has many new and updated pictures/information, not found in previous editions, so it's always best to try and collect the older editions, too.Whether you're a &quot;sometimes&quot; collector or &quot;on fire&quot; for the antique radio hobby, this book is more than a &quot;must have,&quot; hey you've &quot;got to have&quot; it!

Myself, I would pay $60 for a larger book that had 4 times the content. Some short history on the manufacturers would have been nice too. On the positive side, this book has made me more aware of the variety of radios that were made. I can now better decide what I want to buy.

And, I had doubts about this volume after reading some negative reviews. Now, I find it invaluable and can't imagine shopping without it.Any buying guide must be portable to be useful. This book is about as big as a practical buying guide can be. With 317 pages (7th edition) printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper, you cannot stuff this guide into your shirt pocket. However, you can carry it in your briefcase or a shipping bag. (I assume that future editions will be available in a digital format for use on portable electronic devices.)I had some concerns about omissions. Well, after attending radio swap meets, flea markets, yard sales and making inquiries about Craigslist and eBay postings, my experience is that the omissions are not overwhelming relative to the radios I have seen on the market. Moreover, several times I have found data on similar models that gave me valuable insights into a model not listed.The book presents several pages explaining its approach to valuation. After reading the detailed comments, you will be better equipped to make adjustments for unique situations and your buying interests. No guide can account for all variables, but I can tell you that this guide can help you to avoid costly mistakes. Many sellers have no clue about market value, and are wildly optimistic about what they think their antique tube radio should sell for. I always define a \\"bargain\\" or \\"too costly to buy\\" by reference to this guide.There are 800 color photographs in the 7th edition. Do I wish there were more? Sure, and typically each guide has more photos than the previous edition. Again, a buying guide must be portable and cannot contain photographs of all tube radios ever produced.If you are buying, don't leave home without it. There are few buying situations where a beginner or even an expert would not be helped by referring to this book. This is a superb presentation of otherwise rare data on a niche hobby ... and a stunning bargain at under $25.I have performed several market research projects in my professional life. And, I can only respect the years of research and data accumulation that have gone into the production of this unique work. If either the author or publisher ever stop producing this guide, it would be a huge loss to radio hobbyists.

Mr. Smith examines conceptions of the divine family and council of the gods, more general notions of ancient aspects of divinity, and the roles of various divinity. Especially insightful is his critique of James Frazier's category of \\"dying and rising\\" gods in the Near East. In his analysis of Isaiah, he gives considerable background into Mesopotamian views on the divinity of statues of gods, whithout prejudice. There is a lot more than I can list here in this book, but if you're interested in how the idea of one, all-powerful god came about, this is really essential reading."},{"Title":"The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts","review":"Mark Smith has arranged his materials such that his critiques are easy to follow with the aid of a tanach [I don't have an Ugaritic text].

Smith tells you the relative probabilities of different critical hypothesis' & it is apparent when he is positing his own opinions.I especially like the way Smith's approach opens up tanach as a text with a context familiar to contemporaneous West Asians.This is not a quick read. The citations in the manuscript as well as the footnotes are worth following up if possible.It is especially helpful if one knows hebrew language. The hebrew letters are transliterated into a roman alphabet which means you've got to retranslate from the roman letters into the hebrew letters in order to realize the shoreshim [roots of the word meanings]...a minor irritant.I highly recommend this book for those with an interest in tanach in particular or West Asian religions in general."},{"Title":"The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts","review":"This is an excellently documented book, written by a true scholar.

What sets Smith apart is a sociological study on how Israel developed from a henotheistic society to monotheism during the period just prior to the exile. What I appreciate about Smith is that he defines his terms very carefully. He shows how scholars in the past have had different definitions of monotheism, and he strives for precision. What is a little confusing about his work is that some of it is very speculative. The vestiges of (orthodox) henotheistic belief in ancient Israel are very sparse (Ps 82, Deut 32:8, 9 LXX and DSS). And Israelite religion did not be come monotheistic for all Israelites everywhere at the same time. As he says, the prophets record the existence of polytheistic and ditheistic Israelite worship by their critique of it. Another thing I appreciate about it is the annotation. THis book is 200 pages of text and 100 pages of footnotes. If you are looking to dive into a topic (such as, YHWH and his asherah), this is a great place to start because he talks about it briefly, then cites about 20-30 source on the topic. The footnote are a goldmine. What is annoying about this book is the lack of editing and the print. First the print is not necessarily Smith's fault, but it is very poor. I would think Oxford University Press could do better, but maybe this is their way of punishing people for not buying their expensive hardbacks. The other problem is the editing. SMith's theory about Ps 82 and Deut 32 come up about 4 times in the book. There are grammatical mistakes and paragraphs that just go on....and on....and on. This book needs some serious editing. All in all it's a good work.

Most academic research these days involves working within a restricted paradigm that excludes much of what can be called human experience - origin of consciousness, teleological questions, and so forth. This is usually labelled \\"scientific methodology\\" - a term designed to give it an air of legitimacy. Of course, when one operates within a purely physical framework, guided by natural processes, one cannot seek an explanation of the Yahweh cult but through some socio-cultural development model.My main field of interest is mathematics and theoretical physics - I am presently working on a theory of quantum gravity in which I hope to overcome the problems of non-linearity that plague other such theories (Yahweh willing, of course). However, I remember years ago when I was involved in biblical studies and reading the great leaps of logic and absurd conjectures that biblical scholars would make and pass off as virtual fact. I can't help but shake my head in amusement and disbelief as I ponder their incapacity to differentiate fact and hard proof from speculation. Perhaps every biblical scholar would do well to spend part of their undergrad training in physics and chemistry.As an academic myself, I am well aware of the strategical advantage it is to one's career to support an atheistic worldview. I suspect many biblical scholars and scientists have more personal faith than they are willing to reveal in their publications but are inhibited out of fear of recrimination and mocking from their colleagues.

He isn't kidding. His fictional protagonist, initially a 12-year-old stowaway on Bjarni Herjolfsson's ill-fated longship bound for Greenland, introduces himself as &quot;Harald, Harald the younger, and I am seasick. . . . The thought of some of the new names I'll get from [the crew], like 'Harald the Messy' or 'Look out below Harald,' make Harald the younger seem very comfortable.&quot;The laughs don't stop there as the reader follows Harald's account of the true if accidental discovery by Herjolfsson of America (or Vinland, as the Vikings later dub it), the eventual colonization under Leif Eiricksson, and other key events recorded in Harald's &quot;journal.&quot; Grim reality interjects itself in the form of Harald's experiences as a suspected mutineer, the violent deaths of his erstwhile crewmen and, later, a close friend and mentor. To this tally Cherry adds the even more graphically violent -- and senseless -- deaths of native Vinlanders, whose sole crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time.This only makes the humor all the more appreciated, such as the running gag of Harald's falcon, which prefers to perch on Harald's head. (Now we know where medieval European millinery fashions originated, too.) In addition to seafaring excursions and adolescent plots to invade Madam Grunnhilde's establishment of ill repute, Harald chronicles a lifelong spiritual journey presented with a deft balance of sensitivity and pragmatism rarely found in contemporary fiction.That's the good news.The passage of time depicted in chapter transitions varies between 15 seconds and 15 years, often without any clear indication of the duration involved. Billed as being &quot;Excerpts from the journal of Harald the Younger,&quot; 985: The Discovery of America would have better served readability by using a journalistic format with dated entries.In addition, copyediting seems all but absent. Never have I seen more typos and &quot;word-os&quot; (such as the use of &quot;gate&quot; rather than &quot;gait&quot; to describe how a horse moves) per square inch than in 985: The Discovery of America. But it's a testament to the book's overall merit that I not only finished, despite the myriad errors, but still enjoyed the story immensely.Too bad they couldn't make history this entertaining in school.

Bush and the Christian Right","review":"This is not exactly a non-partisan book. Liberal Democrats will love it and conservative Republicans will be angry. I personally believe that Esther Kaplan has proven her case that the George W Bush administration is fundamentally incompatible with American traditions of democratic government. She is especially good when discussing exactly how a phony religiosity is being used as a cover for an elitist economic agenda and a foreign policy out of touch with the real world.There are excellent chapters about the Republican romance with pseudo-science, the current administration's inept attempts to deal with the worldwide AIDS crisis, and GOP attempts to mix moralism and public health policy. But the best chapter is the one about stacking the courts. The author argues that an essential part of the Reagan-Bush agenda has been an attempt to remake the courts as a reactionary force for generations to come. And the net result is that average Americans have no legal protections against the corporate world, laws to protect disabled people are invalidated, and even Constitutional rights supposedly in force since the founding of the Nation are compromised.The subtitle and numerous comments throughout the book assume that the \\"Christian Right\\" is somehow connected to the Christian Faith. However I do not believe that it is correct to blame those of us in the Christian Community for the fact that there are unbelievers, total phonies, and outrageous hypocrites within the ranks. The \\"Pseudo-Religious Right\\" would be more accurate terminology."},{"Title":"With God on Their Side: George W. Bush and the Christian Right","review":"Let me preface this review by stating my own religious background, so that my comments here can be more accurately understood. I consider myself a devout Christian and an adherent to orthodox Christian beliefs as contained in most Christian creeds. I am not a fundamentalist, however. I was raised Southern Baptist, but no longer consider myself one because of the convention's continuing embrace of nutzoid right wing ideology. The main break for me came when the SBC proclaimed women to be properly subservient to men. Also, I have seen a increasing abandonment of traditional, defining Baptist beliefs such as the priesthood of the believers (THE central Baptist principle) and the separation of Church and State, which was pretty much a Baptist invention in the US. Politically I am of the far left, inspired almost entirely not by any political thinker but by repeated readings of the Sermon on the Mount. I am, of course, hardly the first Christian in history to have been so affected by these words of Christ.My background therefore colors my reaction to this book. Like Kaplan I have grown increasingly dismayed by the role that right wing religion has come to play in American political life. Like Kaplan I believe that this influence has been uniformly awful. Like Kaplan, I think that everything possible must be undertaken to inform the public at large of the specific ways religious agendas are harming America. I think the book is not quite perfect, but it nonetheless contains a large amount of very useful information of which all voters need to be aware.Let me point out two things that Kaplan does not raise, but that I believe at the heart of the matters at hand. First, one reason that the Founders wanted a sharp separation between Church and State (and despite the reinvented history of Pat Robertson and the Dominionists, there is absolutely no question of where they stood on the matter) was that they understood that if you introduced religion into politics, it essentially took on a party flavor. And the fortunes of specific parties waxed and waned. Madison understood this better than anyone. If you tie religion to specific political beliefs and stances, if the general public turns against those beliefs and stances, it turns against religion as well. We see this happening right now with my old Southern Baptist Convention, with poll numbers increasingly showing a broad negative perception of Southern Baptists because of their involvement in politics. I think these numbers are going to increase and I believe that the stagnant membership in the SBC churches will begin to decline. All of this could have been predicted twenty-five years ago when the denomination shifted sharply to the right.The second thing that I want to point out that Kaplan neglects is a fact that a disturbingly small number seem to be aware of: most Christians in the United States do not support the far right. Most Christians are either moderates or liberals. Roman Catholics, for instance, tend to be anti-abortion and sympathetic to many so-called pro-family measures (though there is great diversity in the American Catholic church, since the vast majority of Catholics believe in birth control, despite the teachings of Rome, and many support a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion as well), but on most other issues the Church is either moderate or left leaning. And while contemporary Protestantism is dominated in the public eye by Southern Baptists and the Pentecostal denominations, the large number of protestant denominations that are much further to the left are ignored. Even many Baptists, such as American Baptists and Swedish Baptists, are much further to the right than the SBC.Still, none of this changes the importance of Kaplan's book. In a series of chapters she shows specifically how the religious right has penetrated American government and begun to dictate policy in increasingly disturbing ways. Several chapters of her book cover aspects of the relation of the religious right to the Bush administration and the Republican Party of which most people are already aware. In other words, that those on the religious right overwhelmingly support the GOP and provide them with funding. What most Americans are unaware of is the incredibly harmful influence that the religious right has had on public policy.The damage that religious right beliefs have been doing comes in several key areas. For instance, the fear of Darwinian science has led to an assertion of non-scientific creationist ideas in weird and unexpected places. In our National Parks, for instance, books reflecting the almost universally and globally held scientific consensus have been replaced by equally universally and globally disdained books reflecting a creationist understanding of geology. In other words, books reflecting our foremost experts on geology have been replaced by writings by ideologues.Understandings of the ultimate course of world history have led to an uncritical support for Israel and an utter disregard for the Palestinians. Granted, the Bush administration is hardly the first to take this position, but even in the Reagan administration there was unqualified criticism of Israel for the expansion of the settlements. Under Bush and his similarly minded religious right cohorts, we have seen the most hands-off approach towards Israel since the nation was created in 1948. What is truly scary is that the religious right in truth has no genuine concern for Israel or the Jews. Their only concern, as seen in the violently anti-Semitic LEFT BEHIND series (I say this because there as in much religious right ideology Jews are not taken as they are and wish to be, but for the role that the right presumes they are destined to play, i.e. mainly as cannon fodder in a series of unspeakably violent tragedies) is in making conditions right for Armageddon and a massive military conflict. There is absolutely no question that a dramatic escalation of military activities in Israel and Palestine would be greeted with great joy in the Religious Right, while an effective two-state solution guaranteeing the Palestinians a nation and recognition of their rights would be cause for consternation and regret. As Kaplan rightly points out, are these the kinds of people we want in charge of our foreign policy?Beliefs in sexual morality have caused almost unprecedented problems in public policy. World bodies dealing with AIDS have become increasingly frustrated with the US in attempts to deal with AIDS (a frustration that has increased since the publication of Kaplan's book). While most organizations want to deal with the issue taking a multi-tiered approach, including condoms, the US representatives, a disturbing number of them without backgrounds in public health but instead chosen for their religious positions, insist on emphasizing abstinence above all others. Increasingly the US has come to be perceived as on the margins of this and other world health issues. If the US didn't have large amounts of cash and political clout, we would be completely ignored by the international community. We are largely irrelevant in terms of the ideas that we have to offer.Abstinence has also inflicted damage on domestic policy. Increasingly sex education in the US has come to reflect only the beliefs of the religious right ideologues. Although it is too early to say for sure, but it appears that abstinence only education is considerably less effective in preventing pregnancy rates. In fact, pregnancy rates have gone up slightly among teens even while sexual activity has gone down.These are only a few of the areas that Kaplan covers in her book. She writes extensively about how right wing religious ideology has harmed AIDS research, almost all public health research, environmental research and policy, and a host of other areas.I do want to point out what I think is the book's most serious shortcoming: a minimal discussion of the Dominionist movement. There is a brief mention of this, but the small but very influential group of people who intentionally stay beneath the radar but who have as their agenda the recreation of America as a Christian Nation exert a huge amount of influence on the religious right. Even most on the Right are unaware of their true beliefs. The Dominionists bring forward only their least objectionable beliefs, such as the anti-historical claim that the US was created as a Christian nation and that we should be once again. But they keep many of their beliefs out of the public eye, such as the belief of the most ardent Dominionists that no women should be allowed to work and should stay home and be caretakers (though given the fact that there are more women than men in the population, I am not sure how that works out). Or their internal debates as to whether homosexuals should be stoned to death or burned, i.e., the most ardent Dominionists don't disagree over whether they should die, but only on the Biblically agreed method of execution. Luckily, other books similar to Kaplan's, such as Kevin Phillips AMERICAN THEOCRACY and Michele Goldberg's KINGDOM COMING address dominionism as great length. It is her failure to take up this incredibly important topic that keeps me from giving it five stars.All of this leads to the question: what next? Books like this are a crucial first step. People like Sara Diamond and Frederick Clarkson have been warning us about the dangers of the far religious right for years. With polling showing that even most Republicans feel that the Religious Right has too much influence in American life, it is looking like the mood in the country is shifting against the religious ideologues. On a policy level, the success of the Religious Right has depended entirely on the general ignorance of the public. Not many Americans would support \\"abstinence only\\" as the primary approach to dealing with AIDS in Africa. Or refusing to fund any AIDS studies because it might be of benefit to gays (most Americans are opposed to Gay marriage, but support Civil unions and every other fundamental right available to US citizens). Information is the key. Books like Kaplan's, and those mentioned above by Phillips and Goldberg, or more specialized books such as Stephanie Hendricks's DIVINE DESTRUCTION: DOMINION THEOLOGY AND AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY are helping.My recommendation for those coming to learn about these issues for the first time to read this and one other book. Kaplan is great in talking about the specific influences that the religious right is having on public polity. But she is somewhat weak on the ideology under girding the religious right. Michele Goldberg's KINGDOM COMING: THE RISE OF CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM is basically an updating of the work by Sara Diamond and Frederick Clarkson in the 1990s. Together, these two books can help expose the pernicious influence that the religious right has had on contemporary American politics. My hope is that gradually my fellow Christians will come to their senses and start moving back to a Biblically instead of politically mandated understanding of the role of Christians in society."},{"Title":"With God on Their Side: George W.

Their reach is astounding, ranging from social programs to science to war and peace!In almost every way one can think of, Kaplan documents the ways that the extreme right-wing Christian community, led by George W Bush, has used their anti-science, anti-intellectual and anti-reason point of view to shape policy, often to disastrous results.Many will superficially see this book as \\"anti-religious.\\" This is not necessarily so; this book is anti-irrationality, and then, if the shoe fits, wear it.One could also write a book on the irrationality of some left-wing religious activists as well and that would be justifiable; but it is safe to say that at this moment in time, the Religious Right's embrace of a coming rapture, their belief in an inerrant bible and rejection of mainstream science in favor of Creationism and other pseudo science overwhelms the dangers posed by any other religious class in the US!This book is a must for those blissfully unaware of the ways that the fundamentalist religious beliefs of others can some day profundly change their lives. For those who already know, this is a great compilation with all the facts neatly assembled in one book."},{"Title":"With God on Their Side: George W. Bush and the Christian Right","review":"With God On Their Side: How Christian Fundamentalists Trampled Science, Policy, And Democracy In George Bush's White House by Brooklyn-based radio and print journalist Esther Kaplan is an informed, hard-hitting, no nonsense investigation into the collaboration of a power-hungry President and his supporters of the fundamentalist Christian right. Delving deeply into the details of the covert conspiracies and overt deal-making for gaining political empowerment among fellow Christians in the first term of Bush's election, With God On Their Side comprehensively supports and documents the arguments presented while intricately mapping out the Bush Administration's attacks upon the democratic principle of separation of church and state. With God On Their Side is very highly recommended for students of political science, and contemporary social activists who support the continued separation between the powers of the government and the demands of the religious community."},{"Title":"With God on Their Side: George W.

Bush and the Christian Right","review":"There are many books on this subject and I have just about all of them. So far I like this one the best because it states clear and consise facts without an opinionated view. I recommend this as a first read on this subject to give yourself a good foundation on other books that are mostly interested in writing about the \\"effects\\" of this political power.It is a very easy read, yet at times very hard to put down, Stacking the Courts is a very good chapter! Many parts of this book I have highlighted too.My Conclusion : Religion should not be joined with politics! I am not against Christianity, but to me this is not Christian. The God I know does not work deceptively and is not codenming! I love this Country, but the only thing Christian about its foundings was the FREEDOMS it secured for us. I am sorry those freedoms have been taken advantage of and now its seems that the \\"Christian Right's\\" answer is to take them away from us, the government is all too willing to oblige!"},{"Title":"With God on Their Side: George W. Bush and the Christian Right","review":"My wife picked this book up for me at a used book store last week and I could not put it down! Like another user stated I've read just about every book on Bush's \\"presidency\\" (somehow, however, I sadly missed this one!) and agree that it's an excellent starter for someone interested in learning about how religion played a forceful part in our government from 2000-2008.Of course, the religious right has been infiltrating our government for many, many years but none so much as we saw during Bush 43's reign. For example, as Kaplan's book points out, abstinence funding in the Reagan days amounted to about $4 million/year. During the Gingrich days funding rose to $97 million. When Bush took office he more than quadrupled funding for the mostly christian-based \\"abstinence-only\\" organizations while slashing, and in some cases completely defunding, organizations who offered anything more than abstinence-only materials.This is just the tippy tip of the iceberg. Kudos to Kaplan for incredible investigative work. I very much appreciate that the facts are backed up with citations and that she uses a no-nonsense approach to her writings. My only regret is that I didn't read the book sooner and that Americans as a whole didn't heed the messages in her book that explains how America is swiftly heading towards a theocracy."},{"Title":"Never Give In!","review":"Most of us even with a cursory knowledge of history have heard or read of some quotations of Winston Churchill. Such phrases as \\"This was their finest hour\\", \\"An Iron Curtain has descended \\" and \\"Blood toil, tears and sweat.\\"Even taken out of context these words stir the emotions and inspire. I have read many of Churchill's speeches all the way through. They are indeed inspiring and very well thought out.In this two CD disc set conceived and produced by his grandson Winston S. Churchill, we actually hear these speeches as they are given. Not all the speeches selected were recorded. Those speeches that weren't were read by Churchill's grandson.What must be remembered is that when the majority of these speeches were given Great Britain was indeed fighting all alone. What we hear is Winston Churchill defying Nazism and inspiring and indeed explaining all what was happening in the War against the Nazi regime.Churchill was the Spokesman as well as Defense Minister and Prime Minster. Also in his spare time he was the Speechwriter.In hearing these famous speeches one can feel the calming effects in Churchill's voice. Also you can hear his anger and vehemence at Herr Hitler. These indeed were desperate times but these speeches served to inform and inspire the British people. Churchill inspired an Empire to never, never give in.After hearing these speeches in the desperate times of World War II, one can attest that Churchill was the greatest orator of the English language.I really don't have enough Stars!!!"},{"Title":"A Harmony of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles: The Books of the Kings of Judah and Israel","review":"This book makes the study of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles much easier, since it shows the parallel passages next to each other on the same page. The pages are conveniently divided into 2 larger columns, one for the Judah, one for Israel. This method takes much of the confusion out of trying to figure out what is going on where and when, since the &quot;overlaps&quot; are shown side-by-side. I think such a harmony in essential to have available to the Christian community. I myself teach Sunday School and have found it indispensible. My only objection to this particular harmony is that Mr. Crockett has seen fit to rearrange the chronology in places (rather than just going straight through Samuel and Kings, incorporating Chronicles where it overlaps). His way of doing it has made it difficult for those without harmonies to follow what it going on."},{"Title":"A Harmony of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles: The Books of the Kings of Judah and Israel","review":"This harmony is similar to a harmony of the Gospels. There is no real commentary; the passages are simply arranged in columns so the reader can better understand sequences and the full details of accounts that are referenced in Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles.This is a book for pastors, academics, or laymen who are planning an extensive lesson/sermon series on some the characters in these narratives or academics who have interest in chronology."},{"Title":"A Harmony of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles: The Books of the Kings of Judah and Israel","review":"Many people do not even study these books and therefore do not understand the history within them.

I guess it was too good to be true."},{"Title":"50 Fast Digital Camera Techniques (50 Fast Techniques Series)","review":"This book resolved numerous unanswered questions I had about my 'prosumer' Canon PowerShot G3 (see review). What benefit is the histogram, for instance? Now I know not only what it's for, but how to use it for proper exposure - that alone was worth the reasonable admission price. I learned about exposure lock, focus lock, exposure (and flash) bracketing, why results with the built-in flash may be disappointing, why fast-action sports photos require a fancier (SRL) camera, the pros and cons of the red-eye prevention pre-flash, and dozens of other tips and features that the camera's instruction manual describes in detail, but leaves it to you to find out the why's and the how-and-when-to-use-it's.As expressed by some disappointed readers, this is NOT a book for point-and-shoot photographers and/or cameras [you'd be better served by one of the \\"Dummy\\" books]. It is meant for the more richly endowed cameras with many selectable functions, some of them mysterious. The title certainly falls short in not making that difference clear. But I found the contents enormously helpful in grasping the camera's potential (even though I couldn't tell apart the black-and-white original and edited vignettes that start each section). The enclosed CD has full-sized color photos that you can edit in graphics software, and a 'slide-show' that shows each and every book illustration in color (albeit compressed to web size). Also on the CD is a protected Acrobat version of the entire book [ie, you can view, but not print individual pages - using PrintScreen, you can copy a page to the clipboard, paste it in Word, then print the page].Overall: a superb guide to familiarize the reader with the arcane buttons, dials and menus of a complex digital camera. Other books might better serve snapshot photographers."},{"Title":"50 Fast Digital Camera Techniques (50 Fast Techniques Series)","review":"As an experienced 35mm user just switching to digital, I found this book to be the perfect complement to my camera's instruction manual.In a clear and straightforward manner, it addresses a wide multitude of picture-taking situations and accessory choices, from the most basic to the more complex. Each of the 50 techniques is concisely explained and extremely well illustrated in a most logical progression of sections ranging from 3 to 10 pages each. The table of contents and index are wonderfully comprehensive and make finding what you want as simple as possible. The included CD-ROM and associated web site are a beautiful bonus.

I am on my 4th digital camera but the first three worked fine in Auto mode and I never challenged myself to learn how to use all the features of the cameras. Having no photography background with advanced film cameras, I was not familiar with using white balance, f stops, depth of field, etc. This book has helped me to understand how to really get the most out of my more advanced &quot;prosumer&quot; camera and it is also full of tips and techniques for taking better photos of all types from landscapes to portraits, panoramas, pets and kids, using off-camera lighting and tripods.

Its filled with lots of information in easily digestible amounts.The first \\"technique\\" simply is a form to fill out with all the settings your camera can set, how high and low each can go, if it applies to your camera, and where in your camera's manual the topic is discussed. This sounds rather dull at first but believe me you will be thankful later when you know exactly what your camera is capable of and know how to quickly find the information again when you need it.I'd say the first 15 \\"techniques\\" (I prefer mini-chapters) are great to get you up to speed with the basics of what you need to know about photography and how to really USE all your camera's features.The rest of the book is essentially bonus material to expand your knowlege of certain types of photography.This book is clearly written for people who own point-and-shoot digital cameras, which is pretty much most people.

About half the techniques show how to get the most from specific digital camera features, and half are subject-oriented techniques (e.g. flowers, still-life, landscapes, people, etc.) I've been shooting like a maniac with my new D50, and I'm a satisfied customer with this book."},{"Title":"50 Fast Digital Camera Techniques (50 Fast Techniques Series)","review":"I brought this book based on good review here and read it through. I found some mistakes, also disapointed for not going to details in other chapters or not talking some important things in photography. But I think for people never taking picture before, this is a good book to introduce photograph to them.Now, I like to pointed one obvious mistake when author talked about the lens F/x.x aperture number. He said that F actually means 1. That is wrong. F means the focus length. The aperture number is an indication how much light can get through the lens. A f/2.8 lens will allow more light through than a f/3.5 lens when they have the same focus length. For build a compact camera, most manufactures try to build smaller and lighter camera. When you select a camera, select bigger aperture number on the lens will enable you take picture at lower light.When author explains in the book why smaller pocket size camera has deeper field range, he also failed to explain that smaller pocket size camera also has smaller lens, sometimes the tiny lens has f/3.5 or even worse aperture number. The aperture number is causing the field depth to be deeper, which may not be a bad thing for point and shot camera, but not work well in low light.The book did mentioned about aperture priority and shutter priority. But not in any depth at all, not enough for anyone to take advantage of the camera functions by following the book. I am really disapointed about that. It did not talk about lens filters at all, which is very important technique but totally ignored.In the 50 techniques talked in this book, at least 10 of them is not related to the camera directly, rather is how to use photoshop element software, how to print. But in the how to print section, it did not discuss the paper differences. From my experience, using HP photo paper and Epson photo paper will produce different result in any printer. If anyone talks about printing photos, how to select paper to get best result should be discussed. But author did not get into that details either.I give this book two stars because it does help people to learn how to select subject, which is also an important part of taking good picture."},{"Title":"50 Fast Digital Camera Techniques (50 Fast Techniques Series)","review":"I am a beginning digital camera user and bought this book to try to shoot in different scenarios.

But I went dutiflly and dug out my manual, started paging throught it, and \\"surprise\\" if this book wasn't right! When you take the time to look at the full list of capabilities for your camera, it opens new doors in photo opportunities and creative possiblities. I got out my highlighter and went to work both on my manual and \\" 50 Fast Digital Camera Technicques\\".Chapters 8, 9 and 10 are worth their weight in gold!

It is pretty easy to use, etc. Gives great pics and a lot come out looking very professional, but my being completly unacquainted with photo terminology has slowed down my learning curve.

Techniques\\" I'd simply hoped for a collage of tips to quickly apply to different photo taking situations. Surprise! This is a comprehensive, clearly written and generously illustrated text designed to get the new digital photographer beyond \\"Auto\\" and on to understanding and using the settings and features of his camera.The 20 Techniques in the first 4 Chapters build the foundation. Learn these first and you'll understand your camera and how to use its features and settings - including scene modes, shutter speed, f-stop, color balance, focal length, and the histogram - to control image quality features like exposure, sharpness, depth-of-field, and noise.And you'll learn enough good photo basics to appreciate when and why which features are important.It also goes well beyond the camera controls - covering composition, natural and flash lighting, tripods, and even care of memory cards and batteries.Beyond those opening chapters, there's seemingly a Technique for every common photographic challenge - e.g. kids, portraits, pets, sports, nature, macro, waterfalls, stars and sky, landscapes, and panoramas. The illustrations are high quality, in color and well chosen; \\"tip boxes\\" highlight many special tidbits, and a 15 page index helps find everything.Techniques even cover the oft neglected image handling challenges of digital photography - including editing, resizing and printing, sharing, organizing, and backing up. Although less complete and dated as software and services quickly evolve (this 2nd edition uses Photoshop Elements 3 and Elements 6 is out), these Techniques will get you started.This book should get you started and be a great reference whenever you try something new."},{"Title":"50 Fast Digital Camera Techniques (50 Fast Techniques Series)","review":"I gave this book 5 stars as I enjoyed reading this book from the moment I got it in the mail.

I've read the 50 Fast Digital Photo... and 50 Fast Photoshop... books by Gregory Georges and was not impressed. Gregory seems to know about Cameras and Photography, but his Photoshop skills are amateurish. The reason I bought this book was because Larry Berman and Chris Maher were involved. Larry takes breathtaking pictures of the south west. You should check out his website. Unfortunately this book is mostly written by Gregory. The production of the book is fair to poor. All of the 50 Fast... books are printed on cheap paper and the pictures are printed in black and white. There are a few color pages in the center of the book that you can find some of the pictures reproduced in color. What a pain to have to flip back and forth. If you want to see all of the pictures you have to use the CD Rom included on the back of the book.

Known as an iconoclast and an excellent satirist, Bierce is best known for his Devil's Dictionary. He's also known for the disappearing act he pulled in Mexico in 1913. I decided to give this short anthology a chance. If I liked his stories, I figured I'd buy some more of his writings. I will be reading more of his writings.The recent movie _The Blair Witch Project_ has brought scary stories back into vogue. After reading this book, I realized you can make a direct connection from this film to Ambrose Bierce. The connection would pass through Stephen King and H.P.Lovecraft along the way. I've seen things in both of these writers that could have been lifted directly out of one of Bierce's stories. In Bierce's story, &quot;The Damned Thing&quot;, with its talk about colors that can and can't be seen, I could have sworn I was reading Lovecraft. Bierce is a master at quick twists and shocking violence, and delivers scares fast and furious. I got chills with several of these short stories, which certainly makes for good horror reading.The book gives the reader a sample of Bierce's short stories. Most of the stories are tied around American Civil War themes, which is no surprise as Bierce served in the Union army during that conflict. His experiences gave him the necessary frame of reference to write these dark stories. And when I say dark, I mean DARK! Some of these tales will make your jaw drop. The violence in them is extremely unsettling. Chickamauga and Oil of Dog are sickening, describing blown open heads and dead babies in graphic detail.Did I mention Bierce's prose? Some of the best you'll read. His prose is so amazing that I found myself rereading some of his passages just so I could make sure I was getting the full meaning. It is that rich and textured. It's also extremely funny in places. In the introduction it is written that Bierce lived in England for several years and was embraced by the English, who are masters not only of the language, but also insults. I'm not surprised when I look at how he writes. He can pen an insult that would bring tears of joy to an Englishman's eyes.Finally, Bierce's stories show incredible depth for the short story format. He ridicules false courage, irony, lawyers, and even unions in the story, &quot;The Revolt of the Gods&quot;. I highly recommend that anyone not familiar with Ambrose Bierce give this book a read. It reads fast and you'll laugh and be shocked within the space of one page. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Tales of Soldiers and Civilians","review":"Ambrose Bierce's collected stories, mostly of the Civil War but also of peacetime America in the last half of the 19th Century, are amazing not least because of the fact that he was one of the first to write in this genre. No doubt much of his inspiration for his Civil War stories were based upon his own observations as an officer in the Union Army while other stories may have been ones he came up with while living on the Pacific coast.Ghostly occurances, strange machines, unexplained episodes, monsters... Bierce seems to have lived in a strange world of shadows all his own. It is somehow fitting that Bierce simply disappeared in the early 20th Century.Great book. Definitely a classic."},{"Title":"Home Video: Choosing, Maintaining, and Repairing Your Home Theater System","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. The author is a master of the obvious. There is not even the most basic information for a complete novice, let alone someone considering &quot;maintaining and repairing your home theater.&quot; For instance, you get a detailed description of the author's &quot;wet, dingy, 5'8&quot; basement. You do get insight on the finer points of building with particleboard and on digging down to your footer to tar your foundation. The advice given on designing a room for a home theater is to avoid parallel walls or else include a sofa and overstuffed chairs to absorb echoes. Other sage advice is to cover your windows to avoid glare. Four full pages are devoted to informing the reader that computers are getting faster and cheaper. Wow! Insightful!

This is basci, but useful material."},{"Title":"BASIC STICK FIGHTING FOR COMBAT","review":"RATING: I give this trilogy of books 1.5 stars overall.1 star for validity, 4 stars for marketing and 5 stars for Echanis service in the U.S. Army as Green Beret, may you RIP.Now back to the review. I am reviewing all three titles in Echanis's series of books.Fist Echanis system of fighting was established and based on Korean Hwarang-Do, which he developed into a somewhat hybrid military hand-to-hand combative. All his methods and techniques are based on this system in all three books.I will start with \\"Knife Self-Defense for Combat\\". This book offers compendium of 35 plus knife defense techniques that entail multiple variations that supposedly provide unlimited possibilities for the combatant. The only possibilities I see are ways to get you killed. I have been studying bladecraft for sometime now and can say that I seriously question the validity of most all these techniques in this book. The majority of the methods are way too complicated to perform under duress and stress. The moves are too long with too many steps to remember and choreographed like it is Kata. Defensive knife moves need to be simple, short and sweet, but deadly effective. Unfortunately these moves are not. Maybe if you have 5-6 hours a day to practice and learn a handful of his moves they may work for you. But for me I would rather use my time more wisely.The second book is \\"Knife Fighting/Knife Throwing for Combat\\". Like the first volume that same echoes here. There are some points of interest to be found in this title, but can be found in better and more up to date works that are available. I have to make it know that a vast majority of the methods in this book are ridiculous. One major and contradiction to knife fighting is the topic of knife throwing, I just do not see the validity in this. If you are using a knife most likely you lost your firearm (malfunction/disarmed), so are you literally going to throw your last line of defense away? This method has no place in combat, maybe Hollywood.The final title is \\"Basic Stick Fighting for Combat\\" which was published after Echanis passed away. It is said he never completed all the text to support this book and if so I do not think it would have made a difference. Like the other titles the moves are just to complex and very limited in there employment. I do think if you are an avid stick fighter you may get some use from this title but for the true combatant they are just too choreographed for any fluid and effective use in combat.Overall this entire series is very poor and would not recommend using most of the moves for defense or combat. With that I do recommend the books for what not to do. They are also useful in the study of the historical evolution of modern combatives. A lot has changed in the art and science of combatives since the late seventies. Ultimately there is always something to be learned whether it is good or bad and knowing the difference may help to keep you alive to fight another day."},{"Title":"BASIC STICK FIGHTING FOR COMBAT","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

Before you get to the phone, a couple of young punks come out of the shadows and want your wallet. Do you have what it takes to survive? When it comes to dealing with real world life and death situations, no one can compare to the late Michael Echanis. This book, part of a series he intended to release, deals with using conventional short and long sticks. Mr. Echanis covers both offensive and defensive tactics. This book gives a brief history of the particular Korean martial art that Michael perfected, and a dedication to his instructor. The rest of the book is profusely illustrated with actual photographs showing the tactics and moves. Michael Echanis was a serious instructer who would often put students in the hospital if they didn't practice what he taught. This same philosophy carries over into his books. Mr. Echanis's philosophy is that when it comes to self defense, nothing works as good as a great offense. No trying to intimidate or bluff your way out of trouble; rather &quot;go for the throat&quot; to cripple or kill your opponent before he does it to you. Not for the faint hearted."},{"Title":"BASIC STICK FIGHTING FOR COMBAT","review":"Basic Stick Fighting for CombatThis is an interesting little book (192 pages) about stick fighting. It was originally written as a training manual for special forces. And, it was an early book on stick fighting. To the best of my knowledge this book was published before Arnis (and other PMA) became popular. The late Michael D. Enhanis was highly trained in the Korean art of Hwa Rang Do and this book represents stick fighting techniques derived from that training.The book covers fighting techniques with four varieties of sticks, basically sticks of various lengths (though there is some overlap in the lengths). First, the Baton with a length range from 18 to 36 inches (the pictures seem to indicate the author uses a baton in the 28-31 inch range). Some techniques would be more difficult with the shorter baton. Second, the Short Stick with a length range from 12 to 30 inches (the pictures seem to indicate the author uses a short stick in the 18-20 inch range). The majority of the techniques presented use double short sticks, though some single short stick techniques are demonstrated. Third, the Bone Breaker is an 11 inch oak stick of 1 inch diameter. This stick was the most interesting to me and the techniques are up close and personal. Fourth, the Cane. The author presents some uses of the cane I had not seen before.The author presents blocks, strikes, and advanced techniques with each length of weapon. The reader will not find much of the \\"entangling\\" techniques of stick fighting present in many of the stick fighting books, though the author does utilize some basic trapping. The techniques all contain some degree of lethality - it was, after all, a special forces training manual. I did feel that some of the techniques bordered on the eccentric. Not all of them seem to me to utilize the best economy of motion. I have no doubt that the author could make these techniques work. I just think I would choose different combinations in some of the sequences for a different rhythm and flow. And, the author writes that each person should do just that.So, the variety of weapons presented is a plus in this book, even if that reduces the total quantity of techniques for any one weapon discussed. The reader will gain a good basic understanding of how these weapons can be used. And the author states that his goal is to provide a basis from which the stick fighter can further research and develop his skills.A side note, the author does discuss in brief the religious and internal aspects of Hwa Rang Do. As well, the \\"code\\" of the Hwa Rang Do warriors is provided. The book gives some brief history of the art and Korea as a whole (I think about 10 pages). It is interesting reading for those who don't already know the information.If you're already into sticking fighting, especially the PMA, this book probably won't hold much for you, except to show you how the Korean approach may differ from the approach you currently use. Particularly interesting was the reverse grip use of the Short Stick. It reminded me a little of the reverse grip use of the Japanese Sai.Anyway, if you're interested in stick fighting, this book will give you some information that you probably won't find in the PMA schools. Give it a read and decide for yourself. Personally, I'll gain from practicing these techniques, particularly the Bone Breaker techniques. I hope you enjoy this book and learn from it what you can."},{"Title":"BASIC STICK FIGHTING FOR COMBAT","review":"This book was one of the first of the post-Vietnam era \\"military martial arts\\" books. It is the third (and last) in a proposed series of nine books presenting Echanis' Special Forces applications of Hwarangdo. The author died while the book was in production, and it shows. The text is not nearly so detailed as in his first two books, and two sections were photographed using other people (one with his instructor, one with one of his training partners). Still, this book sports some excellent combat applications using various lengths of sticks. As in most Ohara books, the photos are of good quality. While many books have dealt with the topic of stick fighting in greater depth since this one was published, this book is a fine addition to the library of anyone who is interested in martial arts for combat."},{"Title":"BASIC STICK FIGHTING FOR COMBAT","review":"Echanis is a Legend in the Martial Arts world and many other Martial Artist are very, very, jealous of him even though he has been dead since 1978.

If I have a book in my library, it's definitely worth owning. One such book is Michael D. Echanis', \\"Basic Stick Fighting for Combat.\\" This book is directly influenced by the Korean martial art of Hwarang Do and its current Grandmaster Joo Bang Lee, who Echanis had studied under before his untimely demise in Nicaragua.This book along with its two companion volumes, \\"Knife Self-Defense for Combat\\" and \\"Knife Fighting, Knife Throwing for Combat,\\" were not initially released to the general public, but instead were only available to certified and recognized self-defense instructors. These books were originally intended to be military training manuals for the various elite units in the United States military. These were units such as the Special Forces, Army Rangers, Navy Seals, etc.This volume, like the other two in this series, starts out with a brief section on the history of Hwarang Do and its relationship to hand-to-hand combat. This is followed by another brief section that looks at the theory and internal dynamics which make up this very impressive art.Introduction:Principles of Stick Fighting:a. Proper GripYour grip should be relaxed yet firm, it should not be really tight like a vise.b. 3 types of strikes1. Thrusting2. Snapping/Shocking3. Whippingc. Visualization and BreathingThis section, although rather brief for my liking, shows you how to use visualization and breath control in order to enhance your skill with the stick. This is effective not only for the stick, but any weapon that you may employ against an attacker.d. Focus of AttackThe focus of your attack will generally be confined to one of five general target areas. They are the top of the head, side of the neck, the wrist, the body, and the leg below and including the knee.e. Vital PointsAlthough this particular section is rather vague, the author does illustrate a drawing of a man with the vital points clearly marked on it.Baton:a. PrinciplesThe author gives you the basic principles that you need to adhere to in order to learn how to use a stick properly and safely during practice and during an actual self-defense encounter.b. Basic Blocks and StrikesThrough the detailed use of photographs and brief yet detailed text, the author takes you through the basic strikes and blocks used when utilizing a baton.c. Combat ApplicationsThrough the detailed use of photographs and a somewhat brief yet detailed section of text, the author and his assistants take you through several different examples of how to use a baton during an armed and also unarmed self-defense encounter.Short Stick or Double Short Stick:a. PrinciplesThe author gives you the basic principles that you need to adhere to in order to learn how to use the double short sticks properly and safely during practice and during an actual self-defense encounter.b. Combat Applications of the Short Stick and Double Short StickThrough the detailed use of photographs and a somewhat brief yet detailed section of text, the author and his assistants take you through several different examples of how to use the double short stick during an armed and also unarmed self-defense encounter.Snapping Short Stick:a.

Combat ApplicationsThrough the detailed use of photographs and a somewhat brief yet detailed section of text, the author and the supreme grandmaster of Hwarang Do, Joo Bang Lee, takes you through several different examples of how to use the cane during an armed and also unarmed self-defense encounter.This book, like the other two in the series, does an exceptional job of explaining the techniques described within through detailed written descriptions and the use of clear and concise photographs and illustrations. The only thing that I would like to have seen a lot more of in this particular manner would have been some close-up shots during various phases of certain techniques."},{"Title":"BASIC STICK FIGHTING FOR COMBAT","review":"Rex Applegate was right when he said the Echanis method was too complicated to be applied, made even worse if one is wearing gear and carrying ammo and weapons.

He was a professional warrior who managed to write several informative texts on various combat methods. This book deals with how to employ the most common of weapons, the stick. This is not a recreational read but rather a book that must be studied to get the most benefit. Chapter one deals with how to best use the standard baton (18 to 36 inch models). Basic blocks and numerous strikes are shown in this section. Chapter two covers sticks between 12 and 16 inches. The use of the snapping short stick is explained in chapter three. The final chapter shows various cane self-defense techniques. As someone involved for more than 45 years in various martial arts and practical combative systems, I found many of the techniques in this text too formalized and complex for the average person seeking a simple and effective stick fighting method. It may be because of the author's back-ground of the Korean art of H Wa Rang do. In conclusion, this book is a fair guide to using various sticks for self-defense, but I personally look at it from more of a historical value. The practical combatives of Rex Applegate and Kelly McCann is much more effective.Rating: 3 stars. Joseph J.

Many consider it the best of the Chan novels--as much for the memorable way in which Biggers renders the Hawaii of the era as for the character and story he offers.The Winterslips are a socially formidable Boston family, the members of which are touched by occasional fits of wanderlust. Several members of the original Boston family, including Dan Winterslip, have settled in Hawaii, and he is visited by cousin Minerva--a woman in her fifties who is so taken with the islands that she prolongs her visit to the length of a year! The Boston family is scandalized, and dispatches Minerva's nephew John to retrieve his aunt. But even as John's ship floats placidly in the harbor, Dan is brutally murdered in his bachelor home.At Minerva's insistence, John takes a hand in the investigation, and comes face to face with the memorable Charlie Chan. Biggers is quite sly in his presentation, for both Minerva and John are shocked to find themselves dealing with a \\"Chinaman.\\" But as the mysterious case progresses they soon find themselves, at times grudgingly, coming to respect him as both police detective and man.Like many of Biggers' novels, the plot is more adventure than actual mystery, but the characters are charming, and his portrait of Hawaii as it trembles between its ancient traditions and the modern world is remarkably effective. It is quite true that the novel is \\"tainted\\" by the common racism of the time, and from time to time Biggers uses terms that are no longer considered acceptable. But for all this, Biggers never shows his ethnic characters in a deliberately unflattering light; they are all part of the swirling Hawaiian society, Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, and WASP, layered together in an exotic array.It is a fun novel, and if taken within its proper context a very innocent one as well, among the most memorable of Biggers' Chan novels and indeed among the most memorable of Biggers' work in general. Quite charming and recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The House Without a Key (Charlie Chan Mystery)","review":"I have read all of the Charlie Chan books, and this is by far the best. All of the novels are literate and well-plotted, but THE HOUSE WITHOUT A KEY is more complex than the others. And the solution to the crime is perhaps one of the most original, yet still plausible, to have been created in the history of the detective novel.A mystery gem. Good to see it back in print."},{"Title":"The House Without a Key (Charlie Chan Mystery)","review":"This book is an excellent example of the polite, pre-Hammett, pre-hard-boiled era of the mystery novel. It's certainly a fun read, but it's the introduction of the Charlie Chan character that gives it a special place in the history of the genre. Chan is certainly an appealing and engaging character, and it's easy to see how such a successful franchise followed. Biggers also makes excellent use of his tropical setting, which along with Chan's presence, makes the reading experience memorable.As usual, the edition itself is beautiful and a great pleasure to own; many thanks to Otto Penzler for more time and money well spent."},{"Title":"The House Without a Key (Charlie Chan Mystery)","review":"He was very fat indeed. Yet he walked with the light dainty steps of a woman. His cheeks were as chubby as a baby's, his skin ivory-tinted, his black hair close-cropped, his amber eyes slanting. -The House Without a KeySo enters Charlie Chan, crack detective of the Honolulu Police Force, in this his first appearance in print. While vacationing in Hawaii in 1919, Earl Derr Biggers read about a local Chinese detective named Chang Apana. Intrigued by the concept, he created Charlie Chan, one of the great fictional detectives in all of literature, and, thanks to the movies, one of the enduring cultural icons of the century. He is, of course, a stereotype, but it's hard to see how he would be objectionable. After all, he's a bright, witty, polite police officer and family man. If anything, I should be offended, the WASP descendants of the Hawaiian missionaries are caricatured as priggish and sanctimonious, but I got over it. It's all done in a spirit of fun and who's to say that the caricatures don't have something to them.The real charm of the book lies in the portrayal of a Hawaii that is now long gone. The islands we see here were still pre-statehood, dominated by the Anglo aristocracy, but with a large and vital Asian community. (Reading this novel, it's easy to see why there was no effort made to inter Hawaii's Japanese population during WWII, as was done in the West Coast states. They were simply too great a percentage of the population to even consider such wholesale civil rights abuses.) And Honolulu was still very much a port city with all of the rowdiness that one would expect with the regular influx of young sailors.At any rate, the mystery involves the murder of the black sheep of a blue blood family and all leads seem to point back towards the dubious circumstances surrounding his clipper ship days in the free booting South Pacific of the 1880's. &quot;Helping&quot; Chan solve the case are the dead man's spinster cousin and his straight laced banker nephew visiting from Boston. Good clean fun is had by all, including the reader.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"The House Without a Key (Charlie Chan Mystery)","review":"You can almost feel the gentle trade winds of Hawaii during the 1920's in this classic novel by Earl Derr Biggers. Romantic and full of atmosphere, this is a most enjoyable read that was our first introduction to Charlie Chan. Biggers was always a great romance writer who simply incorporated mystery into his books to propel the story forward. This was never more evident than in The House Without a Key.The story centers around young and very proper John Quincy Winterslip of Boston, who has been sent to retrieve the elder Minerva Winterslip from the semi-barbaric Pacific Islands of Hawaii. When his ship stops in San Francisco on its journey to the islands, however, John Quincy's idea of who he is begins to change, and the possibility that there is a world outside of Boston and Beacon Hill begins to take shape. A mysterious errand in the city by the bay for the black sheep of the family, Dan Winterslip, also living in Hawaii, will begin an adventure that will in the end make him a man.The murder of Dan Winterslip shortly before John's arrival will reveal old family secrets from a time when Hawaii was wild and dangerous, and a port for all the world. John Quincy does not understand the nostalgia Minerva and others feel for this time in Hawaii's history. But there is romance in those trade winds blowing the cocoa palms. John will meet Carlota Egan, a girl who could not be further away from the fiancee awaiting him back in Boston. But as John Quincy begins to help his lovely cousin Barbara and Minerva get to the bottom of Dan's murder, Boston seems like a distant memory.Luckily for John, Hawaii's best police detective will help him unravel the clues that will lead to an exciting revelation, and in the process become his friend. That detective is Charlie Chan. An Asian who has been in Hawaii many years, Chan navigates the mystery with little to go on, but with much wisdom and humor. The Charlie Chan of The House Without a Key is subtle and endearing. Chan may be Chinese, but his very American take on a piece of pie he is not happy with is a hoot!Biggers truly makes both his characters and the islands of Hawaii come alive in his first novel in which Charlie Chan appeared. His descriptions of Hawaii through the eyes of those characters are nostalgic and filled with beauty. The House Without a Key is that rare novel which can be read with pleasure by both those who love a good mystery, and those who love a light and atmospheric romance. If both are your cup of tea, this great classic is definitely for you. It is a great read during summer, when things are bright and cheery, or during winter, when you want to escape.You can't miss with this one.

Although playing a minor role in the beginning, Charlie asserts himself by the end of the case.John Quincy Winterslip, a young lawyer from Boston, is on a trip to Hawaii to visit a wealthy relative, Dan Winterslip. En route he is asked to find and destroy an ohia wood box which is in the attic of Dan's San Francisco house. He fails to get the box and learns on his arrival in Hawaii that Dan has been murdered. The leading suspect is Jim Egan, owner of a ramshackle hotel on the beach. The essential clue is a wrist watch with an illuminated dial which is damaged. Motivated by his growing interest in Egan's daughter Carlotta, John Quincy helps Charlie and the police solve the crime. The real hero, however, is Charlie who manages to stay one step ahead of everybody else.In 1932 Earl Biggers wrote a report to his Harvard classmates on the occasion of the twenty-fifth reunion of the class of 1907. He described how he happened to conceive of creating an ethnic Chinese detective for a mystery story set in Hawaii:\\"But my memories of the islands were rather dim; I dropped into a library to brightem them a bit by a perusal of recent Honolulu newspapers. In an obscure corner of an inside page, I found an item to the effect that a certain hapless Chinese, being too fond of opium, had been arrested by Sergeants Chang Apana and Lee Fook, of the Honolulu Police.\\"Because of this chance reading of a newspaper item, Biggers was inspired to use Chan in THE HOUSE WITHOUT A KEY which was published in 1925 after running serially in the SATURDAY EVENING POST."},{"Title":"Tablecloth Scribbles","review":"I was so struck by the parts of the book set in Spain!

Needless to say, I found myself captivated by this work, which is an intriguing exercise in untraditional but very well-written meter, rhythm, and vocabulary in contemporary poetry. In addition, Max's (writing as Kevin Max Smith, a last name I understand that he had dropped) themes are clear and his imagery is provocative, and while he doesn't attempt to be too abstract with his work here as most contemporary poets strive to be, he does present very well-written poems with simple messages and well-executed meter.As I have stated, the most interesting aspect of Max's work is by far his exercise in vocabulary and meter. Max is very interested in maintaining traditional meter in most of his poems, bringing to mind, at least rhythmically, the best of Roethke and even Yeats. The poems in particular that demonstrate this talent are the excellent \\"Queen of the Nile,\\" \\"Draw Nigh,\\" and \\"Awake at Night.\\" While these poems are never quite in perfect iambic pentameter, Max clearly knows his poetic devices and uses them effectively, creating his own interesting rhythms within the meter. Even in poems which are free-verse in nature, Max successfully keeps a steady rhythm throughout and displays some creative usage of assonance and particularly alliteration (a good example of both can be found in \\"My Reoccurring Desert Dream,\\" \\"Vanity,\\" and \\"Wilt Thou?\\"). I would say that this book must be best read aloud to appreciate Max's unique rhythm to its fullest potential (as all good poetry should be).In addition, Max clearly engages in a breathtaking love affair with word play which is often so clever that the reader will only catch it after several reads. Take the poem \\"Jordan's Kiss and Then Some,\\" in which Max cuts the word \\"Mother\\" in half at the end of a line, so that the word reads \\"Moth-/er.\\" Here, we are given a clear description of this \\"mother.\\" By simply cutting the word and emphasizing \\"moth,\\" the reader understands the motivations and characteristics of this particular character. There are many little details thrown into this book similar to this example, and in addition, Max's vocabulary includes words I never thought could fit into a poem as well as he utilizes them. Words like \\"retroaction,\\" \\"placation,\\" and \\"kamikaze\\" somehow manage to find themselves seamlessly placed into Max's poems, and they manage to maintain both meter and rhythm. Who knew? Evidently, Max did.Thematically, \\"At the Foot of Heaven\\" is a little more under whelming, but this doesn't make them at all disappointing. Clearly, this book is an exercise in meter and form, so if the themes and images are a bit simplistic, that is only because they were intended to be. Max's poems are not particularly long, but they all serve as interesting and complete thoughts unto themselves. He conjures up some fascinating images (\\"Tonight I wish to touch the stars./ To swing the moon in my cradle/ To pull the sky around my neck\\") but none of these images cast any question as to what direction he is going with them. Occasionally, Max finds himself with lines a little too simplistic in nature (i.e. \\"I would count ever speck of sand/ every bit of stardust to be with you\\"), but for the most part, he simply concerns himself with creating simple messages of love, faith, and humanity (indeed, the book is divided into sections with these titles) using extremely well-crafted poetic lines and some provocative, if obvious, metaphors and similes.I must also note the fascinating layout of the book, which is actually a collaborative effort which an abstract painter named Jimmy Abegg, who I haven't heard of before or since. Mr. Abegg has a truly gifted eye for color and striking images, and his work compliments Max's tremendously. If for no other reason, this book is worth owning for Abegg's wonderful paintings. In addition, Max continues to exercise creativity in form often in fonts that he uses for many of his poems. Some of the fonts are so large that single words will overlap one another fill up entire lines. The result makes particular poems literally leap off of the page, in a creative approach that I have not seen before. Neither Max or Abegg are afraid to push boundaries in this book, and the creativity pays off.A fellow student who is not an English major but who loves this book hit the nail on the head regarding its significance better than anything I could add: Max's fascinating use of form and simple messages very effectively bridge the gab between the literary world and the everyman who is not necessarily interested in reading poetry. Whereas this individual shied away from poetry in general, finding it too intimidating, this book, in its creativity and simplicity, made him want to take a second look at the literary world of poets. As the wonderful world of poetry seems to have lost its impact in America in this modern world (and most contemporary poets are starving), and that its appeal seems limited to English classrooms, such a statement pays Max the highest compliment imaginable. Indeed, after reading \\"At the Foot of Heaven,\\" I am convinced that his unique style makes him one of the most gifted and promising contemporary poets currently writing in America. Keep an eye out for this guy."},{"Title":"At the Foot of Heaven Signed 1ST Edition","review":"Kevin Max is a gifted writer, his poems are brilliant and intriguing.

He mentions in the two previous volumes of Modern Painters that there were two sources of pleasure for art lovers. The first source lay in the observer's enjoyment in viewing the simple resemblance of the art object to its original model in nature. The second source was the actual pleasure taken in the contemplation of the painted object. There was a third source which functioned as a link between the first two--the relation of the meaning of the painted object to the object itself. Ruskin wishes to use these various sources of pleasure to isolate those traits that mark some artists as great and others as mediocre.Ruskin admits that there are various unavoidable difficulties in setting up a systematic approach whose purpose it would be to accomplish his goal; instead, he suggests that his careful arrangement of chapters in Modern Painters will make the answer readily apparent.He is quick to point out that the greatest art includes the greatest ideas, but he is still left with the central question of some basic definitions: \\"What is it that makes one truth greater than another, one thought greater than another?\\" The answer, he states, may rest in the historical division between the Great Art School of Theory and the Low Art School of Theory. The former connotes \\"a certain noble manner of painting, which it was desirable that all students of Art should be early led to reverence and adopt.\\" By contrast, the latter is synonymous with \\"vulgar, low, or realist,\\" which in terms of painting and conceiving \\"was equally necessary that all students should be taught to avoid.\\" One obvious flaw to Ruskin was the inherent limits of such a twin level categorization. Those who call themselves \\"high\\" are often ridiculed for their pretentiousness. Then there are artists who claim not to be in either camp as their stated goals relate to entirely unrelated affairs like strength, health, and humbleness.Before Ruskin can even begin to list the qualities that one may deem requisite for inclusion as High Art, he first asks whether it truly exists at all or is no more than an agreed on fiction that makes its practitioners feel high and mighty about themselves. Rather than devising his own rationale for the existence of the term, he turns to the noted writer/critic of the Augustan Age, Sir Joshua Reynolds for help. Reynolds had written various essays for Johnson's The Idler which dealt with this very topic. In The Idler # 79, Reynolds compares the Dutch with the Italian painters. The former he classifies as the \\"low\\" while the latter as the \\"high.\\" The Dutch are low due to their excelling as mechanical imitators \\"in which the slowest intellect is sure to succeed best.\\" The Italians are high because their art is a visual representation of their imaginative poetry and it is this which gives them the claim to superiority.Though Ruskin accepts Reynolds' claim about the Italians, he nevertheless feels constrained to point out what he sees as flaws in his methodology. Reynolds interprets a \\"slow\\" intellect as a pejorative; Ruskin grants that \\"slow\\" might just as easily and laudably be seen as worthwhile restraint. Further, Reynolds notes with obvious approval how exactly the Dutch copy an object from nature onto a canvas. This method of faithfully rendering such an object is termed typical of the \\"historical\\" school of art. The Italians, with their poetic renderings, are linked with the \\"poetical\\" school.\\" Paradoxically, the artists of the poetical school use accurate reproduction of object from nature to canvas at least as often as do those of the historical school. Thus, Reynolds' conclusion falls flat, leaving Ruskin back to square one.Ruskin tries a different tack to clarify the relation that art has to the observer of that art. He now asks rhetorically: \\"What is poetry?\\" His conclusion is that poetry is \\"the suggestion, by the imagination, of noble grounds for the noble emotions.\\" He adds that these emotions are the \\"four principal sacred passions: Love, Veneration, Admiration, and Joy.\\" These sacred passions have their contraries: \\"Hatred, Scorn, Horror, and Grief.\\" Poetry, then, is the mixing of these into their various combinations, which emerge as \\"poetical feeling.\\" Yet, these feelings by themselves do not constitute poetry. What is needed to complete the equation is that they must be felt on noble grounds, which he helpfully adds as being \\"true\\" or \\"great.\\" The firing of gunpowder, for example, would not be \\"great\\" but the budding of a flower would be so. Once the reader reads a poem that has the needed emotions, has a true ground, then that reader needs to interact with that poem via the active use of his imagination to transform the verbal prompts on the page into indelible images in his head. When that reader notes the accumulation of delicate details, then he will perceive an affecting result, which most critics call the \\"power\\" of poetry to move men.Despite Ruskin's lengthy digression on poetry, he adds that \\"Painting is properly to be opposed to speaking or writing but not to poetry. Both painting and speaking are methods of expression. Poetry is the employment of either for the noblest purposes.\\" This frank admission does not necessarily return Ruskin to square one. He does see a link between the sister arts: \\"We gather three important indications of the supposed nature of the Great Style. That it is the work of men in a state of enthusiasm. That it is like the writing of Homer; and that it has as little as possible of \`common nature' in it.\\"The first requirement is fairly obvious. Ruskin requires that the artist \\"feel strongly and nobly.\\" The concept of \\"nobly\\" disqualifies such base passions as envy, jealousy, or rank ambition. The second is less obvious due to the vagueness of \\"common nature.\\" Though Homer often writes of \\"common\\" things in the Iliad and the Odyssey--shields, cups, sandals and the like--there is little that is common in the passions of the verse. So as Homer used the common and small minutia of a warrior's daily routine to point that warrior toward greater things, so must the painter with his visually reproduced common and small items.In Modern Painters, Ruskin also considers the role that the mind plays regarding the relation between the mind viewing external reality as either subjective or objective.John Ruskin begins by distinguishing between \\"objective\\" and \\"subjective.\\" The former he defines as the \\"qualities of things which they always have, irrespective of any other nature, as roundness or squareness.\\" The latter refers to \\"the qualities of things which thus depend upon our perception of them, and upon our human nature as affected by them.\\" From this he considers which of the two terms has the greater impact on our lives. He facetiously mentions philosophers who may deny the latent power to destroy that inheres within gunpowder even as that gunpowder proves otherwise. Ruskin does not like either term since both have meanings which vary from person to person and context to context. For \\"subjective,\\" one might easily use \\"It seems to me.\\" And for objective, one can say \\"It is so.\\"From what seems so to what is so, Ruskin suggests that one's state of mind may account for the perception of either. Those who are under the stress of exaggerated emotion may easily confuse the two. Such emotion need not be limited to the type involved in life-threatening situations. The simple act of reading a poem may induce the reader to read those lines in a deliberately and artfully heightened emotion. The reader knows that the lines are literally untrue but cares not due to the pleasure they bring. The \\"fallacy\\" lies in one's knowing the poem's unreal base but wishes to continue reading of his own accord even though that accord is not totally his own. Ruskin quotes two lines from the poet Kingsley:\\"They rowed her across the rolling foamThe cruel, crawling foam.\\"Ruskin writes that \\"The foam is not cruel, neither does it crawl.\\" The poetic power of these lines lie in their ability to inject sufficient grief in the mind of the reader to suspend, however temporarily, that reader's ability to recognize the impossibility involved. Ruskin terms this ability to produce a heightened and false awareness as the pathetic fallacy.Ruskin admits that all poets use this fallacy to varying extents, though only those of the first rank can make the resultant passion flow naturally and smoothly from a subjective reading to an objective acceptance. He provides an example of the improper use of the pathetic fallacy from Coleridge:\\"The one red leaf, the last of its clan,That dances as often as dance it can.\\"Ruskin accuses Coleridge of fancying that the poem has \\"a life to it, and will, which there are not; confuses its powerlessness with choice, its fading death with merriment, and the wind that shakes it with music.\\"For execrable lines like these, the problem is that the fallacy is not pathetic at all. The poet has unwisely chosen to mix mutually exclusive emotions that jar the reader with their widely varying polarities rather than seduce the reader with their evolving harmonies. If the erring poet writes plodding lines like this, then if the reader accepts their plodding as a smooth segue from objectivity to subjectivity, then this reader is far more at fault than the poet. Ruskin portrays such readers as having \\"a mind and body in some sort too weak to deal fully with what is before them or upon them.\\" Contrariwise, for those readers who recognize the clangor of clashing emotions when they see them, Ruskin has only the highest praise. Based on those who accept or reject the wrongful use of the pathetic fallacy, Ruskin sees three ranks: The first is \\"the man who perceives rightly because he does not feel and to whom the primrose is very accurately the primrose because he does not love it.\\" The second is \\"the man who perceives wrongly because he feels and to whom the primrose is anything else than a primrose.\\" The third is \\"the man who perceives rightly in spite of his feelings and to whom the primrose is forever nothing else than itself.\\" This man is untouched by the associations that may crowd around the lines. Rather inexplicably, Ruskin adds a fourth category, \\"the men who, strong as human creatures can be, are yet submitted to influences stronger than they, and see in a sort untruly because what they see is inconceivably above them.\\"The difference between poets of the first rank and those of the second rank is that the former can pick and choose their temporary movement from objectivity to subjectivity while the latter make this journey with a too frequent wild abandon. First rank poets have a steady and sure command in their use of the pathetic fallacy. They can evoke the acuteness of sincere feeling engendered while simultaneously being able to command the tropes to do so. Paradoxically, second rank poets misuse their ability to write well to deceive the reader into accepting a simulacrum of genuine feeling. For such poets, Ruskin has only the deepest of scorn."},{"Title":"Modern painters","review":"This is a classic text, but unfortunately this edition is a poorly-made facsimile of an unsourced original.

Of course no one is as they seem, and all the beautiful ladies fall in love with Marlowe. Thankfully there are only about a dozen characters in total to keep track of, and Chandler gives his Marlowe character some of the best (and rudest) one-liners I've ever read. Believable?

Marlowe tries futilely to reunite a scattered family: a dead blackmailer, a rising movie star and a girl named Orfamay Quest. In sorting out the mystery, Marlowe gets involved with picture people, including a powerful agent, a half-senile studio head and the muscle the studios call out to deal with blackmailers. Some of them have ice picks sticking out of their necks. And of course, he has to take care of those corrupt small-town cops from Bay City.From the first words of the Little Sister you immediately get into that typical film noir mood. The way Chandler describes the shabby office of Philip Marlowe gets you really going. You breathe and smell the decadence of the 1940's and know that you have to get ready for a rollercoaster ride through many intrigues. With the hand of the master Chandler weaves all the evidence into a complex web and keeps you on edge to find the solution. But be prepared, the plot is getting complex very fast and the denouement might come as a total surprise if you do not watch out very carefully. But then again, the real joy of the novel is not in trying to figure out who is who, and who did what, but in the way Chandler lets the mystery unfold.By the time Raymond Chandler wrote The Little Sister, he had written several screenplays for Hollywood pictures. He did not earn that much money by writing books, so he needed the dough he was offered by the Tinseltown people. This does not mean that he enjoyed this very much. There is plenty of cynicism directed towards Hollywood. It seems as if The Little Sister is some kind of getting even with how Chandler was treated by the major film bosses."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"I liked the female character (the little sis) ... reminds me of Maltese Falcon.

One of my favorite scenes is the old studio owner with his dogs in the courtyard. Why is Marlowe so often doped up by corrupt doctors? All in all, this just trails FAREWELL MY LOVELY as my favorite Chandler."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"There are lots of wonderful adjectives that can be used to describe Raymond Chandler, but \\"prolific\\" is not one of them. Like his literary predecessor, Dashiell Hammett, Chandler didn't publish many books in his career, especially compared to some of his pulpier successors: authors like Donald Westlake, Lawrence Block and John D. MacDonald would turn out multiple books in a year, but Chandler would publish only once every few years.As much as I like Westlake, Block and MacDonald, however, I can see the merits of Chandler taking his time: his books are very well-written. Even The Little Sister, which I personally find to be one of his weaker efforts, is still very good, merely not quite the measure of his true classics.This novel opens with the title character, Orfamay Quest, hiring private eye Philip Marlowe, to locate her older brother, Orrin. Both the Quests hail from a small town in Kansas. Orrin has apparently disappeared in the big city of Los Angeles, and Orfamay wants him found. Superficially, Orfamay is a mousy prude, but Marlowe can see that is just a facade.More out of pity and boredom than any sense of financial gain (Orfamay has virtually no money to pay), Marlowe takes the case, and soon, the dead bodies are piling up. It all has to do with a mobster, a blackmail scheme and, in the center of it all, an up-and-coming movie actress.As usual, Chandler's writing is almost perfect, but there was something in this particular plot that didn't grab me as much as his other stories. By no means is this a negative review, however: even decades after this book was written, it still tops most of the mysteries coming out today. That is why the Marlowe books are classics and why Chandler is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"If you like Raymond Chandler's Marlowe, you'll love this one. In this novel, Marlowe is, as always, dealing with the seedy underside of LA; with Hollywood starlets and wannabe's, dead bodies at every turn, gangsters, and the almost obligatory shady doctor keeping the pace fast and the story captivating. Hard, gritty, twisting and turning in the classic Chandler style. A Marlowe-must-read."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"For an author whose novels have been faithfully and successfully adapted by Hollywood, Raymond Chandler...well...hated Hollywood.Already an established crime novelist, Chandler entered the film industry as a screenwriter to work with Billy Wilder on the 1944 drama 'Double Indemnity,' which earned both men an Oscar nomination. By the time Chandler's stay in Hollywood ended, he published a widely-read article in the Atlantic that decried producers' 'exploitation' of scribes and had a permanent falling out with Alfred Hitchcock over 'Strangers on a Train.''The Little Sister,' published in 1949, is an anti-Hollywood novel fueled by Chandler's dealings with the studio system. Little surprise that it was only adapted for television during his lifetime and not touched by the film industry until Paul Bogart directed an updated version, 'Marlowe' with James Garner, in 1969. Chandler could not have made new friends in Tinseltown with this angry, aggressive novel that shows Philip Marlowe at his most bitter and the author at some of his truly best.Six years had passed since Chandler released his previous Marlowe novel, 'The Lady in the Lake,' in 1943. 'The Little Sister' is his first novel set in the post-war era, which seems to have increased his - and consequently Marlowe's - irritation towards the United States as a military and economic superpower. Now 38, Marlowe laments the disappearance of 'old' Los Angeles when economic growth and urban sprawl changed the city's atmosphere and the attitudes of its people. Neither is his job getting any easier, by the way, and his assignment in 'The Little Sister' is his most bizarre yet.The story is centered on Orfamay Quest, a petite, childlike woman from Kansas who is trying to locate her brother, the employee of a California engineering company. Marlowe is immediately sucked into Chandler's plot maze, stumbling upon two murders just after they happen. He even runs afoul of the police, who place him under threat of arrest for suppressing evidence. Connections from the Los Angeles underworld lead him to an emerging Hollywood actress and the crude individuals she's surrounded by, who prove a wild experience in themselves.'The Little Sister,' though with plenty of Marlowe humor, is a novel that will leave you feeling grim and a tad debauched. None of the characters Marlowe deals with are the least likeable and each person has a certain repulsive quality, coming across as a deadbeat, slut, or junkie. Even Marlowe falls into transgression when he crosses paths with good-looking and manipulative women, which creates more than enough problems for him when crime-solving.Chandler's novel has a certain rawness that is not common to his other work and it's all the better for it. I found it far better made than 'The Lady in the Lake,' which only shows traces of what makes Chandler a great author. 'The Little Sister' has rounder characters and an airtight plot whose ending, while over the top, brings everything neatly to a close and left me completely satisfied. Though Marlowe does not visit unusual locations as in the previous novel, Chandler places the action in Los Angeles and Bay City (really Santa Monica) with eye-catching detail. You could almost smell the air freshener of expensive Hollywood suites and the mildew and stale booze of a run-down boarding house.Though Chandler's novel was not a great success in bookstores and never adapted to film in his lifetime, 'The Little Sister' now enjoys critical praise. It's perhaps not as stellar as 'The Big Sleep,' 'Farewell, My Lovely,' or 'The Long Goodbye,' but it belongs at least on the next-to-highest tier of his output. While he could have spent more time depicting Hollywood and his wonderfully fluid writing (as usual) is sometimes too loose to the point of being long-winded or stilted, 'The Little Sister' is still one of the best-written crime novels in English. Anyone with a stomach for shady people, seedy locations, and a touch of blood should be impressed by what Chandler pulls off.Black Lizard, the crime label of Vintage Books, has done an exceptional job in rereleasing Chandler's novels, but there seems to be an unusual number of typos that were not fixed up before the 1988 edition of 'The Little Sister' went to press. The 250-page volume is in Black Lizard's sleek format with Deco fonts and trim. Unfortunately, there were several instances where a word was misspelled and at least two cases where a word was omitted. Since Vintage has been exceptionally accurate in the other Marlowe novels, these mistakes jump off the page. This was hopefully corrected in later printings that are up to Vintage's established standard."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"This was sixty years ago. And already Marlowe is grieving for a Los Angeles only twenty years earlier than that one. The signs of the one to come were all there. But oh, what we would give to have back the L.A. of 1949.The whole United States of 1949. Except of course for some of us.Still, even for those for whom one might say it is better now, it is still really not nearly good enough.This book is a sad book, but a very good one. Marlowe is a beautiful and perfect example of exactly what a good person is in a very confusing and corrupt environment, which makes it a helpful read for anyone running around today.Sort of what Kipling was talking about in his poem \\"If.\\"And Marlowe does mourn the passing of all that is good about our society and our country. He sees the good parts that are going away and the bad that is yet to come.He is a man in mourning, a man in grief, seemingly much older than the character is supposed to be in years.But in those days people did not expect to be running in marathons in their sixties. Life was seen as short. Something which passes. Youth was seen as something which passes. Very quickly. Middle age was defined differently then.We cannot run and run forever. And there can be no such thing as unlimited growth.Marlowe was a painting of a person living generously. An ideal."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Some years ago I galloped through whatI thought were all Raymond Chandler's novels. Somehow this one eluded me. I think I probably came to them through the various film dramatisations, none of which really did the books justice. They all seemed to be far too 'clean' for a hero who usually had to rise up through the sleeze to triumph before sinking back to wait for the next case.Perhaps a modern 'noir' director would take a shot at this book, redolent as it is with late 50s atmospherics - 'retro' being so fashionable. Rather than regale readers with plot and counter plot I simply say that if you love Chandler and had missed this one, grab it, because once you do it will grab you. I loved it so much I reordered a brand new copy to keep on my shelf. I think what I should do is take it out and ruffle it, let coffee stain a few pages and sprinkle some cigarette ash on others, just to give it the world weary feel that Chandler gave Marlowe, who was anything but pristine."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Having read The Big Sleep, Farewell My Lovely, The High Window, and The Lady in the Lake in quick succession, I found The Little Sister stands at number 4 of 5 in entertainment value. It just isn't one of the more compelling. Marlowe is still terrific, but the plot doesn't stoke the fire.An idiosyncratic young woman travels from Kansas to locate a missing brother in LA. Things progress when it is discovered that the siblings have an actress sister as well. There's murder (with ice picks!), drugs, and plenty of skullduggery, but one just doesn't get the immersive 40's-era LA experience that other Chandler novels afford.Period and place are essential to the full enjoyment of Chandler's novels. It is both the grist for, and the reflection of, film noir. For me, The Little Sister lacked this certain quality. Perhaps, it was too insular with its small town hoods and small time actresses, but the most likely explanation is it just didn't measure up.If this is your first Marlowe novel, perhaps you feel differently. Keep reading. There is so much more in store. 4 stars."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Before reading this book, make sure you have a large blackboard and plenty of chalk. At least half a dozen different colors. Because that's what you'll need to diagram out the plot of The Little Sister. Keeping straight who's who and who did what to whom and why will give you plenty to do as you read and reread the pages of this Philip Marlowe mystery. Now I know what you're going to say. With Raymond Chandler, it's not about the story, it's about atmosphere. True enough. But I still have to believe that the reader's enjoyment is greatly enhanced if the writer has provided a coherent plot as a framework for displaying literary dexterity. In other words, the story itself isn't all important, but it is somewhat important.As I see it, there are no less than four ways to view this novel.The first way is as a murder mystery. A young woman from Manhattan (Manhattan, Kansas that is) hires Marlowe to find her missing brother. His subsequent search does eventually locate the young man but not before a drunk and a grifter are both murdered with an ice pick to the vicinity of the medulla oblongata. What is the motive behind these grotesque slayings? The motive is the urgent need to find a particular photograph. A photograph that shows two people sitting down to dinner in a restaurant. I'm not kidding.The second way to view The Little Sister is as an affectionate sendup of noir crime writing in general and Dashiell Hammett's Maltese Falcon in particular. This might explain why the complications are endless and so very difficult to follow. Perhaps Chandler felt the need to exaggerate the number and degree of plot twists in order to make a satiric point.Thirdly, The Little Sister is a withering look at Hollywood and the recognizable types who dwell within. Second rate actors, self important talent agents, ambitious starlets, jaded actresses and befuddled studio heads are all lampooned to one degree or another here. I found this aspect of the book to be highly entertaining and would have liked to have seen it emphasized even more.And lastly, this book can be taken as a view into the mind of a man slowly losing his grip. This Marlowe is world weary, tired. He's lonely and exasperated. Chandler has Marlowe questioning his own sanity for continuing to pursue his chosen profession.Marlowe's investigation takes him to many places in and near Los Angeles. A seedy hotel, a rundown boarding house, the police station, and a working movie set to name only a few. Chandler brilliantly describes all locales with an amount of detail that serves to set the exact mood he wants to convey. Marlowe's steady output of cynical quips, some spoken, others only thought, are first rate and at times absolutely priceless. It is a tribute to Chandler's originality, as well as his keen wit, that readers never tire of this ongoing patter.The Little Sister has a lot to recommend it. I just don't think one should have to work so hard to be able to follow a storyline. And oh yes, be sure to read The Maltese Falcon first."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Having read every other \\"Marlow\\" novel, I figured that this would follow the pattern established by the previous stories, each one being better than the last. Unfortunately, this one dropped the ball. I wish I could say why - all the usual ingredients are there from seductive women brandishing sex to dangerous mobsters and other assorted degenerates brandishing guns, ice picks and dodgy cigarettes. The accustomed hazards of a private eye!But... this time it never seems to catch fire. The traditional Marlow observations and asides. The chess like dialogue. The characters oozing deceit and human frailty. It's still there, but it's kinda got all formulaic. A sort of writing by numbers. Chanlder was by this time famous, well off and held in some esteem, so perhaps he had lost his early enthusiasm and drive. I don't know, but it certainly seems that way.The plot itself starts out tired and, like some of the hapless people in the book, eventually turns up DOA. Again, all the ingredients are there but the recipe is off. Hollywood, starlets, The Mob, bent cops - perhaps it's just too easy a target. It's complex, as one would expect from Chandler, but about two thirds the way through, the author seems to stop bothering to explain (even in a general manner) how we got where we are and loose interest in the narrative. And so did I.Never mind, I have ordered The Long Goodbye and that seems to get glowing reviews, so perhaps this was just a bit of an aberration. Please don't be put off trying the other Marlow stories, or even this one. At his worst, Chandler is still head and shoulders above 99% of other detective writers."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"&quot;The Little Sister&quot; was my introduction to Raymond Chandler and his immortal private detective, Philip Marlowe. I opened it up for the first time four years ago and have read it twice more since then.I had never read a hard-boiled mystery before, and &quot;The Little Sister&quot; exceeded my expectations. The punchy dialogue, the terrific characters, Chandler's trademark similies, Marlowe's toughness interlaced with a penchant for justice, the contemporary view into the Hollywood of the late 1940's. &quot;The Little Sister&quot; electrified me and sparked an insatiable appetite for more Chandler. I read his remaining novels in rapid succession, always buying the next one before reaching the end of the novel at hand so I could immediately plunged back into Marlowe's long-vanished world.I have since read all of Chandler's novels and short stories, and &quot;The Little Sister&quot; still remains my favorite, closely followed by &quot;Farewell, My Lovely.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"THE LITTLE SISTER is terrific mystery that concludes with a gruesome incident of sudden (albeit implausible) poetic justice. By my count, TLS has five murders and a suicide, with Philip Marlowe a step too slow to prevent any crime but way ahead of the cops (and this reader) as he identifies the perps and unravels their interlaced motives.There are lots of standard Raymond Chandler elements in TLS, including gangsters, devious deadly dames, and a film-noir Los Angeles. But in contrast to other Chandler novels I've read, there seems to be even less effort to elucidate the sour integrity of the lonely Marlowe. Since this is the fifth novel in the series, Chandler probably felt such explication would add little to, and might actually detract from, his spare and disciplined style. On the other hand, Chandler tells us more about the movie business in TLS and his dialogue is never better. Among my marginalia is: \\"Conversation as combat.\\"In TLS, it's the cops that bring out the best in Ray. When they're on the page, Chandler's wonderful metaphors seem sharpest, his skillful screen writer's dialogue carries the most freight, and his rhetoric absolutely soars. Here's Chandler letting loose, as Lieutenant Christy French berates Marlowe:\\"It's like this with us, baby. We're coppers and everybody hates our guts. And as if we didn't have enough trouble, we have to have you. As if we didn't get pushed around enough by the guys in the corner offices, the City Hall gang, the day chief, the night chief, the Chamber of Commerce, His Honor the Mayor. ...We spend our lives turning over dirty underwear and sniffing rotten teeth. We go up dark stairways to get a gun punk with a skinful of hop and sometimes we don't get all the way up, and our wives wait dinner that night and all the other nights. We don't come home anymore. And nights we do come home, we come home so [expletive] tired, we can't eat or sleep or even read the lies the papers print about us. So we lie awake at night in a cheap house on a cheap street...\\"Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"This is classic Marlowe. Perhaps one of the lesser works.

But she ain't no Dorothy and the plot thickens from there. There is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly as we get a glance at the seedy side of those above-mentioned mean streets of Los Angeles. More so than earlier Marlowe adventures Chandler here gives his take on the changes in his former quiet little town of L.A. as a result of the double infusion of Hollywood hyp and war production during World War II. The gangsters naturally followed the money and the fame. Oh, and maybe they just came for the sun.Marlowe is older and 'wiser' here but he still has that funny habit of tilting after windmills. He is at the beginning of a 'mid-life' crisis in this story. But what is a guy to do when there is a Hollywood movie star damsel in distress to rescue and the frame is on. And little Ms. Kansas is there to gum up the works. Besides he has cut a couple of corners in his pursuit of justice and the cops are mad. Damn, you know he has got to square things up. How does this this work compare with the other Marlowe volumes? Give me those background oil derricks churning out the Stearnwood wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day.

I found and reported 31 errors, most of which are not in the paperback edition. The e-book edition is loaded with typos, formatting mistakes, and even two passages with a number of missing words. In short: this book is a mess.Amazon's response to my complaint was prompt and appropriate. I received a phone call and two e-mail messages from an Amazon representative. He informed me that the book had been \\"pulled for review,\\" and he assured me that I will be notified when a corrected edition is available. I was also offered a promotional credit to compensate me for the poor quality of this book.This was my first Kindle book, and it has seriously dampened my enthusiasm for purchasing any more e-books or a Kindle reader. Many of the errors in the book are directly attributable to the scanning and OCR process (for example, \\"lips\\" ---> \\"ups\\" and \\"comer\\" ---> \\"corner\\"). Obviously the e-book was not checked for errors after scanning.

There are the usual jerk cops and wicked women, but we've seen them all before in Chandler's novels. What's somewhat new is the truly corrosive and bitter tone, and that gets pretty tiring. Some of the writing is excellent--Chandler was a wonderful writer, but there just is no good plot and interesting characters to hang the plot on (and the caricatured Latina actress is dreadful, though she eventually is somewhat explained), so we're just left with a sour aftertaste. And I couldn't believe it when Marlowe accepted the drugged cigarette from the shady doctor. If Marlowe's that dumb after all those years, he deserves all the sappings he gets! He should have known not to accept treats from shady doctors by this time.New Chandler readers should try his masterpiece, Farewell, My Lovely, or the intricately yet cleanly and cleverly-plotted (and underrated) The Lady in the Lake."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Postwar L.A. -- and especially Hollywood -- is the setting for Chandler's fifth Marlowe novel which, like the time and place (and the author himself), is a little &quot;off.&quot; Marlowe's beginning to tire, his loneliness is a bit more apparent, and the disillusionment has started to etch permanent lines on him.None of which stops him. Neither does it make &quot;The Little Sister&quot; a bad work. In fact, it holds up remarkably well alongside Chandler's first four novels.Chandler draws upon contemporary events and personages for much of his inspiration here (something he did in several earlier stories and novels, to a lesser degree); the photo which triggers the action in &quot;Sister,&quot; for example, is based on an incident involving gangster Bugsy Siegel . . . but then the character of Steelgrave, himself, bears a more than passing resemblance to the then-recently deceased hood. It's equally evident that Chandler relied upon his recent screenwriting experience (and exposure to Paramount and Universal studios) for material and characters. There's an element of gleeful revenge, I suspect, for example, in the character of agent Sheridan Ballou: certain characteristics, such as his tendency to strut up and down his office twirling a mallaca cane, can only have been inspired by director/screenwriter Billy Wilder (with whom Chandler, collaborating on the screenplay for &quot;Double Indemnity,&quot; shared an entirely mutual loathing).Other characters, primarily a pair of mismatched thugs sent to intimidate Marlowe, are pure burlesque; Chandler appears to be simply indulging himself here (while he simultaneously manages yet another dig at the movie industry). But then, in scenes such as a Bay City boarding house or -- even more on point -- a mood-laden confrontation in a doctor's office (&quot;Things are waiting to happen.&quot;) -- Chandler emerges as still the master at stretching tension beyond its breaking point.There's also that memorable passage when Marlowe takes a latenight drive over Cahuenga Pass (&quot;Easy, Marlowe, you're not human tonight.&quot;), in which Chandler shows himself unmatched at juxtaposing mood and movement and thought, particularly when he wants to advance the plotline and divulge his protagonist's mindset without appearing to do so. This, for me, has always been Chandler's greatest skill: the ability to achieve art without letting himself get caught at it.But is &quot;The Little Sister&quot; Chandler's best? Not close.But Chandler still delivers. As does Marlowe."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"The latest in a long series of visits to LA had me refreshing my memory of one of my favourite novelists. As a young man I knew the Philip Marlowe books nearly by heart before I ever set foot in the city they put on the literary map. I have always thought that Chandler counts as literature not just as crime fiction. He was a professed admirer of the ultra-craftsman Flaubert, and it shows in the way he works at every sentence, indeed every word. He was English and as far as I know unrelated to the 'real' LA Chandlers (he attended the same school as P G Wodehouse, if you can believe it). He maintained that 'the American language' can say anything and in The Simple Art of Murder he took a brilliant potshot at the Agatha Christie school of English crime fiction , all tight-lipped butlers polishing the georgian silver and respectful upper-middles gathered to hear the amateur master-sleuth analyse over 5 or 6 pages which of them dunnit. His power of creating atmosphere is phenomenal, his dialogue is legendary, and for me The Little Sister is the best of the 7 Marlowes. It's at the crest of the hill, before he started to lose concentration in The Long Goodbye and lost just about everything in the sad Playback. I can still feel the heavy heat at the start of the book, and the dialogue is the best he ever did. Is there any other instance of anyone silencing Marlowe with an answer the way the beat-up hotel dick does when Marlowe tells him he is going up to room such-and-such and the hotel dick says 'Am I stopping you?'. And I cherish the bit about the same character tucking his gun into his waistband 'in an emergency he could probably have got it out in less than a minute'. I can't even yet follow the plot, but actually I have never been able to follow any Chandler plot, though I suspect the author himself lost his way in this one. It's maybe the first sign of the decline that set in next -- Marlowe is beginning to feel old and tired and he is probably speaking for more than himself. The plot is really neither here nor there. The only fully developed character is Marlowe himself, but Mavis Weld comes over well, the little sister herself is a memorable grotesque and see what you make of Dolores Gonzalez. The other major character is Los Angeles itself, which fascinates me as it obviously fascinated its adopted son Chandler. Half a century and more on from the time of writing I can still get the feel of Chandler's LA."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Everyone, one way or another. Everyone except maybe Marlowe.This isn't one of Chandler's better-known stories; as far as I know, it was never made into a movie. Maybe it's just a little too complex for a movie.

She needs to find her brother, a small-town boy who's lost his way in the big bad city.She's not quite what she claims to be, though, and the brother isn't what he should have been. As the story progresses, Hollywood and all the people in it lose their shine, and get darker and dirtier.

The characters in this book start off well, but become more cartoonish as the story moves along.In my opinion, there is no terrible Raymond Chandler book, but this does come close.

Dialogue segues are sloppy, words are missing -- this from the first Vintage book edition, 1988.

Around this time, Hollywood had come knocking. Chandler co-wrote the screeplay for \\"Double Indemnity\\" with Billy Wilder, and the first Marlowe novel \\"The Big Sleep\\" was made into a classic motion picture starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The money came rolling in: Chandler and his wife Cissy moved into a luxurious house in L.A.'s ritzy Pacific Palisades section. The Hollywood temptation came as well: Chandler began an affair with a secretary at Paramount Pictures and his chronic alcoholism--which was already bad--began to worsen.In addition, during this time (the late 1940s), Los Angeles was rapidly transforming from what was once a small, coastal, desert community when Chandler had first moved there 30 years prior--into the enormous, sprawling, congested, and smoggy metropolis it is today. It's telling that Chandler moved 100 miles south to La Jolla, CA not long after this book was published.One can sense while reading \\"The Little Sister\\" that Chandler was becoming bitter and weary--not only at the direction of his own life and the Hollywood movie machine (where writers are traditionally the low man on the totem pole) but also how his adopted home was changing...and not for the better, calling L.A. \\"a neon slum\\" and \\"a big, hard-boiled city with no more personality than a paper cup.\\" While world-weariness had always been present in all the Philip Marlowe private detective novels, here, unlike Chandler's other books, it almost weighs down the storytelling.The story itself is the standard, convoluted Chandler fare: Ms. Orfamay Quest--a pretty young woman from Manhattan, Kansas--seeks Marlowe's help in locating her missing brother Orrin P. Quest. Marlowe immediately suspects that Orfamay is not all she appears to be, yet--lacking any other clients--he accepts her case nonetheless. From this unlikely setting, both Marlowe and the reader are brought into a world of movie stars, agents, gangsters, backstabbers (both real and metaphorical) and small-time hustlers. While it's hard to figure out exactly who is doing what to whom, this confusion is the hallmark of all Chandler novels--particularly the ones of any worth.For the Chandler enthusiast, \\"The Little Sister\\" is an above-average book, with some of the punchiest, toughest dialogue that Chandler ever wrote. It's far from the worst Chandler I've ever read (that would be \\"The Lady in the Lake\\"--1943) However, for the enthusiast as well as the more casual reader, \\"The Long Goodbye\\" (1954) is Chandler's true masterpiece, with \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\" (1940) coming in a close second. \\"The Little Sister\\" is well worth the read, but I expected more from the potent combination of Raymond Chandler, Philip Marlowe & Hollywood."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"I've read THE LITTLE SISTER four or five times but really found myself able to wrap my head around the novel after a couple of viewings of the 1969 movie MARLOWE (based on this book). James Garner plays him far better than Robert Mitchum, parlaying the same character into Rockford a few years later. I unequivocally state Garner outshone Bogart in the role too, Bogey was a much better Sam Spade than Philip Marlowe to my mind, but that's neither here nor there.LITTLE SISTER has been maligned as a minor Marlowe book, even by Chandler biographer Frank MacShane, who harbored similar sentiments about THE LONG GOODBYE. Not so!Whether you watch the movie or not LITTLE SISTER is one of the great Marlowe novels. Chandler met and interviewed gangster 'Lucky' Luciano before writing this book. Watch for Chandler's fictionalization of a real-life event in Luciano's life involving a newspaper on a restaurant table in a paparazzi photo. Marlowe's a lot more fun in this novel than THE HIGH WINDOW."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Marlowe is sitting in his office swatting at a fly when Sweet Polly Purebread from Kansas strolls in carrying her Bible and sob story about a lost brother. Something doesn't smell right to Marlowe and you guessed it, it does stink.Chandler paints beautiful scenes as always in his unique hardboiled style, with Marlowe wisecracking like a pro. But the reader needs to keep notes to keep up with the dizzying cast of characters in this difficult to read story. I think this one is about as hard as The Big Sleep, which according to lore, was so complicated that even Chandler didn't know who killed one of the characters. Consider this a thinking man's whodunnit."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"The previous reviews of this Chandler novel are spot on, it's a Raymond Chandler novel, it's worth reading but it's not one of his most famous, and even darker than his other novels.I have a bone to pick with this Kindle edition, though. Apparently someone just dumped in an old file without doing any proofreading. There are a lot of hyphenated words in the middle of sentences, so my guess it was from some publishing industry typesetting program that inserts hard hyphens for justification. This is irritating in a \\"free\\" public domain book, but doubly so in a paid Kindle edition. It doesn't help that there are typos, too. There are no more editors working in the publishing industry?Cheesy. Straighten up and fly right, you mugs."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"I just finished reading &quot;The High Window&quot; and got hooked so I went right out and bought &quot;The Little Sister&quot;. I'm not sorry. It's even better! Now I'll have to go buy &quot;Trouble is My Business&quot;. I only have about 40 pages left and I don't want it to end yet. Raymond Chandler is the best."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"On one of those clear bright mornings in Los Angeles the little sister sashayed into the spartan office of Private Investigator Philliip Marlowe. The dame was from Manhatten Kansas fresh from Sunday School and service in a doctor's office. Her name was Quest and she was seeking her brother who had left the cornfields for the lush sinful landscape of 1949 Los Angeles. This is the opening scene in the \\"The Little Sister\\" which is an excellent late novel by Raymond Chandler author of such hardboiled detective classics as \\"The Big Sleep\\"; \\"The Long Goodbye\\";\\"Farwell My Lovely\\"; \\"The Lady in the Lake\\" and \\"Playback.\\"The plot is convoluted and difficult to follow; the characters are grotesques from Miss Quest to movie queen Mavis Weld, the evil Steelgrave a mobster from Cleveland and the Latino beauty Dolores Gonzalez (who seeks to seduce Marlowe). We also get a trip to a movie studo; rich allusive writing about Los Angeles and the world weariness endemic to the disillusioned soul of Phillip Marlowe. Marlowe is the narrator of this opus.Chandler could turn a phrase and keep your fingers flipping the 250 pages of another crime classic. Excellent writing and an entertaining visit to the underworld will keep you enthralled. Read Chandler at all costs!"},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"The Little Sister is a fine place to start for the new Chandler fan. Its plot is not overly complicated like some reviewers have said (It is easier to follow, say, than Farewell, My Lovely). But its main drag may be the opening half, which is just another retread of the same scenes fans of the genre have encountered many times in Red Wind, Trouble is My Business, The Big Sleep, and even Dashil Hammett's Maltese Falcon: the flirtatious woman with a problem, the surly hotel detective, and the sudden discovery of macabre corpses with all the answers on their dead tongues.It's not that these noir tropes should be totally abandoned, but in Sister they are trotted out with a laziness that made me nervous I was reading The Great Book of Mystery Cliches. The leads are cardboard and have flat lines, the sideline characters are at best sketches and at worst (Dolores Gonzales) grossly caricatured stereotypes.But the second half of the book, starting with Marlowe meeting the head of the studio, Mr. Oppenheimer, then through to the scene at the doctor's office and beyond reaches a new level. The cliches stick, but they are delivered with more humor, more terror, more vitality. And it helps that the writing is much improved. When Marlowe awakens from being drugged he describes the anxiety of opening his eyes: \\"A big black gorilla with a big black paw had his big black paw over my face and was trying to push it through the back of my neck. I pushed back.\\"Or this zinger to a dirty movie star: \\"I was born rich.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" I said. \\"You were born with a Cadillac in your mouth...\\"I don't know what happened in the writing of this novel (though I've heard it was quickly published without edits) but there is a marked difference in quality from start to finish, and refreshingly it's a reverse of the usual order.If it's your first dive into Chandler, the above complaints won't nag, though I can't imagine many people would pick this one up over the more readily recognizable novels. (The Big Sleep and The Long Goodbye are just darn good titles, while The Little Sister is about as sexy as, well, your little sister.)If you're looking for more Chandler, don't be turned off by criticisms that it's loose on focus or weak compared to his best. It's a solid novel that breaks free of the norm at the most critical moments."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"I think this is the novel where Chandler started to take his press clippings seriously and tried to write an Important Book. While it's a very good book, the book feels like a lesser sequel to his previous four classic novels perhaps because it strays a little more from its pulp roots. In the earlier books, he showed us the seamy side of Los Angeles, and the characters demonstrated their basic corruption through their actions. There is some of that in this novel as well, but he also feels the need to tell us what Philip Marlowe actually thinks about your average person. \\"Tired men in dusty coupes and sedans winced and tightened their grip on the wheel and ploughed on north and west toward home and dinner, the whining of their spoiled children and the gabble of their silly wives.\\" True, probably. Pleasant, no. Marlowe also occasionally indulges in self pity. A flawed hero is one thing; an unlikable one is something else altogether.There's no leavening the unpleasantness as even Marlowe himself doesn't come off well. As misanthropic as Marlowe becomes in this novel, you wonder why he even bothers to do his Don Quixote thing. In this book, I think Chandler strays somewhat from his original concept of Marlowe, and the book suffers as a result. Still a good read, but far from classic."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"not Chandler's best. The book was written during his wife's dying and death. Chandler could not bring himself to reread it, therefore some of the language oddities can be forgiven as well as character inconsistencies. There are terrific descriptions as usual, but motivation for the many violent things people do isn't apparent and in the end the bottom drops out. That said, you could do worse in the genre."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"This is my favorite Raymond Chandler novel. After reading the first two pages, describing a bored Philip Marlowe watching a blue bottle fly, I set the book down and said, \\"Chandler! you are one cocky son-of-a-bitch!\\" Amazing stuff!Though I read the book years ago, I still remember Marlowe's visit to a Hollywood producer. Can there be anything in literature better conveying the stench of greed and magalomania?"},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"I just finished Chandler's \\"The Little Sister,\\" or at least I think I did. That is, I have no idea what I was reading so therefore am not sure that I'm not still reading it. Somehow a young girl from Manhattan, Kansas named of all things, Orfamay Quest, hires Marlowe to find her brother Orrin who is missing and the fun begins. But how the skein of lies becomes unraveled, well, that was beyond my comprehension. I have no crystal ball, I don't know why Chandler seems to lose us in this cobweb or why the characters all seem like walk-ons except for Marlowe. The nympho, the babe, little Orfamay who is described as on a par with Lady Macbeth when she's introduced, the tough cops--they all seem to like I said enter and go away. So do we care about any of them? And of course, Marlowe is the star, the hero, the anti-hero, the guy with the chip on his shoulder, the seeker of truth with his bottle of expensive booze someone gave him. But still there is magic in this book and yes I am over the emotional age of thirteen so you can trust my opinion. I also just reread \\"The Lady in the Lake\\" which I thought far superior, including Marlowe's weary wary persona."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Orfamay Quest is the little sister. Marlowe is the man. The story offers sex and murder. The dialogue is Chandler. So why is there no click, no snap?&quot;Now that you have hit me, maybe you ought to kiss me&quot;, one of the women in the story says. That is the sort of line that is out of place, a Chandler crack of the sort that sings in other books but seems strange here. Few women would ever say such a line, and the woman in this story would not have, and why have her say it? The same is true of the story, where the death and murder never seems quite serious.There is a scene in the book where two actors playing tough guys try to muscle Marlowe by acting tough. Both appear to be caricatures of characters from the Maltese Falcon. That is the problem with this book - it is too self-consciously tongue in cheek and self-wise. Is it a parody or a novel? Marlowe's wise-cracking diffidence takes over the entire book.But Chandler on an off day is always worth a read, and his bad writing (or half-parody)sings better than most modern writers, so if you can find it in a used book store, snap it up!"},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"Raymond Chandler is possibly the greatest detective fiction writer of all time. The only people that even hold a candle to him are Hammet and in some ways Mickey Spillane. Cahndler was able to take a genre and transform it from what many considred trash into an art. In my opinon The Little Sister is his best work. He was able to captrue all of the characters attitudes and emotions with expert skill. Even though I enjoyed all of his other novels this one sticks in my mind simply becasue in this novel we actually see Marlowe willing to give up. In this novel he complains about his pay rate and almost throws in the hat but he doesn't. Marlowe finally shows that even he can become dejected to a point where he considers giving up and that is one of many reasons this novel is my favorite of Chandler's. Read it and give it a try."},{"Title":"THE LITTLE SISTER.","review":"if you love raymond chandler like i do you'll still enjoy his not so great works and this is one of em...enjoy..."},{"Title":"Reason and Life.the Introduction to Philosophy","review":"As Mr. Marias writes in the first chapter of his book, this work is not one of the kind &quot;history of ideas&quot;, even though it has something of this. The main goal of this book is helping us to realize that philosophy is a human activity, as working and shopping, and that we have need of doing it, in order to live better, to live real and authentic lives. And authentic life requires basic trues, these ones that give sense to everything else. The human search for these basic trues, in everyone's circumstances, is called philosophy. This search happens with emotions, with fears, with memories,...it is not a mere intellectual exercise. There is vital reason to do it.It is difficult writing a summary of such a complex, and fascinating, book but one would expect after reading it that you should be able, at least, to:- Being aware of the historical status of the most of your beliefs. They can change, as much as you, so, it is not worth enough cause struggles by them. Better, being open, listen to others, being committed to search the true more than defending what you already know, by experience or inheritance.- Realize that between your usual interpretations of reality (almost any human knowledge is an interpretation of reality - let Mr. Marias explain this to you) and the reality which causes them could be room for questioning many things. And even though one will arrive, finally, to the same point the travel would be good, because before it these interpretations &quot;were not yours&quot;, and after it, &quot;they are yours&quot;..until the next experience that could change something again.- Discover that not all the trues you &quot;handle&quot; every day have the same importance. Some of them give support and stability to all the remaining. The authenticity of a life depends on the validity of those few trues. It is worth to spend a normal life living and at the same time assesing if this core of beliefs are as worth as you think.- Think on time, history, death,....seems so abstract, but they are so real. Our search for basic trues happens in those limits, and should help us to live better in those limits too. Whatever is your God's idea, it is good trying to make sense of your whole life since the next point of view, this one that closes and ends, at least as far as we know, everything on earth: the moment of death. Our choices could change after the discovery of those realities.- Realize that the great philosophers and the history of their ideas could help us to make everyone's search more comfortable and less expensive in time, but, their search was THEIRS. Their circumstances were not like yours today. After you find true in the basic core of beliefs you need to make better choices everyday, you could rewrite on many topics written before. The basic core of trues of them were not the same of you. It is not about losing respect for their works, but working with them, as much as they did with the legacies of former times.- Buy more books of philosophy and not feel you are wasting your time and money.Accept the invitation to live with a little bit more complexity. It seems to be a whole journey."},{"Title":"1001 winning chess sacrifices and combinations (Chess lovers library)","review":"Positives:1. 1001 of them!2. difficulty levels are pretty high (90%) .

READ BOTH BOOKS AND KEEP THEM HANDY."},{"Title":"On Competition","review":"Michael E. Porter is a Harvard Business School professor and a leading authority on competition. This book consists of three parts - Competition and Strategy: Core Concepts, The Competitiveness of Locations, and Competitive Solutions to Societal Problems - and each of these parts consists of 4-to-5 Harvard Business Review articles which were published between 1979 and 1998. &quot;The study of competition, in its full richness, has preoccupied me for two decades.&quot;In Part I, the five HBR articles outline Porter's strategic concepts. &quot;I have sought to capture the complexity of what actually happens in companies and industries in a way that both advances theory and brings theory to life for practitioners. My goal has been to develop both rigorous and useful frameworks for understanding competition that effectively bridge the gap between theory and practice.&quot; In the 1979-article 'How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy', Porter introduces the monumental five competitive forces (from existing competitors, new entrants, customers, suppliers, substitution). This article has had an extensive impact on the field of strategy and is still a starting point for strategic management at any MBA-course. 'What is Strategy?' was published in 1996 and is, in my opinion, a reply to all the critics of his frameworks and models. The 1985-article 'How Information Gives You Competitive Advantage', Porter and co-author Victor Millar write how information technology influences competition. The current impact of Internet and e-commerce provide excellent examples for this article. In the 1993-article 'End-Game Strategies for Declining Industries', Porter lines up with Kathryn Rudie Harrigan to discuss the last stage/final phase of a industry. This articles is largely based on Harrigan's 1980 book 'Strategies for Declining Businesses' and is a chapter in Porter's 1980-book 'Competitive Strategy'. Part I is finalised with the magnificent 'From Competitive Advantage to Corporate Strategy'. This article is truly a classic and discusses the radical rethinking of corporate strategy. &quot;Corporate strategy is what makes the corporate whole add up to more than the sum of its business parts.&quot; This article is the basis of his book 'Competitive Advantage'.In Part II, Porter kicks off with 'The Competitive Advantage of Nartions', which is also one of the titles of his books. In this 1990-article Porter argues that in a world of increasingly global competition, nations have become more, not less, important. In 'Clusters and Competition' (1998), Porter expands on the theme and discusses the new economics of competition - clusters. &quot;A Cluster is a geographically proximate group of interconnected companies and associated institutions in particular fields, linked by commonalities and complementarities.&quot; Examples are the Italian fashion industry, the California Wine cluster, Silicon Valley's venture capital industry, and Massachusetts IT industry. In the next article, 'How Global Companies Win Out' (1992), Porter, Thomas Hout and Eileen Rudden discuss what a global industry is and how global companies can win out. In the next article, 'Competing Across Locations' (1995), returns on this subject and provides additional insights on global strategy, including a general framework.Part III includes the latest works of Porter. Porter discusses environmental regulation and competition ('Green and Competitive', 1995), with a great case study of the Dutch flower industry, and the impact of these regulations on competition and industries. In the next article ('The Competitive Advantage of the Inner City', 1995), Porter introduces the economic distress of America's inner cities, whereby &quot;the real need - and the real opportunity - is to create wealth&quot; . In the 1990s, Porter also turned more towards government institutions. He discusses the American health care ('Making Competition in Health Care Work', 1994) and, the according to Porter, America's failing capital investment system ('Capital Disadvantage', 1992).The advantage of this book is that it provides the a quick insight into the ideas and essential points of Porter's books 'Competitive Strategy', 'Competitive Advantage', and 'Competitive Advantage of Nations'. Part I and Part II are now essentials in the field of strategy and competition with fantastic frameworks and models. Part III are Porter's latest articles and discuss the connection between social issues and competition. A great book that is good to read (simple US-English)."},{"Title":"On Competition","review":"This book is a collection of essays and articles by Michael Porter alone or with others. Most of them are collected from his writings in the Harvard Business Review although two are new to this book. Think of this as a &quot;Porter's Greatest Hits&quot; kind of thing. That is a bit misleading because his HBR articles are not exactly the same thing as his Competitive Advantage books although the topics are definitely related.The essays are grouped into three broad sections: 1) Competition and Strategy: Core Concepts, 2) The Competitiveness of Locations, and 3) Competitive Solutions to Societal Problems. Will you find each article of the same high quality? Probably not (again, like a greatest hits collection), but you will find them informative and thought provoking. It is impossible to study for an MBA nowadays without invoking &quot;Porter's Five Forces&quot; in your discussions of competitive and marketing strategy.This book can help add to your thinking and understanding of how every aspect of our life is in some way part of a competitive context and the ways it improves our standard of living. It will also help you improve your thinking in how to best strategize for and participate in competitive situations.It would be a mistake to think that Porter advocates for a Hobbesian nightmare of life being nasty, brutish and short. Rather, he is more or less helping us think through the nature of the way competition arises and how to best think about its sources and how to manage it and the traps to avoid.While Porter's model is used by some as a hammer that sees everything as a nail, it really needn't be used that way and, in its proper context, is very helpful."},{"Title":"On Competition","review":"'Porter On Competition' is 'lighter' to read than his 'Trilogy', but it nicely consists the core ideas of his work & how it evolved during the past decades. It provides reader a nice overview about how competitive strategy & competitive advantage are applicable to a wide range of areas: from corporation, industry & nation, to social issues such as health care & environment."},{"Title":"On Competition","review":"I read this book when it was first published (in 1979) and recently re-read it prior to reading his most recent work, Redefining Health Care which I will also review in the near future. In the Introduction (which then became the first chapter of Competitive Strategy, published in 1980), Porter observes that competition \\"has intensified over the last decades, in virtually all parts of the world.\\" That is even more true of competition - especially global competition -- during the 27 years since Porter shared that observation. Nonetheless, the core concepts which he and his collaborators rigorously examine remain relevant...indeed, in my opinion, have become even more relevant. Consider these assertions:1. Competition shapes strategy2. Successful strategy creates a \\"fit\\" among all organizational activities3. Information can provide a decisive competitive advantage4. Declining industries require an \\"end-game\\" strategy5. Successful corporate strategy \\"builds\\" on three premises: Competition occurs at the business unit level, diversification inevitably adds costs and constraints to business units, and, shareholders can readily diversify themselves.6. \\"Moving from competitive strategy to corporate strategy is the business equivalent of passing through the Bermuda Triangle.\\"Porter carefully organizes the material within three Parts: First, he focuses on competition and strategy for companies at both the level of a single industry and then for multinational or diversified companies; next, he addresses the role of location in competition; and then he Part III, he addresses some important societal issues (e.g. environment, urban poverty, health care, and income inequality), each of which he asserts - and I wholly agree - is \\"inextricably bound up with economics and, more specifically, with competition.\\"All but two of the articles originally appeared in Harvard Business Review, the exceptions being \\"Clusters and Competition: New Agendas for Companies, Governments, and Institutions\\" and \\"Competing Across Locations: Enhancing Competitive Advantage through a Global Strategy.\\" In the former, Porter explains his concept of clusters, clusters which are geographic concentrations of firms, suppliers, related industries, and specialized institutions that occur in a particular field in a nation, state, or city. In the latter, Porter brings together the two dimensions of international strategy - location and global networks. As he observes, \\"The concept of activities, so important to understanding competitive advantage in general terms, provides the basic framework for international strategy as well.\\"This is by no means an \\"easy read\\" but it will generously reward those who read it with appropriate care. By all accounts, Michael Porter is among the most influential and productive knowledge leaders, justly renowned for his cutting-edge thinking on the subject of strategy formulation and implementation but in this volume and in countless others, he also has much of great value to say about competitive and corporate strategy insofar as their global impact is concerned. That said, many of his greatest concerns are those specifically related to the U.S. economy. Hence the importance to me of what he and his collaborators (Claas van der Linde, Elizabeth Olmsted Teisberg, and Gregory B. Brown) have to say in Part III: \\"Competitive Solutions to Societal Problems.\\"Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Porter's other works as well as two recently published books: Kenichi Ohmae's The Next Global Stage and C.K. Prahalad's The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid."},{"Title":"On Competition","review":"This is a brilliant collection of Michael Porter's work and should be the first stop for anyone interested in competition, competitive strategy, and competitive advantage. For nearly three decades, Porter has been the leading thinker in this area, and On Competition publishes his 11 greatest articles on this subject--plus two new ones--and an introduction that ties all of his work together.From his early work on competition among companies and within industries to his later work on the competitive advantage of locations, to his most recent work on competitive solutions to societal problems such as the distress of inner cites, On Competition covers it all in a clear, easy-to-follow sequence."},{"Title":"On Competition","review":"I'm a great fan of Porter's works, but was disappointed that something published in 1998 wasn't updated to the impact of the internet on competition. The net is the greatest inflection point in competitive activity in business history, IMO. Not only is the impact great on nearly all aspects of Porter's 5 forces, but changes are happening blazingly fast. To be sure many of MP's concepts help one predict and understand Dell's cleaning of Compaq's clock and many other happenings, but none of this is dealt with explicitly. How tough would it have been to update, or even just add a blurb at the end of chapter's like &quot;How Information Gives You Competitive Advantage&quot;. But no, it's the same as when it was written in mid-1985...a lifetime ago in terms of information technology. $35.95 should entitle the reader to bit of updating, but the internet doesn't appear in the index and I only saw the word once in the text of one article. Had the book and articles had a bit of an update, I would definitely give it 5 stars...and for those who haven't read Porter's articles I would highly recommend it. But for those expecting a 1998 book should carry a more recent perspective, it's a bit of a disappointment."},{"Title":"On Competition","review":"This book is well known in Consulting circles, Ivy league schools &amp; CEO circles to be THE Competition bible.

As a professional investor, I evaluate competitive strengths and weaknesses of companies on everyday basis. I cannot overemphasize how important Mr. Porter's writings are to my ability to pick investments that perform well. In my opinion, the first chapter is the most important one. Mr. Porter writes about five forces:* Threat of new entrants* Intensity of rivalry among existing competitors* Pressure from substitute products* Bargaining power of buyers* Bargaining power of suppliersThese five forces can be a roadmap to determining the competitiveness of individual companies.

If author Michael E. Porter had walked up to buy a cup of punch from you, he probably would have asked about your business strategy. While you poured, he would have questioned what made your lemonade different from anyone else's. If he liked your lemonade, he'd no doubt give you suggestions on how to earn millions competing in the global marketplace. Ah, if only you had listened... The author, America's dean of competition, has spent two decades asking seminal questions such as, \\"What is competition? What are its effects? How can society benefit?\\" The Harvard Business Review previously published 11 of the 13 articles collected in this book. In the two new essays, Porter serves up invaluable concepts. His take on the growing importance of location, despite rising globalization, is a tour de force. Oddly, Porter sees no inconsistency in encouraging \\"productive competition\\" in the health care industry while advocating universal health care. For Porter, competition is the ingredient that turns lemons into lemonade. We recommend his latest book to any corporate strategist who seeks ideas on becoming more competitive, starting in your own neighborhood."},{"Title":"On Competition","review":"Michael Porter clearly explains why having competitors is good, and why having them closer is better! Society improves by innovations caused by competition, and this happens faster and farther in clusters. This book also explains why joint ventures will become a more important business structure.

Some they could order it for me but the prices were to high so this worked out very good for me."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The original Dune ranks as the greatest sci-fi story ever told. After Dune: Messiah, however, Frank Herbert started to get bogged down with his philosophizing and the quality of the storyline consequently slipped. After a lackluster couple of books, Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune finally started to build an exciting story. Then Frank died, and it seemed we would be left hanging forever. Enter Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. Having found Frank's notes, they are writing a prequel trilogy and, apparently, the concluding Book 7. Doing so, they have retained the epic grandeur of the Dune universe and returned to the action-packed, intrigue-laden storytelling style that made the original Dune so great. House Atreides is one of those rare books that are hard to put down, and I'm dying of suspense waiting for the remaining books. If you want philosophy, mystic religions, or an ecological treatise, go visit your local university textbook store.

He just needed a best seller to permit him to publish future books on the Butlerian Jihad...and I am looking forward to reading those."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As a long time Dune fan, I was thrilled at the release of Dune: House Atreides. Stepping back into the Dune universe is like being reunited with an old friend. For this reason, it was truly a fun read, and if you long for new tales of the people and places from the original series, you might enjoy it.However, if you are looking for the level of sophistication, and a stylistic vision that is absolutely true to Frank Herbert's original series, you could be disappointed. Many of the settings in House Atreides have the feel of a movie lot, great on the surface, but none of the depth that we came to love in the originals.By the same token, some of the characters seem very superficial, and come across as very shallow in their feelings and motivations, without the deep psychological features that were a hallmark of Frank Herbert's characters.That having been said, again, the book is entertaining, and since it is probably the truest sort of work we are likely to see in the Dune universe, incorporating material from Frank Herbert's notes as it does, it is at least worth reading by true Dune fans."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Entertaining sci-fi novel for readers who enjoy the genre, very disappointing for someone hoping to relive the \\"Dune experience\\".

Sure--no one expected it to be on the level of his father's books, but WOW, this is BAD. I'm not sure who to blame--I have a feeling Anderson did most of the writing and Brian just threw his name on for more punch.If you are a fan of Dune don't even bother picking this book up. The brilliance of the original series was that it lifted the story out of the realm of &quot;sci-fi&quot; and into something that was bigger and better.

And, I must say, they came very close. The pre-Paul Atreides/Muad'ib/Kwisatz Haderach era was put together in a suspenseful and comprehensive way.

So just enjoy the books for what they are, fun."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is a major accomplishment for the authors, who, using Frank Hebert's original notes about Dune, have constructed a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor, the epic, Dune. I was very impressed at the level of detail the authors gave in referencing the orginal novel, especially when it came to the inner workings of House Atredies itself. I have gone back after reading this novel, and have begun reading again the original Dune novel. Brian Hebert and Kevin Anderson have really given us something to be proud of and worthy of the extra bucks it takes to buy it in hardcover. Although some have said that this novel is nothing like the original as far as style, it is truly an enriching story that only makes me love the Dune series even more. I have rated this novel at four stars instead of five--due to some rather quirky language in some parts. Overall-- You must read this book!!!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This story stuck marvelously well to the \\"Past\\", that is the past as it was outlined in the orginial novel.

I cannot wait for Dune: House Harkkonen and Dune: House Corrino to be published (I prefer the paperback versions of books). This is a wonderful prequel and deserves attention."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I had reservations about picking it up since I was disappointed with the series after the original Dune. This book blends all of the policital and personal adventure that made Dune an epoch. The remainding books were more run of the mill science fiction. I'm looking forward to reading the next prequel."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"If you're going to buy this, check yourself first and make sure that you're a confirmed, loyal fan of the original Dune series, because only then might you find in it some redeeming features, namely the exposition of some of Frank Herbert's original ideas. Apart from this, the book is trite and childish; I felt (a) as though I were sifting through a Dr. Seuss book to find nuggets of original intention and (b) that I could have dragged a better version out of my arse - perhaps Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson should consider ordering Frank Herbert's original notes such that they follow a reasonably contiguous pattern and then publishing them &quot;as is&quot;. Gone, here, is the plot complexity and the atmosphere, but what's missing most of all is the psychological angle which made all of Frank Herbert's books so compelling. Buy this book for a 5-year-old so that he can have some introduction to the concepts of the Dune series for when he's old enough to understand it. Incidentally, the previous reviewer (Pyotr Petrovich Bazarov) was incorrect about the axolotl tanks and the no-room: the first Duncan ghola was presented to Paul quite early on, and the very same no-room was rediscovered by Duncan Idaho's last incarnation in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; some 10,000 years later, complete with original Harkonnen images, nullentropy bins, etc. -- the novel is consistent, for all its other faults. Nevertheless, nastily enough, I shall probably break down and buy the &quot;House Harkonnen&quot; one too, just for the sake of being able to peruse more of Frank Herbert's initial intentions."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I am a passive fan of Dune. I was turned on to the series by my Dad, a long time SF reader, during a family vacation which included long periods of driving. Although I enjoyed Dune, I never read on in the series. That said, I found House Atreides to be an enjoyable read. I found inconsistancies in this novels attempt to cast light on events preceeding the events of Dune. However, I have chosen not to pick the novel apart. I enjoyed discovering how the Baron became the disgusting blob that he is, where Lady Jessica came from, and the background of Duncan Idaho. These revelations are interesting and fun. The average reader does not need &quot;The nit-pickers guide to Dune&quot; to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"If you are new to this series (or, God forbid, if you've only seen the movie) you will find to book to be a very good sci-fi example. The plot is surprisingly quick for any Herbert book, rather written by father or son. The characters develop quickly (though not overly deep); the lines between good and evil are very clear. There is not so much Dune jargon that it makes it difficult to understand. Most importantly, it can easily be read as a self-encapsulated novel.If you are an avid Dune fan, on the other hand, you WILL find this book disappointing. Not horribly so, but a mild distaste instead. For all the reasons that make it easy for a new person to read (quick plot, clear sides, fast development), you will find it lacking. Dune has always been about a world so real that it is palpable. This book falls short of that bar."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The sublety and dark complexity of the original Dune novels is absent here...the clumsiness and cliche apparent in this book made it a sad disappointment. Only the names remain the same... do yourself a favor and read Dune again."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When I bought the book and started to read it, I expected it to be mediocre like the most of the sequels to the original Dune. Much to my surprise, it was extremly good. It was a quick read and was always at a climax. Though it still lacks the depth, complexity, and mystery of Dune, it is 20 times better the the sequels to Dune. I am impressed and can't wait to read the next prequeal."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Let me make one point straight away: this is not \`Dune', or any of it's sequels, in any way shape or form. Any fan of Frank Herbert expecting a seamless return to the world of Arrakis is going to be disappointed. Every aspect of the writing - pacing, plot, characterization - is a world away from the style and atmosphere created by Herbert Snr.Glaringly obvious clunkers like references to Cranberry juice and Feng Shui only highlight the depth of creation involved in the original series. Brian Herbert &amp; Kevin J. Anderson have set a tough task for themselves: writing a prequel to what I and many others believe is the greatest Science Fiction novel ever written. Not only do they have to keep the old fans interested but they have to attract a whole new group of devotees. This is achieved by a near excruciating amount of exposition that explains every unfamiliar term or plot point (\`Dune' had Appendices for this role). Add to this the fact that the reader who has read \`Dune' already knows what the outcome of the prequel trilogy is going to be. It's not an enviable task.That \`Dune House Atreides' is readable at all is a miracle. If you approach this novel with an open mind you will find it is a reasonably enjoyable read."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When I first picked up Dune about two years ago it was because I had finally consummed every other sci-fi book in my possession, the roads were too slick to visit the library, and Dune was the only thing left. I finished it in two days and proceeded to read through the rest of the series just as quickly. I was desperate to know how the whole thing ended. I'm sure others shared my disappointment when I attempted to locate a nonexistent sequel to Chapterhouse: Dune. But I did find a different novel, yet to be published, a prequel entitled Dune: House Atreides.I literally waited months and months for the book to get published, while rereading the other Dune books and catching many of the subtleties I'd missed the first time around. I don't know how many times I tried to imagine what would be contained in this book, what it would say about the characters and the events of Dune.I wasn't disappointed.No, DHA is not Dune. But, honestly, what did you expect? For starters, the settings of DHA and Dune are completely different. In Dune, it is essentially confined to one planet and centers around a House in exile. DHA covers House Atreides on the rise, in a multi-planet setting and in a universe far less mystical and more pragmatic than that of Dune. Lots of things change in the forty-odd years separating the plots of the two books.And as for the comparison between DHA and the Star Wars prequel, again I must ask: what did you expect? SW has always been a cheap copy of the Dune universe, so of course the prequels will be similar. How you can claim to be familiar with Dune and not realize this simple fact is a mystery to me.I wholeheartedly recommend Dune: House Atreides to anyone, whether you have loved Dune all your life or never even heard that title before. It is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Good enough. It's not Frank Herbert, but it is Dune, and fans should just be thankful for that. I set out to find fault, but in the end liked it. If you're not a Dune fan then its probably a very good read, on a par with anything from the same author. If you are a Dune fan then some things will grate. Some scenes come straight from Dune with the characters changed, the baron over flying a spice harvester where in Dune it was Duke Leto, and here the difference in style is most apparent. At times it comes close to reading like an adventure, a bit like comparing Asimov's Space Rangers with Asimov's better work, aimed at a younger less demanding audience that Frank aimed at. The upside is you'll understand what's going on first time, the down side is you won't get anything from reading it twice. The only thing I had to read again was Brian Herbert's postscript, &amp; I still don't know if we'll see Dune 7 (this is presumably Dune -3), this is the book I wanted to find out what happened to Duncan, the universe etc, not a prequel, which only exploits the Dune characters and doesn't really add anything new. Could have been one of the many Star Wars sagas, not surprising, given the author. Worth reading never the less.

Just because Brian Herbert is his son does not make him a good writer. What's missing in these books is Frank Herbert's insight and observational skill. The Dune books make so many observations in regards to religion, science, politics, etc. that can only come from Frank Herbert's insight. As far as I'm concerned these prequels have no place in the Dune universe. The only canon are the original 6 books."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I look at some of the other people's reviews of this book and they are embarrasing. Most of the people reading this book seem to be trying so hard to not like this book that they forget that it was made to be enjoyed. Many of the descriptions say how this book is &quot;not as good as the original.&quot; Frankly, if all you do is compare books to the original Dune, then you might as well give a one to everything.When I read this book I was blown away. Brian Herbert managed to take a piece of history that was already spoken of in the original and weave it into a masterpiece. I found myself unable to stop reading this book until it was over. Even then you wish you could read more. I have not yet read the sequel, but I have been wanting to ever since I first read this.Another point to note is that it is a very different writing style than the original. It is much more straight-forward and replaces the &quot;baroque mystique&quot; with a more modern attitude. It is very well written and can be read by both educated and common people easily. I finished the six hundred and fifty pages in less than a week. The only way someone can insult this book is if they attempt to compare it with the original Dune, a book which has not yet been equaled."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Let me say right up front that Dune: House Atreides would never be mistaken for a work by FH. Some of the magic of the original derives from the fact that prose is layered upon layers, just like the plots themselves. BH and KA miss many of the old man's tricks - the use of color to set mood, the fact that the first volume was written as an epic poem, then rewritten as prose.Nonetheless, I found the book highly entertaining. All these years, I've wondered about what Ix looked like, what Geidi Prime would look like, and so on. Duncan Idaho's back story was good. More than anything the real strength of the book is in filling in details that FH only hinted at in the novels.Many parts of the book are obviously tongue in cheek, in a kind of nudge nudge wink wink kind of way. Far from being cheesy, I found these portions very funny. I mean, no one is ever going to BE FH, and so playing around a little seems to deliberately acknowledge this fact."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"How much sleep have I lost over House Atreides?

Not only House Atreides, but also all the others besides the original six.I read several of these Brian Herbert / Kevin J.

It is, at best, a misguided and failed attempt to honor his father, and at worst, a greedy attempt to capitalize on his father's talent as much as possible. Either way, consider yourself warned.Frank Herbert dealt with important topics (including sex, violence, politics, commerce, religion, etc.) with grace and eloquence. These Brian Herbert books, on the other hand, are a cesspool of gratuitous sex and violence, very poorly written, and a disgrace to Frank Herbert's legacy."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The authors do an excellent job of staying true to the original Dune, a book which I have read several times. (Four years since the last time. I am probably ready to read it again). Their storytelling power kept me reading happily to the end. And prompted me to buy House Harkonnen that I am currently reading. I will finish the trilogy and move on to the Butlerian Jihad, which will be the test for these authors."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book has the usual quality you know and love from the Dune series. I have two minor quibbles with the book.It feels to me like a screenwriter was involved in the book. A few of the scenes in the book feel like they would be perfect in a movie. I don't like the feeling of being pulled out of the story narrative and into a movie scene.Also, this book and the others in the trilogy seem to have fallen victim to the current fad of including explicit descriptions of brutality and outright torture. Those explicit descriptions add nothing to the book and only contribute to the moral decay and mental corruption of the reader in my opinion.Someone who only reads books without realizing the implications of their effects on the reader and society will probably not even notice what was described above."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It's written alright and I enjoy some of the threads that come out in later books but might be reaching point of Dune fatigue. I think they might have written some of the characters as maybe a little to one dimensional but do enjoy the stories of IX."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is dreadful. Brian and Kevin should feel ashamed at writing such dull prose. This turns the previous books of a master into nothing more than a franchise. It was so dreadful a read, I cannot be bothered......"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I really enjoyed this book a lot. I did have some minor problems with sections in the book compared to Frank Herbert's Dune. Specifically, I had thought that Jessica had known the old Duke; however, I might be wrong. The writing style does fit nicely with the Dune rest of the Dune universe."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Written, in 1999, Dune House Atreides is the first part in a 3 part series that details events preceding the Frank Herbert sf classic Dune. The total 3 part series is approximately 2,000 pages. That's quite a bit of material. So for it be worth the reader's time it better be good stuff.Unfortunately, from the beginning this book and this series suffers on my many levels:Set about 35 years before Dune, the book includes main Dune Characters Leto Atreides, Duncan Idaho, Trufir Hawat, Emperor Shaddam, Count Fenring, Baron and Rabban Harkonnen, as well Gaius Mohiam of the Bene Gesserit. In addition, there is Pardot Kynes who is the father Liet Kynes, the planetologist in Dune.As a result, the reader who has read the Dune books will know the eventual outcomes of the events. In addition, if the reader hasn't read the Dune books, they will not enjoy the books as much if they read this book, because the authors give away some of surprises.As for character development and writing it's bad. I'll admit the SF writers are never expected to be great at technical writing, but the simplistic sentences really got on my nerves in this book. Examples: A man attempts to molest a 7 year old Duncan Idaho. Trufir Hawat forces a confession of someone by torturing them then kills them. Definately, not the Atreides way.There are major contradictions between this book and the Dune series. The most glaring of them is the description of free flowing water on Dune not only at the south but also at a location near the shield wall. Not mentioned anywhere in the series.Then then are major contradictions within the story. The emperor afraid that Leto may expose his involvement with the Tleixau, yet the failure of the Harkonnens to expose the involvemewnt when they knew about it in detail and lost more from the alliance than any House in the Landsdraad.To put it mildly, the authors fail to replicate the magic in any of Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Good read with a interresting story line. It answered some questions I had from watching the Movie as I haven't read the book yet, (I am reading it now)"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I found this book to be lacking in most areas. While mildly entertaining, the writing was amateurish. And worst of all, you'd swear this was fan fiction from some teenager. Not very true to Frank Herbert's vision at all."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I am not a Kevin J. Anderson fan by any stretch of the imagination (he's poisen to Star Wars, I tells ya) and I am a fan of the original Dune series (although not as hardcore as most). And with these two concepts colliding as I read &quot;House Atreides&quot;, a shocking fact unfolded like Paul's visions in the original book... I actually liked it.I'm not one to tally up every detail in the original Herbert series, so theres no way possible I could criticize it for missing details. All I can say it was a good read. Unlike Frank Herbert, whose writing was intelligent and made you think, Anderson prefers rather to show everything, leaving nothing to the imagination. Every scene, action and battle is told in Anderson's quaint style. And I found nothing wrong with it. It was fun to get a look at the major characters seen a few decades before the original novel.Just the same, I still prefer to view this work as a 'what if' type of Dune story, a glamourised look at the characters and locations Herbert created. Rather than an accurate prequal, I see 'House: Atreides' as an embellished history. But a fun sci-fi romp all the same."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Frank Herbert's Dune series stands alone as one of the most significant science fiction stories. This is maintained by its craft and its quality as literature, not genre writing. Herbert used the worlds he created as a sounding board to tell the tales of a Messiah, and the human qualities of that man (Paul Atreides), he went on to expand on the effects of religion and belief after the Messiah has come and past. His world is magnificent in scope, thickly layered and beautiful. It stands with a complexity rivalling any peice of fiction or fact. His character are human, his world, while fantastic is believable. One is consumed by the Dune series, and while its later books (Heretics of Dune &amp; Chapterhouse Dune) seem inapproachable and difficult on first (or even second reading), the meaning they project is part of the cause and effect style Herbert presented. In retrospect, these last two books are the most stunning, while often seen as the least dynamic. House Atreides, by Brian Herbert lacks the intricate qualities of the works of Frank Herbert, the derived stroyl and ideas seem pale in comparison, and it becomes at best clever, lacking any real insight into Frank Herbert's world. Dune, and its following novels told a story, and epic, and tried to create the atmosphere and intricacies of human belief and struggle. It was a tale beyond the scope of mere storytelling, and House Atreides in comparison seems just a sci-fi novel."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I took upon myself the job of reading 'Dune: House Atreides' mostly because I believe with all my heart that the original 'Dune' ranks as THE BEST sci-fi novel of ALL-TIME, and wondered whether or not ANYONE could do it justice. Now with that said, as long as you remember the MOST IMPORTANT thing while reading this first of 3 installments, you will probably enjoy it...do NOT forget at ANY point that this WAS NOT written BY Frank Herbert--IF you remember THAT, then it wasn't half-bad. I think (and this might come across as sacrilege to some) that 'Dune: House Atreides' is better than a couple of the later 'Dune' books by Frank himself. Some believe that the later 'Dune' books were even better than the original (but that is an impossibility in MY opinion) but remember, this is just ONE GUY'S OPINION, be it right or wrong in your mind, this is how I feel.My BIGGEST complaint about this book was the authors felt necessary to include SO MUCH into the plot that it jumped around a bit too much for me. But all in all, it kept the overall 'feel' of the Dune Universe, which alone I feel is a major accomplishment. I just cannot imagine what a daunting task it was to not just imagine continuing the GREATEST sci-fi series of all time, but to actually DO it...it must have been phenomenal. After purchasing their weight in Pepcid AC, these guys have managed to pull out of the hat an enjoyable addition to the remarkable Dune saga, and in short, a pretty fun sci-fi story that helps us learn more about the incredible world we call, Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I eagerly awaited the release of this latest in the &quot;Chronicles&quot;, and was somewhat disappointed. There are many inconsistencies in the book, which many of the other reviewers have pointed out. The hunger for the series kept me &quot;with it&quot; until the end, and will probably make me buy the next installment (House Harkonnen), but Frank Herbert's talents are sorely missed. Brian's collaboration with his father (Man of Two Worlds) foreshadowed his talent, but with strong input from &quot;Dad&quot;, outshined this offering."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I really Enjoyed this book. Being a consumate fan of the original &quot;Dune&quot;, this book is, relative to their own series, a better prequel than &quot;the phantom menace&quot;. It sets the stage for and explains many of the issues which we were simply presented with in the book &quot;dune&quot;. Although i havent read anything by brian herbert, i knew kevin j. anderson to be a great story teller. I was overall quite impressed and staisfied with this book. it will go on my shelf with &quot;dune&quot;, as another book that i bring myself to read over and over again. for the &quot;dune&quot; fan, this is among the &quot;MUST READs&quot;."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune:House Atreides if the 2nd best book in the Dune universe. Dune is the best book. It is better than the 5 sequels that Frank Herbert wrote. It also adds much to the characters of Dune. The Baron's physical shape was a twist. The Ix sequences were well written and absorbing. Read it and the forthcoming sequels, then read Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have to admit that I expected to hate this book the moment I heard about it. A Dune book by someone other than Frank Herbert borders on blasphemy. I was wrong. The book was far better than I expected, but it was still riddled with flaws. The main problems I had was with the introduction of technology (no-ships, etc.) that didn't evolve until after &quot;Dune&quot; and the poor characterization. The novel lacked the inventiveness of Herbert's masterpieces; it was merely a regurgitation of everything he had already done. I gave it three stars because there are some interesting tidbits scattered throughout the book that I assume came from FH's notes, making the book of some worth to fans."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The best thing about this novel is that it will renew interest in the original. It made me go back and reread Dune and marvel at how beautifully written and conceived it all was. This book breaks no new ground, offers few insights and the writing is stilted. Too bad, we miss Frank Herbert very much."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was cautious about this book for a number of reasons: lukewarm reviews, the scale the writers were attempting, and previous bad experiences with authors taking over another writer's universe. However, my cautions were misplaced. Dune: House Atreides kept me on the edge of my seat, and I could hardly put it down. I felt the characterizations were strong and quite on par with Frank Herbert's original ideas. There are some real treats in here, particularly with the dialogue between Paulus, Leto, and Thurfir Hawat, and seeing the growth of the young Leto into a strong, capable ruler. The intrigue is exceptional, particularly the machinations of the Bene Gesserit. Naturally, Dune: House Atrides is *not* quite as striking as the original book, but it's as close a companion as I'd hoped. If I had to fault House Atreides, it's on the seeming inconsistencies with the original (i.e. the maternal parentage of Lady Jessica). Perhaps these possible retcons will be explained in future volumes. In any case, they weren't distracting enough to keep me from thoroughly enjoying this new tale. I look forward to rereading it while I anxiously await the remaining two volumes in the trilogy."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is another in the Dune series, carried on by Frank Herbert's son, Brian, and a science-fiction co-writer, Kevin Anderson. They base this volume on notes Brian's father kept about the events prior to the first book in the series. It is fascinating to learn the history leading up to the blockbuster novel, but neither of these writers can match Frank Herbert's skill. The character sketches seem pale in comparison to the work of the master. We are introduced to Leto as a boy, so we can understand how and why he makes some of the decisions he does as Duke on Dune. We meet Duncan Idaho, also a boy, and learn the hatred that is the root of all his swordsman's skill and passion. We meet schemers behind the Emperor's throne. We learn how the Landsraad congress functions. But the prose lacks the pointed clarity of Dune, and it especially lacks the in-depth explorations of the characters. A second book by this duo, also based on notes, has been published. I hope they managed to spend more time polishing it. I'm a little reluctant to buy it."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Based on a lot of reviews here, I delayed picking these books up and reading them for myself. They're actually quite good. I agree with many of the reviewers that this series lacks the depth and complexity of the original novels, but is it actually fair to measure the value of these books against a standard of one of the greatest imaginative works ever created? With the exception of a couple of stupid ideas (introducing Feng Shu to the Dune universe), these books are entertaining and enjoyable reading, probably best suited for readers already familiar with their context and willing to simply enjoy a pleasant re-visit to the worlds of Dune without overanalyzing every detail."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"In this book, the authors take us back to the events that will ultimately lead to Frank Herbert's Dune. Indeed the novel seems focused on introducing and explaining all characters that will play an important role in the future. Without Paul Atreides and Arrakis, most of the original book's underlying mixture of religion, politics and sociology are lost, though the authors make a valiant attempt at preserving the original wheels-within-wheels plots that seem to involve all characters. Unfortunately it all seems straightforward. Thus, the book carries an enormous scope in characters and complexity. It's pace never quickens enough for the addictive reaction and it's ultimate conclusion is anti-climatic. Opposing Frank Herbert's genius at dropping subtle hints about the characters' machinations and goals that always left us hanging on his every word and more often than not re-reading passages to appreciate his mastery, here the characters reveal their thoughts and plots every step of the way. But it's unfair to compare it to Dune. I found the book interesting, shedding light to the politics in the Empire before Muad'Dib. It's entirely devoted towards the original Dune, though. A worthy addition to the saga but I'm afraid only fans of the original series may find it enjoyable. As I said, if you haven't read the original saga it might get slow an unappealing. After you get hooked on spice, though, you'll come around to this books searching for gems of insight."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I tend to ignore other critiques of novels but I was thoroughly surprised at the uprising on both sides of this book. I have been a Dune fan since the early 70's. I have read and re-read everything (and I do mean everything) that Frank Herbert has ever written and published. For those out there who think that this is the first book that Brian has ever written relating to his Father's work, that is incorrect; he co-authored a book with his father (before Frank Herbert's death) titled &quot;Man Of Two Worlds.&quot; It is a gripping and sometimes hilarious science fiction novel. It was during this co-authorship that Brian and Frank began discussing co-writing the Dune Prequels as well as Dune 7 (as yet untitled). Brian Herbert has all of his fathers notes and know precisely where Frank Herbert wanted to go with the story as well as where the Dune Universe should begin (which brings us to Dune: House Atreides). It is precisely where it should be in the series. It is accurate in the extreme as to technology and where the characters in the original Dune Series are supposed to be. I have read, and re-read the series and then gone back and re-read House Atreides. I find the book exciting and well planned (i.e. I can see the ground-work for the next two prequels developing). I hope that everyone will read this novel first and not read the reviews here (including mine). Then come back and see if you agree with what others have written. Enjoy."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This prequel to _Dune_ is apparently based on Herbert Sr.'s notes and vision for the series, tragically unfulfilled.If you loved Herbert Sr.'s style, I regret to let you know that you won't find it here. There was only one Frank Herbert. After reading _House Atreides_ I'm glad Herbert Jr. and Anderson went ahead and wrote in their own style, which is smooth, enjoyable and interesting._Dune_ fans will like the meatiness and direct relevance of the story to the later books. The majority of characters here are familiar to _Dune_ readers. Portrayals are consistent (of course, we see them all in younger years; the timeframe of the book is roughly that of the accession of Shaddam IV). In fact, I really hadn't anticipated that the portrayals would be as good as they are, so that was one of several pleasant surprises.Heartily recommended to those who want more _Dune_. Devotees of Herbert Sr.'s unique style won't find more of it here, but it's still good SF."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I'll be brief and blunt ... it seem to me like Brian Herbert is trying to ride on the coattails of his father's past successes towards financial success. The sad thing is that he seems to be succeeding, because this series is selling well, despite being (IMNSHO) [b]exceedingly mediocre and uninspired.[/b]These books basically seem crafted to take advantage of the old saw about pizza [i]\\"it's a lot like sex ... even when it's bad, it's still pretty good\\"[/i]. And that's pretty much the only reason why I bothered to read the rest of this series, after being bored almost to tears by book 1 ... [i]it's still Dune[/i]. Unfortunately, it's a very disappointing series when judged against the powerful intellectual sweep and eco-cult religious edginess of the original series.My advice, to those who are not already hopeless Dune addicts, is to avoid the entire prequel series for the [b]opportunistic mass-market fluff[/b] that it is, and stick with the originals masterpieces by his father, Frank Herbert. You'll get 10x the literary bang for your hard-earned bucks that way, trust me.I'll give Brian a B for effort, and a D- for results."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I started this book with pretty high expectations. I knew it couldn't be as good as the original Dune books, but my father had assured me they were still good, albeit with a faster pace and less philosophizing.To be honest, it was kind of horrible.I still read it, and I'm planning on reading the rest of the Brian Herbert books, but it was a severe letdown. The writing reminded me of a story I had written in middle school. The author incessantly kept stating and re-stating the obvious, with no regards for subtlety at all. The dialogue is often stiff: its very informative (overly so), but does not seem realistic or in character at all.The stories (there are four or five going on at once) are quite clever and fill in the void before the first Dune quite nicely. The plots are what keeps any credibility to these books (probable because of Frank Herbert's files). However, the multiple plots, though lively and interesting, are the biggest perpetrators of Brian Herbert's re-stating habit. Every time he switches back to a previous plotline, the basic premises and descriptions are laid down again every time.Overall: immature and disappointing writing, with no flair or depth whatsoever of the originals, but a nicely fast-paced story to add to the Dune history."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune: House Atreides is a decent read, an enjoyable trip back to the world of Dune. The authors have done a respectable job of explaining the past that leads up to the original Dune, with some good characters and plenty of action. As with the original there are multiple plots, each with the power to stand on its own and at times weaving through the others.The story is somewhat hampered by weak writing; Mr. Anderson (whom I assume does the actual writing) is overly fond of starting sentences with prepositional phrases and gerunds. The pattern quickly becomes repetitive and distracting.The story is missing some of the original drama, especially the plot threads that relate to Arrakis. There isn't the sense of mystery and desperation on that planet that made the original Dune so exciting. In some scenes the planetologist is casually sipping spice coffee, as if there were plenty of water there.But I still found the story to be fun. Despite its weaknesses, who can resist a twenty-thumper journey into the deep desert on the back of a sand worm? I think most fans will probably enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I found myself staying up late to read more! The characters were very well developed -- including the planet Dune, which is a character itself. The plot was intricate, weaving one storyline with another, but without being difficult to follow. As in the other Dune novels, there is plenty of medieval-style intrigue, between the different Houses of the Empire as well as with the Bene Gesserit and the techno-heretical Tleilax. It was nice to get to know Leto Atriedes and Pardot Kynes in their younger years.Reading this book took me back to my high school years when I first read Dune. It felt good to have a novel sweep me away to another world again."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have read a number of the comments that people have written on this page and realized that, unlike the original Dune series written by Frank Herbert, these new prequel books may not &quot;stand alone&quot; as some people would like them too. I suggest that everyone wait and read ALL of the books in the prequel before they opine about anything. I'm sure that when DUNE itself first came out people didn't see how it would fit in the Sci Fi universe but after 5 more books and a somewhat random movie, they finally understood what Frank Herbert was trying to say. So just wait and see..."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This is a prequel written by Frank Herbert's son, Brian and Kevin Anderson. It takes place during the Old Duke's (Leto) coming of age and tells us about the Atreides, the Harkonnens, the Ix and a little more about the Navigation Guild. This novel is a good telling of the history surrounding Dune. It is more accessible and, thus, less intimating than the Dune series. It seems that it would be a good introduction to Dune, but it is not quite up to the master. I will be reading House Harkonnen and House Corrino."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"For a Dune fan, House Atreides is a fun read. You get to find out all sorts of interesting history about many of the great characters from the original. The plot is extremely complicated, but not so much that you can't understand what's going on.My main cricism with the book is that it lacks the depth and style of the original series by Frank Herbert. The writing style is simple - basically just plot and characters. There's not a whole lot of depth to any of the characters, and it lacks the philosophical and political insights of the original. Still, the storyline is engaging enough to keep you reading, and it's fun it find out some of the past events that led up to the original novel. You get to find out, for example, why the Baron is so fat (it's not just from eating too much, if that's what you're thiking). I think this is a worthy read for any Dune fan - but it should not be read before the original."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've read through some of the other reviews, which mostly seem to be written by several described \\"die-hard\\" Dune fans who felt that this book didn't live up to their unrealistic expectations. Well, I believe that I should qualify as a \\"die-hard\\" fan myself--I did read all six of the original books and was quite disappointed that Frank Herbert died before he could write the sequel to Dune: Chapterhouse--but I actually LIKED this book. I think that most fans will appreciate having more of the background story and thus will devour all three of the prequel books as I have. So what if the writing quality doesn't quite live up to Frank Herbert's? This is not something I even noticed (it was mentioned in other reviews), but regardless, it's the Dune CONCEPT that is so amazing, and Herbert's son and co-writer have done a great job with it. I think that any REASONABLE Dune fan will love this book and the two follow-up prequels as well--you just need to read them with an open mind!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As someone who's never read Frank's works (or hardly any science fiction at all), and remembers next to nothing about the movie, I have to say that as novels go, House Atreides is a reasonably fun read. It doesn't purvey much of a sense of originality, however much it borrows from its predecessors. The plot and style are sadly standard for a &quot;youth&quot; book, and it's a little odd when the book deals with adult themes, like it can't find its audience.I got the book from someone who didn't finish it, who had gotten it from someone else who didn't want to finish it (sf fans both), which is never a good sign. I did finish it, and enjoyed it enough to consider looking at House Harkonnen, and then go on to Frank's stuff. I can't speak for his fans, but anyone else will probably be bored by the first 100 pages or so, and find the whole thing just a little light. The authors seem a little wary of taxing their readers with any depth to chew on while their waiting for action to pick up, and I found myself glancing briefly at paragraphs after the drama begins, which is something you'd expect from the cheap, dime-a-dozen paperbacks that get the lion's share of the sf/fantasy section at the bookstore. While there is a demand for that sort of thing, a Dune book (or any outstanding fiction) should strive for a little more permanence. If not for it's heritage and subject matter, I think House Atreides would be held no higher than the rank and file of sf."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Writing a book against Frank Herbert's masterpiece is no easy task. The authors make a valiant attempt and come away with something that's a nice Saturday afternoon read, but nothing that I'd re-read again and again (as I have Dune).The most disappointing thing is that the book just kind of falls apart at the end. There's no punch. No sense of &quot;Wow&quot; when you put it down. All kinds of setup is done for the next book in the series, but since it's a shallow attempt...the interest just doesn't carry."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have to admit, I wolfed this book down. It was nice to be back in the Dune world.But the quality of the writing left much to be desired. There's a lot more Caricature Developement vs. character development.You know, the Barron is a sick-o (he's so sick there's no way he could really be a credible threat!). Leto is just sooo noble. The Freeman as sooo free! On and on."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've reading and re-reading the Dune books of Frank Herbert so many times, that I know all the characters as part of my friends. Usualy I read in italian, but since the novel is not available in my language I went through the book in english. This book isn't one of the originals, but it brings you back to the planet of Arrakis with a very good aproach. The story is good and, since it's a precuel, you already know where thing will conduce you at the end of the trilogy. I felt my self home travelling again through the sands of Dune, and learning about the characters that will be older during the original books. The stories of Duncan Idaho, C'Tair, etc are well developed. I substance it's a good book that has to be read by any Dune fan."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Brian Herbert is the son of Frank Herbert creator of Dune Saga. Brian and Kevin Anderson start with this book a difficult mission: revisit Dune's universe describing the events immediately preceding Dune, the first & unforgettable volume of the famous saga.Did they succeed? Well, yes and... no. Yes because they deliver an interesting first step with all the elements of this fascinating universe; and no because the story is not as gripping as the original Dune.Nevertheless Dune's fans (as me) should not be too disappointed because even Frank Herbert wasn't at the same height when writing Dune Messiah, Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune and he will recover allure only with the last two books of the series.So let us hope the same will happen with Brian & Kevin efforts!The variety of themes touched by the original series is still present in this book: ecology, political-religious interaction, genetic manipulation, longevity drugs and secret sisterhoods and brotherhoods.The story is as follows.The Scenery.There is a Galactic Empire ruled by the Emperor. There are powerful Noble Houses that rule different planetary systems and confront each other in endless struggle, yet subject to strict rules. There is a Guild of interstellar Pilots. There is the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood following their eugenic plans and playing in backstage as advisors to all powers. Computers & AI are forbidden and replaced by human-computers called Mentat. Arrakis is Desert Planet inhabited by mysterious desert dwellers: the Fremen.The Argument.Consist of several threads that will mingle and interact thru the present book and the intended continuations.A very young Leto heir of Noble House Atreides is being educated by his father Duke Paulus.The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood following their eugenic plans is approaching their goal: to produce a male specimen that will surpass all their limitations and fulfill their mission.Execrable Baron Vladimir head of Noble House Harkonnen, Atreides' ancestral enemy, is in command of Arrakis and planning mischievous deeds.Prince Shaddam, the Emperor's son & heir and his intimate Fenring are getting bored of Emperor Elrood's long life and planning to shorten it.Noble House Vernius, masters of point technology, had developed a new cruiser that will cut Emperor's income, incurring in his wrath.All these elements and more, much more are deployed skillfully by the authors, giving way to an interesting narration.I recommend this book to sci-fi lovers and general public too.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As can be seen when taking a look at the hundreds of other reviews of this title here at Amazon.com, this collaborative work by Frank Herbert's son and Kevin Anderson is to some extent controversial.In part, this is a result of the complexity of the plots Frank Herbert weaved in the original series, as well as the mystery in which some of the past preceeding the time span covered by his Dune series was shrouded.This title is the first in a trilogy prequel, which elaborates on some of the events that eventually are covered in Frank Herbert's six \\"Dune\\" books.While Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" are great works of Science Fiction, to some readers they were not readily accessible. The slightly more simplistic approach chosen here will allow new readers who are not yet acquainted with Dune to familiarize themselves with the variety of characters and plots which later are at the core of Frank Herbert's works.Especially in light of the cable mini series \\"Frank Herbert's Dune\\" and \\"Children of Dune\\", this trilogy can help to provide readers whose interest in Dune was sparked by these made for TV movies with easier access to Frank Herbert's works."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"What i found most distrubing is the attempt to explain everything in the Dune Universe. For example, Herbert et al explain in detail how the guild actually folds space or how the baron became fat. In the Dune chronicles, the mystery was half the fun. Too bad Herbert didnt use this opportunity to create his own prequel universe instead of being regimented to follow his father's story. Still its entertaing :)"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Let me start by saying this; it is not Frank Herbert's Dune. I did not expect it to be when I bought it. Those who expect it to be as excitingly fulfilling as any book in the Dune Chronicles are greatly mistaken. I find this novel to be a great SF novel. What I like most about it is the way it presents characters you havent read about in years, and it brings back those memories.

I truly recomend you read this book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"There is of course no way to match the original novel, and yet I found this book to be simply wonderful.

Fortunately, both Brian Herbert(son of Dune creator, Frank Herbert) and Kevin J.

Prelude to Dune is the first trilogy of the Dune saga, consisting of three chapters, and it starts off with House Atreides. Like most Dune novels,this prequel has lots of interesting and well-developed characters; some old characters we have known make a comeback while the rest of them are quite new and sometimes unique in many ways. House Atreides is also huge in scope; some scenes remind me of Star Wars which isn't a terrible thing to say. Yet, the greatest aspect of this novel is the storyline which reveals more about the feud between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, the creation of a god-child, Kwisatz Haderach by the Bene Gesserit, the war between the Tleilaxu and Ix and more. Overall, House Atreides serves some of the most exciting action sequences ever which may never fail to please even a royal Dune fan. Brian Herbert is indeed a worthy successor to Frank Herbert, and I expect more Dune novels from Brian and Kevin. We all know House Atreides isn't 'Dune'; at least it is certainly 'Prelude to Dune'."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I love this book...and yes I am a Star Trek fan...There is nothing wrong with that...as some reviewers might say. The language is modern and easy to follow. It fills many many holes left open by the original series. It makes me appreciate Dune universe even more. Only Hyperion series kept me more on the edge. Thanks to Herbert family for your efforts past and present."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is necessary to understand the inner workings of the entire Dune saga. With this, we can see glimpses into the future of many important figures of &quot;Dune&quot; through how they were while younger, such as Leto &amp; Duncan as boys, Shaddam's rise to power, &amp; why Kynes started his work on Arrakis. The flow of action is beautifully crafted - espescially the events leading up to &amp; during Leto's trial - &amp; the the descriptions of important locales such as Kaitain, Caladan, &amp; Giedi Prime put anything shown in the movie &quot;Dune&quot; to shame. I'm glad i read this book before attempting to compare the book to the movie &quot;Dune&quot; because otherwise i would have been sadly disappointed."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I enjoyed it even if it wasn't &quot;pure&quot; Dune. They gave it a good shot. But, there are still alot of unanswered questions and intrigues left hanging. Does this mean another book will be written?"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Great read! Continues with the facinating Dune universe and even manages to expand upon many aspects of it.If you liked Dune for the mystery of the future culture and civilization then don't read this, it answers many questions about the different factions and houses.My only complaint is that in the authors' attempts to make the series more readily avaliable to first time readers it heavily indicates and repeats certain key plot points (ie the importance of Spice, Dune... etc)But overall a great addition to the Dune story and universe."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've read a lot of reviews bashing this book and comparing it unfavorably to Frank Herbert's series, and I know that a lot of people are going to disagree with me on this, but this book and &quot;House Harkonnen&quot; are superior to Frank Herbert's series. While it's true that if you buy it with the expectation that it will be another volume in the style of the Dune sequels you are in for a bit of disappointment, in my opinion this is a good thing.The original &quot;Dune&quot; was one of my favorite fantasy novels, but the rest of them never quite caught my imagination in the right way. Having &quot;House Atreides&quot; and &quot;House Harkonnen&quot; to compare them to, the reasons for this are abundantly clear. This is what the original series should have been, and its strengths make visible the weaknesses of Frank Herbert's writing.&quot;House Atreides&quot; and &quot;House Harkonnen&quot; are exciting. They are adventurous. They have well-rendered characters you will love and/or hate, not just feel ambivalent towards. They do not shroud themselves in mysteries and attempt to make you feel the Soul-Crushing Weight of Destiny. They do what the original series never did: give you the background, the excitement and the character development that help you to really appreciate the story.If you want more of the philosophical rambling of a later Frank Herbert book, characters as bland as Emperor Paul in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; or as unlikeable as Leto II, or a self-referential story arc with no identifiable value, do not read this. But if you want what the original &quot;Dune&quot; almost had and the sequels didn't, this is worth your time."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I would like to add a point to those reviwers who stated that the House Atreides is not a real Dune book. In none of Frank Herbert's work are there characters in the same book who are similar to each other. Here, there are several, whom a less careful reader might easily confuse."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I enjoyed reading all of the \\"House\\" trilogy. Mostly, I wanted to write this review because of all the wackos out there who have written personal attacks against Brian Herbert for \\"raping his father's grave,\\" etc... Get a grip people!These books are written by different authors and will of course, be of a different style. Keeping the obvious in mind while reading these books is a good thing to remember."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book weaves an intricate storyline which not only stands fully on its own, but works in tantilizing glimpses of your favorite character's beginnings. A studly, fashionable Baron Harkonnen? A Harkonnen daughter? Oh yeah, the foundations for the Dune series come from believable, but unexpected directions. I pity those other reviewers who actually expected some kind of Dune 0.5 beta, rehash of what's already been written. I read this book in two days, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Well, I just finished the book, and I must say I was totally immersed and couldn't put it down! I have read and re-read the entire Dune series over 12 times, and frankly did not have high expectations for this book, as Frank Herbert was not the author. I've have been fortunate enough to read Frank Herbert's notes on Dune, in the archives of Cal State Fullerton while I was a student there, so I consider myself an avid Dune fan. I recommend you buy and read this book if you are a fan of Dune and the Imperium. It's great background material for the original series, and an excellent tale of intrigue and coming of age. It's a great read, and I can't wait for House Harkonnen! I'm inspired to read the entire Dune series again...now, where did I leave that copy of Dune??"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I haven't yet read the Dune books by Frank Herbert. I plan to now that I've finished this one, if only to prove to myself that the most popular sci-fi novel of all time must be better than this. I'm not saying that the book doesn't have it's high points, but my main problem is with the writing style itself, which is, at times, unbearably campy, shallow and poor. Emotion, character development, action and description are all carried out in ways that, at times, literally made me put the book down out of frustration. It's tough to describe, but it was sort of like watching an incredibly bad, cheesy movie. This is a matter of personal taste, I know, and the plot itself is well carried out (with skeptical moments and inconsistent characters) and managed to interest despite the writing. This book has some elements of a great book, namely the worlds contained within, the creatures, creativity and vision, but I think those are mostly taken from Brian Herbert's father's work. This can be said, though; this book got me interested enough in the Dune universe that I'm looking forward to reading the other Dune books, which, supposedly, are carried out with more skill."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Reasonably well written by two talented individuals, with some good ideas (but I wonder what F. Herbert would think). BUT: Unlike Herbert senior's ability to keep disparate plot threads fairly relevant and synchronized, this book is a bit muddled and disjointed and even plods in places. It's hard to see how they can keep a trilogy going at this pace. But with K.J. Anderson's experience with pace and action, that could change. Though Brian Herbert will have to ensure it remains a true collaboration and not let Anderson, with the best of intentions, create a Star Wars-like space opera set in a Frank Herbert universe. No, I'm not trying to pigeon hole KJA, but his style IS a distinctive one. Still, we should not expect these writers to create a 'Duncan Idaho-Herbert' clone. And the signs are favorable that they will not. I give the men a B-minus."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"At first I was very concerned if the Brian Herbert and Mr. Anderson could pull off such a challenging endeavor. I was pleasantly surprised that they did it without much trouble at all. I enjoyed seeing the Dune Universe come alive again. These two talented authors left an avenue available for another book following House Atreides, yet in the authors notes in the back of their book they talk about the incredibly challenging task of finishing what the original author left unfinished by his untimely death. They plan to write the next book after ChapterHouse Dune. I can't wait. Best of luck to them and I hope their next endeavor won't keep me in the edge of my seat too long. I loved it!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Having read most of the previous reviews, it seems everyone either loves or hates this book.I loved it.But it's not Frank Herbert, which seems to be the most common criticsm, that it doesn't read like the original, how can it! It's a different guy that's writing it.Anyway, the plot isn't as complex as Dune, so you shouldn't expect it to have the same depth, but that doesn't make it a bad read. The plot is well-paced, descriptive and although the narrator can be too literal at times, I never got bored reading it. I think that what makes the book a good read is that it delves into the background of the characters in more detail than was possible in Dune, as it was dealing more with the preceding generation, and more especially with Paul, and some of the best characters in Dune were killed off, or appeared far too infrequently, so it was nice to have a chance to read more about them, whether it's in the style of Frank Herbert or not."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This new book from the universe of Dune is some of what I read in the negative reviews and some of what I read in the positive reviews. I am surprised at the number of reviews which disect the story so ruthlessly. I enjoyed it, even with its flaws and I look forward to future efforts by these two authors. They are doing a competent job in expanding our view of the Dune universe. I will buy the next Dune book and the next, regardless of the nay-sayers and negative attitudes shown by those without the ability to &quot;get into&quot; the world of Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I guess it has become hip to come down on prequels. Hey folks, both the Phantom Menace and Dune: House Atreides are not that bad. Don't be fickle and fall into what a some booklist says or some critic spouts off because they want to be cool. Grand in scope like Dune? No. Rambling, confusing prose that will lose the wierdest of the wierd? No. What you do get is a plainly written, factual prequel of what takes place before Dune. In this book we gets to see the origns of Duke Leto, Duncan Idaho, Baron Harkonnen, Mother Superior Gaius Helen Mohaim among others. I really don't understand what is so wrong with this book. I have read it straight through and I find it an entertaining yarn. It certanly answers many questions that I had about the Dune books. Not the greatest novel ever written, but a solid read that does not deserve the Lynchesque scorn and derision it has received."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I'm surprised at the level of vitriol in some of the reviews here. As one who always thought the elder Herbert's writing style somewhat, shall we say, overwrought, I find the breezy style of the prequel refreshing. No, it is not perfectly true to the original, but so what? Some of the later books in the DC were pretty awful, GEOD being perhaps the worst. Sheesh, you'd think that some of the reviewers here had had their religion attacked. Dune was a great novel, but the sequels were just sequels...and a gravy train for father Frank just as the prequels might be for son Brian. I recommend this for the entertainment value, not for perfect adherence to the details of the Dune universe, something that only a true geek would worry about anyway. Gee, I hope I don't start another jihad...P.S. Phantom Menace? Haven't seen it and I don't plan to. Star Wars is mental junk food and that's all it ever was. Get past puberty, people."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was very wary about reading this book, because Frank Herbert was such a masterful dramaticist, and the Anderson/Brain Herbert Dune short story was so bad. However, I found that I couldn't put this book down. I take this book not as an official part of the Dune Chronicles, but rather in the sense of the movie, which it resembles in many ways (several descriptions are lifted right out of the movie, but this has precedent, as Frank Herbert did the same in CHAPTERHOUSE). Brian Herbert has always been more of a humorous writer than his father, and this shows in the comic characters in DUNE: HOUSE ATREIDES. Kynes seemed quite out of character as a bungling, absent-minded professor type. There are some -what I would call- errors in the book. For example, I don't think Leto's father, referred to in DUNE as &quot;the Old Duke,&quot; should be called &quot;the Old Duke&quot; while he's still living- he was obviously called &quot;the Old Duke&quot; in DUNE because he was the PREVIOUS duke. This could just be a pet peeve of mine, but it irked me. More importantly, there was technology in this book that didn't seemingly exist until the last two Dune novels. The authors had better destroy or hide this technology in their following books, or else there will be gaping inconsistencies. Following these critical comments, why then am I giving the book 5 stars? Because it DOES add to the mythology of Dune, in the sense that the movie DUNE did. Myths change and transform every day. When this process stops, it usually dies (read some of Levi-Strauss' work on mythology). As Frank Herbert believed, Time will judge all."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"House atreides was the first Dune novel i ever read, Infact it was the first sci-fi book I ever read, Infact it was one of the first books i read since i left primary school ten years ago! I never imagined myself being so absorbed by a book, but it was this a book hundreds of pages of writing something id always ignored or perhaps been afraid of that had me captured. I was amazed by the way i really felt i was there had a vision in my mind of what all the charactures looked like, and had emotions that were based on the way the story opened up in front of me. Well anyway the imagination needed to create such a atmosphere to even the most illiterate of people speaks for itself. I am now reading house harkonnen and am once again enjoying two seperate lives! Thank you Frank and Brian herbert and not forgetting Kevin.j.Anderson."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Before I read Dune: House Atreides, I read the reviews of the Book in the Boston Globe first. They said something similar to the fact that &quot;the book did not ruin the Dune series, but it did not add anything to it either&quot;. After reading the book myself I have to respectfully disagree with their assessment of the book. I thought this book was great, and I was very much a skeptic going into it. I am now very much looking forward to reading the sequel to &quot;Chapter House Dune&quot; which Brian mentioned he is proposing to write at the end of this novel. I must admit I was weary of a famous father's son trying to pick up his father's work and running with it. You never know if they are just trying to make a buck off of their father's name. Brian, after reading this novel I see that is not the case, and that you really must love this story. Your father would be proud."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Cynically, I had low expectations for this book. How could anyone write a prequel to such a superb novel as the orignal Dune?Not only was I pleasantly surprised but I was delighted. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and felt inspired to reread the entire Dune series again. Be warned that this is a risk you will have to be prepared to take.The book really did give further depth to the characters from the original and explained their motivation and history in an interesting and entertaining way. I would certainly recommend it to any lover of science fiction generally and anyone who enjoyed the original Dune series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Storyline- B+. It could've been exciting if FH dictated it, because it is a good story, but the writing was monotonous. There was frequent sidetracks with obvious information repeated again and again.Writing- D-. Paragraphs full of 3rd person thoughts that are so irrelevant. Hardly any dialouge. Chapters average about 3-6 pages long and ALWAYS switch to a new place every time. Characters are &quot;paper thin&quot; as another reviewer put it.There are some parts in the book that are exciting and almost feel like Dune but it really comes off like a book for a 12 or 13 year old. It took me a good 2 months to finish it because I had to force myself to read through it. I really wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but I heard the same thing from people and I still read it anyway. The next book in the series will be better, have hope."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book lacks the complexity of emotion and Frank Herbert's remarkably keen insight into human nature that made the original Dune such an amazing book. However it is imminently readable if not the masterpiece on what it is based. And because it is faithfully set in one of the richest and most beloved universes in the science-fiction canon it is transformed from a pleasant piece of fiction into a joyous undertaking. Highly recommended to anyone who has been enchanted by Arrakis and the universe within which it is contained."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"So, after reading down through some of the customer reviews (Stilgar...chill out !How 'bout if *I* decide what to read? ) I must agree that you'll either love the book or hate the book. Personally, I loved it, enjoying it more that any of the sequels to DUNE, as I originally fell in love with the *characters* in DUNE as much as the storyline. It was nice to revisit the originals, even though there were omissions that I wish had been covered. Realizing that room has been left for additional prequel material, I can only hope for more background on Gurney Halleck, Wellington Yueh, the Lady Jessica, and the grown-up Duncan Idaho (someone please help me here... isn't Mt. Idaho named after the aforementioned Duncan Idaho? If so, then why is there a Mt. Idaho on the map in House Atreides? )The truly disappointing part for me is the rather obvious attempt to provide literary background descriptions for the characters as depicted in that GODAWFUL move of the same name; i.e. the descriptions of the Guild Navigators, the pre-description of Baron Harkonnen, Rabban, Thufir Hawat, etc. Well, maybe if they make another movie, they'll do it right this time. In short, it's a lovely read, unless you go into it expecting the original."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"What a great read Dune House Atreides is.The original Dune novel established a universe created by Frank Herbert that is revisited by authors Brian Herbert(Frank's son) and Kevin J. Anderson. Dune House Atreides is set in time approximately one generation before the original novel takes place. The reader is introduced to familiar(and unfamiliar) characters that become the main players in this part 1 of 3 Prequel Trilogy. Right from the opening chapter we are taken on a fast paced ride that gives insight to the many beginnings of friends and foes in the struggle to control spice. Anyone unfamiliar with the Dune universe can pick this book up and instantly become engrossed in it. Fans of the &quot;Duniverse&quot;(like me), can finally rejoice with the release of great new material that expands the greatest sci fi story ever told."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I am disappointed. There is not much action. A lot of stuff gets repeated, over and over. It has given me an appetite to read again (fourth time?) Dune, but this one can be skipped"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I am listening to the audio version of the Dune House series (Atredies, Harkonnen and Corrinos)This series has many virtues and many faults. There are certainly good reasons why the Dune books have become a legend of sorts, and has set a standard for imaginative and complex science fiction fantasy. And there are many reasons why the creative majesty was nearly ruined for me.First, the series is amazing in the complexity of the universe created, the political intrigue and the number of individualized and self motivated people and races. The premise that all complex, artificial brains (ie complex computers) makes for very intriguing settings and plots. The ways in which people have created off shoots into different cultures and even physical and metal characteristics is imaginative and very interesting. The complex web of self interest, political motivations, loyalties, betrayals and kinship makes for a really fascinating and gripping read. I have listened to both House Harkonnen and its predecessor, House Atredies, with much enjoyment, unable at times to put them down.Second, though, the many flaws in the characterization and the portrayal (or simple lack of portrayal) of women, homosexuals and non-white races has left me with an increasing negative opinion to the effect that it is a growing irritation to the point that if I had not already bought the third book, I don't think I would have. Characters are stupid, overly dramatic, and constantly shocked that the bad guys are so bad or annoyed that the good guys are so good.The woman in this universe cannot head the great Houses, and cannot hold positions of power in government or apparently their personal relationships. They are relegated to being wives married off for alliances, purchased and \\"BOUND\\" concubines, or objects used to illustrate the evil of the antagonists through torture and rape. They are often self serving, conniving, manipulative and deceitful for purely selfish reasons, putting themselves and their wants/beliefs over the lives of their fathers, husbands, brothers and children, and essentially bringing themselves and their loves ones down in ruin. They are in effect reduced to snakes in the grass. In addition, all the wives and concubines are drop dead gorgeous super models, even the ones bought by or married to twisted, evil, ugly men. These women are trained in the sexual arts and raised to be concubines and wives only. And the women of the Fremen are only chattel or prices to be won, given to those who kill their husbands or to the brothers if their husbands die from other means.The only characters at all that I can think of, or have noticed since paying attention throughout this entire second book, are all white. I can think of one character, a VERY minor weapons trainer who had dark skin. There are no other colors or races presented, even though dark skin and hair are dominant gene traits and would not have been lost down the centuries. And, any race not of the straight and tall and white variety, are portrayed as misshapen, twisted and evil by design.And, the only homosexual character is a brutal beast of a man bent on torture, murder and mutilation, who leaves the bodies of the boys he kills to rot in his rooms for visitors to see. This man expresses both revulsion and condescension to any and all women he encounters.And, as so many other reviewers have noted, the writing is amateurish and sometimes laughable. As another reviewer noted, when a character put \\"wrinkling substances\\" on his skin, I laughed. When something was described as \\"jury-rigged\\", I also laughed. But by the time I got to such things as \\"roly-poly\\" I wasn't laughing.As others have also commented on, the plot just doesn't make sense when related to the origin Dune book. I had at first thought it was just me. It had been a while since I had read the Dune book, and I have watched movies and TV series more recently, so I thought I was just remembering wrong. Nope, things don't line up, they don't make sense, and its frustrating. Its disappointing. The whole series so far as been disappointing.Overall, the books have been good reads, up until the novelty of such a great and complex world wore off and the prejudice framework shows through. The writing is not too horrible and the plot is surprising enough and face paced enough to keep my interest, but honestly, if the sexist/racist/homophobic themes continue, and I see no reason to hope they won't, what good opinion I have of this series will most likely be dashed.SPOILER ALERT:Some specific examples:The only women with any semblance of power are the Bene Jesuit, who train in mental discipline and fighting skills and can control their body chemistry to chose how and when to conceive. However, these supposedly strong powers only put them in positions of power behind the scenes through manipulation and deceit. Their whole purpose is to create a messiah (male of course) through a breeding program. I'm tired of women being written as such single minded creatures obsessed with breeding and babies. And, I have seen it argued that Jessica is a strong female character, but she's really not. Take a second look, she has mental skills superior to the untrained, yet she defers to \\"her Duke\\" in every decision and actions even to the effect of retreated hurt and teary eyed if he is angered by her advise. She has been raised and trained by the Bene Jesuit to be the grandmother of the messiah, ordered to have a girl child. Yet, she forsakes all her training, her family, her sisters of the Bene Jesuit and gives \\"her Duke\\" a son to replace the one he lost. She forsakes all her training and her oaths, breeding and training for the love of \\"her Duke\\". Meanwhile, Duke Atredies is written as strong and valiant and righteous for putting his people and his House first and not marrying for love, to in face not love at all if it gets in the way of his duty. Therefore, the actions of a women forsaking all for love is portrayed as the most virtuous actions a woman can take while the same actions in a man are seen as weak and undesirable.And, we are also given an example of two women who are so self serving and selfish and vindictive that they would arrange to have their husbands killed! Both Leto Atredies' mother and his lover arrange for the murder of the fathers of their children for selfish and self serving reasons. Both use underhanded and treacherous means manipulating others to help them, with bribery or sex."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"i anticipated this book only because i wanted to read more.i wasnt looking for FHs writing style or even a return to the complex and dense information available in each chapter.honestly, after reading god emperor, every dune book was like a cake walk.i really had no interest in the history of the atreides. i was more interested in the origins of jessica, gurney, and duncan.there was a lot to digest in this book and perhaps it deserves another read but it wasnt my favorite.i was more interested in house harkonnen.overall, this is more stories in the universe i love. im content with reading more about the characters i grew to love over the past 15 years. but i certainly dont have the time to pick all these books apart."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I knew that this book would be good when we were introduced to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, a &quot;lean, muscular, handsome man.&quot; All Dune fans should definitely check out Dune: House Atreides, and those who have never read the classic Frank Herbert series would find this the perfect place to start. This novel answers many questions about the history of some of the most real, three-dimensional characters out of science fiction. The Bene Tleilax, Ix, Shaddam's ascension to the throne, Duncan Idaho and the reason why he hate the Harkonnens, Lady Jessica's origins are just a few of the things revealed. The great thing is that while the book answers some questions, it just poses others. While this is not a perfect book, it is a good book. Of course it will not be exactly the same as the other Dune novels, different people wrote them, and no one can copy Frank Herbert's definitive style. But Brian and Kevin do an admirable job, and I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Anyone who picks up any 'Dune' novel outside of the first 6 should know by now that these were written by \\"the _LATE_ Frank Herbert\\". However, not unlike J.R.R. Tolkein, Frank Herbert kept meticulous notes, developed unwritten 'histories' and backgrounds for the people, places/planets, and 'things' that made up the story lines that he was able to complete. And, I think that it is fair to say that where Tolkein's 'The Hobbit' is perhaps the greatest fantasy book of all time (although the 'Ring Trilogy' books all give it a run for it's money - they just don't stand alone as well as 'The Hobbit' does.) Similarly, I am a staunch supporter of 'Dune' as being (perhaps) the greatest SF novel of all time, with many of the sequels giving it a run for it's money (although I would still rate several Heinlein novels - 'Time Enough for Love', 'Stranger in a Strange Land', and 'I Will Fear No Evil' - higher than most of the F.H Dune 6.) However, there are some remarkable parallels between several of the 'mature' Heinlein novels and the FH 'Dune' saga, the most obvious being the span of time covered within related books and the more subtle being the use of religious iconoclasm while maintaining a skeptical and/or jaundiced view of (organized) religion.However, I digress; my goal was to compare and contrast the whole of the 'Dune' sagas and those of 'Middle Earth'. You see, Frank and J.R.R. did more than keep meticulous notes while researching their manuscripts; they used their fervent imaginations to weave (what I suppose were mostly bed-time) stories for their children. And, each of the elder writers had a son who was captivated by the stories and in awe of their patriarchs and each of whom ultimately felt that they owed the world more of the stories that their fathers had begun. Where Tolkein had the better of the two deals is that his son (Christopher) was left with an amazing volume of work that required very little modificationn except by way of editing - actually, it was more like piecing together various bits and providing some spit to hold it all together. Brian, on the other hand, felt that he would do more service to his father - and his father's fans - by partnering with a more experienced SF writer and, using his father's notes as fodder, building a set of prequels and sequels that is written more in the style that is amenable to today's (young) SF readers. (After all, the goal of most of the great 20th century SF authors was to stimulate the imagination of the modern youth while inculcating a love of reading even as television became the entertainment medium of choice for far too many kids.)All of that being said, the stuff that Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are cranking out is not the enriching sagas crafted by the late Auteur et Pere, Frank Herbert. However, they are doing for the current generation what Brian's father (and his colleagues) did for mine: they are stimulating the imagination of otherwise tv-addled kids and they are showing them how much more 'Hi-Def' the mental images that arise from pages of black and white can be than the visual ones laid out in Liquid Crystal Display."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I rediscovered that odd rapaciousness that overcame me when reading each of the original Dune books.

The House Atreides book gives the reader a chance to learn about Paul's father Leto and the Atreides family history and gives a sub story to that Corrino Bull head that has the blood on it's horn.Overall, House Atreides is a must read for any Dune fanatic."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I enjoyed getting into young Leto's head. The book seems to be part of a series as it keeps several threads dangling."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dispite enjoying a couple of Kevin J. Andersons other novels I was disappointed with the characters in this book. I thought that they needed more devlopment and lacked the depth that made the original 'Dune' so engrossing. On the other hand the descriptive writing and scean setting was good. All in all I enjoded this book dispite it's flaws."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I am extremely pleases in this book. It gives increased depth and life into characters that that were minor in the original series. I highly recommend it to any lover of the Dune series. I can't wait for the next one -House of Harkonnen."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As a seperate work of science fiction, this book would be quite good. However, because of the fact that it is intended to be part of a previously-written epic, _Dune: House Areides_ falls far short of expectations. It is utterly lacking in Frank Herbert's vision, breadth and scope, and just a few cursory glances at the _Dune Encyclopedia_ reveals several major errors in character backgrounds (Duncan Idaho never lived on Geidi Prime, for example) and numerous other inconsistencies.I suppose no other sci-fi author could ever begin to compete with Frank Herbert on his own turf. It may have been better if this book had not been written. It cannot compare favorably to any of the others in the series, and will always stand in the shadow of the grandeur of Frank Herbert's creation.For a book that is supposedly based on Frank Herbert's notes and &quot;recently discoverd files,&quot; this novel displays surprisingly little insight and/or character and historical knowledge of the series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Sure we all wish Frank Herbert had lived to finish his Dune series, but he didn't and this is the closest you're going to get so just start grinning and bearing it, okay? ;-)If you didn't make it through Herbert's original 6 books, don't start with this one, because the master himself definitely tells the story best, but if you're like me and have read pretty much everything the man ever wrote, just can't possibly get enough Frank Herbert, this is definitely worth your time.Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson do a credible job of bringing Frank Herbert's characters and universe back from the dead. The book is a &quot;prequel&quot; to the original series, and further good news is that there are clear hints that there will be at least one additional prequel book and a &quot;postquel&quot; book as well."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I barely managed to wade two thirds of the way through this book, and skimmed through its sequels. Its hard to believe quite how bad and mismanaged all three Prelude to Dune books are, and how pathetic they are in comparison to Frank Herberts novels. Everything is laughably simplifed, especially some of the most interesting characters- Count Fenring is now just a psycopath, the future Shaddam IV is a vain idiot, Baron Harkonnen is really EVIL in a naff, Bond villain sort of way-and the story plods along, written in an awful pulp sci-fi style that makes a mockery of the Dune tradition. Its as if Brian Herbert and Kevn J. Anderson set out to write a parody of Dune, and if thats the case then they succeeded admirably."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It's been a while since I last read any of the Dune books, but they were so classic that when House Atreides came out, I avoided it since I figured it would never measure it. Well, after tripping it across it at the library, I decided to risk it since it wouldn't involve any money.It turned out that my preconceptions were pretty much correct. Perhaps they were self-fulfilling and I merely got what I expected. Nevertheless, this book just didn't seem to have any of the texture that the original Dune books had, none of the depth. Or in a sound bite, this is &quot;Dune lite&quot;.I imagine that if I was high-school age, a time when I read sf voraciously and was a bit less discriminating, I'd love this. These days I'm a lot more picky, and aside from some from a few sparks in the chapters about Pardot Kynes, this book just didn't do anything for me."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is OK if all you are looking for is a possible history of the events preceding Dune, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. It's written along the lines of the Star Wars type books, and comes across almost like a comic book with very cardboard characters. There are too many references to 20th century pop culture ideas (e.g. feng shui, thinking outside the box, etc...), and it attempts to make all the characters fit in line with their representation in the movie."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I guess if you like a book that spells out the plot at every step of the way .. this one is for you. but the most intriguing part of the original series was watching everything that you thought was going on in the first 80% of the book unfold in front of you to become something totally &quot;Unexpected&quot;. Familiar characters and settings are not enough for me."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I'm the biggest Dune fan, read 10 dune books already but this was my least favorite.

We learn of why Baron Harkonnen hates the Bene Gesserit. We learn the true story of how Duncan Idaho became an honored retainer in the Atreides house and of the death of Leto's father.Worth the [money] I spent for it."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune-dUne, DuNE, DUNE duNEThis book is TERRIFIC.. Start here after Franks original series and you will not regret it-Do not stop until you catch up to Brian's and Kevin's latest books-take a breather and read their newest Paul of Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was quite impressed with this book. It does a wonderful job of exploring the pre-Muad'Dib Duniverse that Herbert only hinted at in the first two books. I think the best scene that illustrates this is Emperor Elrood consulting with the two mentat lawyers.I loved the characterization, and, to be honest, I find that Leto I to be a far more interesting character than his son Paul was. Leto's confidence, sense of duty, compassion, all resonated with me. He is as interesting as Miles Tegg, one of the few male characters that has a soul and a superabundance of guts.The plots and sub-plots worked. You get a feel mor the intricate future milieu that in some ways exceed that of Tolkien's world. You get the feel that everyone and everything has an agenda. And Brian Herbert's writing style is better than his fathers. His syntax and voice are easier on the eye. Reading this book was like floating on a stream.As to the discontinuities, I saw them. It seems like Herbert and Anderson were recasting the book in the light of the 1984 Lynch movie. Since Frank Herbert was involved with this movie, I accept these revision as being canonical. Plus it makes \\"the movie in your mind\\" as you read more vibrant."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Frank Herbert wrote about the next stage in human evolution, this is a book about humans as we know them. While this isn't Herbert Sr. by any means, it's certainly incredible in and of itself."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book, and the others of its ilk by Kevin J. and Brian Herbert, are nothing more (and considerably less) than cashing in on the Dune mystique. It reads like it was written by a wannabe fanboy, and the story has lost all of the Dune \\"magic\\" that Frank Herbert put into his stories. Regardless of whether or not Brian was in on where his father wanted to go with his stories, it's obvious that he (and his \\"assistant/compatriot/whatever\\", Kevin J.) are incapable of living up to those ideas.This book gets by the same way that the new Star Wars prequels have, by riding on the sentimental attachments that fans have for the originals. I got rid of my copies of the House books after reading them, and stopped even thinking about buying any more of these attrocities. If you like Dune at all, just re-read the originals...."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I love Dune and the three prequels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are entertaining and an interesting look at the characters. I have Anderson's Star Wars books and like his writing style - but it is vastly different from Frank Herbert's. If you are looking for the dense prose of the elder Herbert, you will not be pleased with these books. If you are looking for a continuation of the stories simply for entertainment, enjoy."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I thought I'd check out the first of the \\"Dune\\" prequels just to see how it was; although a Dune 'aficionado' (perhaps fan is too strong a word), I didn't run to grab this off the shelf when it first came out over a year ago. This is really a review of this book plus _House Harkonnen_ (which I just finished). Incidentally, all of the prequels are really about Atreides, Harkonnen, and Corrino equally; not to mention the Fremen, Tleilaxu (blech!), Bene Gesserit, and a lot more.It starts off a little unevenly; not *particularly* well-written, and some ham-handed passages serve to jolt one into remembrance that this is not Frank Herbert writing. But it evens out eventually, and gets to be very interesting indeed. A young Leto gets farmed out to Ix for his 'education' and a trial-by-fire results which ultimately culminates in his becoming Duke, 8-year-old Duncan Idaho survives somewhat incredibly against Harkonnen cruelty on Giedi Prime, and Shaddam plots to foreshorten the reign of his father Elrood IX and become Padishah Emperor himself. And that's just the beginning. The action gets to a fever pitch in _House Harkonnen_, and you can bet I'm going to pick up _House Corrino_ to find out how it all gets wrapped up.Basically, most of the plot strands are drawn to show you the background of stuff that happens in _Dune_ itself, so it keeps it interesting for people familiar with the original material. Granted, this prequel material lacks the subtlety and depth of the original novel, but it is certainly more entertaining reading than the incomprehensible \\"Heretics\\" or \\"Chapterhouse\\" (I read those when I was 15, though; maybe I should give them another chance). And some of it is, frankly, incredible. One of the things that irked me about the above-mentioned sequels was the Bene Gesserit being portrayed as unopposable demigods, and this is extrapolated to ridiculous proportions in the prequels (are we really supposed to believe they can make themselves invisible at will just by hiding under a table?). Why doesn't someone just blast them to ribbons with a damn lasgun?Anyway, suffice it to say that the hardcore Dune fan might be disenchanted by the fact that this is definitely not Frank Herbert, but it's solid, entertaining sci-fi in its own right, and though at times garish and grotesque (the Harkonnens are really, really, *really* evil), it's worth reading."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Great read. This book captures something that the movie and TV special couldn't - the society of Dune. The original series of books was made great by the creation of worlds, with political intrigue mixed with action. This book also combines both. There is plenty of action, and at times you will not be able to put the book down, but there is also a lot of detail which gives great background into the various societies and worlds. The reader gts to know so much more about who the characters of the Dune series are and why the relationships were what they are. This book really shows that Frank Herbert had created more than what was actually written in Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The hours that I've spent with the Atreides clan have been a joy, a span of time that took me away from an ordinary life and gave me a part, albeit as a reader/observer and, later, fan in a saga of hope and redemption set in a future that I would never see. When Herbert senior died, I thought that this special place was gone forever. When I learned that the series would continue, I almost wanted it NOT to be true. After all, why would you gild the lily?The verdict? As Lewis Carroll wrote \\"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\\"It works! They're here. A duke. His lady. A Baron. An Emperor. The Bene Gesserit. The Freman. The whole Cast. They're all here and I'm happy.The new book isn't perfect. It drags a little sometimes and sometimes it moves too fast. A few sections seem contrived and occasionally it goes over the top.But who cares? Dune has returned and it's good to have it back.

A great book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is a great read. It is, of course, a prequel to Dune, the Frank Herbert Sr. classic. Although it is not as great a book as the original Dune, I actually liked it better than all of the sequels to Dune written by the original Frank Herbert Sr.The novel takes place in the latter years of the Old Duke's reign on Caladan, the home of House Atreides. It introduces us to the Old Duke, and to Duke Leto Atreides, who we never really get to know in the original Dune, since he gets killed off there fairly soon. Duke Leto is the central character of this novel, and that fact is what makes this a pleasure to read.The story is fast-paced, interesting, and very readable. It was good enough that I have re-read it, and I enjoyed it very much the second time. Recommended."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune is the best series of all time, hands down. The most intelligently and creatively written that it is possible to imagine. When I heard that they were coming out with prequels, I cringed. I half hoped they would be successful -- so I would be lucky enough to get more of this world again -- but I didn't want them to ruin it for me.THEY DIDN'T.They pulled of the incredible feat of giving us something new in the context of something old. And man, did they do a great job. It is written by two authors, one of whom is a son of the original.Different chapters thread through the story in different areas, and it looks like one author took certain threads. Some of the threads are clearly better than others, but all are great.The originality that they come up with was really a feat. They didn't &quot;extend&quot; the original, they created new stuff that is just fantastic, without compromising the later novels.This book is about the House Atreides -- but contains all of the major players from the other houses. Much of the story we already know, but the fleshing out of it was fantastic.My hats off to the authors."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is for the fans. If you love the Dune world and have read all the other books, you will really enjoy this one. You won't get that feeling of revelation like the first time you read Dune, but you won't be able to put in down either."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"You know, after reading all six original books and watching the movie too many times to count, I'd have to say that I know my Dune. So after finally reading House Atreides, I must say that I'm very impressed by what the author's have done. The original six were amazing (Heretics being one of my favorites) and this prequel lived up to my expectations. The tale of Leto Atreides, Shaddam IV, Pardot Kynes, Baron Harkonnen, and Duncan Idaho was stellar. I always felt that I could identify with Leto, and the Harkonnen's were as insidious as ever. Pardot Kynes's journey as planetologist was truly amazing as he integrated with the Fremen. And Duncan Idaho was in top form, even for an 8 year old boy. If you're a Dune fan and you still haven't read this, you've got work to do. If you're a newcomer, it's not a bad place to start, although I would read the original six first. Either way, if you love sci-fi books, this is among my favorites. Can't wait til I finish House Harkonnen."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I first became aquainted with the world of Dune via the movie, and later the 4-hour uncut version. After watching them both a few hundred times and thinking I grasped the concepts pretty well, I picked up Frank Herbert's classic &quot;Dune,&quot; and was blown away.While &quot;Dune&quot; laid the foundation for the entire series, including the mythos, the history, and background of the two major houses in the book, &quot;House Atreides&quot; fills in many blanks about how Emperor Shaddam IV came into power, the history of Vladimir Harkonnen (some of his extracurricular activities were merely hinted at in the movie), and also some deeper history into the dealings between Leto Atreides and other houses.Leto is a young man, his father being the model for the duke he would become by the end of the book. His father is intent on making his experiences varied, in order to enrich his rapport with the people he will eventually rule. In this, he develops compassion, empathy, and determination- once he sets his mind on a task he does not let go. He also is not afraid to stand by those he supports.Supporting characters are spotlighted here and there, such as Rabban, Duncan Idaho, and Pardot Kynes, father of Liet Kynes, and grandfather of Chani. Also, the developing relationship and acceptance of Pardot Kynes into the Fremen is important, and gives an even deeper look into their society.All in all, an excellent prequel, and I doubt I would have picked it up if someone within the Herbert family had not written or cowritten the story. I'm waiting eagerly for the next installment."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"In this novel, Dune: House Atreides, Brian Herbert, son of legendary Frank Herbert, has become a shining figure in the literary world. I enjoyed reading the book with it's thickening plot line because of the way each character's story and events were assigned to one chapter, thus allowing the reader to go from story to story until the end when all the characters were gathered at te Imperial Palace for Leto's Trial-By-Forfeiture and Shaddam's Crowning. The book was a sucess and Brian has truly walked in the footsteps of his superiorly-talented father, Frank Herbert. I find myself happily anticipating the next release from Brian called Dune: House Harkonnen. -Review by ProfessionalFantasyNovelist1"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"For a already established Dune fan it is a foundation to the story that grabbed you up and took you through the millenias. For a Dune newcomer it is a introduction to the best story you will ever set eyes on. house atriedes makes you all giddy inside when the characters play into an important role in Dune history. Brian and Kevin make you feel Duncan's hatred for the Harkonnens that he talked about so many years later. An incredible book for any lover of that special desert planet."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This is about the worst garbage I have ever experienced. It is a complete abuse of the Dune universe. It is effectively Days of Our Lives in Frank Herbert's Dune Universe - well, I say the Dune Universe, but even that is poorly applied. There are distortions between this book and the Dune universe, connections made that should not be (Liet meets Gunny Hallek? gimme a break), a complete lack of understanding of the dune universe (I think that the only thing the authors understand about shields is that they go boom when a laz gun hits 'em). The automatic crossbows are a nice touch....I started reading this series with the knowledge that it was not Frank Herbert's Dune. Pretty soon, though, the discrepencies with the actual Dune books started standing out. As I progressed further and further, it got worse and worse... and my enjoyment of reading became more morbid fascination.Frank Herbert has gotta be spinning in his grave over this one... and Brian Herbert ought to be seriously ashamed of what he has done."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is TERRIBLE. Sure--no one expected it to be on the level of his father's books, but WOW, this is BAD. I'm not sure who to blame--I have a feeling Anderson did most of the writing and Brian just threw his name on for more punch.If you are a fan of Dune don't even bother picking this book up. The brilliance of the original series was that it lifted the story out of the realm of &quot;sci-fi&quot; and into something that was bigger and better. This book takes the original story and pulls it back down among the masses of other pulp, shoddily wirtten sci-fi cr@p. Too bad.....Frank's probably rolling in his grave right now. Poor guy. Poor me for actually reading this cover to cover..."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"House Atreides may not be written in the writing style of Brian's dad, but so what. From the first chapter I was whisked away once again and dropped in the center of the Dune Universe, how wonderful to be back. Beloved characters brought back with new life, historical questions answered, wheel within wheels plot twists, intrigue and treachery unbound, Dune was back! It seems a life time away since I finish reading Chapterhouse, since hearing the heartbreaking news of Frank's death, and the painful realization of an unfinished dream. But even through those dark times and the years that followed there was always that twinkle of hope. The hope that one-day Frank's son Brian would take up the mantle his father left behind, a monumental task for any man to accomplish. But with a skilled Kevin J. Anderson at the ready, this writing team, like Frank and his wife Beverly, had pulled it off. We get to see Leto, Paul's father grow to one day be the Great Duke of Caladan, a young thin muscular Baron Harkonnen, the Dune visionary Pardot Kynes, an 8 year old Duncan Idaho struggling through his tortured youth, and so much more, marvelous. No matter what anyone says, these two talented writers have taken on this great task and passed with flying colors. Kevin you've just reached a whole new plateau in your writing career, and Brain, from all of us die-hard Dune fans, your father would be proud. Don't stop, don't ever stop, I'm having more fun than I've had in years."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I picked up &quot;Dune: House Attreides&quot; as soon as I came across it, and read it in short order. As a Frank Herbert fan in general, and a Dune series fan in specific, I relished the chance to re-enter the intricate world of Dune. I was transported back to the worlds I'd gotten to know fairly well, and I enjoyed reading about the roots of House Attreides and House Harkonnen and their rivalry. As I read, however, I realized that if &quot;Dune: House Attreides&quot; were someone's first venture into the the Dune series, there would a a good chance that they would be greatly disappointed.You see, this book is actually more of a foreward and detailed glossary to the rest of the Dune series than it is a prequel (even though the storyline is such that it does occur earlier, chronologically, than the rest of the Dune series). The book provides interesting background about where some of the main players in the Dune series came from, and how they got to be where they are.If you have already read the rest of the Dune series, or even just Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; you will enjoy this book. If you are planning to cut your teeth on the Dune series by reading this book, you will be missing out on the richer tapestry, and the more intricate political and ecological machinations that Frank Herbert wove into his writing.Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson do an admirable job in adding detail to the Dune world, but their's a step down from Frank's work.I awarded this book 4 stars primarily because of the enjoyment that a seasoned Dune reader will gain from the additional background, while I readily admit that it would probably be a 3-3.5 star offering for someone who had never read a Frank Herbert Dune book.Still, I think that it's worth a read. There are interesting plot developments, you learn more about the Fremen, and the story is told with a minimum of diversions into foul language, etc.Good luck!Alan Holyoak"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Frank Herbert's Dune is perhaps the best science fiction book ever written in my opinion. So who wouldn't want a nice prequel to the original? Well, believe me, you don't want to waste your time.Here's what's wrong:* The story is shallow and unsatisfying.* The characters are poorly written and totally unlike the very same characters as created by Frank Herbert.* The plot meanders around with very little interest going on. The things that happen are totally out of line with the other Dune books.There was hardly a chapter that didn't disappoint me. I can't believe I read the whole thing! Arghhhh!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The question is why would Brian Herbert, a respectable sci fi author in his own right, have to partner with Kevin J Anderson, an author who seems to write the most formulaic cookie cutter sci fi ever unleashed on the reading public? Was Herbert unaware of Anderson's crap Star Wars serial novels? I managed to only get through about two of Anderson's Star Wars novels before I gave up. That Lucas would even license the property to Anderson made me predict years in advance that the new movie trilogy was going to suck bag. And I was right!Herbert must have inherited much of his father's fortune, so he's got to have no pressing need for quick cash and more than enough money to let him write proper novels for a living.A lot has been said already in previous review, but let me just air one gripe. Why is everyone running around firing lasguns in this novel when it's also been demonstrated people use shield belts? We're told if a lasgun hits a shield belt, a nuclear explosion results. In Frank's universe, this has resulted in pretty much everyone locking away their lasguns and using knives. However, in House Atreides everyone is firing lasguns madly despite the fact someone might be using an active shield. Does this make sense? It doesn't to me."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As others have noted, you must adjust your expectations some and realize this is not Frank Herbert writing. Once you get past that and accept Brian and Kevin's respective styles, this is a book that will absolutely keep you turning the pages. Yes, I have noted some minor (key word, minor) inconsistencies here and there, and have no problem with that. I love and admire the Dune novels but I'm not a fanatic. Dune is not my life nor does it occupy my every waking thought. Surely, the original six by Frank Herbert are in a class by themselves. Therefore, let us judge these other works not by comparing them to Frank, but by judging them on their own merits. Brian and Kevin are not rewriting the original 6 novels, like a song or movie is remade today; no butchery is found here, as this is new material, nothing to butcher.That said, I think the authors have done very well in explaining the histories, conflicts, families, characters, and so forth, preceding Dune. There are many interesting plots and \\"plots within plots\\". The characters are dynamic, growing and changing as you turn the pages, instead of remaining static and dull. Reading House Atreides, you get a sense of the characters in Dune book 1, events that helped mold and shape them, creating the personalities and character traits you observe in Dune book 1. Events only hinted at in the original novels, are explored and fleshed out a little more, as well as some mysteries unraveled and enigmas explained. Those who wish to see familiar character names and event references will be satisified. Those who desire the \\"feel\\" that accompanied Frank Herbert's Dune novels, the feel of mystery and mysticism, the sense of \\"Otherness\\", will not be disappointed. Religion, economics, politics, science...they are found here in House Atreides. The \\"old world\\" feudalism married to a futuristic setting, is still in place, with dukes, earls, barons, and emperors.I still have Houses Harkonnen and Corrino to go and my opinions may yet change, but for now, I am definitely hooked. It's as if House Atreides is using \\"Voice\\" on me and drawing me through page after page. Just understand that these are different writers, with different styles, and you can deal with the minor inconsistencies and different \\"flow\\" if you can expand your mind and broaden your horizons a little. I find the new easy-reading styles, repetitive emphasis on plot points, and other characteristics of Brian and Kevin's styles to be refreshing and entertaining. As you immerse yourself in it, you will forget that Frank is not doing the writing, but you will feel his presence there, in the ideas, the vocabulary, etc. and for that, these books while not authored by him, are certainly worthy to be included in his tradition and that of the original six Dune novels."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"A complete waste of 700 pages. The story was all over the place then it all just ended. 700 pages and nothing happened. The best part for me was that I bought it from a homeless guy on the street for a buck, so my investment wasn't too bad. However, the time I wasted is another story."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Duen: House Atreides is an good prequel to the fantastic Dune Series. However, this novel is not on the same caliber as the orginal Dune series.The novel is easily read, and at times is very fast paced. Furthermore, it gives historical background for important characters such as Leto Atreides. Furthermore, it also spells out some interesting questions, such as: Why is Baron Harkonnen so disgustingly ugly? It also answers why Duncan Idaho has such contemt for House Harkonnen. Bare in mind, these are only samples of the interesting aspects of the Dune series brought to life in this novel.These authors should be commended on a tremendous attempt to share the same vision as Frank Herbert. However, although the vision may be similar, the writing is not. Herbert displayed a very intelligent backdrop for his characters and his world. These authors attempt to do the same, but lack the overall depth that Frank had. Furthermore, the authors for this novel create an environment that is highly intricate that contains the &quot;wheels in wheels&quot; philosophy. Again, these two should be commended on their attempt to mimic Frank's style. However, they are a little more forward with explaining the politics in the novel.Overall, those people who loved the original Dune series should pick up this novel. However, don't expect the excellence that Frank Herbert created. These two authors are very good, and do a great job, but it just is not quite the original."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The Original Dune Series (TODS) contained quite spectacular political complexity, and, over a period of thousands of years, the saga revealed many of the secrets of the Bene Gesseret, Tlielaxu, Harkonnen, and Atreides.TODS has, throughout, the feeling of being a reflection of a rather &quot;static&quot; set of cultures, where everyone's thinking has been _strongly_ influenced by the thousands-of-years-back cataclysm of the Butlerian Jihad.In contrast, the recent &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot; seem to be trying to fit today's bits of technological advancements into the 50 years that lie just before the advent of Paul Atreides; the natural result is that it suffers from not Feeling Old. Furthermore, the people in the story clearly don't _believe_ in the evils of things like computing; in &quot;TODS,&quot; it's SO ingrained as something passed down for generations that it feels like something resonating in their bones. Instead, there's the &quot;bubbly feeling&quot; in this book (and the sequel, House Harkonnen) that Kevin/Brian would be happy having folks doing web searches and such. That just doesn't fit with the &quot;world view&quot; of the Dune Saga. They _should_ have been exploring what sorts of mental, biological, and political artefacts might be used to overcome the utter lack of automation in a universe where people vigorously rejected it so long ago that memory of it only comes from those with ancient traditions.This book (and sequel) just don't have the feeling that what people are doing is based strongly on traditions passed down for hundreds or thousands of years. And sadly, none of what's introduced is really good enough to become such a tradition."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Okay, it's definitely a book about Dune, and set in the Duniverse, and it has all the terminology of a Dune book...but it's not a real Dune Book. Period. Don't get me wrong, I read it and I liked it, but it has NONE of the depth of any of the original series. Even weaker books in the original series tower over House Atreides. The best sections of the book are those that involve situations discussed directly in the other books, i.e. those where the authors had Frank Herbert's hand guiding them. Many of the newer charactors (especially Rhombur Vernius) fall flat and are poorly fleshed out and just plain uninteresting.Frank Herbert is sorely missed. I went right from finishing this book to re-reading Dune!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I read this worthless book along with House Harkonnen and House Corrino. I have no idea why I even bothered with the second two after reading this crap. Brian Herbert has turned his father's great work into a Sci Fi soap opera with none of the character depth or political intrigue that the original series was full of. The original Dune series had strong female characters that were actually developed, something I find that male writers have a hard time pulling off. Every character from the original series was interesting to follow and read about. In Brian's blaspemy, women are lowered to the point that they are seemingly there just to be the romantic OTHERS to his boring male characters.Brian doesn't stop there. He continually destroys characters created by his father due to his lack of imagination, intelligence, and ability to write. The gravest of these trespasses is his destruction and character assassination of Holtzman who was a genious. In the original series we get but glimpses of him through writings of his or commentary from characters. The man was an exceptional human being almost godlike in his aftermath. In Brian's books we meet face to face with the man and Brian does whatever he can to drag him through the mud and make him out to be an idea stealing crackpot who uses slave labor to defeat difficult math problems. As if......If you want to read a great sci fi series read FRANK Herbert's DUNE and the following 5 books. Don't waste your time on this trash.To Brian:Shame on you. It's bad enough that you are trying to profit from your father's great work but the degree to which you are destroying it is just disgusting. You have no honor or talent and I hope you fail in all that you do. Good day sir."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I read up to children of dune, then decided that was a good stopping point (since the next one takes place thousands of years later) so i took a break from the original series and decided to read this one. I really enjoyed it. it was kind of nice to have a better balance of descriptions/action with dialog compared with frank herbert's originals. overall very good."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"At first, I was skeptical in ordering this prequel to the Dune series. I had found the sequel to lack strength in plot and poor use of the returning characters. Paul Atreides, Liet Keynes, Stilgar, Jessica, Duncan Idaho, Suk Doctor Yeuh...all just brewing in the story; most of them were not influential to the plot.The prequel has been a more enjoyable read. I feel that the authors fill in the gaps that lead up to the original dune series. I enjoy the constant scheming of Baron Vladimir Harkonen; Learning how Leto developed into a noble leader; Meeting Paulus Atreides, and why the tacky Salusan Bull decor meant so much to Leto. Those characters, and more, are developed so an understanding can be gained as to their importance to the story... essentially enhancing the original Dune series.House Atreides a more somber story than then House Harkonen. It was a great read for me and I recommend it to anybody who considers themselves a fan of Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book an easy read where the original Dune books ar much more complex. The original books remain interesting after the first read, and one still discovers new things on second or sometimes third read. House Atreides holds a lot of interesting background info on Frank's universe. And I liked that. The end was a bit to &quot;easy&quot; in my opinion. But remember this is not Frank. Rate the book on its own merits. Then it is a decent read."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Despite some significant mistakes, this book does a decent job of recreating the world of Herbert's DUNE. Unfortunately, the writing style is geared more towards the less intellectual crowd, an apparent attempt to cater to Hardy-boy type readers who prefer sex and violence over the smooth philosophical undertones which characterized Frank Herbert's DUNE series.The authors also suffer from mistakes and misreading of the original book, Dune, in other ways. The authors go somewhat overboard with making the Harkonnens into monsters, and depict them with red hair, when the original book had them with black hair. Fenring's hmmm's are actually a secret language between him and his wife, but the authors apparently overlook this, and mistakenly portray this as a speech defect in their new prequel.The level of violence and sexual innuendo is played up in this prequel, and characters such as \\"the Baron\\" are a far more affected than the original book ever suggested. The level of adventure is heightened, which is a refreshing change. The authors also do a good job of creatively enhancing details which were only mentioned in Herbert's dune, as well as creating some intriguing ones of their own.Overall, a good read, but the authors would have benefited from closer reading of the original books."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Although the new Dune trilogy is not a replica of the writing style of the first six, that does not make these books bad. Brian Herbert seems to have a good grasp of his fathers universe, which is to be expected. When I first heard that Kevin J. Anderson was involved in this series, I was slightly put off. I do not normally enjoy his writings. However, when I read House Atreides, I was pleasantly surprised. Perhaps Brian Herbert was able to to Anderson's normally wild and unreasonable ideas at bay this time.On the whole, they are a wonderful series of action/intrigue sci fi novels. What is lacking from the originals? It's missing some of the original insight into politics, religion and other philosophical realms."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've just completed House Atreides and like some of the previous reviewers, I found the recaps annoying and distracting. I kept waiting to hear the words 'Previously on Dune...' as if the book were written for a continuing TV series. Aside from this complaint I was happy to be back in the world of Dune. It isn't Frank Herbert but it is familiar and fast read. I'd recommend the book for any fan of the original Dune series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Kevin Anderson and Brian Herbert make an impressive start into the story behind the story of Dune. Many will complain because it's not as profound or philosophical as Frank Herbert's masterpiece, but I can't hold that against them. The elder Herbert was a genius and DUNE his masterpiece, so anyone would have a difficult job in writing it.Actually, I prefer the lack of deep philosophy in the novel, because it allows the characters to come more to life. The younger Leto and his father, along with the Baron and Shaddam are impressive in this novel as in the original series.I am slightly bothered by the contradictions in the storyline, especially with the inclusion of the no-globe and the sligs, things that were not mentioned until \\"Heretics\\" and I thought the inclusion of the Feng Shui room for Jessica's birth just a cheap trick to cash in on a pop trend.I look forward to reading House Harkonnen and House Corrino."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I loved this book. I've read all of the Dune series and this was a good compliment to the series. Of course after you've read the original series you want more, so any credible work would be great."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I had never read a Dune novel before I read House Atreides, so I was able to enjoy the book on its own merits, which are considerable. The characters are rich and iconic, the politics deliciously dark and unpredictable, and the battles are momentous. The negative extremes in Herbert's world are all examples of things in today's world, which if left unchecked could end up being just as onerous as they are in the book. The book has a kind of dark gothic feel, and the story moves along nicely. Compared to the original Dune, which I read immediately afterwards, House of Atreides is written in a cleaner, more formulistic style. Because it focuses on the Atreides, who represent truth and courage, it has a more uplifting feel than the original. It was for me, a great intro to the original Dune, which taken on its own can be difficult to follow. Most importantly, it is a classic story, and would be considered as such if it had come out first."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I agree with all of the negative comments below.When I heard that there would be a new Dune novel, I went back and re-read all 6 of the originals, just to refresh my memory of Dune.After the first chapter of &quot;House Atreides&quot; I realized that this book was NOTHING close to the original. The narrative style is repetitive, and written for early teen readers. The errors made, with regards to the Dune universe, are so frequent and so glaring as to totally detract from the reading experience. The only reason I finished the book was so that I could warn other people about it.DO NOT buy this book if you enjoyed any of the originals. If you have not read any of the originals then start with Dune and NEVER read this book. I have never thrown a book away, this will be the first, and I will NOT buy any of the sequels."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Let me get this out of the way right now. As 100 reviewers have said already, this is not the original Dune. Oh well. Nothing like that is ever going to come out again anyway. The thing is, once you get those expectations out of your head and take this book for what it is, you may well be surprised as to how good it really is. There are two expectations I have for any prequel to a series I have read before. 1. It stands alone as an enjoyable read by itself 2. It adds to future readings of the original story.Taking the second one first, it meets that criterion and then some. One reviewer lampooned this book for not leaving as many unanswered questions as Dune. I think this book WAS written as an answer, rather than a question. Dune opened with a precreated universe that was already rich in Herbert's notes, into which we only got glimpses that we could piece together as the series went on. House Atreides serves as a much wider window to the past of the Atreides family and of Arrakis. For those of you who ever wondered how a planetologist could &quot;go native&quot; on a planet as strange as Arrakis, or how the baron could get just THAT fat, this book will tell you. The first time rereading the original after I read this book was filled with &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;oh, so THAT'S how that happened.&quot; In and of itself, that was worth the price of the book. The first criterion is also met, in my opinion. Agreed, the writing is not as dense as the original, and the scene changing is a bit choppier. The universe Herbert created still enthralled me though, as did the plot unfolding in this prequel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book in its own right, as well as for the insight into the larger world it gave me. My recommendation? If you idolize Frank Herbert so much that you feel anything not by him must be inferior, this may not be the book for you. You'll set your expectations so high you won't notice when it is &quot;merely&quot; great. Otherwise, buy this book and read it, than reread the original series. If you've never had exposure to Herbert before, you might want to try reading the original than picking up this book later on."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Reading Frank Herberts Dune along with the other 5 books I found this to be my personal favorite. It answers many questions about the Dune series and I personally think the characters have more depth. I dont understand why everyone seems to compare father and sons writing techniques...both are surpurb in their own unique writing style. This book was fantastic and I look foreward to Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson next Dune project."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"First off I'll be very upfront and admit that I'm one of those Dune fans who hates these books. I make no bones about it. Sure, they're books...technically. There's lots of pages, there's dialogue and there's stuff that happens and it's all written in prose that is definitely passable. But if you're the kind of person who likes the original books, and cares that they are light years beyond this one, then don't even bother reading it. Don't let that morbid desire to \\"know what happened\\" get to you and make you read the book. You'll be happier not knowing every detail of every aspect of every character's past. I'm not going to accuse Brian Herbert of being a bad person for trying to cash in on his father's stuff, but it really shows in these books. The narrative is boring and uninteresting. The plots are predictable, the characters are bad space-opera Star Wars-style characters and it all just feels like a blatant attempt to \\"explain\\" things mentioned in the original series. It's garbage. This is mass-produced, popularized drivel almost written on the level of something like a Dan Brown book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"To say this is the best of the trilogy isnt' saying much. Terrible writing, and the fact that I see nothing of the characters from his father's work, despite the names benig the same, is a tragedy. Avoid all of Herbert and Anderson's dreck."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"After reading many of the reviews, I was bit dismay to figured out that many of these people wanted the authors of this book to basically mimic Frank Herbert. Well, much to dismay of these readers, Frank Herbert been long dead and he should not be mimic by his son. After reading this book, I began to enjoyed the story, the fast pace style and exciting set of characters. I wasn't concern if the trivial storyline don't jive with the original storyline written by Frank Herbert as long as the basic spirit was there and presented in a fine form. When I read this book, I didn't expect to see the ghost of Frank Herbert and the exactness of his universe. Being a Trekkie of a sort, I am quite used to how things don't jive with the original TV show. I haven't read the second or third books on this series but I thought that the first book was good reading and fun. I think expanding and adjusting Herbert's universe is a good thing. As science fiction reader, I can appriecate that we will not be gridlock into a vague format."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"At 31, I have read through the original Dune series about three or four times, each time getting a little farther. The first time was at about age 17, and the last time at about age 25. The first time around, I gave up at book five. One time, book six. Finally, I made it through the final book. Do you ever become sad when you finish the last page and realize that that's it; there's nothing left...you've devoured it all, and the plate is now empty?Perhaps the first few times around, I never quite finished because I knew there was always a part of Dune I had yet to discover. I orinally thought that the story dragged by the end, and it lost its hold on me, but I still had the choice of continuing. The one gem I missed from the final book the first few times was the reference to Judaism still being practiced by a Bene Gesserit with her family aboard a space ship. I loved the religious themes throughout the Dune books, as I have wrestled with my own notions of religion. The plots of the original series were so interwoven that it kept your mind constantly racing with questions. The details are what made the universe believable. With the final book read, the only journeys left to make were in my own mind.Fade to the present. When I heard that there were Dune prequels, I rejoiced! I'm not a professional critic. I use words like \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" and phrases like (...)\\"that was the best thing ever\\". But as someone who took Dune and made it her own, I was grateful to one last feast. I felt some familiarity with the basic chapter layout and dialogue. I found it to be a much easier read than the orignal books which I imagine is what made some of our more \\"sophisticaticed\\" critics whince, but I cherished the opportunity to revisit my second universe. I enjoyed the chance to get to know some of the characters a little better and their history. I was convinced that some of the characters' ages were not consistent with the original series, and that bugged me. Still does, but after reading House Harkonnen and House Atriedes, I am now looking forward to reading House Corrino, despite whatever inconsistencies may exist.If Dune is real to you, and you're not an overly critical, purist, or pretensious person, then you will relish in the chance to visit that universe again, and I'm sure it will inspire you to read the original Dune series once more, as it has me. No, the new series is not as complicated, but like some other reviewers, I don't know that that is such a bad thing. For me, Dune is not so much about the words but about the place. And the Dune prequels will take you there."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I actually enjoyed this fast-paced pulp novel, based on Frank Herbert's Dune. There was just enough story here to keep me reading, in spite of the cardboard characters and juvenile writing.Although this book is atrociously written --- painfully inept metaphors and similes, scant descriptions that fall flat, and an overall tone that hovers somewhere between Doc Savage and Superman comics of the mid-sixties --- Herbert's notes provide a strong basis for the plot, which is engrossing at a pulp-fiction level. It's been more than 25 years since I read the original novel, so I wasn't bothered by the inconsistencies that would be apparent to a hard-core Dune fan.It's a shame that a good editor didn't intervene and clean up all the unnecessary modifiers and given the text some polish. Still, that hasn't stopped the book from selling, so it's not hard to guess why nobody at Bantam cared.Kevin J. Anderson has been nominated for Nebula awards and Bram Stoker awards. Either his other books are infinitely better written than this one, or the Science Fiction Writers of America have drastically lowered their standards.If you're not a true-blue Dune fan, you may enjoy this as a light read with a few interesting ideas. But be ready for some really, really bad prose. These clowns make Michael Crichton look like Hemingway. Even Jackie Collins's writing doesn't contain basic mistakes such as you'll find here.Nevertheless, it's only fair to tell you that I'm more than halfway through the second volume, and having a good time (although wincing every so often). Not only that, but it's whetted my appetite to go back to Frank Herbert's original books (which are stylistically sophisticated and far more imaginative); so Anderson and B. Herbert must be doing something right."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've never read Dune, or seen the original movie. I have, however seen the new mini series on Sci-Fi, and that led me to finally read this book that had been sitting around my house forever. So, I'm really approaching this book from a &quot;non&quot; Dune fan perspective, with no knowledge of what happens next really. I can't really remember every character and event in the mini series, so the suspence is still there. I also realize how big the Dune series is, it's a book legend, and I realize the enormous task these two arthors have taken on. They were up to it.Okay, that being said, I found this to be a top notch book. It started out a bit slow for me, but all that character introduction and building is really important for what happens next. I loved the characters, Leto, Rhombur, Fenrig, the Fremen and Duke Paulus especially. Unfortunately, hardly any of the female characters are doing much anything, but there are a couple of exceptions. We are introduced to all of these characters that obviously come in to play a big part in Frank Herbert's original books, and it's fun. You'll see Leto take certain actions that make his legend grow, you'll see many plots take course, all interesting. &quot;Wheels within wheels.&quot;At 600 pages, the books flies, juggling one set of characters after another. You're sure not to get bored, because each chapter turns to another storyline and so on. This is not simply a &quot;good versus evil&quot; book. These people are real people. Sure, the &quot;bad&quot; folks are really evil and the &quot;good&quot; folks have good hearts, but they all have to make decisions, and they all aren't always the best ones. Sometimes they are. There are plenty of grey characters that are who they are. I think Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson did a marvelous job portraying their characters and getting us to feel certain ways about them, and to me that's always the most important thing about a story.The main bad point in the book is something that I've actually started doing on occasion. Yep, every once in a while I catch myself uttering the phrase, &quot;Vermillion hells!&quot;, that curse of Rhombur's that started to get on my nerves after a while. Oh, well, small complaint.I guess the biggest compliment I can give this book is that it's made me want to become a Dune fan. It's made me want to continue on with House Harkonnen (which I have) and House Corrino (it needs to hurry and come out) all the way through Frank Herbet's legendary original saga. For that alone, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson deserve major props."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I read the cyclus of 7 Dune-books and started House Atreides which gave me more exciting insight , how wonderfull, but am wondering which one i should read now..... ."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I listened to the Audio Unabridged version of this book - and it was riveting. Having been through the preceding books with Scott Brick as the narrator, he now sounds like the voice of Dune to me. Often annoying but nevertheless somehow fascinating in his delivery, I think he is perfect for the job.The book itself is so good! Wonderful to read about the early life of Leto, and beginnings of Jessica. The sinister partnership of Shadam and Hasimir is much clearer. I don't want to spoil things for anyone - just know that it is worth the read. Well written, and almost entirely in the same style as the original Dune series. Well done!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This trilogy covers what happened right before Frank Herbert's Dune series and spans about 25 years, from 10,150-10,175 AG. It covers events like Jessica's conception and birth, and Leto's adolescence and his assuming the title of Duke after the murder of his father.Quite a few things contradict the real Dune books. In the real Dune books, it is hinted that Baron Harkonnen had sex with a Bene Gesserit, but never that the experience was unwilling (like was said in this book) Also, in the real Dune books, Jessica's mother was specifically stated to be Tanidia Nerus, yet Brian and Kevin have ignored that to make Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam Jessica's mother (and thus Paul and Alia's grandmother) and the scene where Baron rapes her is rather awkward. Not only that, but she already had a child by him, and Baron thought to have revenge on her for this second calling by assaulting her.In the real Dune books, it is implied that the Baron's weight was not a burden to him, and that he was willing to let himself get fat due to his hedonism, and that Spice prolonged his life and health so he could continue enjoying his pleasures. However, this book tells us that Vladimir Harkonnen was once a handsome young man in superb physical shape and that he was punished for raping Mohiam by being infected with a Bene Gesserit STD created by Mohiam just for him right on the spot during the rape.... Really? I know the BG have some really cool powers, but Brian and Kevin give the BG some unrealistic powers, such as invisibility (revealed later in this trilogy)This trilogy was really an unneccessary project, especially since Brian and Kevin wrote this AND the Butlerian Jihad trilogy before they even worked on Dune 7. Give me a break."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune: House Atreides is, of course, the first of a threevolume prequel to Frank Herbert's classic novel, Dune.The point of the novel is to give &quot;backstory&quot; to the eventsin the elder Herbert's work. It certainly succeeds in explaininga great deal of things -- there are numerous &quot;oh, so THAT'Swhy...&quot; moments in the novel.But its not great stuff. There are numerous stories going on,and, despite the fact they are ultimately interwoven, there'sa feeling that you're reading an anthology of short storiesand not a novel.On the plus side, while the novel can't be said to live upto the quality of the original &quot;Dune&quot;, it is more entertaining,and accessible, than Frank Herbert's own sequels, especiallythe almost painfully dull &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;.If you enjoyed the original novel, and want more, thisis a good choice -- better than the original sequels."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Of course any \\"Dune\\" fan is going to be skeptical about the son of the author of one of the most successful science-fiction series in history trying to continue it. Tougher still is the task of writing a \\"prequel\\" to the first novel, which would be tough even if done by the first author. But fear not. This work stands proudly with the original, and in some cases even exceeds it.For in this book you see how many of the characters you meet in the first book got there in the first place. You get to see Duke Leto as a boy growing into young man. You get to see how Jessica is conceived at part of the grand sisterhood plan. You see how Duncan Idaho meets up with Leto. And in one of the best twists in the book, you see how the Baron becomes his physically disgusting self. This alone is worth reading.What I liked about it is that it equals, and in many cases, even exceeds the ruthlessness of the characters we've grown to know. There are virtually no breaks in the unrelenting pressure to survive by each an every character. This comes both in the form of nature on the title planet, as well as the constant political maneuvering and backstabbing that occurs to gain power. It would have been nice to see a little more human kindness, but it is probably what we have to expect for a story that sets up the Harkonnens holding the cards in the next story. I enjoyed this one very much."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Prequels are unusual novels. They should be written to introduce a book and series for someone who has not yet read any of the material. Yet their prime readership will be from those who have already read the series and want more. So you have to evaluate prequels from both prespectives. Usually, they favor one dimension or the other.As is the usual case for prequels, Dune: House Atreides will primarily appeal to those who have read the Dune novels. The Harkonnens are beautifully cast as thoroughly nasty, despicable, and incompetent. The tension between the religion of not having thinking machines and the potential to create new technology is nicely developed. You will also get a good sense of Emperor Shaddam IV. Duke Paulus Atreides is a very enjoyable character, and you will delight in the places where he comes into the story.I found much of the novel to be competent, rather than compelling. Unfortunately, these sections included Duke Leto Atreides, Duncan Idaho, and Pardor Kynes. These characters could have been magnificent, and provided much more fascination for the series. They come across as attractive, but not as people you want to grasp and hold onto because they are so appealing.As a result, interesting, additional details comprise a reasonably small part of this book.For those who have not yet read Dune, I felt that the book had one mistake in it. Readers will discover a bit more about physical changes that Guild navigators experience than is desirable for enjoying the whole series. In all other ways, this book will help the new reader anticipate and enjoy the beauties of the Dune series more. The background of much of what is happening will still seem mysterious after reading about it in this book, which is good. The origins of the key power groups are alluded to, but left murky. I think that approach was a good decision, because it encourages the reader to move on to other books in order to learn more.The lack of illustrations was a missed opportunity. Many of the concepts in Dune lend themselves to pictoral explanations. In fact, each of the covers of the later novels added to my enjoyment.I do encourage all fans of science fiction to read this book. It is a worthy volume in one of our greatest series.After you finish reading this book, I suggest that you think about what really is most important to you in your life. As this book shows, you can achieve fame, friendship, wealth, power, family closeness, or prescience. The more someone focuses on one, the less they have of the others. How will you make your choice?Look forward to enjoying more of what provides the most meaningful satisfaction!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"In this book, the authors take us back to the events that will ultimately lead to Frank Herbert's Dune. Indeed the novel seems focused on introducing and explaining all characters that will play an important role in the future. Without Paul Atreides and Arrakis, most of the original book's underlying mixture of religion, politics and sociology are lost, though the authors make a valiant attempt at preserving the original wheels-within-wheels plots that seem to involve all characters. Thus, the book carries an enormous scope in characters and complexity. It's pace never quickens enough for the addictive reaction and it's ultimate conclusion is anti-climatic. Opposing Frank Herbert's genius at dropping subtle hints about the characters' machinations and goals that always left us hanging on his every word and more often than not re-reading passages to appreciate his mastery, here the characters reveal their thoughts and plots each step of the way. But it's unfair to compare it to Dune. I found the book interesting, shedding light to the politics in the Empire before Muad'Dib. It's entirely devoted towards the original Dune, though. A worthy addition to the saga but I'm afraid only fans of the original series may find it enjoyable. As I said, if you haven't read the original saga it might get slow and unappealing. After you get hooked on spice, though, you'll come around to this books searching for gems of insight into the characters' background."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is a pretty good read. Unlike the original Dune series, it is not a great book, and anyone who anticipates such will be disappointed. Still, I was happy to read more of the exploits of Leto, the Atreides family, and their allies and enemies. Some of the new characters were excellent additions. I was jarred, though, by a few obvious errors. For example, after the Tleilaxu take-over of Ix, we actually get to see the Axlotl tanks. However, as we learned in the later Dune books, there are no &quot;tanks&quot; but instead the gholas are birthed by the Tleilaxu females. So when the tanks actually showed up as physical tanks, and when the Tleilaxu were actually doing scientific research with them, I was disappointed. It doesn't seem to be such a big thing to try to ensure consistency of such a key point of the entire series. Still, the overall reading was fine, and the story was interesting."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Reviewer: Chuck Spicer from Champaign, IL USA Brian distorts the Dune serious making unbelievable leaps and writing things that any Dune fan know just couldn't be or clash with Frank's vision. The characters are one dimensional and the story line is preposterous. It's as badly written as star trek books. This book might be entertaining to those looking for a fun read but anybody who holds Dune true and dear to their hearts will dislike this. This was obviously a tool to fatten his pockets. He should have listened to his father when he wrote &quot;YOu don't write for success.&quot; Let Brian have his fun with the prequels but let us all hope he doesn't truely desicrate Dune by attempting Dune 7."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Although this volume is not as richly textured as the original &quot;Dune&quot;, it is an intrigueing addition to the sequence. The Harkonnens are appropriately nasty and the Atreides follow their own code and one gets to see Leto earlier in life.The only real element that didn't fit well was the Bene Gesserit and the birthing sequences. Ideally, given the creative biological powers, less in terms of birthing additions would have been more believable.Can't wait to see if the most recent addition is as good as this one, so close on its heels."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I understand that, perhaps too often, the Dune 'elite' sneer in contempt at anyone who hasn't read at least the original 6 DUNE books. Likewise, I also understand that it may indeed be a struggle for the casual reader to wade through the immense imagination and genius that was and is Frank Herbert. To the point, HOUSE ATREIDES is akin to a somewhat diluted form of the original DUNE series. Some might find that to be a rub against the book, however, I actually found it a bit more enjoyable and much less tedious than some of the original volumes. I did miss the ever-present aura of the un-known that permeates Frank Herbert's original series, however, the trade was acceptable to me. If you've read all of the other books, read this series too. If you haven't read all of the others, these may inspire you toward that endeavor."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune is an incomparable classic of SF writing. No-one would have expected House Atreides to match it. But this book falls so far short of Dune that it is a travesty that it bears the Dune name.For one thing, House Atreides does not draw on the aspect of Dune that raised it above countless other SF books - the pervasive presence of mystico-religious elements. Most obviously there was Paul's fulfilment of the Fremen's prophecy of the Lisan al Gaib and the Bene Gesserit's breeding programme for Kwisatz Haderach, and his vision of the jihad to come. But even more striking is the fact that we were constantly reminded that many of the central characters were either deeply religious (the Fremen) or had a keen awareness of the possible religious consequences of the events they are involved in (Paul, Jessica, the Bene Gesserit). This religious dimension is wholly lacking in House Atreides. Given that the significant religious events in the Dune story caught everyone off guard it might have been inconsistent to have heavy foreshadowing throughout the prequel trilogy. However, the absence means that House Atreides is not cut from the same cloth as Dune.But the real problem is simply that House Atreides is badly written. The characters are paper thin (good guys - clean cut, loyal and courageous; bad guys - nasty and scheming). The characters are also all irredeemably stupid. The intrigue and politicking between the Great Houses and the Emperor that formed part of the backdrop of Dune and was uncovered as the story proceeded is brought into the foreground in House Atreides and set out in excruciating detail, killing any suspense or intrigue. The plot has so many implausibilities I can't begin to count them. Frankly, this book insults the intelligence of the reader."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Apparently, Brian chose Kevin J. Anderson to do the Dune Prequel because he did good Star Wars stuff - he seemed very capable at writing stories set in someone else's universe. Unfortunately, the majesty of Dune is not something that others can easily adopt as their own. Frank Herbert focussed on ideas rather than narrative, whereas the prequels seem to do the opposite. Very well written, 'House Atreides' seem to lack a certain epic 'WOW!' that made Dune popular not only in its own time, but a worthy entrant into the history books as a literary classic. Beginners won't understand the references to CHOAM, the guild and the Landsraad, or spice and Arakkis, or the various schools and houses (Ix, Bene Tleilaxu, Bene Gesserit, the Swordmasters, Mentats, etc). Old-hat fans, on the other-hand will be invariably disappointed by the lack of development in such controversial areas as AI and genetic engineering. If you want to get up-to-date on Dune history, great, but don't expect it to be as dark, intelligent and compelling as the originals would suggest."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I'm 17 years old and Dune was the first sci-fi novel that I ever read. Upon hearing of a prequel in development, I began to eagerly await discovering what fresh ideas that Frank Herbert had set aside in his manuscripts before his death. But, unfortunately it seems if there was any new Herbert available his son and Anderson discarded it light of a weak rehash covering(and effectively destroying) already familiar plot points and characters. If I took the time to list the various points in the novel where accuracy took a backseat to brevity and lay understanding I would have filled this limited space 10 times over. I think the main quality of this novel is that it can be used by people with very little imagination as a primer for the series. A kind of paint by number Mona Lisa. If you are a fan of the Dune series and have not read this book yet, I would read the second page of the novel before making your decision. I was so appalled that it took a great deal of mental and phsyical effort to turn to the next page(with my greatest motivation being the ... I shelled out for the hardback.) After all the spice must flow! (omg.)"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"First, this is a two star book. I gave it three stars because I wasso elated to finally tread once again the sands of Frank Herbert'suniverse. About halfway through, the &quot;honeymoon&quot; was over,and I realized that this book lacks Frank Herbert's lean, gritty,captivating style. Since it's the only Dune prequel out there, I willgladly continue with House Harkonnen, as I suspect most Dune fanswill.Second, even though this book is a prequel,***Do NOT readthis book unless you have previously read Frank Herbert's Dune, DuneMessiah, and Children of Dune***.Unless you read the originalsFIRST, House Atreides will probably not make sense to you and you maynot relate to it at all (but I'd be interested in the reviews ofreaders for whom this book is their first Dune experience).Third,having said all that, if you read House Atreides first then try toread Dune, you might stumble when you step from the loose, wanderingstyle of &quot;Atreides&quot; to the tightly-woven, captivatingcomplexities of Dune. This would be most unfortunate, as Dune is anovel of breathtaking scope and insight, and should NOT bemissed.One last point: The authors faced an interesting challengehere: House Atreides is set just a few decades prior to Dune, so thatthere exists a large established reader base which knows how theseprequels are supposed to end. Normally, we know the beginning and theend is the surprise. The trick is in writing interesting plotlinesthat lead to the known endpoints. I hope the writing becomes tighterin House Harkonnen, and in whatever follows.Good reading to you!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I just finished the novel and I consider it to be a worthy attempt at continuing the master work of Mr. Herbert. It certainly lacks the depth of drama and characterization of the others, but I believe the authors' err mostly on the side of giving their characters a two dimensionality by explaining too much intead of letting their actions speak for themselves, and keeping the scope of the scenes in the book always within the limits of local subplots without interleaving any subplots into each other. This leads to oversimplification of characterization and underdevelopment of dramatic drive. I would tend to believe their next effort will be an improvement, as theirs' is not an easy task. In the production of a final Dune novel they will be working with more fleshed out characters and storylines, and hopefully they will be braver in their willingness to put more of themselves into the work. After all, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Let us not forget that this series is one man's masterpiece and its continuation is not a task to be taken lightly. Congratulations on a job well done. I dare your detractors to do better! I look forward to more, and will endeavor to read more of your works."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It is particularly hard to evaluate this book because it is a mixture on several different levels. I would have given 1-2 stars for the book itself, were it not for the superb framework provided by Frank Herbert in his Dune series. I felt that the present writers were like toddlers who could not walk on their own, but managed to stumble along with the aid of a baby-walker (in the shape of Frank Herbert's richly detailed plot and background). The unsatisfactory nature of much of the writing is made up for by the satisfaction of finally learning just what happened (for instance) to Duncan Idaho as a boy. Characterisation, dialogue, action and plot all seemed very weak at times, better at others, leading me to wonder if some fragments of Frank Herbert's own notes might have found their way into the book. The authors' task is made much more difficult by Frank Herbert's allusive style, which often hinted expressively without fully explaining. Yet I feel that this book could have been much better, had Brian Herbert recruited one of the world's leading writers to collaborate with him - preferably someone whose style and mindset was closer to Frank Herbert's. Regretfully, I don't think I will be spending the time and money to read the other two prequel volumes. As far as I am concerned, Dune - like its author - can rest in peace."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I read this book preparing myself for the different style that would inevitably come from the authors trying to follow in Frank's steps. I was not dissappointed. The book is very different and somewhat lacking in action but rolling in the true vileness of House Harkonnen, honor of House Atreides, and selfishness of House Corrino. Many questions were answered but many questions were also raised, leaving me tied up in knots of angst and curiosity. It would be wise for readers to read the Afterwords before reading the book. It does not give away any of the books twists and turns but helps give understanding and acceptance of the book's lackluster ending. This book is worth the read and worth the wait of a, I'm sure, soon to be coming sequel to the prequel. When the book starts to look bleak for our young hero, do not despair, this book redeems itself in many ways and holds hope for the true loyal fans of the Dune Legacy!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was beyond excited to hear of a new addition to Herbert's Dune universe. I bought the book before it came out and I read it with an intense hope of reconnecting to the world that stunned me years ago. I was unfortunately disappointed. The book was generally simplistic. It did not have the same complexities, intrigue, or language as the orginal. It was nice to revisit the characters and the plots, but it did not &quot;say&quot; anything, unlike the original Dune series. It was pulp through and through. In addition, the shameless drive throughout the book to leave enough loose ends so young Herbert could write a second book and recieve more lucrative book deals was upsetting. It seemed that some parts were written so a next book could be written, not to enhance House Atreides itself. Read it if you are a fan, but do not expect the original."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"&quot;Dune&quot; is my all-time favorite book. A masterpiece rich in story, intrigue and subtlety, set in a universe which I love, so any revisiting would undoubtly be a pleasant experience, and it was, mostly. The problem with &quot;House Atreides&quot; is that it contains none of the subtlety or depth that made &quot;Dune&quot; great, the prose is especially bad, with exposition being constantly repeated, and the language simplistic and occasionally clunky. Most of the charcters also suffer from rather bad cases of &quot;cardboard cut-out&quot; syndrome - The Baron is evil, the Duke is good and that is that. The inconsistances with &quot;Dune&quot; also tend to grate, such as here the Old Duke seems warm and friendly here, a great deal more so than Leto, and yet in &quot;Dune&quot; it sounds as though he was a cold and rather cruel man, with Jessica cursing his name, and wishing he had died sooner. But having said that I still liked HA. To revisit the characters earlier in their lives is a fascinating experience, and I loved the extra details that this book gave. The best thing that HA does is give more of a sense of the Imperium that &quot;Dune&quot; ever did, and I appreciated the visits to IX and more especially Kaitain, and you could glean more details about many of the other Houses, that &quot;Dune&quot; never gave. (That, BTW, is not a criticism of &quot;Dune&quot; as it was focussed in Paul, whilst HA has a much broader focus.) Also, the first chapter was clever in that it provided a direct contrast to Duke Leto's visit to the harvest operations on Dune, I don't know whether that was intentional or not, but I liked it. Overall, the main problem is the actual writing which suffers from being too much like what you'd find in a teenage Star Wars/X-files novel, but it's still good fun to read if you liked the &quot;Dune&quot; universe and can enjoy reading a book that is not particularly deep."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I wrote a review a few years back. I will admit it was a bit scathing but nothing asbestos gloves couldn't have handled. For some reason it was lifted. Oh well, I doubt if I can redo my deathless prose of that day but suffice to say this book does a great injustice to the works of the great Frank Herbert. I will not even go into how it makes a mockery of all that is Dune, that is readily apparant and besides that is usually answered by the reply that, well it's not Frank writing it. What's even worse is that, whereas Dune was written for the thinking person, someone who loves a challenge, this book, and those that have followed, are written for today's generation of those needing to be spoon fed instant gratification and that have the attention span rivaling the life of a mayfly after it reproduces. The Harry Potter novels present more of a reading challenge than these books and they were originally meant for a juvenile audience. After reading this book I don't know if, as presented, that Herbert the Younger actually had outlines of what his father was doing and where he was going but if he did it seems he sold him out, going for mass appeal to a generation of quasi-literates rather than a reasonable additon to a great series. If he ever decides to write sequels, rather than prequels, to the story his father left unfinished I do hope he made enough money on these books so that he can find someone who can do justice to them. Writers on the order of Frank Herbert do not come along all that often and I don't expect anyone who takes up the mantle to be as great as he was, tho it would be a nice surprise. However, I do expect respect to be shown and a great tradition to be continued rather than, as these books have done, trivialized. As far as I am concerned comparing the House books to the Dune series is like comparing a child's fingerpaintings to Picasso or Gauguin. It's a shame this system requires you to issue a star at all."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Not bad. Okay, so that isn't the finest way to start a review, but it's the best way to start this novel - not bad. It's far from stunning, and far from a Dune book - far from being what is considered \\"proper\\" science fiction! - but it is good if accepted as a fairly simplistic action-adventure sci-fi novel aimed at a predominantly teenage audience. There are a not inconsiderable number of inconsistencies with Frank Herbert's original Dune Chronicles, but these aside, D:HA is fun at a base level. If I were to enter into honest criticism, I would cite weak characters and poor research as my main gripes. However, apart from this, D:HA is a fair (if oversized) read."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This prequel to the Dune series is an admirable effort but it falls far short of the standard set by Frank Herbert. The book's most noticeable failing is the hasty and poorly executed introduction of the Harkonnen's &quot;no-ship&quot; technology. Not only is the idea lifted almost exactly from Star Trek 6 (and who knows where else), but this crucial plot element is introduced far too late in the book to interest the reader. The prose tends to be redundant. Plot elements unique to Herbert's Dune Universe are overexplained. Even a reader new to the Dune universe needs only one explanation of the purpose of the Bene Geserrit or the physical deformities of the Guild Navigators. For whatever reason, the authors found it necessary to continually remind the reader of the subtleties of the Dune universe. Most of all, Frank Herbert's literary tone is discarded in favor of the more popular tone and structure currently in vogue in the science fiction community. Despite its failings, Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's resurrection of the Dune universe is certainly passable, and even a welcome reintroduction to the characters that many thought had died along with Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I did not hope the new book would be equal to the original, but please keep the details straight and logical. I like the character of Duncan Idaho very much, so I paid attention to his background in the original books. He had a sister who died in the Harkonnen slave pit. He was saved by Duke Leto or Duke Leto's father from the Harkonnen slave pit. In this book, he has &quot;NO&quot; sister. Instead, his parents were killed by the Harkonnen. The slave pit was not a slave pit; it was more like a prison where people were waiting around to be executed (or freed). And Duncan was not rescued. He escaped there himeself. The woman who helped him to escape had the most ridiculous reason to help him and send him to the House Atreides. I did not check for other conflicting details. Since Duncan Idaho was one of the main characters for 4 of the 6 books of Dune, getting his background wrong was really ridiculous."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Let's get it straight from the start - this was not written by Frank. And it shows. Keeping Dune aside, this novel stands by itself as the beginning to a new series. It is written in a modern, readily accessible style that allows the reader to slip into the very convoluted plot and follow it to this book's conclusion. It was nice to see characters previously mentioned in passing being 'fleshed out' and an effort was made to keep existing characters from other novels within the boundaries of their personalities. Not a bad sci-fi novel, and a good start to a new series. I recommend it. BUT - if you are expecting the style of literary prose and insight from old Frank, then you will not get it. This is a totally different style, and while Frank purists may moan that it isn't the same,it is on a par with current writing trends. Many people find Frank is obscure and long winded (his last Dune books certainly started to lose me), and this may be the chance to drag more 'mainstream' readers into this universe, and maybe then later into Frank's true Dune. You shouldn't solely judge a book by what it isn't when compared to another book - it should stand on it's own merits, and House Atreides has them."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Maybe its the fact that I hold Dune to be the best novel I've ever read, maybe its Brian Herbert's different writing style. I don't know, but what I do know is that this book stunk. I forced myself to finish it. My first thought was that this book read like a star trek/star wars novel. And what do you know? It was co-authored by a novelist who has in the past written those kinds of books! It held none of the magic that the original Dune series. None. Not a drop. I'd only recommend this book to those of you who actually read the ENTIRE Dune series, but please..buy the paperback..it's not worth 25 dead presidents. Word to the wise, continuations of a series after the original author has died are bad ideas. (just look at the continuing 'Foundation' books by the 'estate' of Isaac Asimov) Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go hurl this book into the open desert and collect my water-debt from Brian Herbert's hide."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was pretty leery about these books as I truly loved the original six by Frank Herbert and thought that the prequels would be nothing more than a cash cow for his son and Kevin Anderson. NOT!!! House Atreides was a phenomenal read that made me laugh, cry and cringe with anticipation. Lets face it : Frank Herbert was a masterful philologist but his books were never the page turners that these prequels are... The stories are simply fascinating and wonderful and if you can get over the fact that one of these two authors really doesn't write very well, you'll love House Atreides and the other prequels and their prequels. Thankfully, he doesn't write very much and you can spot his chapters a mile away... They fit in with the overall plots quite nicely though, and are therefore tolerable. In closing, House Atreides is all the original Dune books could have been in terms of characterizations, drama and plain old, GOOD storytelling. I loved it and all that has come since (especially the Machine Crusade). Cheers!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When I first read Dune by Frank Herbert, I was lying on a beach with a stack of about 8 books that I intended to read of the next few days. On the first day, I blew through 2 or 3 quite easily. On the second day, I started Dune, and by the second chapter I knew that I would be consumed by this book for probably the rest of my vacation. Mr. Herbert constructed an elaborate and engaging universe of unrivaled imagination in science fiction. The characters lept from the page including the very pivotal Leto Atreides, Duke and leader of House Atreides. After reading Dune, I sped (relatively) through the rest of the series and absolutely fell in love with the universe. I had found an equal to my already beloved Middle Earth and Star Wars universes.So when I picked up this book, the beginning of the House Trilogy, I was more than excited. I had known that Brian had several works of his own already under his belt that had garnered some acclaim in the Science Fiction community. I had also read a few of Kevin J. Anderson's works in the Start Wars universe and enjoyed them immensely. Therefore, I flung myself into the series whole-heartedly.I fell flat. Indeed, most of the book itself seemed only a flat copy of the marvels of the father's novels. Perhaps, as other reviewers have noted, the disappointment stemmed somewhat from knowledge of the fates of the characters, but I feel it was more than that. In Dune, we met such characters as Baron Harkonnen, Beast Raban, Reverend Mother Gaius Heather Mohiam, and of course Leto Atreides. Even in their limited roles (as compared with Paul and Lady Jessica) in the first novel, Frank was able to present enormously more life in these characters than Brian and Anderson were able to do in a full length novel. The emotions and actions of the Baron, Mohiam, Leto, and Rombur (as well as others) were so predictable and lacking in flavor that I found myself rolling my eyes at many of the events. The events of the novel such as the fall of House Vernius, the Harkonnen plot to destroy Leto, and even the death of the Old Duke Paulus all seemed like flat attempts at the imaginative flair of Frank Herbert. Some parts of the novel, namely those following the Planetologist Kynes were so out of place and annoying that I question the need of the character in the novels. I picked this book up with interest in the mystique and flavor of the Great Houses of the universe, and found myself entwined in a novel of too many \\"main characters,\\" of which none were treated with enough detail and development. Indeed, halfway through the novel, I had to put it down and pick up other books because I was simply bored with the plot. I ended up finishing the novel by listening to the audiobook while driving.Nevertheless, as a true science fiction fan, I cannot help my overwhelming desire to explore the extent of the Dune universe. As before with some of the less engaging of the Star Wars novels, I will most likely continue on with the House series and with the Bulterian Jihad novels at some point. I can only hope that the remaining of the novels improve on this sub-par effort."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"All I can say about this book is that it is a great read. The Dune books are all well written (in my opinion) and this is no exception. As good as science fiction gets and then some."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"After reading the original series, I had not interest in reading any of the prequels. Not bothering for years, until recently I picked up The Butlerian Jihad and gave it a try. I have been reading the Dune story from start to finish ever since. I just finished reading House Atreides, and I must say that it was the best work yet from Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson. I saw the plans within plans mixed in with little pearls of wisdom that I longed after from the original series.The Baron Vladimir Harkonen unleashes his sublte wheels within wheels aproach to life in this fast paced novel. I learned much of the background of many characters from the orinal series. I eagerly look forward to finishing the reast of the 'House' series and will jump back to the original series with gusto.All in all. This book hit the spot. A satisfying read."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Okay, first things first: No, Brian Herbert is not as good an author as his father and no, this book is not as good as the original. Of course, Frank Herbert was probably the best science fiction author of the past 50 years and &quot;Dune&quot; is perhaps the best science fiction novel ever written. So those are rather impossible standards for Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson to live up to.&quot;Dune: House Atreides&quot; does stand on it's own quite well, however, and is one of the better science fiction novels I have read in a long while.This book is a prequel centering on the original Leto Atreides, who was killed off in the early pages of the first &quot;Dune&quot; novel. (Leto, we hardly knew ye.) Brian Herbert and co-author Anderson go into the past to write of Leto's adventures long before the Atreides ever went to Arrakis. We follow the young Leto as he battles the Harkkonens and matures into one of the most powerful men in the universe.Certainly the book lacks a lot of the subtext of Frank Herbert's original novel. And, as with any prequel, there is the problem of us already knowing how this is all going to end.Still, if the worst you can say about a SF novel is that it &quot;isn't as good as 'Dune'&quot; ...well, you can probably say the very same thing about every other SF book ever written.My advice is that if you liked the previous &quot;Dune&quot; novels, sit back and enjoy this book for what it is. And don't worry about impossible comparisons."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune: House Atreides is the first in the expansions to the Dune legacy created by Frank Herbert, this novel is set approximately 45 years prior to the first Dune novel written in 1963. Written by Brian Herbert, the son of the author of Dune, with co-writer Kevin J. Anderson, the duo has huge footsteps in which to follow. The novel takes us through the lives of the young Leto Atreides the man who would soon be Duke Leto and father to Muad'Dib, Duncan Idaho and his escape from the Harkonnen slave pits, Baron Harkonnen's early dealings with the planet Arrakis and his subsequent siring of Lady Jessica, Shaddam Corrino and his ascendancy to the emperor's throne with the help of childhood friend Hasmir Fenring, Thufir Hawat, and the original planetologist assigned to Arrakis by the Emperor Elrood, Pardo Kynes.Now if that looks like a mouthful, even to a seasoned Dune fanatic, wait till you try to chew on all of the additional characters that these key players meet and interact with. It's enough to make your head spin. When you mash all of these plotlines together into one novel like this (and the first in a trilogy, so you know that the next two will be more of the same characters and certainly an equal number of new characters) you are left with a meal consisting of delicately sipping a vintage wine in between bites of chili-cheese fries. The chapters get shorter and shorter as the book progresses and end up more akin to a few frames of an after-school cartoon rather than something worth reading, pondering, digesting, and perhaps re-reading again someday. Nope. One read through on this book and you will probably need to brush your teeth just to get the bad taste out of your mouth.The entire Pardo Kynes story simply does not belong in this novel. It is little more than a fleshed out version of Appendix One from Dune, and Frank Herbert wrote a more compelling version in 6 or 7 pages than son Herbert and co-writer Anderson do with a dozen chapters. Pluck this plotline out of this book altogether and make it a smaller, separate book of its own. It's presence here shows us how little these two really know about storytelling.For those of us who have been Dune fanatics for any portion of the past 3-1/2 decades, we get to look forward do at least one major Duniverse error in each of these chapters, whether from the Baron's lean, muscular physique, to Duncan Idaho's curiously missing sister and absence of slave pits, to just about everyone and his brother being acquainted with the Bene Gesserit's breeding programs. Gone is the mystery of the Bene Gesserit, the origins of spice, and the inner workings of Ix. We even have Vladimir Harkonnen's suggested inclination toward boy sex toys (from Dune and Children of Dune) clearly laid out as no-holds-barred homosexuality. Makes you wonder how he is going to become the father of the future Jessica Atreides, hmmm? Well, never fear, but our wonderful Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohaim will find herself the future mother of Jessica through a surprising tryst with the Baron. OMG! Where did these boys miss the repeated references in the Dune chronicles to the multiple bastard children the Baron had by his reckless youthful adventures? The son Herbert insists that upon reading his father's notes, though, that the Baron is gay (not maybe even a little bi) and is forced to father this child (and another!) through a few weak plot points and manipulations. Wow! The imaginations of a pair of writers is limited by their extreme belief in polarities and simplicities. Every nuance is good/bad, straight/gay, obviously planned out and panned out.Every attempt at complexity can't escape the suffocating breath of complicated and contrived. If the reader wanted to scrutinize the text piece by piece, consider such timeless phrases as \\"by the saints and sinners\\" or \\"the work of Satan\\" or how about \\"stronger than adamantium.\\" What, is this suddenly an X-Men novel?The inherent problem with any prequel, as clearly visible in the Star Wars prequels, is how to make use of the information that already exists in the later novels, and enhance it in the prequels, while not spelling out the details of what were surprises in the original series. If we know that Jessica is Baron Harkonnen's child, then where is the surprise upon reading Frank Herbert's Dune that the Baron is Paul's grandfather?Another problem with prequels, especially with decades between the actual writing of them, is to be careful not to introduce technology or advancements that would be inexplicably absent in the later novels or would give people an undue advantage if they were so readily available. Let's call into question these strange earplugs that Baron Harkonnen uses to make himself impervious to the Voice? You would think by the time of Dune, in relation to this book, that everyone in court would have such earplugs to avoid manipulation by the Bene Gesserit. Of course what follows is sure to upset the Bene Gesserit fans: A Reverend Mother is stunned by the future equivalent of a tazer and then she is raped! Let's not even consider that some strange disappearing no-ship technology wanders into the Baron's hands. This would become real useful to wipe out a pesky Duke who took over Arrakis. Come on! Reality check!This book feels more like a color by numbers painting that a child could easily do, rather than a complex and intriguing work of art. The authors are trying to connect too many dots into one story, and they are winking at the readers repeatedly as they try to be clever with tying in as many Dune themes as possible, even themes that will not resurface for 4500 years in Heretics of Dune or Chapterhouse Dune, or more frighteningly, in the ever-present Dune 7 and 8 looming on the horizon...This reader is afraid to continue on to the next book, House Harkonnen..."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've been waiting for a new Dune novel for a long time. Needless to say, I was anxiously awaiting the release of Dune: House Atreides. No one should expect to find the complexities of Frank Herbert's style retained in this new book, I never did. That is not to say that my anticipation for House Atreides was ever diminished. Brian Herbert and K.J. Anderson are both fine authors, but everyone must remember that Frank Herbert was an astonishing, unique talent. That said, House Atreides is fun to read; a well structured story. A person can fly through this book in a day or two, as the authors' style doesn't really lend itself to prolonged contemplation, and that's fine. I was thrilled to learn of the background of my favorite character, Duncan Idaho, as well as a host of other familiar people in the Dune universe. Also, there are plenty of new characters to discover. While there seems to be some contradictions in character behavior, I am reserving judgment until I've read the entire prequel trilogy and look forward to the next book, House Harkonen. There may be a reason for these contradictions to exist. In any event, no Dune fan should pass on this opportunity to revisit Frank Herbert's ultimate creation."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I loved &quot;Dune: House Atreides&quot;. There were a couple of things that bothered me though.One is that near the end A priest of Dur was mentioned, but Dur is the shortening of Guldur (Heritics of Dune)a Gammu name for the God Emperor who was born thousands of years after this.Two is the seeming common Knowledge that the Tleilaxu are religeous Fanatics but that was kept a total secret by the Tleilaxu until Taraza interragated Waff (Heritics of Dune). They kept a facade of amorality (Neither moral nor immoral / without moral principles) until that point.One thing that was not wrong but still something I wished for, I had hoped that Idaho would turn out to be an illegitamit son of Palus or Leto. thus a rationalzation of Idaho's rampant gholaing and special abilities. But that was quashed.A good read, but Don't expect FH's Dune"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Writing a prequel to one of the greatest science fiction books ever written is no easy task. Herbert and Anderson are to be commended for even trying to craft this work, based at least partially on the notes left by Brian's illustrious father. Their success, however, is partial and this book is probably only of interest to Dune fanatics.The book concerns events that happened a generation before Dune. That's about as much as I can say about the plot because its principal fault is the lack of a narrative focus. We are treated to Pardot Kynes starting his lifelong study of Dune, to Shaddam IV scheming to get control of the Empire, to a villanous plot to take over the planet of Ix and to the rise of Leto Atreides. We even get information on the conception of Lady Jessica.Any one of these stories might have worked but the attempt to put all of them together makes the book slow (at 600+ pages, it is longer than most of the Dune books). A few threads should have been dropped.Additionally, the suspense of the book is watered down when you've read Dune. You know what the outcome of Leto's trial by forfeiture will be; you know how the Baron's breeding will work out. The really interesting stuff concerns Ix and House Vernius and I could have used a lot more of that and a lot less of Lady Jessica's conception.The book's appeal is not helped by the authors' style which is slow and repitive. They will tell you about the balance of power in the Empire at least a dozen times. This can be contrasted with Herbert the Elder's style, which was crisp and quick -- so much so that you really have to pay attention to know what was going on. This book is a lot more dumbed down.Hmmm. It sounds like I'm panning the book. I'm not. It's not *bad*, it's just not *great*. It was an enjoyable read and I found the filling in of Dune's background interesting. Although I knew the eventual outcome, the last hundred pages had me reading rapidly, eager to see what happened. I was reminded of the appendices to Lord of the Rings -- which lack the narrative verve of the novel but are fascinating if you love the world Tolkien created. This is the same -- it lacks the power and lyricism of Dune but is fascinating if you're interested in the history of the Imperium.The ultimate point is that I went out and bought House Harkonnen after reading this. That should tell you how much I liked it. But then again, I loved Dune. And that's the point of my review. If you loved Dune, you'll like this book. If not, save your money."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I ordered this book with considerable trepidation after reading many of the reviews you can read for yourself on these customer review pages. I had considered waiting for the paperback given some of the vitriol written by some self-identified Dune lovers! Now pushing 50 years of age, I count the original Dune as one of my most-loved sci-fi tales of all time. Although there is valid criticism of House Atreides in these customer reviews , perhaps the one I agree with the most is the authors' compulsion to provide a &quot;recap&quot; of known (and previously established) events, concepts, or character motivations at the beginning of virtually every chapter... even those that have been well-documented in the text of prior chapters! They must feel the reader has the intellect of a Star Wars paperback reader! Nonetheless, I found the book to be an entertaining read. Lacking the mysticism and spirituality of the original Dune (as is almost always true of sequels or &quot;prequels&quot; of any great novel), House Atreides still spins a tale that is entertaining, largely congruent with the events and cast of characters of Dune, and informative regarding the prior generations of Harkkonens, Bene Gesserits, and the Emperor's ancestors.... Reading House Atreides led me to re-read Dune for the first time in 4 or 5 years, and those critical of this prequel may be surprised to find there are also problems with Dune as well...one that I noted more than I remember from prior reads is the repeated references to Paul's &quot;prescient&quot; visions of the galaxy-wide Jihad! Is House Atreides a mind-altering life-changing sci-fi classic? Definitely not! But House Atreides is definitely a good entertaining read that kept me turning the pages and wishing for more.House Atreides is not worth incurring a water debt, and you may wish to wait for the paperback if your budget is tight, but read it!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I picked up the book, and got about what I expected. Certainly, it is not reasonable to expect anyone to be Frank Herbert, and trying to write in the Dune universe is a daunting task.So I accepted that the characters weren't as subtle, the plans within plans ad infinitum weren't there, and there was more fluff that made the book while as long as a Dune offering, just not as satisfying. On the upside, the borderline pretentious posing and glee at one's own subtlety was missing as well. That could grate at times.And the epic events depicted somehow just weren't as epic. A hollow shell, without the abliity to draw in. Perhaps it was the overt displays, the way most things were on the surface, rather than hinted at in a well turned sentence.Consider: In Dune, the Duke and Jessica hardly seemed to display and tension between themselves (as there are hardly any discussions between themselves), but by secondary discussions and inference, the tension is just as strong as if pages of prose had been devoted to building it.The whole thing was &quot;Dune lite&quot;, as it were.There were contradictions, from the death of the Old Duke, to the stretch for Elrood's chaumurky death and Baron Harkonnen being thin to start with. I'd discuss, but it would be too much of a spoiler.Then, as I was nearing the end, ready to go and write a passing review, I found something I could not countenance. Someone being appointed &quot;Spice Production Czar.&quot;That little slip, three words in a 700 page book, just turned me off. Yet at the same time, in crystallized everything that nagged at the back of my head on reading."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"\\"Dune: House Atreides\\" is the first in a trilogy of prequels to the \\"Dune\\" novels of Frank Herbert. Like sequels however, the only lesson you'll get from \\"Atreides\\" is to leave well enough alone. Frank Herbert was masterful because he could conjure up a vast universe without losing sight of his characters' humanity, and he knew how to both deftly craft his surroundings, and keep the historic details of the Dune universe tantalizingly vague (the appeal of Dune's hidden history stemmed largely from Herbert's refusal to dissect). The new trilogy ignores the qualities of the original's prose and the otherworldly seduction of its myriad plotting.For those new to the series, Dune is set in a far distant future, when man has spread across the stars. Once enslaved by machine minds, men rose up in a religious crusade whose legacy has been the absolute prohibition against artificial computers. Instead, vast schools enhance the human mind, turning men into living computers called Mentats. Huge starships are guided by \\"third-stage navigators\\" - artificially evolved human beings who see through walls of time/space. Though technologically advanced, humanity is ruled by an emperor through an aristocracy (the \\"Landsraad\\") perpetually at odds with itself. (Individual houses endlessly plot against each other ala Machiavelli). Outside of Landsraad, various other groups jockey for power - like the insidious Tleilaxu who are masters of forbidden technology, or the Bene Gesserit who conduct genetic engineering experiments designed to create a suber-being called the \\"kwisatz haderach\\". Each party wield great power, but is checked both by each other and by their dependence on a mystical spice called \\"m&eacute;lange\\" - a drug which stretches human lifespans, widens consciousness and, in really huge doses, turns humans into navigators. In short, m&eacute;lange underlies every aspect of this society. Unfortunately, technology hasn't supplied a substitute for m&eacute;lange, and the inhospitable planet Dune is its only source.In \\"Atreides\\" we meet younger versions of the noble Leto Atreides, the vile Vlad Harkonnen, the slyly murderous Fehnring and Shaddam - the future emperor. Aside from other characters also already established in Dune lore, we meet the royal family of Ix (soon to be exiled when Ix is overrun by Tleilaxu) and Leto's parents. Title aside, \\" Atreides\\" tells as much about the Atreides as everyone else. Actually, Shaddam, gets the lion's share of attention. With his father Elrood kept alive through m&eacute;lange addiction, and showing no sign of releasing the throne, Shaddam conspires with Fenring to kill him. Leto, not yet a duke, travels to Ix, whose rulers develop technology at the limits of the law. Leto's strict mother (whose religious fundamentalism dates this book as none of the original novels had) distrusts the ruling Ixians. The reigning duke is too fun-loving a guy to accord with the duchess' stern dogmatism. Vladimir Harkonnen, already Baron when \\"Atreides\\" starts, has yet to become the physically repulsive ogre of the original epic. Shaddam, already considering himself emperor, conspires to \\"give\\" Ix to the Tleilaxu, confident can blame it on a feud his father nursed against the Ixian rulers. In return, the Tleilaxu will try to develop a synthetic m&eacute;lange. None of the original books' intense plotting nor their focus on their characters' perspective are in evidence here. No character possesses any depth. Fenring is a master in the art of murder, even when just giving advice, but here he's just annoying, and his plotting is seldom Macchiavellian. Neither Anderson nor Herbert develop Fenring in a way that suggests his complete reversal in the original \\"Dune\\". Leto is the hero of the story, but he comes off as one of those angst-ridden characters of a Dawson's Creek spin-off. None of the myriad subplots reflect an understanding of the Dune-universe. The Bene gesserit never arouse suspicion, even though their plan to breed the messianic Kwisatz Haderach threatens everybody, especially the Navigators (since they possess the closest thing to absolute power in the Dune universe). Instead it's the illegal invasion of Ix that unites the characters in this book - but who cares? (the Tleilaxu turn the Ixians against their rulers for whom they do the most work and reap the least benefits.) The authors completely miss the underpinnings of the age old Atreides/Harkonnen vendetta (they take the feud as the logical product of Atreides nobility and Harkonnen villainy. The point of a prequel is to show how things came to be the way they are, after nearly turning out differently). Another error is Leto's father - described as a cruel blowhard in the original \\"Dune\\", he's now a benevolent ruler who lives for his loyal subjects whom he entertains with frequent bullfights. But above all is Shaddam's nonsensical collusion with the Tleilaxu. At Fenring's urging, Shaddam presses the Tleilaxu to develop a synthetic version of m&eacute;lange in order to both free his throne from spice mining and elevate it over the spicing guild. What the authors fail to grasp is that success would only swap the monopoly of the navigators for that of the Tleilaxu (it would also nullify the industrial complex that mines the spice, one of the economic structures that both ensures the stability of the universe and, because the throne manages it, allows Shaddam to effectively rule. Besides, if the Tleilaxu reneged, how would Shaddam enforce his end?) The unblanced deal would make sense had Shaddam nursed a vendetta against the Ixians - but the grudge against Ix was Elrood's.Being part of a series, \\"Atreides\\" doesn't have to be open-ended (with half-finished plotlines and characters left for the next book), but it is. Some subplots don't come together at all - like the expeditions of planetologist Liet Kynes or the story of C'tair, a loyal Ixian working against the Tleilaxu. But worst of all, the novel lacks a solid voice, a single perspective in its scenes to feel the pain, joy, fear and triumph that all the plotting must create. \\"Atreides\\" simply fails because, unlike the spice m&eacute;lange that underlies much of the plotting, it is neither addictive nor consciousness expanding."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've had Dune: House Atreides, the first prequel Dune novel, sitting on my night stand for a couple of weeks. Its not that I dislike the Dune books, but Dune is not a novel. It's more like a research project. Frank Herbert's Dune series is arguably the most detailed, complex, and multilayered science fiction opus of all time. Never have I read such enormous books and finished with the feeling that the author needed to explain more. Very few books have forced me to pause, close the book and think carefully about the plot just to keep up. And there on my night stand sat Dune: House Atreides, with a menacing challenge gleaming from the cover. En garde!I suppose I should start with what House Atreides is not. It's not written by the legendary Frank Herbert, who is deceased. The novel is a joint effort from Herbert's son Brian Herbert, and popular science fiction author Kevin Anderson (Jedi Academy Trilogy). Additionally, it does not continue the Dune books, but rather is a prequel and starts a generation before the initial Dune novel.It only takes a page to tell the old master is gone. It's not that the new writers are bad, but Frank Herbert's prose is unmistakable, and I doubt there are many writers who could even approach the detailed and complex style that Herbert seemed to spin with such ease. Brian Herbert and Anderson make a strong effort, but it's a pale shadow to one of the most acclaimed science fiction writers ever.Yet House Atreides is a good book in its own right. While the novel is not as heavy, either in girth or prose, as previous Dune books, it is an entertaining look at young Leto Atreides as he learns the hard lessons of leading a major house in the galactic empire against the intrigues of the evil Harkonnens and even the Padasha Emperor himself. We get to meet familiar characters and learn how they developed in their good or evil ways, and we learn more about the competing schemes of the galaxy's great ruling houses. The new authors are painstaking in the effort to remain consistent with the other Dune books, and this attention to detail is remarkable considering the sheer number of detail in the original novels.Dune: House Atreides is a relatively easy read and paced quick enough to keep the reader's attention. If I didn't keep comparing the book to the previous novels, I likely would have been impressed. But if you are going to write a Dune Book, then you must be prepared for the inevitable comparisons. House Atreides is good, but few can compare to Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Brian Herbert attempts to complete the stories leading up to Dune, surely the greatest science fiction novel yet written. However he does not capture the feel of Dune which is so rich and intriguing, a great depth of politics, psychology, personality and hidden agendas and hidden backgrounds which not only create a great mystery and give a mystical feel to the whole story but also capture the reader completely. Frank Herbert knew how to write about people and their characters with such consummate skil, it will be hard to find even in his son or anyone who attempts such a great vision which this book does not. But then it cannot, not really because this vision was created already in Dune itself and as such had to be followed to stay true. The grand scale of Dune and the awesome sense of the Empire is not wholly captured. Some of this was portrayed extremely well in the film with the costumes especially and the various machines and the worms, however it failed to live up to the whole because it simply wasn't long enough you need a long term series to do that, I would think at least 3 or 4 films.Nonetheless this book maintains the interest and to some degree the sense of the first and it reveals much more information about the main characters, even though one of the strengths of the original was the fact that it held it back. The things one learns about Pardot Kines and his son are fascinating and this is what is remembered most of all.All in all very entertaining but it doesn't come close to the original."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I would rather devour a bucket full of my own excrement than attempt to read this book again."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"And it's a pretty good start! I would have to say the story is better written than books 4 and 6 in the Dune series, which is a major compliment considering Frank Herbert is my all time favorite author. The story line is just as good as any science fiction novel written today, but will never match the first two novels. No book can. Ever wonder how and why Duncan Idaho came to be House Attreides number one weapon and Paul's most trusted advisor? This story, which is exceptionally well written, will answer that question. I would strongly recommend this novel to those who read and enjoyed the first 6 Dune books.http..."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"3 1/2.

I believe Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson did a great job, in explaining and giving us a background of the events that took place before Dune, I simply couldn't stop reading, everything was so cleary and well explained and I do think it all made perfect sense, I am not an expert in the Dune Series, but finally I was able to understand many concepts that I didn't before. I am breathless with anticipation awaiting for Dune House Harkonnen."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I loved it!I read the first series 25 years ago and thought it was amazing,but a little complicated and convoluted.Reading them was almost like doing homework.This prequel was much easier while still maintaining the richness and power of the original series.

I never went in for the original books that much, and am currently stuck near the end of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; hopping to get through with it soon so that I can go onto the third book which I hear is much better than the second. Anyway, this book stands out and away from the other books in the &quot;Dune&quot; series. I think that Frank Herbert should have written something like this before he published the original &quot;Dune&quot; since it helped me out a great deal to understand the original books. It is much more interesting and exciting than the original ones, and I'd recommend it to any first time reader."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"DUNE:HOUSE ATREIDES IS A GREAT PRELUDE TO THE DUNE BOOKS.

Kidding aside, it's a very entertaining book. It doesn't have the slow and steady rythm of the original Dune books, but then again it's not supposed to be like the original. First time readers would like it because of that reason while long time fans would be suprised to find something fresh and different.

It is true to the origial series by Frank Herbert, and explains so much that went on in Dune and the other Dune books, I was just blown away by it.

We can look forward to more Dune novels written by these two men in the future. The spice is nice!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It was with great trepidation that I picked up this book. Frank Herbert was one of the greatest science fiction novelists ever and upon his death the sci-fi community lost an incredible mind. I never expected another book to be written in the Dune series even though I had hopes that Brian Herbert (Frank's son) might consider it due to the ending of Chapterhouse Dune. I was excited when the book was finally released and I met up with Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson at their book signing in San Francisco at Stacey's book store. The book itself was NEVER designed to compete with the original Dune Novels by Frank Herbert (an apparent oversight by some reviewers of this book). It was instead designed to give us the history behind the original Dune Characters and how they came into being in the first Dune Novel. The authors did an excellent job telling an exciting tale of those persons in the first Dune book and their early experiences. Dune: House Atreides keeps the reader riveted and turning the pages. It is a startling insight into the characters personalities and political conflicts surrounding the Dune universe. I am sure that the next two books, due out in the near future, will also lead us further into the depths of these characters. Although some characters may seem different from their personalities in the original Dune books, let us not forget that what we are currently seeing from this book is their early development. More is on the way. Hang in there Dune fans. I know I am....on the EDGE OF MY SEAT."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Despite the inherent difficulties of writing a prequel, the authors rose admirably to the challenge. Their research shows. I reread Frank Herbert's DUNE series before reading this book and -- although the authors did not choose (to my great relief) to mimic the elder Herbert's actual writing style -- the story, action, and philosophy fit in well with the previous DUNE novels. An excellent addition to the series. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've just started the book -- about 1/3 the way through. I, too, was wary about someone else picking up the trail of Dune after FH, but couldn't resist. BH is an experienced writer too so that gave me confidence in at least trying the book. I've read the series many times, as well, and find that FH &amp; KA are trying to establish an early pattern of writing for FH's style. All that aside, the book is wonderful- FH left us all so hungry for more that it's great to get some pre-history for our beloved characters. I like the style and the content and substance thus far and eagerly await my reading time each evening so that I can once again savor new adventures of 'Dune world' --- I HOPE that they can continue the work by continuing the story where FH left off -- I'll certainly buy the next one, if that's where they go. These stories are so intricate and subtle and meaningful and somehow fun all at the same time -- I walked into the bookstore and saw it displayed -- I could hardly believe my eyes; and now after only a partial reading, I'm so excited about it, that I find myself telling anyone who will listen! That's the effect of this series -- and I'm an 'old broad' -- I've been reading these books since 1969 or so, criminey! Bottom line is that BH &amp; KA have done a fine job and I'm so grateful to get at least one more piece of the puzzle to put together -- it ended much too abruptly and much too soon...."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The problem with this prequel, or almost ANY prequel for that matter, is that, while working to fill in backstory for the fans, the fans already have an idea of how things will turn out in order to lead up to the original series, thereby giving no real payoff within the prequel itself - the story, therefore, is very paint-by-numbers.In order to attact the attention of new readers, however, another disservice is done: &quot;House Attreides&quot; is written in a simplistic fashion to provide new readers with essential info, and this insults the intelligence of those who have followed the original series.After reading this story, I shudder to think that someone may mistakenly begin reading the Dune series with &quot;House Attreides&quot; instead of &quot;Dune&quot;. I would never recommend this book to a newcomer OR a long-time Frank Herbert fan. It is too simplistically written, and I agree with a prior reviewer who stated that it was written on the same level as Kevin Anderson's &quot;Young Jedi&quot; series. This book is not mature nor challenging; it doesn't have near the heart or ambition of the original series.The most irritating point of the book for me is how it is peppered with the characters wondering about the secret of the spice. Well, any fan of &quot;Dune&quot; knows the answer, and while this is designed to give a sense of plot development to new readers, this technique is pretty cheesy and falls flat on its face for fans.On one hand, I can't believe that the story of Dune would be polluted with this mess. On the other hand, I *can* understand it ($$$). Don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It didn't take reading too many pages before I found this prequel nearly impossible to put down. I enjoyed more about the characters that made Dune so rich, the plot twists, the better look at some of the worlds only touched upon in the six-volume series, and just about everything else in the book. I like the authors' style of moving the setting from one planet to the next from chapter to chapter (most of the time), in order to make the story run linearly, with the story on two or more planets converging later somewhere else.My only concern is that good and evil may be a little too black and white, one (of many) faults of the movie, which to me had an ending that sounded like &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. Wasn't the bottom-line theme of the original trilogy &quot;Beware of Messiahs&quot;?That having been said, the side of me that likes an adventure came up with the 5 star rating. The plot carried the day(s) for me, and I'll defer looking at the consistency of message for the prequels to those of the real thing until the whole prequel trilogy comes out.

It's true what they say, that the quality drops off as the series continues.House Atriedes, as a prequel, is right about where it belongs quality wise. The writing is crisp and clear and compelling, in some ways more so than the great one, Frank Herbert, himself.

House Atreides is but a single link in the long chain that is the Duniverse; it is the first in the trilogy, but it is the middle of the story. If you are new to Dune, this is not the best place to start the story.The writing style of young Herbert and Anderson is much more accessible and with smoother cadence capable of quickly engulfing the reader. This amazing story is a component of the overall outline that Frank Herbert had planned. Although the writing is different, it is not hard to imagine that Frank himself had written every word.Dune is a brilliant work of art that puts the very soul of humanity under a microscope and analyzes what it means to be human while painting a rich and beautiful universe in our far off future."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Since I'm reading Brian and Kevin's Dune novels in chronological order rather than in the order they were printed, I first read the Legends of Dune Trilogy before coming to the first in the House trilogy. As with the first trilogy, Butlerian Jihad, Machine Crusade, and Battle of Corrin, I honestly enjoyed Dune House Atreides.Meeting the grandparents and father of Paul Atreides, along with other familiar characters from Frank Herbert's original Dune Chronicles in the decades before Paul was born was a thrill. And as soon as I finish this review I'm picking up number two in this trilogy, Dune House Harkonnen and continuing the adventure and look forward to another entertaining and enjoyable trip into the Dune universe."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The writing is pretty poor compared to Frank Herbert's...this book could have used a lot of editing and tightening up. But, on the other hand, it is interesting seeing classic Dune characters such as Leto Atreides and Duncan Idaho as kids...therefore I am rating it in the middle ;)"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I can't deny that there things in the story that I feel are not totaly consistent with the original Dune books, but personally, I found this book more readable than the original series. Mr. Herbert and Anderson have a more user-friendly narrative style than Frank Herbert. For those of us weened on Dune, the plot discrepancies may be hard to swallow, but newcomers should find the book very entertaining."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was interested in Dune since a friend suggested it was a good read. Accidentally I picked up this book instead of my intended origional Dune. I thought this book was extremely entertaining, probably one of my top 10 favorite books and worth every penny. I loved the multi-plot writing in the book that gives the reader insight in every perspective. I intend to finish the prequel trilogy and then continue on to the origional series. If this book doesn't compare to the origionals as most of the reviews say then I am in for a treat."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was many of the few science fiction readers who thought that Dune was needlessly drawn out. I think this new set of prequels have the readers of modern sci fi in mind. Nothing will be able to top the originals...how could they? They have a history all of their own. The new Dune books should be seen with a new point of view. They certainly won't satisfy all the fans who say they are not like the original. However I believe they will add a new perspective to the saga that Brian can call his own. I give it five stars."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I came into this prequel with a lot of preconceived notions that it would not be a worthy successor to the original. And it isn't. But after a second reading, I realized it's not supposed to be. &quot;House Atreides&quot; is a prequel, not a sequel. It's supposed to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; of what happened before the greatest book in science fiction history. NO book can ever hope to live up to that kind of hype. But I believe Brian and Kevin do a masterful job of setting up things that we =know= are going to happen in later books without killing the suspense. There's whole new storylines to explore in this series, which they do later on. So Brian's not Frank. But he's working from Frank's notes with the aid of an author who is used to working in other people's universes. If you like &quot;Dune&quot; give this series a chance. I believe if you come into it with an open mind, you'll find it almost as entertaining as the original."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I started out skeptical of this novel for a couple reasons. One I am not a big fan of Kevin J. Anderson. His work on Star Wars and other series was just plain lousy to me. It was simple reading, played out story, and just down right uniinteresting.The second thing is that it is not Frank Herbert. I understand Brian is as close as we can get but when comparing this and the series to Franks epic series there is no comparrison. The characters have different attitudes. The descriptions are somewhat off. The tone of the novel doesn't match up with the original books. It is annoying how some characters in Frank's novels don't know each other but now in these prequels they are great buddies. Kinda like Leto and House Vernius of Ix and Gurney Halleck and Liet Kynes. Finally the book lacks the old biblical sense that Frank put into his. It seemed in Franks novels ever sentence was trying to be prophetic and hold meaning while these novels are just playful fun with some deeper meanings but nothing like his fathers.However I did give the novel 4 stars because even though it doesn not mesh with the original Dune works it is still quite entertaining, a fun read, and it clears up many questions to those left ambiguous in the original Dune series. So if you are a Dune fan and can get over the discrepencies between the works and just go with the flow you will enjoy this series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Ok, so it was not a masterpiece as the original was but what could posibly match that? Maybe a little shallow but it's fun revaling in all that the old Dune was. I found it an interesting combination of knowing how events must end (though not nessicarily in the manner) and new plot points not discussed in other books.The repeatitiveness can get a little bit irritating (ok, Shaddam's hair is pommaded, I get it). But overall I think it's a strong prequel to one of the greatest books ever written.Seriously, worth the read if you're longing for something new in the Dune world, or even just getting started."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I won't go into how the book doesn't compare to Frank Herbert's original novels in any way.You don't have to be a Dune fan to see that this book is bad, quite simply:- The writing is uninspired, full of old clich&eacute;s and inappropriate slang. The authors explain the plot over and over again, insulting the intelligence of their readers (and boring them to tears).- There is no *point* to the book; no overall plotline, theme or symbolism. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens to a random collection of characters. Therefore there's no feeling of suspense, no anticipation of how the conflict will be resolved.- The characters are flat, uninteresting and apparently more than a bit stupid. Each has only one dominant character trait (good, evil, scheming etc...), and always acts in accordance with it, never revealing hidden depths or otherwise surprising the reader. No character develops significantly over the span of the book.For such a simplistic book, I found it amazingly hard to read. I continually lost interest in the characters and their actions, and the prose quite literally drove me to sleep.This book is not very entertaining. It is not interesting. It is not well-written, epic or poetic. It is certainly not profound.\\"Dune\\" by Frank Herbert, on the other hand, is all of those things. So why not read that instead?"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Of course it's not as good as the sixth book of the original serie, but it put light on the origin of some characters."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Look, I don't see how people reviewing this book expect Frank Herbert to get up from his grave and write another book. Cut it some slack. Obviously it's not going to be as serious as the others, lighten up people. It is a good book, an easy read, though not exactly what I expected, it still attempts to explain some things that Mr. Herbert and to put in an Appendix. I think the reason most people don't like this book is because it tries to oversimplify things, compared to the not-so-simplistic DC. For the authors, this is their first attempt at trying to write in the shadow of Mr. Herbert. Let's just see how the next book turns out before we pass total judgement on their writing style."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This is a good book. It is not the original by any stretch, but, I think it derserves some credit for bringing us back to the world of Dune. Overall, I see teh negative comments on this book and the negative comments on SW: The Phantom Menace to be along the same lines. Remember that both came along after years of already determined outcomes, characters, and fan attachments. Both are constitantly out of style with the past(their future) works. Take the use of modern day slang in both. The &quot;Uh...&quot;'s refered to in earlier comments. The Marv Albert like guy in Phantom Menace. Basically, just remember that this was intended to be the first in the long lline of saga ,and to view it in context that there are two(?) more stories to tell before we get to the original Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When I saw this novel available, as a hard-core Dune fan, I HAD to have it. When I finally received it, I immediately curled up on the sofa by the fireplace and sat down to read. What I found was a mix of both insighful writing, flashes - almost echoes - of Frank Herbert's original ideas and phrasing, and unfortunately, jarring use of slang and interruptions in narrative flow. I enjoyed the long phrasing and flow of the original &quot;Dune&quot;, and later, &quot;Heretics...&quot; and &quot;Chapterhouse.&quot; This book occasionally went there, but the phrasing was too tight, too condensed at times to flow for me. As for the reviewer who thought the &quot;no-rooms&quot; concept was out of place, it was not. Remember Lucilla and Duncan in (I believe) &quot;Heretics&quot;? An ancient Harkonnen no-room was the description given. Yes, enjoyable and a nice addition, but I hope that if there are any books forthcoming, they be more intense and elaborate."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Is this a bad book? No, worse books have been written but that still does not make it a good Dune book. Here's the major problem with the book... it is too simple. Frank Herbert wrote Dune intricately with various symbols and social criticism woven in, House Atreides (and the sequels) do not do any of that. When Dune is read, it's not just a simple novel its a piece of literature, House Atreides is just a book attempting to go mainstream.Other problems with the book is its use of language. It sounds too much like it is being in the 1990's while Dune can be read at anypoint without any era-dialect. It incorporates too much from Star Wars, and if you changed all the character names it probably would read like a Star Wars novel. Its characterizations are weak and completely wrong. Count Fenring is an insane killer, Shaddam is an immature, scheming Machiavellian bastard, the women are nothing more than spoiled brats, and Duncan meeting with Leto comes off as a soap opera plot line.It has inconsistancies (which the later novels make no attempt to explain and create even more inconsistancies). This book is an attempt at mainstreaming not the continuing of a great work of literature."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I'm a fan of the Dune series and have read them all. It took me awhile to get used to the writing but when I did I loved it. The elder Herbert didn't spoon feed the reader. The book &amp; the world Arraksis are full of mystery and wonder. I felt the younger Herbert and this Anderson guy didn't do any of that. They lay everything out leaving no secrets, wonder or for that matter depth.If you've read the Dune series from Dune to Chapterhouse you know why Arraksis is a desert world. Why does the author have Kynes asking why? It just feels as though Frank Herbert would have taken a different, more satisfying approach. I've only read about 150 pages of this book and hate it. I'll suffer through it to see what happens (if I can). I'm just happy I got it from the library instead of spending the $20.Definitely two thumbs waaaaaay down."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Not a terrible piece of work by Brian Herbert. Certainly nowhere near the complexity or intricacy of his father's work in the original Dune series, but still an enjoyable read nonetheless. Herbert manages to spin a fairly interesting yarn concerning the events that predate the first Dune book. The timeframe involves a young Leto Atreides, before he takes over the role of Duke from his father, Paulus. The entire trilogy deals mainly with the polical movements and events of houses Atreides, Harkonnen, and Corrino (the Emperor), but many other smaller matters are addressed, such as Fremen developments on Dune, the Tlelaxu takeover of Ix, and of course the omnipresent Bene Gesserit.Once again, do not expect the in depth analysis of the interplay between politics, religion, and oracles that we got from Frank Herbert, but don't let that dissuade you from reading the series. Certainly worth the time for any Dune fan."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"If your looking for the mysticism and philosophy that was trademark of Frank Herbert, you wont find it here. Well written, but doesnt capture the mood of the originals. Worth the read if your a fan of the Imperium though."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I'm astonished that anyone who's read Herbert's masterpiece could possibly consider House Atreides anything more than one star. 5 stars?? Have these people lost their minds and have been brainwashed by the publisher into thinking that this has any merit at all so that they'll cave in and buy the rest of this garbage? And say it was good just because they want to believe it's good? Have any of them actually READ the original? Or did they just see the Lynch film and play the video game?Poor Frank Herbert -- his genius work pilloried and degraded (by his own son, no less) all for the sake of ... what? Commercial appeal? Sheer greed? Stupidity, is more like it, and I was the one who was stupid in buying this book.I'm what some would call a \\"Dune fan\\", so of course I'm going to be critical. But the only semblance to the themes, philosophy and imagination of Frank Herbert's undeniable classic is that it happens to use the same names for people and planets. The rest is like the worst sort of fan fiction found on some awful anglefire or geocities website.It gets worse. This book is nothing short of Abomination. All of the carefully constructed ideas beautifully presented in Dune, from languages to technology to politics are more than neglected. They are trampled on, abused and then told to shut up and put on a smile while they get repackaged and pimped out to the public.I admit, I fell for it too. I kept on reading page after excruciating page, hoping that well, maybe it'll get better, and sure, the plot is juvenile, but it's \\"Dune\\"! Now, I think it wasn't even supposed to be \\"Dune\\", but a marketing ploy to get us to buy into a third-rate sci-fi series. I threw away the book immediately after I was done."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It was wonderful to return my beloved Dune universe so many years after Frank Herbert's death. Reading this book was like becoming reacquainted with long-lost friends. I always wondered why anyone would want the hideous physical transformation associated with becoming a Guild navigator until I read about Dmurr's experience. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment in the prequel and also hope that a new series will follow where Frank Herbert left off. Meanwhile, I'm off to read Dune for the 5th time."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I originaly read DUNE many years ago. It is a classic. DUNE; House Atreides, is not an original; however, it is a welcome addition to the DUNE mythos. Some of the negative comments in other reviews are a bit disturbing. Some reviewers seem very angry and I don't see why. The story in DUNE needs to be finished and Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have given DUNE readers some hope that the story will finally be told."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As a work of science-fiction, this book is good solid material...but it is not Frank Herbert's words or thoughts. The book reads very much like a Kevin J. Anderson novel. I like Kevin's work and this book is a page turner, but I couldn't find Frank at all. When reading the original books, one could feel the quiet, fierce intelligence of Frank under every word.In this book, the characters were, in some ways, better realized than any in the original books, with distinctive opinions and goals. The plot was simple but very effective. I think Frank would have been proud of this novel, but you can't substitute the real thing. This book in no way approaches the deep subtle complexity of Frank Herbert's vision. However, it was fun to revisit the Dune universe with a couple of excellent sci-fi writers. I will read the next book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"If you loved Dune, then you must read this book. It's been at least 10 years since I read Dune and now I can't wait to read the whole series again. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Herbert stayed true to the details and vision of the series. I absolutely couldn't put it down. I don't want to give anything away, but you will be thrilled with this read!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"If you like the Dune series, this book is worth it, if for no other reason than to return to the universe (which, if you're like me, you do often) I enjoyed it, but it felt ... wrong. It flowed strangely ... it seemed to lack the seriousness that marked Frank Herbert's work. All in all, good background for the Dune series, and I can't wait to see what else comes from the Herbert/Anderson collaboration. There is still alot of uncovered ground between &quot;House Atreides&quot; and the opening to &quot;Dune&quot;. Enjoy."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson did a masterful job of interpreting the Dune universe as it existed before the birth of Paul Atreides. The story was compelling, the characters were engaging, and the convoluted alliances, enmities, and intrigues were true to what Frank Herbert did in his original novel. It is definitely worth reading and I am looking forward to the next novels in the series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I wish I had the words to describe my emotions after reading HOUSE ATREIDES... I was afraid the book wouldn't match the complexity, originality and depth that made DUNE the best science fiction series in history. Boy, was I was wrong! House Atreides is all that and more. The characters I've come to love after reading the series seven times are all there. As is the mystery surrounding Dune, the plans within plans, the epic struggle between greed and nobility. Thanks Frank Herbert for Dune! And thanks Brian and Kevin for embracing the legend and achieving the impossible!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I agree that this is a fun, fast-paced, complex and generally effective novel. Alas, I'm sorry that so little of it (relatively) takes place on Arrakis, which for my money is the most fascinating part of the original. Also, this book makes a reader see how the original relied overmuch on stereotypes of good vs. bad: I mean, come on, all the Atreides are super-good guys, and all the Harkonnens hideously depraved? Could do without the endless hammering on the fact that the evil Baron is gay, too. I realize that Frank Herbert made him so in the original, but here it sounds a little shrill and homophobic. Still, this is an enjoyable read, and I agree that it's as good or better than most of the 'Dune' sequels, excepting perhaps 'Children of Dune.'"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson do a great job in reviving the Dune universe. The novel is filled with action, plots, and a dozen new and dynamic characters. There is no doubt about it, this novel must win the Nebula and Hugo awards for the year. The only bad thing is that I probably have to wait a year to read the next novel. &quot;The spice must flow,&quot; and the Dune novels must continue."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I found this book to be the best in this series since the original novel. The book is interesting, the plot unfolds at a reasonable pace and its character development is excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone who loved Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I must say I have been a &quot;Dune&quot; fan ever since I saw the original movie.The Dune series, for me, are the epitome of Sci-Fi. I love the background, the characters, the philosophy... the whole world and universe Herbert created.In this book, I thought I recognized some of the original ideas and background Herbert senior created. Some developments seem to be just &quot;filling&quot;, though.Leto's character is a strong-willed, intelligent young noble, heir to a Great House, a fact that explains much of Paul Muad'ib's character; he is not only a result of genetic tampering, but also of his upbringing.I thought it was interesting to read about it; the relationship between the Old Duke and Leto, leads one to see the relationship between Leto and Paul in a new light.This book opened up some interesting secrets and background on the more complicated issues described in the original book, which have led me to understand more about Dune.I recommend this book. I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I had some ambivalent feelings about this book. On one hand, we get all the components of the original Dune saga: Duke Leto, Bene Tlaxu, Shai Hulud, etc. It reminds us that Dune lives on as long as die-hard fans like ourselves are around. Unfortunately, Kevin J. Anderson falls short of the masterful Frank Herbert. The plots are generally predictable (even without knowledge of the Dune series), but I found them interesting nonetheless. The author explained too much overtly or with overuse of cliche, and this detracted from the subtle mystery that surrounded the original Dune. I enjoyed Anderson's portrayal of the Baron Harkonnen, but I was most disappointed with Duncan Idahoe. Granted, Duncan did have a difficult time having his parents gunned down and being chased through the hunting grounds, but I thought his escape was too easy. I expected something more stressful, more painful of his experience, torture to the limits of human endurance or even molestation by the Baron himself. I also expected Leto to have something more to do with his escape. Remember, Duncan was supposed to have experienced so much terror so much pain from the Harkonnens that he could &quot;never&quot; repay his debt to the Atreides family, not in a hundred ghola lifetimes of service to the God Emperor Leto. It just did not seem like enough. The Harkonnens killed his family and chased him a little bit, and then he escaped."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune: House Atreides brings us back to the landmark epicuniverse created by the late Frank Herbert. Although, it lacks thesubtle nuances and layers of the original series, it was enjoyableescapism. I enjoyed having the gaping holes filled in concerning thebackground of the various characters. I am planning to read its sisternovel Dune: House Harkonnen in the near future, with the hope that theauthors might improve on their first outting...but realisticly FrankHerbert is a tough act to follow. The authors should at least becommended for trying."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Id just like to start off this review with saying that the first review up here... by that French guy, was absolutly uncalled for. Now with that out of the way... on to the books. It wasn't that bad. Although I agree that it did lack some of the mysticism and philosophy of the Frank Herbert originals, I liked the way it led into the wonderful book we know and loved. I actually got started reading these books from the movie, (Although I've heard it said- and am forced to agree- that the movie was horrible.) I watched when I was home sick one day, and caught just enough of the plot to think that the book might be interesting. Boy was I right! I spent a captivating week reading it all the way through London, and have been reading the sequals ever since. Although this prequel written by Frank Herbert's son, truly doesn't live up to his father's standards, I definetly would suggest reading it. Dune fans will love seeing old faces &quot;before they were stars&quot; and seeing their lives fall into place to where you know the story picks up in DUne. Dune: House Harkonnen seems like it might be pretty neat aswell, although, I can't think about what else they might have time to tell about before the starting of Dune. Oh well, we'll finde out!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I did enjoy this installment of the Dune series if only to return back to the characters I've missed all these years. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys the Dune series, just don't look for any new revelations and the writing takes a little getting used to. There seems to be a lot of repetition of facts through-out the novel."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It's hard following a master such as Frank Herbert. The pressure in comparisons would seem insurmountable. Yet having read this book I was amazed at the story line and depth to the characters. Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson fill in the gaps that are sorely lacking in the original masters. Duncan Idaho, Pardot Kynes and Prince Leto are given more depth defining there personna that will lead them to the decisions they make in the Dune Series. House Atreides also covers new or short referenced characters in detail. Duke Paulaus and Dominic Vernius and Emperor Elrod IV are just a few in this 600 paged novel. I especially enjoyed the portrayal of the Harkonnen line. Once and for all the reader learns just how evil the Harkonnen's have become. In summation, this is a must read, if I could have rated it six stars I would have."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I read Dune when it was first published, have been reading SF for over 30 years in fact. This book, being written by someone other than Frank Herbert, is bound to disappoint anyone who made their way through the first series. To write a prequel to, arguably, one of the best SF novels of all time, is a very ambitious idea, and one which suceeds only partially.Some problems include: lack of character development on some levels; too much focus on Harkonnen cruelty and torture (if I want to read about Hannibal Lecter, I'll read Thomas Harris, thank you); an unfortunate use of women mostly as flat, one-dimensional characters; and so on.There are some good parts: I liked the background we're given on Duncan's childhood, I liked the exploration into Ix and the Guild, I liked the peek into Leto's parent's relationship, I liked the exploration of Shaddam's relationship with Fenring.All in all though, the writing style is just too far from Frank Herberts to make this book match. I read it all the way through, but don't know that I'd go back to it again and again, as I did with the original series. Buy it and read it if you're a Dune fan, but don't expect it to be something it's not."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"House Atreides is a thoroughly enjoyable read. The intrigue within the Houses of the Known Universe and the background of the Bene Gesserit's birthing program were fascinating. I thought the characters were well developed and reflected what they would become in Dune, if they survived that long. I learned more about what will happen in Dune by reading this book. I have already recommended this book to several people."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was skeptic upon hearing that the Dune universe was being brought back after Frank Herbert's death, but you know what? This book was actually really good. I will not deny that the characters arent as deep, and overall the book is not as philosphical, (those were things that made Frank Herbert so unique) but one cannot deny its entertainment value. There is always something exciting going on. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is a reason others have pointed out: the constant explanation and re-explanation of events that occured only a few chapters ago. Hopefully the authors wont do that in the next one. Put simply, don't expect Frank Herbert, and you will completely enjoy this wonderful &quot;history lesson&quot; of Frank Herbert's incredible universe that is Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I think that anyone who has read Dune has a clear vision of that world and what it entails. If this same book was written by Frank Herbert, It would have had more depth and substance at the expense of plot. Unfortunately it was not and can never be. As a novel it is entertaining and fun to read, but it has more inconsistencies then I would prefer. There are certain plot lines that do not seem concordant with the original series. At any rate a must read for any fan of the original."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I will freely admitt that I was a bit hesitant when I first read this book. I mean no disrespect for BH and KA, but it would be damn near impossible to write like FH did in the dune series. While the writing style was different, it was never the less a good read and worthy of the Dune series. This book/series fills in some details on how the characters became who/why they are. I would recommend it, just to have another story of Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This is a prequel to the original DUNE Chronicles, unquestionably one of the great science fiction stories of the century. Dune House Atreides is a lively blend of adventure and intrigue woven into a stunning embroidery of the Great Houses of the Emporium. It is set in a time before that of the original Dune novels. The authors take you on a journey from planet to planet, character to character and bring them all together in a lively ending. Dune fans will find the history fascinating and some characters familiar. Newcomers to Dune stories will get a taste of what we all so much enjoyed in the original chronicles.Sparkling descriptions of the environments of very different places and narrative portraits of some penetrating characters will keep your interest. A few of the characters are Elrood IX, ruler of the known universe, Baron Vladimar Harkonnen, Governor of Planet Arrakis, Pardot Kynes, Planetologist, Duke Paulus Atreides, ruler of the planet Caladan, and his son the young Duke Lito. The Baron Vladimar Harkonnen hunts people including a child named Duncan Idaho who eludes him. The young Duke finds himself in charge of his house at an early age. The Emperor Elrood's son Shaddam and his degenerate friend Hasimar Fenring are scheming evil plots. Meanwhile Pardot Kynes is discovering the ecosystems and native culture on Arrakis (a planet also known as Dune).In the mix are the Mentats (humans with computer like minds), the crafty Bene Gesserit witches, and the dirty Tleilaxu. The Spacing Guild has a monopoly on space travel. The CHOAM is a commercial organization controlling the all important spice melange (noted mainly for its geriatric qualities).Plots within plots, dark secrets and a few romances kept my interest for all of the 600 or so pages. I found this refreshingly well written and fluid. You will hate the bad guys and love the heroes. This book will leave you wanting more of the same and rumor has it Herbert and Anderson have at least a couple more Dune prequels coming out soon."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:If you ever wanted to know the crucial back stories of how Shaddam IV came to power, Leto met Lady Jessica or how the Tleilaxu came to own the planet IX (was this ever even a plotline in the original series?), then this is a must read. You must be the same person who frets over why Captain Kirk would KNOWINGLY use the wrong button on his chair to summon Scotty. You must also enjoy picking fly excrement out of pepper.This book is also an excellent cure for insomnia with the added benefit of being non-habit forming. We guarantee it.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:Sequel books based on the works of more talented writers are often like that top drawer in your parent's bedroom. It is best for the children to stay away from them lest they reveal something unpleasant that for everyone's sake was better off remaining hidden. We have read stereo instructions more creative and interesting than this book. It adds absolutely nothing to the Dune universe and should be avoided at all costs. We question the need for two authors when one would have sufficed to create this mess. One almost gets the impression that Brian wrote this awful, insipid book to exact revenge on his father for causing some horrific, adolescent trauma. The Dune series was most known for the intricate and compelling \\"plots within plots within plots\\". The plots and intrigue in this book are boring, plodding and constructed like some sort of literary Rube Goldberg machine. \\"Plods within plods within plods\\" is a more accurate description. It was known that this was the first book in a planned three book series. After finishing this book, we were not anticipating reading further installments. The feeling we had at the thought of reading two more of these books can best be described as sorrow and dread. We read this nonsense so you wont have to. Remember us in your prayers.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Everything I've read from Kevin J. Anderson has been an absolute nightmare and this is no exception. Undoubtedly the mere existence of these dune books is proof of the royalties from the original series running a bit low for Brian Herbert's taste. This is just a cheap attempt to capitalize on the desires of Dune fans of all ages for a new and lifelike storyline. Believe me, I wanted it to be good too...but after five pages it's apparent to almost everyone that this new series is just awful. The character development, the style, the dialogue...it's all reminiscent of the very hideous Jedi academy series that Kevin J. Anderson was also in charge of some years back. That's the title of this review - can't anyone stop this man? The irony is that the introduction to Kevin J. Anderson's website (presumably written by him) is a very well-written synopsis of the career of an apparently intelligent and accomplished writer. Too bad for us that everything actually published by the man turns out to be horrible. For heaven's sake, Brian, ditch this man and write the novels yourself! Belive me, they can only get better. Anyone who doubts me can just compare the original Dune (or, for that matter, any other Frank Herbert novel) with the tripe that Anderson spews forth. Maybe I'm too harsh because I was expecting something in line with the elder Herbert's novels. I don't deny that the expectations are high. But the very act of publishing these new ones would say that these should be as good, no? In short, save your money and just buy Dune. If you've already read Dune, and haven't read The Dosadi Experiment, then buy that. If you've read both of those, buy something else from Frank Herbert. Whatever the costs, avoid Kevin J. Anderson like the plague."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When I picked up this book, I was prepared to be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised instead. Frank Herbert's first few Dune novels were superb, but he started going downhill with his last few books. Now the series was being taken over by others. I could only think of Asimov who, after writing &quot;the Foundation Trilogy&quot;, probably the greatest science fiction ever written, came back in his last years to write some dismal sequels and has been suceeded by other authors writing yet more lackluster books. This novel, on the other hand, captures the spirit of the first and best Dune novel, discussing events occurring decades before the action in &quot;Dune&quot;. He further &quot;fleshes out&quot; the main characters while at the same time being true to the original. The characters are believable and the action and treachery(a key element in the universe of Dune) are fast-paced. I anxiously look forward to the next in the series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Well, being a Dune Saga fan I must confess I was more than a little skeptical when my brother told me about it and that he'd ordered it for me. Was I in for a huge surprise or what? The book is wonderfully written, set a few decades before the first one written by Frank Herbert, DUNE. It covers a lot, explains many plots, revenges, betrayals and is a perfect prequel to the Dune Saga...I only hope there'll be more of those as there sure is enough that is still untold."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Could do better.... We've all had this on our classwork/homework.Having read the Dune saga in the 80's, it was with immense joy I saw House Atreides as a title in my local library. I immediately opend a page at random (not too near the middle) to spotread. Hmm....puerile. I took it out anyway, there was bound to be a &quot;re-opening&quot; to the Dune universe I knew so well.Two intermittent weeks later. Poorly written, more like the writing of an adolescent who saw the David Lynch film version too many times &amp; cannot help but refer to that, rather than the writings of Mr Herbert Snr.I adored Dune &amp; it's sequels. I felt SO in touch with Paul Atreides at that moment when he took the Water of Life (having had a particular interest in 'substances' at that time, &amp; always sprinkling cinnammon on anything I drank!). But this just ain't even close. I felt nothing. I laboured through the 600 pages more as a debt to Frank Herbert &amp; the usual &quot;it might get better&quot; feeling. But it didn't.I will read House Harkonnen only because it may provide detail to the rest of the saga. But I tell you now, I will skip ANY rambling I see. I've learned my lesson."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I had to re-read Dune after I finished HA to cleanse my spirit of a novel that, despite its intentions, cheapened Herbert's brilliant universe. For example, nowhere will you find Frank Herbert writing: &quot;The worm approached like a locomotive.&quot; But this is the sort of uninspired writing you get for 600 full pages. The character subtleties, what there are of them, are explained away by an annoying narrator as though the novel were meant for children. Don't read unless you enjoyed a similarly bad prequel: Phantom Menace."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When I read Brian's books, I though it was a parallel Dune where characters are simple and contradicts what happen in classic Dune."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"One of the most well known science fiction series was begun by a world renowned author Frank Herbert; he wrote the founding books of this series, Dune, and 5 sequels, including God Emperor of Dune and Children of Dune. However Frank Herbert died an unexpected death at age 65, leaving his fanatical followers with one of the worst cliff hangers in history and many things in the Dune Universe unfinished.Then in 1999, more than 10 years after Frank Herbert's death, his son, Brian Herbert, took the reins, publishing Dune: House Atreides in collaboration with an already acclaimed Sci-fi writer, Kevin J. Anderson.Brian was already an established science fiction author, having written several books on his own, including titles such as Sidney's Comet and Prisoners of Arionn, he also has published a book titled Dreamer of Dune, which is a biography of his father.House Atreides looked into the near past of Dune, exploring the lives of Paul Atreides' father, Leto Atreides, and grandfather, Paulus Atreides, following the events leading up to Paulus' death and Leto's early rise to power. Leto is pushed into the role of Duke at age 15 and is shortly after wrongly accused of a heinous crime which he did not commit. He is forced to gamble with everything he posses in order to clear his good name in the most risky form of trial known in the empire.The book is full of deeply entwined plots and stories following at least 7 other people in this incredibly developed fictional universe. One of these stories is that of the Atreides rival, the infamous House Harkonnen and its violent, evil Baron, Vladimir Harkonnen. The Baron is currently in control of the biggest source of profit in the known universe, the planet Arrakis, called Dune by its natives, the planet produces the incredibly addictive substance known as Melange, or Spice. The Harkonnen part of the story is full of violent murders, betrayals, and deaths and always keeps the reader wanting to know more about these evil people.Arrakis is a complete mystery to all people in the universe, even The Fremen (Fre-men), Dune's natives; this prompts Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe Elrood to dispatch a planetologist to the desert planet to observe how spice is created. This part of the story follows Pardot Keynes and his investigation of the desert planet. He ponders the disappearance of Dune's water (the most valuable research on the dry planet), the survival of the Fremen, and how to terraform the planet. It follows him as he becomes a prominent figure in Fremen society, losing loyalty to the Imperial Throne, becoming a powerful and water rich prophet to them, all well maintaining the illusion he is still a loyal Imperial servant by sending frequent reports on the ecology of Arrakis.The receiver of these reports is Shaddam Corrino IV, heir apparent to the Imperial throne. He and his confidant and assassin, Hasimir Fenring, plot against Shaddam's father, then Emperor Elrood Corrino IX, in order to achieve a hurried crowning of the young prince. Dangerous obstacles stand in their way, requiring quick thinking and fast talking to avoid the detection of their fiendish scheme, a scheme that will change the history of the empire for ever.There are several schools of thought mentioned throughout all of these stories, one being the Bene Gesserit. This school of thought only accepts women, and has an extensive breeding program, which Gaius Helen Mohiam is part of. She is ordered to bear a child via Baron Harkonnen in order to achieve the goals of this program. The idea is to produce their version of a Messiah, a Kwisatz Haderach. She must deal closely with the treacherous Baron, and things are undoubtedly going to get messy.This book focuses on the development of House Atreides and its morals. Honor pervades the theme of this book, with the young Duke Leto working tirelessly to save the honor of himself, his friends, his father, and his mother in a world full of political turmoil and distrust.The amount of detail put into this book, and indeed this series, leaves literary masterpieces such as the Lord of the Rings looking almost bare bones in comparison. The depth of the characters, coupled with the rich description, intense plots, and beautiful writing leaves the reader's mind hungering for more. After you read this book you will certainly understand why it made the New York Times Best Sellers list.Star Wars fans and people who enjoy a political thriller will be enthralled with this book, it's intense sci-fi universe full of alien tech coupled with its wheels within wheels plots leave one breathless with anticipation, waiting for the next unexpected twist. This book is undoubtedly a 10 out of 10 in my mind."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The original \\"Dune\\" is my all-time favorite science fiction novel. I have read it so many times in the last 20 years that if you read me a single sentence at random from the book I can tell you where you are in the story. I also love the last two books in the series, \\"Heretics of Dune\\" and \\"Chapterhouse, Dune.\\" So, it was with much trepidation that I picked up \\"Dune, House Atreides.\\" I didn't think anyone but Frank Herbert could do justice to another Dune book.Fortunately, I was wrong. \\"Dune, House Atreides\\" is the story of young Leto Atreides (Paul's father). It is extremely well written and does an excellent job of capturing not only Frank Herbert's characters, but also his writing style. Reading it was like visiting an old friend (one I never expected to be with again). The story is well paced and holds many excellent surprises and turns of events. Congratulations, Messrs. Herbert and Anderson, on a job well done."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It is true, that this novel was unnecessary, but I for one am glad that the Dune series is continuing. This book should not be compared to the original, because in truth nothing can be equal too or better than Dune. It may seem to some readers that the characters are portrayed diiferently than they were in the original, but that is untrue. We are simply seeing what caused the characters to become so evil, or noble. It is a necessary glimpse into their past. The book also gives us a better view of the Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Ixians. We learn many new things in this book, things that we had never known. We should not give negative praise to this book, nor should we insult the authors. Brian Herbert made the right choice in continuing the Dune series, and if you disagree, then truly you are the ones who do not understand what Dune really is."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have been a huge fan o sci-fi for years, and most of all the Duen series. I have always admired the very skillful way that Frank Herbert had of creating a thoroughly convincing and believable environment, while abstaining from the greates of crimes that can be comitted by a writer: providing too much detail. This prequel is completely out of line with the other 6 books in the series, and although I can appreciate the curiosity that fans have regarding the smaller details in the Dune History, this should not be an excuse for producing a bad copy of a wonderful original. The temptation of making prequels should be resisted at all costs: they are never as good as the originals! Literature pieces should be regarded as works of art, not like TV sitcoms; if a book is left unfinished, it should stay so. If the Dune series stopped at number 6, well then, we should consider ourselves lucky to have 6 wonderful books to read. Not 7; not 6 with a 3 prequels. It would be the same if suddenly Chris Tolkien decided to make a prequel to Lord of the Rings. It would be a complete aberration - and that is why the books that have been released in History of Middle Earth have been scholarly studies of original material. If fans want more details, well, tough. That's all there is. Furthermore, the book itself is very poorly constructed, the characters are right out of the \\"Cliche Book of Heroes and Villains\\". The Bene Gesserit are reduced from their wonderfully mysterious characterization, the Imperial court is a sham, count Fenring is a poor excuse for a almost-Kwisatz Haderach. Not to mention poor Leto - a boyish, prudish teenager from BH 90210. All in all, it would have been much better (and probably harder) to have made some sourcebooks, based on Herbert's postumous papers. The fans would have been better served."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Within one chapter I knew that this &quot;prequel&quot; wouldn't be satisfying by a long shot.Most glaring thing missing to me are the strong, powerful, sensitive female characters that populate Frank Herbert's Dune books. The women in House Atreides exist as plot points, to look good, or give birth, or be killed.But most of all, gone are the philosophical musings and obvious brainpower of the original author. It's almost painful to read, and I don't think I will read any new installments, for this reason alone."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The two new authors of Dune don't try to emulate the style of Frank Herbert, but their approach is also solid and admirable. I was from the first page willing to listen to these new storytellers and was drawn in more and more. So many things, which are only mentioned on the side in original Dune Books are elaborated upon in full color. Learning the past of many familiar characters is fascinating for an experienced Dune reader and is also a solid place to start for the beginner. What one would expect from a Dune novel is there. The labyrinthine politics and intense personal struggles are all there as before. I found nothing at all lacking in this new approach and give my wholehearted approval."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Don't pass on this one just because you're a Dune purist. It was enjoyable in its own right."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When I began this book it was with a feeling of trepidation, for I loved the original Dune series and questioned whether this was going to be a cheap ripoff. But it is the real deal! We're back in Frank Herbert's universe with all the plots and counter-plots. This book is every bit as good as the original. The detail is stunning. I loved this book down to the last word and period and anxiously await the next one. Great read-keep them coming. P.S. My wife loved it too!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book was not only better than I had expected, but it rekindled my desire to re-read the original series. Really gripping (I found myself bringing it with me every time I thought I might just have five spare moments to open it up!)"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this book. So much so that I actually threw it away. Did the authors even read the original? Or did they read National Lampoon's Doon? To say that this book has a \\"style\\" of writing is an insult to even the worst usage of the English language. Unbelievably obvious errors, poor character development and a lack of understanding of what went into the writing of the original all combine to make this one of the worst books ever written. Buy it at your own peril."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"People may be tempted to buy this book on some expectation that it will be as good as Frank Herbert's originals.Well, of course, that would be impossible. After all, Dune is widely acclaimed as the greatest Science Fiction story ever. But we'd all love to continue to enjoy the story, so perhaps it's OK for someone else to write it?Unfortunately this book shows that this theory doesn't work. Where Frank Herbert's brilliance shone through using pace, subtlety and imagination, 'House Atreides' is plodding, lifeless and explicatory by comparison.Reading this book may spoil your happy memory of the original series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"First off, I must admit that this is the first Dune book I have read, and thus I cannot comment on the other reviewers' tendency to hate this prequel. I have just ordered all the 6 original Dune books, and will very much be looking forward to reading them.However, I absolutely LOVED this book, and while I agree an 8 year old Duncan Idaho defeating Harkonnen troops may be over the edge, his methods are clearly stated in the book and could be justified to an extent. I guess this book is best if you have not read the originals, and until I do, it shall remain on my list of must-reads."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have done an excellent job of continuing the Dune saga. This book contains the essense of the original Frank Herbert series. I am anxiously awaiting the coming additions."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have read some of the other reviews here, and notice some animosity from some of the reviewers about how it isn't (as good /written like) the original Dune series. I too don't believe that it is as good as the original Dune book, but come on, how many books have been written that are? If you are expecting Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson to write in the exact same style as Frank, you will be dissapointed, but they definately have a great flow of their own, and it reveals more of the Dune tale to readers. Sure there may be some minor discrepancies between this book and the original series, but they are definately few and far between, and will probably only matter to the most hard core of Dune fans. If this book was written as well as it is, but as a standalone book, not in the Dune universe, I believe many of the ratings would go up. It just seems to me that it will almost always be impossible to please all the upper elite crust of hard core fans of any series when the series is continued by a different author. I believe that if you go into this book with an open mind, it will capture your imagination, and take you back again to the Dune worlds that you know and love."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is fun for those who want to revisit the world of the Landsraad and Bene Gesserit, but it adds nothing new to the pre-existing universe as conceived by Frank Herbert. The plot is contrived and not one word throughout its 600 pages sent me to my dictionary; you can fault Frank Herbert for digressing, but at least he had a rich vocabulary. If you haven't read any Dune novels yet, start with Frank Herbert's original masterpiece. As one would expect from a good Futurist, Herbert explores politics, ethics, history, sociology, psychology, ecology in new, and at times unsettling, ways. Alas, the tree has sprouted far from the apple seed--one of the most compelling and thought-provoking novels of the 21st century this is not. Dune: House Atreides is a true disappointment."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I liked the book, forgoing food and family to get it done. I read the original DUNE books when I was around 12, so I don't really remember them well. I intend to reread them all soon.The only real problem I have with this one is the same problem I have had with the other Kevin J. Anderson books I have read, the constant repeating of plot information at the beginning of every chapter. The book could have been trimmed considerably because of this, so I found myself skipping just to get past the repeating."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"After reading House Atreides, I reread Frank Herbert's original novel for about the fifth time. While I enjoyed the new book and anxiously await the next installment in Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson prequel trilogy, I found it lacking when compared to the original masterpiece. House Atreides lacks the subtleties that made Dune the finest SF novel ever written. In the authors' notes at the end, Herbert and Anderson hint that they will one day write a sequel to Chapterhouse Dune, Frank Herbert's final installment in the series. I'm glad the new Dune authors have decided to try a few practice novels before attempting to extend the stories Frank Herbert wrote so well."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book was descent, but it did lack some of Frank's complexities, which made the original so good. Part of my problem with this book are the anachronisisms. The no-globe/ship I could see as a DISTINCTED possibility. Because Lucillia or Teg thought that the one on Giedi Prime was from Leto II's time, but they didn't know for sure. The one anachronism that I can't stand are the referances to &quot;Dur&quot; and &quot;Guldur&quot; Unless I'm wrong, aren't those the names that ppl from the Scattering called the Tyrant? But otherwise a good book. I liked the descriptions of Katain and of Ix."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The Dune series as written by Frank Herbert was marvellous in its depth of plot development and full blown characters. After his death I feared the end of this great series was over. Fortunately his son has collaborated with Kevin Anderson to continue the series. Is it as good as the original stories written by Frank Herbert? Definitely not. It is still a wonderful journey back in time to the days prior to the original Dune story. We get to visit again with our old friends who we read and lived with for years. I am happy to be able to experience a continuation of the story. The best news is that the authors suggest another novel will be forthcoming finishing off the series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've long been a fan of Frank Herbert's DUNE series. Since 1985, I've poured through the six book and begged, borrowed or stolen copies of the regular, wide-screen and Director's Cut of the movie. Although *extremely* well-researched, Mr. Herbert left us dangling in several spots, especially after his death. We mourned him, and kept reading his words.However... Kevin J. Anderson and and Mr. Herbert's son Brian have expanded our knowledge as keenly as a tall shot of the spice-essence. This prequel clarifies positions not discussed until much later (the body-eating disease of the Baron Harkonnen, No-Globes, the Tleiaxu takeover of IX) and introduces us to concepts and characters that Frank Herbert left behind (Paulus Atreides and young Guild Navigators). Well scripted, the book is open-ended, leaving us panting for more and includes at the end Msrs. Anderson and Herbert's intentions of two more books and a compendium/timeline to come in the future. While I do not believe that anyone can interpret Frank Herbert's universe as well as he could, Msrs. Anderson and Herbert have done an excellent job of suspending our disbelief and taking us back to the universe of Dune.&quot;It is the year 10,191....&quot;"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Overall, this is a very entertaining book. I couldn't hardly put it down. The majority of events and characters are true to the original series and it is interesting to see how many of the events in the original books were formulated. It was also interesting to see how life at the seat of the Imperium occured. The major fault lies in the authors' total disregard in not using &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; as reference material. For going on 20 years I have used this book as a complete reference for the series but, not one bit of information in it, that wasn't in the original books, is used. Every Dune website I have ever visited uses this book to some extent. It made some of the new book difficult to read because it completely contradicted what I, and thousands of other readers, have taken as canon all of these years. Mr. Herbert himself even gave &quot;The Dune Encyclopedia&quot; his blessing. So, for an overall review, I would definitely tell others to read it because it is a very enjoyable book but, I give fair warning to those who were waiting for a true Dune prequel. I, myself, will have a problem incorporating it into the Dune universe."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I am currently in the process of reading this book. I first read &quot;Dune&quot; in college twenty-five years ago and still consider it one of the ten best books I've ever read. I am very happy with this pre-quel. As soon as I started reading I felt comfortable with everything about it....much as I did about &quot;Dune&quot;. I find the story rich, complex and rewarding."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Since I am very young, Dune have always been my favorite science-fiction serie. Even now, I'm still drinking all the incredibles words of Frank Herbert. Some years ago, I discovered that his son was writing a prequel (!?) to his father masterpiece. I was eager to read it just to leave real world behind and return to my favorite universe.Big, big, big deception. Even if I put aside all the contradictions that Brian and his star wars writer of friend Kevin inserted in the almost perfectly structured universe of Frank Herbert, I'm still unable to love the book. Poor descriptions, thin vision of the complexity of the Dune worlds, superficial caracters and, worst of all, an oversimplified style of writing. Sincerely, I think that the son should let the spirit of his father rest in peace.For the overall Dune fan, I suggest that you read the book and see for yourself. I think that even if the books written by the son and his novelist friend is far from being good as the originals, it is still interesting to go in Dune universe. But, be aware, dont let the linear story fool you, you won't find the same satisfaction that you may have found before. If you do, I won't say your an heretic, but maybe you didn't understand the Dune series like I did or maybe it is time for you to go out in the desert..."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Frank Herbert was able to say so much more with a flick of the wrist, a nod, or an expression. I can't really describe what it was about his writing that was so...his alone, but I can say this, the writing in this flop dosen't even come close.Re-read the origionals, ignore this sham of a Dune book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It goes without saying that the Dune series is a masterwork of science fiction. Its impact, in sci-fi, is equal to that of The Lord of the Rings in fantasy. It has resonated with readers and grown to mythic status.Unfortunately the same won't be said for the prequels. Where Frank Herbert wrote with beauty and style his son plods along amaturishly. The conversations of Dune usually had levels of subtext and required actual thought on the part of the reader to fully grasp the innuendos. The discussions of House Atreides requires as much attention as the typical &quot;Three's Company&quot; episode.The really sad mater is that the book isn't really bad. Compared with the usual sci-fi tripe its measures up as at least standard. But compared to good sci-fi its bad. Compared to mythic Sci-fi its nothing short of embarrassing. I'm sorry I bought it. I know I'll not pick it up again, nor its sequels. In general I'll try to forget it ever existed."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I did not get past the first chapter...and after having read the &quot;1 star&quot; reviews, I am glad that I stopped. The historical inaccuracies that I have read about in the other reviews is definitely worth consideration by true Dune afficionados. When I read about a &quot;no ship&quot; being encapsulated in the first book, I laughed my head off. There was certainly no reason why this technology would just &quot;disappear&quot; for, oh, say over a thousand years later...? I won't go into it any further. Read the other bad reviews; they cover the ground quite nicely.Don't buy it for the sake of another Dune story. The first six books, by the one and only true author of Dune, Frank Herbert, should have been laid to rest. Don't damage his legacy by reading the new prequels."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The characters are childish, the plot is silly. Completely inconsistent with the original series.Words fail me.This book is more like a parody of the series than an extension. Instead of the bold characters and twisting plot, we get worried one-dimensional yuppies which wouldn't have survived three paragraphs in Dune. There is almost no plot whatsoever. The authors keep throwing in the special effects from all books of the original series, without regard to the chronology of Frank Herbert's universe, and without any real purpose. One of the most dissatisfying books I've ever read.Not worth to bear the name of 'Dune'."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Well, I must say that the review from that &quot;French guy&quot; was absolutely wonderful, I too felt that this book needed alot more than a boring storyline and laser fights. It's funny to see how the sci-fi fans who call themselves &quot;true Herbert adherents&quot; dismiss Francois' claim that the book has no real heart. All they can do is complain about how great the book was and it's funny to see different names when probably the same person wrote all the good reviews."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I haven't read Dune in 10-15 years, but this prequel felt/read like the original to me. Dad would be proud."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Frank Herbert, the author of Dune, died at a relatively young age in 1986. At the time of his death, Dune and its sequels were one of the most popular science fiction series ever created.Frank's son Brian followed in his father's footsteps and became a science fiction author. He has been approached a number of times about writing additional Dune novels. Finally in 1997, Brian was introduced to Kevin J. Anderson; an award winning science fiction novelist and they agreed to collaborate on Dune novels that would be prequels to the original book Dune.Set decades before the action in Dune, Dune House Atreides covers action that spans the years that lead to Shaddam IV ascending to the throne of the Galactic empire. A lot of familiar characters from Dune are present in this novel, plus a plethora of new faces. The action is described in short chapters that bounce between several major plot lines and make this book ideal for reading when you only have short amounts of time to devote to it (chapters can be completed in 10 minutes or less).Emperor Elrood's son Shaddam tires of waiting for his father to die and takes steps to hasten the emperor's demise. Young Leto Atreides, future Duke and father of Paul Atreides, leaves his home planet of Caladan to spend a year on the mechanized and secretive world of Ix. Pardot Kynes, a renowned planetologist is dispatched by the Emperor to the desert planet of Arrakis (Dune) to discover the secrets of it's ecology and the addictive, life-prolonging spice known as melange. Meanwhile, eight-year-old slave Duncan Idaho is hunted by the cruel Harkonnen family in a deadly game from which he vows to escape and seek his revenge.While not equal to the original book Dune, the book is still inventive and enjoyable. Frank's books often left the reader guessing about certain pieces of history (such as the source of the feud between the Harkonnen and Atreides families). This book (and the two other House Trilogy books) shed light and flesh out events that lead to the momentous events in Dune. This book is much easier to read than Dune but it stays true to the spirit of Frank's novels. The characters behave here in the same general way in which they behaved in Dune (i.e. - Baron Harkonnen is still evil and depraved), but the authors have included a few interesting differences in some of the characters. I think everyone who enjoyed Dune would find something enjoyable in this novel."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Disappointing. The story line is fine, but the character development, both in description and dialog is very different from the series. Not only is it different, it's quite poor. It's almost a certainty that the editor of this book NEVER read any of the others.It isn't easy to fill the original author's shoes, but somebody dropped the ball on this one."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"glad i didn't pay for this book. couldn't finish it, for fear of spoiling the world of dune in my head. the style of writing was jerky. you know the way you start reading a book and you are transported into the world, and you are not actually 'reading' words anymore. well this book was just all jumbled words contained on pages. i would not, unlike some reviews, even think of comparing this to any works such as rice or rowling (how offensive!). at the very least, no one can argue that they use their 'own' stories. i do agree with one review that i am very happy that tolkien jr. didn't butcher his father's stories (& dont get me started on the films either)."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I thought the storyline was fairly consistent with what Frank Herbert started so long ago. Philosophically, it didn't get nearly as deep as the originals which was a disappointment. KJA and BH have a more 'factual' and step-to-step writing style which doesn't quite live up to FH's ability to weave philosophy, religion, and sociology into every paragraph. I believe FH's original Dune and the last two in the series were masterpieces, with the other three being able to stand on their own only due to the intricate world created in Dune. This book reads too much like others written by BH or KJA and doesn't completely build the aura FH did. It is, however, a great revisit to the Dune realm.There were more typos in this book than in the past 20 I've red! (intentional)"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune has long been my favorite SF book of all time, and while the rest of the series was enjoyable, none of those books could touch what Herbert had done with the original. With that in mind, I never expected House Atreides to come close to the original, and it doesnt.It is however, an enjoyable read. Others here have correctly pointed out that the complexity in the original series is not duplicated in this work. However, I didnt read the book for that, I wanted to see what Herbert had left in his notes as the events that led up to those in Dune. And here is where this book excells. The book delivers all your favorite characters and factions from the Dune series, and even expands on some of them. And this is the reason to read this book.If you want a deep, complex novel, with multiple layers, a near duplicate of the original, then this isnt the book for you. If you want to return to the universe of Dune, and find out some of the history behind your favorite characters, to read a very enjoyable fast reading work, then this is indeed a book to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When this hardcover came out, I hesitated to read it; after all, it's something that I was into 20 years ago, I now had other priorities, etc. Boy was I wrong. When I finally bought the paperback edition, I read it in 4 days. I found it to be a worthy prequel, as well as a good novel on its own.As for those who have found fault with it in relation to the other books in the series, it might benefit them to reread those books. e.g.1) it was Gurney Halleck's sister, not Duncan Idaho's, who was a victim of the Harkonnens2) the ghola tanks of the Bene Tleilax were in existence prior to the birth of Leto II. How else could the ghola of Duncan Idaho be produced in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;?3) it would appear from the discussions in &quot;Dune&quot; that the wealth of House Atreides was indeed based on rice and such.4) Per &quot;Dune&quot;, Pardot Kynes was the original Imperial Planetologist on Arrakis. If indeed he was sent by the Emperor, and his son was a Freman leader, how else would he have joined Freman society than by an unwitting fulfillment of Freman prophecy?"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I loved getting more background on the characters and relationships that occurred before Dune. You get the full details of how Duncan Idaho comes to the Atreides family. Information on how the Baron Harkonnen went from a well muscled handsome man to the disgusting, bloated thing he is in Dune. Details of Pardot Kynes past and how he met the Freman. If you are like me and like to know the missing pieces in a story you will love this book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book isn't bad, in and of itself. Taking place in the world of the Dune series, but decades before the first Dune novel, it is a pleasant read. For Dune junkies, it is rather nice to see the familiar characters - the dread Baron, Duke Leto, and so forth. It makes for an easy, quick read.But therein lies the problem. Almost by definition, a Dune novel is never a &quot;quick read.&quot; Frank Herbert's books generally took some re-reading in order to understand what he was getting at (unless one is either a superficial reader or very good at grasping complexity quickly). Whether in the digressions that, while not dealing directly with the story at hand, enhanced the feel of this alien universe, or in putting the &quot;wheels within wheels within wheels&quot; of the plots together, Frank Herbert wrote works that were meant to challenge the reader and force some thinking. This novel, however, just doesn't come close.Having written that, I'll probably end up buying the two following works as well. Again, the story itself isn't bad - it's a fine, run-of-the-mill, not terribly challenging read. Nothing wrong with that. But compared to the dense and wonderful world chronicled by Frank Herbert, it is but a mere shadow."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The book is called House Atreides, but it has characters other then the Atreides. The book revolves around several different characters views. Young Leto Atreides leaves Caladan to go to Ix for a year of education. Eight year old Duncan Idaho is a Harkonnen slave, used to give new trainees practice in hunting human prey. Shaddam, the Heir to the Empire, urged by his childhood friend, plots to assassinate his father and create a synthetic spice. The Bene Gesserit work to create the child who is to be the grandmother of the Kwisatz Haderach. The Planetolgist Pardot Kyens travels to Arrakis. This book has some interesting facts and is not badly written, but nowhere near as good as Frank Herbert's masterpiece 'Dune'"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It's been a while since I last read the original series, so I was reading the prequel almost as a novel by itself. I admit I did not catch most of the glaring mistakes that other people identified.On its own merits, it's a decent read. Neither of the writers obviously have the talent of Frank Herbert, but I was actually pretty engrossed for about 80% of the book. After that, it sort of disintegrated.

Early on, several lapses were spotted, mistakes in the timeline, gaps in the plot-points set down by the great Frank Herbert, and several continuity errors. Our Mentats at Chapterhouse have in this report laid out point by point the errors:In \\"Atreides\\" the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is presented as a fit and trim man who takes pride in his good shape and his muscular tone. The reason for his immense fattness is not through him becoming lazy.In the great \\"Dune\\" we find evidance of the opposite. In file# 322 the Lady Fenring states while noting the lean tone of Feyd-Rautha \\"Here's one who won't let himself go to fat.\\" In file# 14 he likens a feature on a globe to \\"sweet caramels\\", and on file# 21 he asks for food to be sent for.In \\"Children of Dune\\" during Alia's fit of possession by the Baron where his voice is spoken through her mouth his voice id described as belonging to \\"a querulous man, an autocratic and sensual man far gone in self-indulgence\\".We believe that this clearly shows that the Baron was never interested in being fit or cared about being in shape but rather indulged in all known forms of cuisine.In \\"Atreides\\" Hasimir Fenring habit of going \\"Um-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m\\" is said to be something he has always done much to the dismay of Shaddam IV.Again this goes against what is stated in \\"Dune\\" file# 322 where we are told that the humming is called a secret language between himself and his Lady.In \\"Atreides\\" we see the Harkonnen no-globe used by the Bashar Miles Teg in \\"Heretics of Dune\\".Our Mentats have discovered a glaring error in this: the age of the no-globe itself. In \\"Heretics\\" file# 223 Teg and the Reverend Mother Lucilla wonder about the age of the no-globe and theorize that \\"the Tyrant must have known about this place\\" and must have let the Harkonnens bulid it to drain their wealth.Teg believes that the Tyrant himself had once been there and mabey had the occupants killed.Now, Teg finds the ship about 1500 years after the Tyrant, believes that it was built sometime during the Tyrant's 3500+ lifetime AFTER the events in \\"Atreides\\".At the end of \\"Atreides\\" we find a High Priest of Dur,(an ancient religion), who \\"had by tradition crowned every Emperor since the fall of the thinking machines\\".In \\"Heretics\\" Teg has no idea what Jafa Muzzafar is talking about when he calls himself the regional commander for the forces of Dur. (file# 389)Jafa says in file# 392 that his rank of Field Marshal is a revival of the ancient titles in the Dur, tries to explain a frame bush and then understands that there are no such things in Teg's universe and says that they have much to teach each other.This, we believe, implies that the Dur is a thing that was discovered in the Scattering and not something that was taken out into the Scattering.We have asked our Mentats for their prime projection as to why such errors happened, their finding is as follows:This book was written to capitalize on the name of \\"Dune\\" and rake in money from the legion of \\"Dune\\" fans who would be eager to read more of the \\"Dune\\" universe created by the great Frank Herbert. The writters must have believed that these lapses would not have been noticed, but failed to take into account that Mr. Herbert's books have been re-read by fans several times over and ANY lapses would stand out like \\"a man striding across the open bled.\\""},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"While I didn't expect this book to be on a par with Frank Herbert, I wasn't prepared for how spectacularly ordinary it is. The most missed element is Herbert's didactic, multi-layered prose style. Herbert had a way of saying more by implication than by actual description. &quot;House Atreides&quot; is just plain bland by comparison. Some of the descriptive metaphors wouldn't be worthy of a freshman creative writing student (the bull falling over like a spaceship, for instance). Most of the characters and situations are described or implied in other Dune works. In most cases, they are not better served by being fleshed out. Ix, for example, is a much more provactive and interesting place because it was never explicitly described in the other Dune books; the reader is left to imagine and fill in the possibilities. &quot;Dune&quot; is a book that most people grow into. &quot;House Atreides&quot; is, regretfully, one that you'll have to dumb down for."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book was a quick, enjoyable read -- certainly for the Dunephile who has been dying to dig into the Atreides historical archives. The plot is carefully contrived to nicely fit into the future plot lines, but is missing the depth and larger-than-life myth-creation of Frank Herbert's original Dune. I enjoyed the book quite a bit, but sorely missed much of what we all remember from our first reading of Dune: for example, how many of us didn't begin looking for facial nuances and hidden motives among our friends during everyday conversations before we had gotten through the third chapter?Dune: House Atreides is lacking that permeating layer of Mentat-Bene Gesserit super-insight subtext that so contributed to the popularity of the initial novels. Unfortunately, even the super-human Fremen's mystique is taken for granted and pales in this telling. We were completely and irrevocably pulled into the universe of Paul, Jessica, Duncan, etc. forever within the first ten pages in Dune; in House Atreides we only skim the scholarly surface.Those missing key elements, combined with too many one-dimensional characterizations of both people and events, contribute to a book that is enjoyable for those of us wishing to revisit old friends and adversaries, but fails to stand on its own. This effort is a must-read for Dune fans, but I look forward to the next installment not as a Reader, but as the literary archaeologist who wishes to turn over some more story stones."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I won't say the Dune &quot;Prequel&quot; Trilogy is entirely without merit. Any of the three books is an entertaining read for a cross-country train trip or a trans-Atlantic flight, like a Tom Clancy novel would be. But most people who know and love the &quot;Dune&quot; chronicles cannot help but be disappointed, even angry, at these pale imitations of the originals. The most striking lesson to be gleaned from these new Dune books is the difference between a truly gifted writer and a hack; between a serious work of imagination and literary skill, and airport lounge pulp fiction.I won't detail all of the failings of the narrative - the inconsistencies with the original series, the sometimes absurd plot development, the gaping holes and internal inconsistencies in the story. Other reviewers have dealt with these at some length.My biggest beef with these three books - all of them - is how poorly written they are (especially &quot;House Corinno&quot;). One would have hoped that more of Frank Herbert's literary ability would have found its way into his son's genes than apparently did. (Call the Bene Gesserit, quick! We need a new breeding program here!) The dialogue is often stilted, the character development shallow, and the structure fragmented, episodic and jerky. In contrast to Frank Herbert's elegant, even serene construction, Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have unfortunately adopted the hyperactive &quot;jump-around&quot; style so beloved of today's writers of second-rate entertainment fiction.Most disappointing to me was the shallowness of these new books. Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; books were books of IDEAS more than books about events and action. A great deal of their narrative was occupied with people's THOUGHTS, at least as much as with their actions. Brian Herbert's &amp; Kevin Anderson's books, by contrast, are almost entirely devoid of thought, ideas or philosophy and are entirely preoccupied with who is doing what. At best, this makes their books entertaining, something with which to while away the hours. But they are simply not in the same league with the original Dune books. For the newcomer to the world of Dune, moving from &quot;House Corinno&quot; to &quot;Dune&quot; will be like moving from Harold Robbins to Steinbeck or Hemmingway.Reading my way through these three books, I frequently found myself wishing that one of the Tleilaxu had been around when Frank Herbert died, to grow a Ghola Herbert in their axolotl tanks. These prequels might have really been something in the hands of a gifted writer."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book is okay, perhaps even &quot;good&quot; if you are used to reading other novels which are merely serial additions in a mega franchise such as the case with the &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels. If you're a Dune fan, however, you're probably used to books with more substance. Dune: House Atreides is lacking true substance. To use a &quot;Dune&quot; word to describe D:HA, I would have to use &quot;ghafla.&quot; The entire novel is composed of the gadfly distractions built into the original novels. There is no penetrating philosophical or ecological insight. The characters lack depth. The situations are vapid.The book is also riddled with direct contradictions with the original Dune Chronicles, and more subtle hints that Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson just didn't &quot;get&quot; several aspects of the original novel.Some of the inconsistencies: The most blatent one is the fact that the Bene Tleilaxu are known in D:HA as extreme religious fanatics. This is a *CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET* in the Dune novels, and it isn't even revealed until the 5th book in the original series (which takes place roughly 6,000 years after D:HA.) Even when this fact is revealed, it is known only to a few within the secretive Bene Gesserit. When I read the pasages in D:HA that made it clear that it Tleilaxu religious fanaticism was a commonly known fact, I couldn't believe it... this is the sort of mistake that even somebody moderately familiar with the series as a whole would make, and yet Brian, Frank Herbert's son, and Kevin, for whom &quot;Dune&quot; is apparently his favorite book of all time make this mistake. It is inexplicable.Also, the Baron's gross physique that we see Dune is attributed to an illness inflicted upon him by the Reverend Mother Mohiam, but repeatedly it is strongly implied in the series that the Baron's form is a result of his propensity towards &quot;sampling pleasures&quot; and his sensual nature. It may seem a minor thing, but it actually is a key factor in considering the Baron as character. The dynamic duo have completely missed on this one. Also, another character, Piter de Vries, the twisted mentat undergoes a complete makeover for D:HA. Gone is the effiminate, spice-eating blue-within-blue eyed Piter of original Dune. Instead, we get the &quot;David Lynch movie Piter,&quot; who guzzles sapho and is about as effiminate as the the Baron himself. Who else did they get blatently wrong? How about Leto's father, who is described in Dune as a very cold, rather cruel man... a man Jessica repeatedly curses in her thoughts in Dune, attributing all of Leto's coldness of character to the man... and yet the man we see in Dune is not cold at all. Quite the contrary, he is remarkedly warm and jovial, much moreso than the Duke Leto. And he dies before Jessica has a chance to meet him.This book is an insult to the original novels.Why 2 stars, instead of 1? Well, from what I've heard so far of House Harkonnen, and the excerpts I've read, it's even worse (the Bene Gesserit have superpowers such as telekenisis and invisibility, common Harkonnen cannon fodder know of the most secret of Fremen secrets: the Water of Life, and the pre-chapter quotes are even more horrible than those in HA.) So I want to play it safe and reserve the 1 star rating for House Harkonnen should it truly deserve a rating worse the D:HA.My recommendation: If you have never read a Dune novel, buy the original Dune of Frank Herbert, and if you like what you read, buy the other novels written by him. If you are a Dune fan and you absolutely must read every Dune novel that is published, no matter how horrible, check this one out of the library."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune: House Atreides is one of the most disappointing works I have had the misfortune to read.Within the first quarter of the book, it was obvious that the book would be inferior. By halfway, anyone could see that all the characters 'thought' alike. They were cartoonish villains or naive youths. By 3/4 done, the book had so offended me that I called the person who recommended it, and every other Dune fan I knew, and ranted about it's inadequacies. I finished this book solely so that I could write a review that expressed a fraction of my disgust.Previously-known intelligent characters blurt out their plans for no apparent reason. As many main characters from the original Dune as possibly COULD meet DO so. The Emperor is characterized as a bumbling twit, Fenring is a murderous punk, the Bene Gesserit are believers in (rather than manipulators of) religion, and that is only the tip of the pestilential iceberg that is House Atreides.The author has displayed for us that 1)He does not understand his father's works, 2) He lacks the intelligence to design believable plots, and 3) He lacks the humanity to create believable characters.I would not recommend buying this book, even were it sold for 25 cents in a used bookstore, and came with a pack of gum."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The Frank Herbert Dune novels were so well crafted that the characters seemed to be a natural consequence of the future history in which they live (to which we cannot relate without the help of Herbert's carftsmanship), and a product of their own human ambitions and shortcomings (to which we can relate directly). In contrast, most of the characters of this book are unrelatable on both accounts. I read the book a mere chapter at a time for the first third, finding it uninspiring. Despite this, the story did grow on me, and I finished the book rapidly. Some of the characters did begin to take on extra dimension, and the story had some clever twists. It seems the authors' craftsmanship improved dramatically over the course of the project (assuming that it was written in chapter-order). They have infinitely huge shoes to fill, and have have done so more adequately than I would have thought possible. On the whole, I did indeed enjoy it, despite a slow start. I look forward to the other books, and my enthusiasm for the original series has been sparked anew."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It was at the young and impressionable age of 18 that I first encountered the genius that was Frank Herbert. And while I must admit that it was the miserable excuse of the movie version of &quot;Dune&quot; (why twisted, macabre and sensationalistic David Lynch was chosen for the virtually insurmountable privilege of converting this unquestionable masterpiece to visual media when the likes of Kubrick, Scott and even James Cameron could have been had remains to me one of the greatest mysteries in the history of cinema, especially given the fact that Frank Herbert himself was a consultant during filming - heart plugs! a sound gun for Pete's sake! Head-shaking, mind-boggling!) which opened my mind to the series, I can not bemoan it as the catalyst. The day after watching the film for the first time I went out and purchased what was then the entire series (Dune - God Emperor) which I proceeded to devour over the next several days and sleepless nights. It's effect was inspiring, life-changing, mind-expanding and indelible. It forever changed my view of our species, both our history and our future.I have since re-read the original four books at least four times (I've given the first one six reads, not counting the multitude of times having casually picked it up and flipped to a chapter for a quick stroll) and the entire series at least three times. Each time the effect on me is inescapable: I'm buzzed... my head spins. It defies explanation.Attempts at describing the works themselves to the unfamiliar are equally elusive, especially given, forgive the gross generalization, most people's attitude towards the genre. \\"But it's not really sci-fi\\", I would say... \\"it's social and politcal commentary, philosophy and \\"humanism\\", body/mind focus and control to the height of Eastern philosophy and teachings and beyond; it's millennia-long vision of the survival of our species by manipulating the masses through religion and the necessity of an all-powerful, self-sacrificing, Machiavellian visionary with the strength of character and un-wavering confidence to make the decisions that will ensure our future\\".Unfortunately, I found \\"Dune: House Atreides\\" to be seriously lacking in most if not all of the driving force of Frank Herbert's writing. Whereas his story telling appeared to me to be his true beliefs and personal philosophy, this prequel is simply a history lesson told as an adventure story. Apart from lack of underlying philosophical theme, the key missing element has to be the trademark Herbert intensity during inter-character encounters. He had a way of subtly conveying the gravity and seriousness of a moment in the way his characters could read even the slightest nuances of an adversary's behaviour. Several key scenes leap to mind: the Atreides formal dinner upon their arrival at Carthag (thankfully omitted from the movie); the initial meeting of the conspirators involving Scytale in Dune Messiah; any encounter with the God Emperor; the list is almost inexhaustible.With all due respect to the collaborators and their respective individual achievements, Frank Herbert was a brilliant visionary and literary master whose works and style may never be duplicated. To do so would be a massive undertaking, near impossible, accomplished only by a true adept. In he end, \\"DUNE: House Atreides\\" is a history lesson, it's Herbert's characters without the Herbert edge. As a fan of the story, I was glad for the chance to revisit old friends and learn more about the events leading to Muad'Dib, Leto II and, eventually, \\"Rakis\\" and the Honored Matres. And as such I look forward to the next two, strictly out of historical fascination. But I beseech Brian Herbert to end it there and not attempt a sequel to Chapterhouse, unless he can find a writer who embodies the essence of his father's style and vision."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Let me preface my review by stating that it is a HARD thing to try to compete or even complement a work as complex as the Dune series..hell, some have argued that Frank Herbert had a hard time following up on Dune. Be that as it may I must say that this book is very disappointing.It is missing the subtle use of tone and design that Dune contained. Yes, Dune was in its broadest outline a medieval tale of a young man coming of age and wreaking vengeance on those who destroyed his family, but Dune was complex in the design of the politics, history, potrayal and incorporation of human theories of economics and religious manipulation. It is a masterwork on many levels.What House Atreides misses is immersing the reader in universe that is very complex with &quot;wheel within wheels&quot;. The dialogue was simplistic and the plotting was heavy handed at times. I think that worse thing was that I did not recognize the characters from Dune in their young stage. Hasimir Fenring is portrayed has a murderous psychopath and at the end of book is in love with the Bene Gesserit Margot - quite a disjoint in portrayal.The clearest example of the writers not absorbing the universe of Dune was the fact that a Bene Gessrit would believe in Feng Shui! Imagine my surprise that a feng shui master was called into designing a birthing center.Overall, if you are a hardcore Dune fan then read this as a form of discipline and completion. But be prepared that it is a pale imitation and an odd echo of the Dune saga.For those new to Dune -- skip this book and go to straight to Dune by Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've been reading and rereading Frank Herbert's Dune books for twenty years, and I have to say that I find this book a shameful attempt to captialize on a great SF author's fame. The plot is contrived and simplistic, and the characters are cardboard cutouts. To paraphrase Thufir Hawat when he dealt with the Baron: Frank Herbert could tell us a thing with the literary equivalent of the lift of an eyebrow or the wave of a hand...could express an entire sentence in the the way he accented a single word. This writing, by comparison, is cloddish!I'm sorry if this hurts the authors, because writing any book is a huge task and I'm sure that enormous effort went into writing this one. But the authors should expend their energies making their own creations, and stand or fall on their own imaginations, not Frank Herbert's. Bantam Books, too, should reconsider their all-too-transparent motivations.I'm thankful that Christopher Tolkien has not fallen into this trap, and that the Lord of the Rings remains pretty much how J.R.R. left it (don't get me started on the films...)."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This novel reads like the background notes for someone else's book, a jumble of biographical tidbits from Frank Herbert's Dune Series. Many characters are introduced- Duncan Idaho, Pardot Kynes, Stilgar, and others- who do little to move the novel forward. The plot, by the way, is virtually nonexistent. Since we are provided with a run down of each characters motivation, and let in on every plot before the trap is sprung, there is little in the way of suspense.I could not read this book without making comparisons to Frank Herbert's work. An example of how far this book falls short of previous Dune books can be found in a scene in which Baron Harkonnen is faced with the prospect of impregnating a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, Mohiam. &quot;Using her Bene Gesserit analytical techniques,&quot; we are told, &quot;she learned many things about the Baron and his personality from the way he maintained his odorous private warren....&quot; If Frank Herbert had written this chapter, he would have gone on to tell us exactly what things Mohiam could conclude from her observations, and what dark secrets the Baron's room revealed. These authors, however, offer no such insights into the Bene Gesserit abilities or the Baron's character, choosing instead to press on to details about the sexual act itself.I suspect the blame this book's shortcoming should be laid on the editor's shoulders. Herbert and Anderson appear to be capable writers, but need more guidance to craft a novel that is more than a supplement to the original Dune Series. Plot, theme, characterization are words I learned in grade school English class, and the need for these elements still holds true for today's novel.Since I have already purchased Dune: House Harkonnen, I'll press ahead with the series, and I'm hoping that Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have perhaps written a book that is actually about something rather than another Dune curio cabinet."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"written by Frank Herbert, so how true to the series could it stay? But I was surprised. I loved the book. Frank Herbert's son, Brian, along with Kevin J Anderson did a great job of staying true to the series, and crafting a wonderful prequel. Seeing Duncan Idaho as a child, watching Leto lose his innocence and become a Duke, and learning why Baron Harkonnen became so physically impaired made for a wonderful read. I've got House Harkonnen sitting on my desk, ready to dive back in to Dune. Afterward, I plan to reread the whole series!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I found the pre-history of Dune fascinating and I would recommend it to any Dune fan, but.............. I expected more. I specially enjoyed the source of Baron Harkonen ugliness and Duncan Idaho's saga but found the story on our beloved Duke weak. Too many, on the spur of the moment, decisions and a very weak resolution for the trial. Also the way the new Emperor dismisses his &quot;right-hand&quot; is not credible. Overall, the notes were probably Frank's but the subtlety of the plot was not there. We will miss the father!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Approaching this book with trepidation, I felt that it surely could not match the original.

To the critics who slate it, all I can say is this: It was never going to be the original, but is a classic in it's own right. There were some continuity errors, but I read to be entertained on occasion, and this entertained me. I look forward to the next offering."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"A few weeks ago, I resolved to read all sixteen Dune books (excluding Dune short stories and the short novel \\"Spice Planet,\\" which have not been published in their own books). In chronological order (according to time in the Dune universe), here are the sixteen books:Butlerian JihadThe Machine CrusadeThe Battle of CorrinHouse AtreidesHouse HarkonnenHouse CorrinoDunePaul of DuneDune MessiahThe Winds of DuneChildren of DuneGod Emperor of DuneHeretics of DuneChapterhouse DuneHunters of DuneSandworms of DuneI have just completed the fourth book, \\"House Atreides,\\" and I have not been dissuaded in continuing my task.The space-opera political intrigue is so good in \\"House Atreides\\" that I have decided to give it five stars. It has the same weakness--moments of implausibility--that I noted in my reviews of the first three books, but I do not want that weakness to discourage anyone from experiencing this book's goodness. I am pleased to have vicariously shared existence with some of the characters. I cheered with them, and one time I cried with them. As for the villains, as good villains are wont to do, they just made me want to wring their necks.In addition to the intrigue, here are other examples of the book's goodness:- the perilous travels of the boy Duncan Idaho- the nastiness of Hasimir Fenring, assassin-advisor for Crown Prince Shaddam- the adventures of planetologist Pardot Kynes on the desert world Arrakis (Dune)- the unique and spectacular style of leadership demonstrated by Duke Paulus Atreides- the schemes and brutality of Baron Harkonnen and his thuggish nephew Rabban- the quaint, but intense, machinations of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood- the coming-of-age adventures of teenagers Leto Atreides and his noble friends Rhombur and sister Kailea- the warfare, politics, and pageantry of galactic empire.You may recognize some of the above names. This is because \\"House Atreides,\\" a superb sequel, takes place just a couple of decades before Frank Herbert's hall-of-famer \\"Dune.\\" The writing style is polished and easy to read. There are no detestable moments of gratuitous levity. At least in the hardcover edition you get a family tree of Emperor Elrood IX and five good maps. You also get an afterword with short accounts by Brian Herbert and Kevin K. Anderson describing how these authors became acquainted and how their collaborations for the Dune books got started.One more thing: This book has insufficient closure. So be wary of that unless you intend to read the entire trilogy (\\"House Atreides,\\" \\"House Harkonnen,\\" \\"House Corrino\\")."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book uses the Dune trademark. Yet, it is not Dune--at least, this is what I suspect is the case from other readers' reviews. This was the first Dune book I've ever read; therefore, I am somewhat unbiased. I do not have the same expectations as others. I have heard great things about the \\"real\\" Dune books, however, so I am definitely looking forward to them especially, because these prequel books aren't half bad for what they are. In fact, I couldn't put this book down until I was finished with it.These authors slam their foot on the accelerator and never let up. The car they are driving might not be as sophisticated as a BMW, much less a Lamborghini, but this book is fun in the same way jumping golf carts over sandtraps is fun. If you like action, prepare for a treat. I found myself saying over and over again in my head, \\"wow, this book is so over-the-top; it reads more like a comic book or a Saturday morning cartoon series than an adult novel; and most importantly--I love it!\\"Granted, there are a few things that could have been explained much better to make the story more believable, but then again, I don't need an author to hold my hand the entire time. I just invented my own explanations where others were lacking. This book is simple, brutal, in-your-face fantasy. If your stuck-up \\"intellectual\\" mind thinks this is going to be \\"too stupid\\" for your tastes, read the Wealth of Nations, the Republic, Moby Dick, or virtually any truly philosophical book that I am sure could even put the \\"real\\" Dune books in their place, and spare yourself the disappointment."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have enjoyed this & every other chapter in the Herbert/Anderson series. A lot of people criticize these book because the writers aren't up to the standards of the original series. Truth is, starting with the God Emperor, Frank's writing wasn't up to the standards of the original series either. Not to say I didn't like God Emperor through Chapterhouse - I did very much - they didn't seem as multi layered. The same for this series. The writing is more straightforward & to the point. This means you get the whole story in one read. In the original series repeated readings bring greater revelations even this many years after 1st reading them. I don't see myself re-reading the Dune books post God Emperor. I look forward to reading further stories in the series (just started Paul & have a pre-order for the new one that comes out in August)I just won't be reading them a second time."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"There\`s little I can say about House Atreides that hasn\`t already been said by over a hundred other people who have given the book 5-star reviews, but my deep enjoyment of the entire \`House\` trilogy compels me to add my own voice to the collective, particularly given the inexplicably mean reviews posted by some.I\`m a dedicated fan of the original Dune books, and, when I first heard about the new works to be written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, I honestly cringed. I did not have high hopes.How wrong I was! The characters herein are handled superbly, ultimately making me love those that also appear in Frank Herbert\`s books even more than I did before. The standard of writing is very high, too. Once you\`ve started reading, it just becomes complusive. They have that \\"Just one more chapter before I go to sleep!\\" quality. Before you know it, it\`s 3am and you just know you\`re going to be tired as hell when you get to work.There\`s so much packed into these three books, including some moments that will stay with you long after you finish reading.I can\`t recommend them highly enough. The original Dune still stands head and shoulders above anything else except Lord of the Rings (as noted by Arthur C. Clarke), but the \`House\` trilogy deserves the attention of every Dune fan. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As I'm sure that a lot of Dune fans have for the continued stories of this wonderful sci-fi world. Brian and Kevin work well together and I think it pushes the writing well to a point that is very entertaining."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This prequal to the classic sci-fi epic does a passable job filling in the story of where the history of where all of the great houses came from and the history of the peripheral characters in &quot;Dune&quot;.First the good. This novel does a very good job in filling in the rest of the universe outside of arrakis. It takes the story to the capital to calidan and to geti prime. It makes up new world of Ix and some new neat villians. The sheer imagination of the world carries this story a consiterable distance. The story also starts well setting up a good cast of characters in some interesting siutations.Now the bad. This novel loses it focus and sense of intellegence halfway in. The plotting that makes up most of the last half of the book just didn't feel that clever. I didn't read this book and feel immersed in complex political games, a character that was almost omnipitant in one sceane is rather weak in the next. The story line that is very good the first half of the book doesn't carry over to the second half.And of course the ugly. What really keeps this book from being a four or five star book, is its inconsistant writing. I could tell that this book was written by two authors, and that is not a compliment. Some parts are written well, but then the writing deteriorates. The problem isn't with the prose, but just the style of writing. The characters and the narrorators feel a need to say everything they are feeling. A good author protrays feelings through the characters actions and more subtle characteristics. This got really bad about two-thirds of the way through the book. Sorry but this is amatuer type work that takes an otherwise very good book and makes it simply mediocre."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The book Dune: House Atreides offers an abundance amount of philosophy and political intrigue. The style in which it is written can be compared relatively close to the style of Frank Herbert. The book has many faces in which it could be viewed from many which are obvious and many which are subtly hidden. On many occasions the readers of this book as well as the other books in the Dune masterpieces will find themselves needing to read between the lines to find the hidden facets of the text. This book as its predecessors has such treasures within it. This book has in opinion, has many strengths and few weaknesses. There are a few outstanding unique things about this book that gives its strength. A thing that might be hard to see at first, but at the beginning of every chapter there resides a quote from a faction or person of the universe of Dune and this quote provides a second meaning to the chapter it is on: second meaning as in a lesson or further information about the chapter. Another unique outstanding feature would be the story itself. Another strength of the book aside from the quotes would be the way it slowly introduces everything to you: much like the way Dune does. The beginning seems fairly simple giving you the basic introduction and from there on slowly introduces you to a more complex Dune. There are a few weaknesses in this book. The book starts off slower than it should seem to be, which sometimes tends to take the hook off some readers. Another could be the fact that it still doesn't provide enough history to the universe of Dune. The author seems to put things in a way that you must read the book Dune to get enough information to comprehend some of the details of the book which on the end matter to the storyline the most. As for readers of the original Dune the characters seem weaker in this book than the original. Overall, this book is excellently written out and deserves appraisals and raves given to the book. This book is seemingly aimed for those who have interest in politics and political philosophy or for people who are willing to immerse themselves in a simpler alien environment. As readers take more of the book into them they will realize that the book is focused on the two topics. Those people who want to have a book with more than a few faces should try and read this book, it may have the requirements to please the complex mind."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It was inevitable that the Dune saga would fall to prequelitis, the insatiable demand for new authors to fill in the gaps suggested by plots of well established franchises. We get to see our favorite characters before they became our favorite characters. (Almost every time, we learn why the author offered us what he had) In \\"Dune: House Atreides\\" we meet the heroic and ultimately martyred Leto Atreides, the vile Vlad Harkonnen, and Shaddam - the future emperor of the known universe. In addition to other charachters also already established in Dune lore, we meet the royal family of Ix, exiled when their world is overrun by the insidious Bene Tleilax, and Leto's father, Duke Paulus. Though its title suggests the heroic (though ultimately despotic) Atreides are the focus, \\"House Atreides' tells as much about them as the Harkonnen. Actually, Shaddam IV, 38 years old and yet still just a prince, gets the lion's share of attention. With his father Elrood giving no hint of giving up the throne - kept alive through addiction to the spice melange - Shaddam conspires with his lifelong friend, the deadly Hasimir Fenring to end the emperor's reign. It's the authors' inability to focus on a single charachter - \\"Atreides\\" is intended as one of those \\"sweeping\\" novels - that waters the book down (no pun intended). None of the intense plotting, de rigeur for a Dune novel, becomes very intense here. There's no depth. Fenring, a master of the art of murder, is actually deadliest when he's just giving advice. Here however, he's just annoying, and his plotting hardly rises to macchiavellian - coaxing Shaddim into regicide, or into a scheme to develop a synthetic substiture for melange, or take a bene gesserit for a wife become perfunctory exercises unworthy for the future count and master of assassins. Neither Anderson nor Herbert develop Fenring in a way that would suggest his complete reversal in the climax of \\"Dune\\". The Bene gesserit themselves do little that should arouse suspicion, even though their plan to breed the messianic Kwisatz Haderach should be enough to raise a quarrel with the Spacing Guild, if not the emperor and the Landsraad and just about everybody else. Such a conflict between the BG and the guild - representing the two most established and immovable factions populating the Dune universe - should have been the focus of \\"Atreides\\". Instead, and unwisely, it's the illegal invasion of Ix that unite the charachters in this book - hardly a cause worthy of the heroic Leto. (the ruling house of Ix, a world dedicated to technological development, is exiled when their subjects who do the most work are moved to revolt; you need not be marxist to be unsympathetic given the ease by which the revolt succeeds.) The authors couldn't even be bothered to flesh out the age old conflict between Atreides and Harkonnen, a hole big enough to float a guild highliner through. Another hole is Leto's murdered father - described offhand as a cruel blowhard in the original \\"Dune\\", he's now a happy-go-lucky type that nobody could hate. But worst of all is Shaddam's collusion with the vile Tleilaxu - in which he backs their invasion of Ix in return for their development of a synthetic substitute for melange. The plot is ludicrous as success would give the Tleilaxu a chunk of the monopoly on spice production without their owing anything to the emperor (who at least exerts his control through his de facto directorship of the CHOAM conglomerate). I mean, if the Tleilaxu renged, how would Shaddam enforce his end? The unblanced deal would make sense had Shaddam nursed a vendetta against the Ixians - but the grudge against them was not Shaddam's, but Elrood's.Because \\"Atreides\\" is the first of a series, the authors haven't bothered themselves to make it whole and singular. Some parts of the book don't come together at all - like the expeditons of planetologist Liet Kynes or the story of C'tair, a loyal Ixian working against the Tleilax invaders. But worst of all, the novel lacks a solid voice, a single perspective in its scenes to feel the pain, joy, fear and triumph that all the plotting must create. \\"Atreides\\" simply fails because, unlike the spice melange that underlies much of the plotting, it is neither addictive nor conciouness expanding."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I found this to be a great book. I read the paperback, yeah, the paperback this site says that hasn't been published yet. Much more than what I expected to get off a Kmart Book Shelf. :-) I had never read any of the Dune book, but I definively will. I couldn't put the book down. The longest book I had read in quite a while and i finished in a few days. I gives you so many characters and they all have enough personality to get stucked in your brain. I remember almost if not all of the characters in this book. I am stuck on the series, once House Harkonnen arrives, I'm getting it. If you don't plan on reading the next one, don't read this one because you will be left wondering. It leaves a nice base for the next book in the trilogy. Totally great"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"If you are not a Dune fanatic you will absolutely enjoy this well written book. Having read all of the Dune saga years ago I completely enjoyed this many layered and interesting yarn. I know that those who are totally wrapped up in the Frank Herbert &quot;Dune&quot; mystique may find this wanting but I enjoyed it much more than any of the original books. I'm anxiously anticipating the next segment of this exciting new trilogy."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"A fitting prequel to what is possibly the greatest science fiction work ever written. Expertly and masterfully told by the son of the &quot;Kwisatz Haderach&quot; of science fiction authors and his co-author, Kevin J. Anderson. A very difficult book to put down. Hopefully Dune 7 will be forthcoming from the same duo."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Look, I know there will be a bunch of people out there complaining about how much this book lacks everything the origional had. I know I'll probably be discredited as a raving lunatic. But, through all that, I LIKED this book. I read it, and, even though it's not Dune, it's an excellent history lesson into the past of Dune. I'm also one of those people that liked EVERY Dune book, from Messiah to Heretics. They were all masterpieces, and this one can hold a candle to its predicessors (or postdicessors). If you want something just like Dune, don't read this book. But, if you are willing to open your mind to a different style and a different spin on your old favorite, buy a copy! Then, go read the other 6 in order, from beginning to end...You'll thank me later."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When I first read the novel, I was a bit skeptical about whether I would like it or not. I love the Dune series immensely, and I love the movie and the books. The story kept my interest up until the end, and it explained a lot of things that Herbert had kept shrouded in mystery.I do have to admit that there are a few inconsistencies and questions: the no-ship, the Tleilaxu's fanatical behavior, etc. I was also shocked and apalled to see the wrong way of breathing through a stillsuit a couple of times. Ok you breathe in through your mouth and out through the noseplug. Are you with me on this?For a prequel, it is great fun. I can easily see this as a movie. I also enjoyed some of the fleshing out of Shaddam IV and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. It was interesting to see how these two became the way they were.I kind of like to think of this novel as a really great piece of fan fiction, because it's not written in FH's style at all. Of course if you're really curious about Dune's past and you're really homesick for a visit back to Caladan, Kaitan, Giedi Prime and Arrakis, then read House: Atreides! It's excellent entertainment!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I enjoyed this return to the Dune universe. I greatly appreciated the younger characterizations of Dune heavies. It was a pleasure seeing the grotesque Baron Harkonnen as a young and desirable man. And I must further confess to visualizing Miguel Ferrer playing the role of Shaddam IV as his father Jose Ferrer played the elder Shaddam in David Lynch's Dune.However, the ending was a let-down, feeling more like the stepping stone for another couple of prequel episodes. Does that sound familiar? Plus, I found the repeating inner voices a bit insulting, as if the authors felt I would forget the characters' motivations from chapter to chapter. At the end of the day, though, I did enjoy returning to the Dune environment, and I would still recommend it to anyone who can place the term &quot;Kwisatz Haderach.&quot;"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Definately not the Dune that Frank Herbert imagined. While it maintained the same elements and characters of the novel, some ends didn't tie into the whole like they should have. The coherency of the novel is somewhat hard to follow. This over descriptive novel is far divorces from Frank Herbert's style of writing which emphasized that reader need only know the basic facts and no real actions, only consequences of them. This novel lacks that superlative element."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I think that the authors pulled off the near impossible - writing a new and substantial Dune book. It is very respectful towards the original Dune novels. It has a little more action than some of the others in the series. But what is wrong with that? This is a prequel done the right way. Dune fans should celebrate. Can't wait for more."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As a fan of the Dune book I have been waiting for many years for a book to revisit the Dune world. I found this book to be highly readable. It keeps very much to the original story. Probabily as well though as latter books in the series did. To the fans who want to keep in touch its a must read but to others its probabily better to miss. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I enjoyed reading more details about the Dune cosmology. However the story was too easy to read and explained everything outright. It lacks the subtle undertones of Frank's writings where you learn new things upon each re-reading."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have loved the DUNE series since it was first published. I was therefore somewhat skeptical of reading this new book, feeling that no one could come close to the vivid details of the original series. However the team of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson have done the near impossible. They have lived up to the writings of Frank Herbert. The writing style, depth of character, and world developlent were excellent. I throughly enjoyed reading this prequel an am looking forward to additional stories from them about DUNE."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"There's a reason why Frank Herbert's Dune Chronicles are widely regarded as the best offerings of science fiction in the world: He created a universe almost beyond imagination and, at the same time, made it utterly believable. Tolkien did the same with his Lord Of The Rings, Heinlein did it with his Future History stories. One would of course be skeptical of someone else attempting to usurp the glory of Frank Herbert's majestic works, even if it is his son, Brian, and the talented Kevin J. Anderson. I was... until I read the book. Many of the tantalizing threads Frank Herbert left dangling are picked up here and extrapolated upon, with a most satisfying effect. Questions I had for years have been answered and further questions would seem to be promised answers in the two forthcoming books, Dune: House Harkonnen and Dune: House Corrino. Dune: House Atreides isn't just about answering questions from Dune, however. It's full of surprises and wonders of its own that certainly kept me turning pages until I came to the end. It would seem to be an almost unattainable feat to create more of Frank Herbert's Dune, but his son and Mr. Anderson have achieved it spectacularly. I can't wait until next October to see what happens next!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was very pleased with Herbert's (the Younger) and Anderson's version of the history of DUNE universe. A youthful Duke Leto, Duncan Idaho and the Harkonnens, Shaddam ascending to the throne, the pre-Kynes Fremen . . . these topics were enough to keep this avid DUNE fan reading for hours on end.However, having read the DUNE Chronicles about nine times, I found the writing style of Herbert and Anderson all too different from Frank. It was obvious to me on page one. The style seemed forced, stilted - it didn't have the flow like the originals. The authors also laid too much out there in plain view for all to see. One of the reasons I read the originals so much is that F. Herbert could be very cryptic at times. He made you sift through his words to find the meaning. B. Herbert and Anderson lay it all out there as if speaking to a dumb child. I miss Frank Herbert's style.Nonetheless, the story was good and it takes place in the DUNE universe. I can't wait for the next two."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"If you wish to be mildly entertained with Duneish possibilities, read it. Don't be looking for dynamic tension or layered plots, though. Worth reading, but a pale substitute for Dune as written by Frank Herbert. Think of it as an Alternate Universe book. That will help with the more bizarre stuff. Worth your attention, but only as ancillary to Dune, not as a *true* part."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book chould be compared more with Harry Potter than the Dune series frank Herbert wrote. The dialogs are simple with very little sublety. I just finished reading Chapterhouse Dune before I read House Atreides so I was still beaming from Frank's writing. This book pales before Frank's writing style.The book has several parts that I would label &quot;cheezy&quot; including way too many references to &quot;Spanish&quot; culture on the planet Caladan. There is even mention of the Bene Gessrit employing Feng Shui (japanese art of interior design intended to keep away bad spirits)to make a new room to give birth to a child. How childish and ridiculous that a civilization 20000 years or so in the future would hold such rubish in high regard. More likely one of the authors is a Feng shui practiioner and just had to mention it.The book was easy to read and sort of interesting, but the association with the Frank Herbert's Dune series is undeserved and leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I doubt I will read House Harkonnen, maybe when it is on the shelves of the used book store.Very dissapointed."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"A brilliant addition to the Dune series. A worthy successor to Dune and Dune Messiah which knocks spots off Chapter House and Heretics. Reads like Frank Herbert before he got caught by his own verbosity. A big well done to Kevin and Brian and thank you from the bottom of my heart for not writing the sequel(s) to Chapter/Hertics. Let the story hang poised for ever on the verge of another monumental trilogy."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune: House Atreides, the first of three books leading up to the events of the original Dune series, successfully (re)introduces the characters and themes of the Frank Herbert books, although it is burdened by the legacy the classic Dune books have left behind.Brian Herbert, a most gentle and honorable soul I have had the pleasure of meeting on a couple of occasions at book signings, and Kevin J. Anderson, have undertaken an almost impossible task in trying to fill out the missing story lines of the original books. To those who quip that they are just out to make an easy buck, know that this undertaking was not done in haste, and no decision was taken lightly. Brian and Kevin have done their homework and their goal is to finish the story. But to do so requires telling us what lead up to the events in Dune. Creating the 1000 page Dune Concordance used as their Dune encyclopedia, and writing 1800 pages plus to get to the point of being able to finish the Dune story line, not to mention a probably detour to the Butlerian Jihad events 10000 years earlier, is no way to go about making an easy buck! Both authors are accomplished writers who did not need to take on such a tremendous challenge.Yet they have, and although I think the story gets off to a slow start, the last 300 pages made it hard to put the book down. Although one who has read the original books will be familiar with the characters, the story in House Atreides is well enough written to keep the reader's interest, and keep one wondering how things will play out. The authors follow a number of plot threads that generally coalesce into one thread that is followed at the end. My one complaint would be that early on the story line tends to jump around just a little too much. I would have liked to see a little longer spells following one plot or another. Perhaps this clearer focus later on made the book a more gripping read for me as I turned the pages.Having not read the original Dune since the mid 1980's, and only having been able to &quot;catch&quot; up with Frank Herbert's later Dune books because he sadly passed away - he seemed to write them far faster than I could read them - I cannot easily compare this new book with the original. However, I do not feel compelled to do so either. House Atreides stands on its own merits. It is a book that new fans can enjoy, and old fans should be able to as well. It cannot be as original as the original - that's just the nature of things - but that does not lessen the quality of the book. As the authors become more comfortable with the Dune world they are writing about/in, and their storyline becomes more developed I suspect the future offerings, House Harkonnen, and then House Corrino, will be even more compelling reads.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"While it was great to have a chance to visit the Dune universe again, this was just a poor piece of writing. The only person I could reccomend this book to is someone who has read the series and is interested in learning more of the background to the story. One gets the impression that Dune was written as literature and that House Atreides was written to be a best seller appealing to the lowest common denominator. Unfortunate."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"For Fans of Frank Herbert's Dune series this is good news. His son Brian Herbert (along with Kevin J. Anderson) is continuing the saga in the same style and feel as the original Dune series. The House Books are a prelude to the original series. House Atreides is the first of three novels in this series .They include House Atreides, House Harkonnen and House Corino. House Atreides gives you a look at the origins of Duke Leto as a young man as well as his friends, the heirs to the fallen house of IX, Rhombur and Kailea. You see the trials that Duncan Idaho goes through as a child on the prison world controlled by the Harkonnens' as well as the plotting of the Crown Prince Shaddaom and his lifelong companion Hasimir Fenring.You will learn how and why the Tleilaxu now have control Ix and how and why Pardot Kynes arrives on Dune. All in all this book is a very good read and a must for fans of the original Dune series. Having read House Atreides I only wanted more and after reading all three novels, I still want more. Brian Herbert has done a mesterful job of capturing the feel of these stories as written by his famous father."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"There is no book that I've read more times or loved more than Dune. I've read the 6 books in the Frank Herbert series many, many times. For years I've longed for a 7th book to complete the story knowing that could never happen.Now, along comes Brian Herbert with 3 new books that set the back drop for the series. The rumor is that he and Kevin Anderson will also release their version of the 7th book. We'll see.My rating for this book averages to 3 stars. My joy and excitement at the opportunity to walk down memory lane and experience stories of my favorite characters as they came into being warrants 4 stars. The fact that mistakes were made and the book couldn't possible be as good because Frank didn't write it warrants 2 stars.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Thank God they tried to stay true to the energy of Dune unlike the horror of the first Dune movie."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've read all of the original Dune series several times. The first prequel is not written the same way as the originals (don't expect it to be because it was written by different authors) but it gave me enough information and background about the different characters of the series. I found it quite as interesting and exciting as the other series. You need to get through the frist chapter to really get in the book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"If I could double the stars I would. Read it - read them all and I have them all, father and son. This second generation prequel is amazing. Genuinely so. I thought Frank Herbert was inimicable but Brian the son (with associate)has proven to have inherited his fathers writing genes. I can't wait for House Corrino to land on the shelves. This review refers to both House Atreides and Harkonnen. My opinion of them both, as of all the series, is the same. Eternal. 20th century Classics."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I'm sorely dissapointed in some of the Dune Fanatics who can't see beyond the end of their noses. The fist Dune book by Frank Herbert (go back and read it) seemed incredibly childish compared to Heritics and Chapterhouse. Franks writting ability got better and better the more he wrote. House Atreides is much better than Dune and not as good Franks later writtings, however, I'm willing to bet that like his father his skills will only improve with time. I kept expecting Kailea and Leto to fall in love only to have her murdered by the Harkonnens (or Leto's mother). And Rhombur in his grief to renounce politics and change his name to Gurney Hallek. Oh, well... there were some good plots that were quite enjoyable and I look forward to reading more. I'll probably stop and get House Harkonnen today. I'm not too familiar with Anderson so I don't know if he helped or hurt the book, but if Brian decides he need a different co-author he should look to Melody Higdon - she's excellent at dialog and character development."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This is a remarkable intro to the Dune series.

There are bound to be some small mistakes in some of the finer points, but really, who cares? If that irritated you, it probably ruined your perspective of the entire book, as you must have been looking for a historical recount of the dune universe, not the brilliant novel that it is."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The book is generally good, but lacks something that only the original series could provide. The writing in some scenes was absolutely amazing, even better the Frank Herbert (like the scene where Kailea drinks wine with Leto and Rhombur.) And sometimes dissapointing like some of the Duncan Idaho scenes. Also, I believe that Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson made a mistake by actually making the world in 10,154 more technologicaly advanced than it is in 10,191. I mean, the first No-Ships began to appear at the date of Heretics of Dune, wich was ~16,500, and so did the synthetic melange. And to me, the explanations they gave on dunenovels.com were'nt sufficient. Yes, I could understand the whole thing about the High Priest of Dur, but not the No-Ship or the synthetic melange. One more thing that I noticed, was the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam gave birth to Jessica, whereas in Children of Dune Leto clearly states that: &quot; They know you're a Harkonnen! It'll be in their breeding records: Jessica out of Tandidia Nerus by the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen...&quot; Maybe I'm wrong, maybe the authors would write something about it in the next prequels (like kill Jessica, and force the Baron to mate for a third time with Bene Gesserits.) Nevertheless, the book was well written. I believe they did an excellent job in filling the holes."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"As an avid reader and fan of the origional Dune series by Frank Herbert, I was overjoyed to learn of a Prequel to the Dune series.Dune: House Atredies starts putting the plans withing plans into motion. It is not one story but an elaborate dance of many plot elements with the centerpoint as always the spice melange. We are shown insights on the Atredies-Harkonnen feud, the Emperor's plans for Ix, young Duncan Idaho, Baron Harkonnen contracting his disease and more!Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson cleverly write each chapter to leave the reader hanging to see what the antagonist will do next and if the protagonist will get out of a harsh situation, which kept me turning and turning the pages.Keeping with the flavour of the six Dune Chronicles Books, each chapter opens with a quotable quote from meta journals kept by the characters or faction in the story, setting the mood for each chapter.A drawback I can forsee with this novel would be directed towards the new reader. To really catch the flavour of each character, race and faction, I would suggest reading all of or at least the first two books of the six Dune Chronicles novels.I will be eagerly awaiting the next books in this Prequel Series!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Actually, it's an excellent watering-down of Frank Herbert's classic series, skillfully designed for the lucrative young teens market. The adult reader is left with no doubt that young Herbert did it for the bucks. Will serious sci-fi lovers find any of it to be exciting, awe-inspiring or mind-expanding (as the first Dune was)? Not likely; however, the return to the elder Herbert's world still made for a fun afternoon's read. Despite the many &quot;historical&quot; mistakes (see the other reviews), still makes for good &quot;bathroom reading&quot; on a par with the Star Wars books. Give it to your young teen for Xmas."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This was a terrible, poorly plotted book with thin characters. As a huge fan of the original series, I was disappointed with Frank Herbert's son's attempt to recreate the magic of his father's books.

I wondered if the new authors had even read the original multilayered, highly intelligent, complex, multifacited novels that I enjoy reading over and over again."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Disregard the sourpuss reviews; they think they could have done better.

I am convinced that Brian has watched the movie a few times and may have read his fathers works but, it's hard to say. I equate this to a Star Trek/Star Wars novel. Nostalgia and boredom are all that may get me through this book. If you see it at a Garage sale....buy it!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"With this book, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson weave the warp and woof that make up the complex tapestry Frank Herbert started in his classic Dune novels so many years ago. All of the familiar characters are there in full regalia, along with their progenitors:Emperor Elrood and his son Shaddam, as well as Shaddam's ever-present companion, Hasimir Fenring. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Leto Atreides and his father, Duke Paulus, as well as Thufir Hawat, the Duke's faithful Mentat. The Spacing Guild. The Bene Tleilaxu. The Bene Gesserit, along with their on-going breeding programs and their constant struggle to create the god-child they call the Kwisatz Haderach. Pardot Kynes, the Planetologist. The mysterious Fremen.Dune: House Atreides is full of political and religious intrigue: Watch as Shaddam and Fenring wrangle their way into power. Watch as the Bene Tleilaxu work a most devious and conspiratorial plot against House Vernius and the Planet Ix. Watch as the Bene Gesserit make an unexpected move in their ages long plan to birth the Kwisatz Haderach, or &quot;Shortening of the Way,&quot; a male Bene Gesserit &quot;whose organic mental powers would bridge space and time.&quot;Watch as a certain Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother gives action to the Bene Gesserit Dictum: &quot;History has seldom been good to those who must be punished. Bene Gesserit punishments cannot be forgotten.&quot; Watch as Pardot Kynes becomes the Imperial Planetologist to Arrakis, the Planet Dune, and as he befriends the Fremen and begins a plan of his own making, one he sees as taking hundreds of years to fulfill. And watch, as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen works a most exquisite revenge against the Harkonnen's old rival, House Atreides.Written in a style that complements that of Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert's father, Dune: House Atreides is a fitting and welcome prequel to this longtime favorite series of science fiction fans."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Anderson &amp; Herbert take us all on a very detailed, sometimes complex ride through the precursors of Frank Herbert's Dune books.

It gives the reader the 'keys' to the future of the series, and gave some background on topics left hanging by the later books.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't expect another epic on the scale of &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot;, merely a good story.And I got it.I sincerely hope Brian does as well with the next Dune novel, it will be on my purchase list.(Don't forget to read Moby Dick as well, I hear Oprah gave it 3 stars!)"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I'm a 16 year old guy, and I love to read. I got interested in the DUNE books after I rented and watched DUNE. The movie was awesome, and I picked up DUNE and started reading it. I had no intention of reading the whole six books, but after the first one I was captivated. I finished Chapterhouse: DUNE and was actually sad. After almost a year of reading, it was over. No more DUNE. I almost cried. I had read House Atreides between Heretics and Chapterhouse, and was disappointed. While it was fun to read and go back and visit my favorite characters, except for Teg, of course, who wasn't around then. But it lacked the inner meaning. It didn't grab me and not let go until it had killed me. It was just a book. It didn't have that depth of meaning I had come to expect, and when I was through, I didn't think that I had just gone through an incredible experience that helped me look at humankind in a different light. But still, it is DUNE, however misguided. If anybody should continue the DUNE legacy, it is Frank Herbert's son. I just wish he had done a better job."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I found that as a suppliment to the dune series, it fell far short. However, I feel this is because it was not written by Frank Herbert himself. I aggree that the &quot;no-ship&quot; technology came out of no where. I also felt that to much emphasis was placed on description and not enough on long reaching plot and character development. Otherwise it was an entertaining read"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I found Dune: House Atreides interesting enough to keep me reading, but I found it ultimately unsatisfying.My overall impression is that this is a story that doesn't really need to be told. Dune tells of the pivotal events of this time period; this novel is primarily backstory which only has significance because of the later events.For this reason, I didn't find the story of Duncan's childhood, of the Bene Gesserit's schemes to continue their breeding program, or of Pardot Keynes' adventures on Dune to be particularly interesting. What suspense there was in events was dispelled by my knowledge of how it all came out.As for other aspects of the story, although there were moments of political and military conflict, there was little real suspense. Most moments of danger or mystery were resolved almost immediately. Sometimes, a resolution was delayed for a few chapters, but when it did come, the resolution was sudden and simple. No real suspense was built, and solutions rarely caused new problems.One thing the book had going for it was the setting. I was delighted to explore the Dune universe again, and this book does give us a chance to do that. Much of the richness of that world is in this book. It is built on a strong foundation.Another aspect of the book that I found impressive was the way the authors were able to tie most of the disparate plot threads together. I was afraid at first that the individual backstories would remain unrelated short stories, chopped and multiplexed into one novel. That was not the case; the different plot threads were woven together skillfully.So while I enjoyed Dune: House Atreides, I feel that much of its merit comes from being built on Herbert's original creation. I'll read the next two books, but with diminished expectations."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"House Atreides is the first volume of a trilogy which is intended as a prequel to the events narrated in the great classic \\"Dune\\" by Frank Herbert. The initial idea of Brian Herbert (Frank Herbert's son) was to write a conclusion to the original saga which comprised six volumes. This idea was reinforced when some drafts of a \\"Dune 7\\" novel were found years after Frank Herbert's death in 1986. What finally resulted was the collaboration of Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson (well known already for working within others universes not created by himself, like Star Wars and the X-Files), to write several novels that take place in the 'Dune Universe', both authors claiming that some plots and ideas were taken from Frank Herbert's notes.The attempt is of course futile in the sense that no one will ever come close to write the way Frank Herbert did. He was an exceptional writer with an incredible wisdom and very peculiar style. Thus, when one reads House Atreides, one might see the body (characters, places and events of the Dune Universe) but the soul is missing. And it was precisely the soul of Herbert's works that made him inmortal.The problem with House Atreides is that it does not resist the comparison. If we could be able to judge it without thinking in the original Dune series it could be a nice adventure, even with some interesting events and places. On the negative side, the writing is no more than average, and the two different pens are clearly felt. Some of the events seem forced just to fit in the overall saga and many character responses are poorly backedAs it stands, House Atreides and all the novels which the Anderson-Herbert duo are writing might be interesting only as they will make us remember the greatness of Frank Herbert. The big incognita will be their final volume \\"Dune 7\\". Will it really be the conclusion that Frank Herbert was thinking for his epic saga?. We will never know..."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It's important to view these prequels for what they are - they are not Frank Herbert. Once you can let go of that you can enjoy them for what they are, a nice homage to the world of Dune and the brilliant mind of Frank Herbert.I love the Dune universe, I've read the series once a year for the last 17 years. I love the characters and the houses and the history that Herbert created so I do quite enjoy the prequels that Herbert's son has co-written because they are the only way I'll hear more about this universe.No, Brian isn't Frank and Frank is a better writer but this is Frank's universe so that shouldn't be surprising. I liked House Atreides, I thought the book was entertaining and that it fit in with the rest of the Dune books quite well. Most of all, I like that I can find out what made the characters of the series I love so much into the people they are in later books. Overall, I do recommend this book without hesitation, even being the geek I am."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I enjoyed reading Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's revisit to the universe of Dune but was dissapointed at the lack of depth and complexity of the book. Characters were too black and white (the Baron was about as evil as you could possibly get, just in case you don't get the point he routinely tortures someone or thinks about tormenting someone in just about every scene he's in, and Leto is unsufferably noble and honorable throughout). The characters were not as interesting as they were in the original Dune series, they lack the same depth and intriguing personalities. The book overall is just too simplistic and not as intelligent as its predecessors, (Fenring and Shaddam just happen to come up with the brilliant idea to synthesize spice? With such a demand for the rare drug why hadn't anyone else come up with the idea, for example the Bene Tleilxu themselves?). Some more problems I had with the book, the class issue was delve into only very shallowly during the takeover of Ix and the revolt of the \\"suboids\\". In the end the reader is left with the feeling that the ruling nobility was unjustly thrown from their seats of power and that the suboids were well taken care of (food, housing, and work all provided; why ask for anything more?) and had no right to complain; they were blindly led to their own downfall like sheep to the slaughter and they brought it upon themselves. Somehow the whole \\"ignorant masses\\" thing doesn't work for me. Also the portrayal of the Bene Tleilxu was way too much for me, all they seemed to say about them was that the Bene Tleilxu = evil, corrupt, and ugly. Where are the shades of grey? Where are the complex characters with complex motives? Where is the intrigue, the mystery, the complicated plot? All the brilliant revelations in this novel seem sub par and mediocre. The book was so terribly predictable. I also felt that Leto's miraculous victory in the trial wasn't so spectacular, and though he got a lot of acclaim and respect from it, he never actually did anything that led to his success. He was the one that had to be saved.Now, this does not mean the novel wasn't enjoyable. I definitely enjoyed going back to the roots of the characters and seeing where they came from. Some of the ideas were interesting as well (though the details could have been worked out a little better). If you are a fan of the Dune series I recommend the book as a chance to revisit characters and learn a bit more but don't expect anything on the same level as the orginal series."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"A very interesting and fair attempt at extending the Dune series. The idea to start with a prequel is a great idea because it provides us with the elements that we could only guess in the first novel by Frank Herbert. The fact that the prequel is supervised and partly written by Brian Herbert, Frank's son, is a guarantee that it is fairly faithful to the originals. We thus discover why the Baron is inflated and sick. We thus discover details about Rabban's personality (if we can call this a personality) and his family background. We also get data about the Emperor and his Bene Gesserit wife. We also get data about the Atreides family : the death of Paulus, the beginnings of Leto I, his personality, his friends. We also understand the ups and downs of Ix and the Vernius family. In short it gives us the background of the first novel, and this is a good thing.But such an attempt has a drawback. The style of the two writers (Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson) has little to do with Frank Herbert's. It is entertaining, informative, rich, packed with dense action, but the main characteristic of Frank Herbert's novels is missing : there is little introspective explanations. The characters get their psychology from their actions, whereas with the father they got their psychology from their constant introspection and teaching, first : action was only quite vague as for the psychology and motivations. Those who are on the verge of a caricature are the Bene Gesserit, the witches. Their motivations are hardly explained, except in breeding programs (with no details) and their direct active meddling with the current course of events. We do not get any perspective in their long term objectives and in their motivations, let alone their constant use of Other Memory and their constant questioning of any decision anyone of them is taking within their fields.Thus, the characters seem to be in their infancy. We have the impression we are in some kind of limbos from which great depth will eventually, later come out. But it is a page-turner indeed.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune: House Atreides was on it's own a fine book..hence the 3 star rating. However, when compared to the original Dune novels by Frank Herbert, it pales vastly in comparison. The book is filled with inconsistencies with the first Dune novel.On a positive note, what this book does give us, is a refreshing new look at characters that were cursorily touched on in the first Dune novel. We have Leto Atreides thrust into becoming Duke Atreides at the same age as young Paul in the original Dune novel..we learn how Emperor Shaddam ascends to the throne, we learn the initial importance of Arrakis, and of Kynes.However, negatively...we have two authors searching out reasons to explain changes they're making to the story, by finding a spot where there can be some consistency with the much earlier written later novels.If you want to read this for the sake of reviewing some background information in the Dune universe while suspending some motions of belief, then this book will be fine for you. If you are a general sci-fi fan, this book will be fine for you. If you are a Dune purist, however....I believe you will highly dislike this novel."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I enjoyed this book overall. I don't think it was as good as the original Dune. The writing was weak in places. Also it was too violent for my taste. But overall it gave interesting background to the Dune universe, and was original enough to keep my interest. If you like the other Dune books, this is worth a try."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I picked this book up based on curiousity factor; I have to confess impatience with the purists who disdain the Dune film because of it's imperfections, when anyone should realize what a daunting task it was to film and that to do as well as Di Laurentis did is an admirable accomplishment. What made me choose to pursue this book was that some files/unfinished manuscripts had apparently been found. I feel that incomplete, or even bad Frank Herbert writing is still so much better than most of the crap that gets published that I was willing to take the bait. I choose to view this as additional research into the Herbert Universe, not unlike the furtherance of JRR Tolkein's world by his son, Christopher. It will never be as if the original author were doing the writing and editing, but neither is it presented as though it were.I re-read all of Herbert's books (Frank) on a yearly basis and still find them so multi-faceted that I enjoy them in new ways and with new levels of understanding each time. Of course I find this book to be inferior in writing quality to Frank's style; the man's mind was amazing. However, if you climb down from your literary soapbox long enough to notice, you'll find some interesting explanations and historical allusions that help to flesh out (notwithstanding the odd anomaly) characters and political relationships that weren't fully explained by Frank. I enjoyed it on that basis, and chose not to expect too much. By these standards, it is a success for me."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Brian Herbert can't write. Or, maybe he can, but he didn't bother to put any effort into his writing because he knew people would buy Dune books no matter how badly he wrote them. Essentially, the only merit of this book and the other Dune books written by Brian Herbert is to give us the raw facts about the world of Dune. The plot is probably quite close to what Frank Herbert himself would have written. The writing itself, however, is stilted, shallow, and painful to read. What little characterization there is has been executed without consistency, believeability, or style. The dialogue is horribly artificial. Brian Herbert's writing is utterly devoid of ambience, and he makes the most common and most deadly mistake in writing: he fails to &quot;Show, Don't Tell&quot;. I know fifteen-year-olds who write better than this. The bottom line: don't buy this book. Get someone who HAS suffered through it to tell you the main plot points and interesting historical trivia. Those are the only things this book fails to screw up."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I hear a lot of people complaining about House Atreides and it's silliness, immaturity and inconsistencies. They say it isn't Frank Herbert's quality of work. It obviously isn't. But, of course, Frank Herbert is dead, and there is no way anybody can ever write the way he does again. There are a lot of inconsistencies, I'll agree with that. However, it is nowhere near as bad as it has been described. It is co-written by an author known for his Star Wars novels, not his analysis on philosophy. The reason that there is no philosophy to the book is becuase there is far less involvement on behalf of the Fremen, so we don't get all this babbling about the Lisan al-Gaib and the Kwisatz Haderach. I liked House Atreides. In fact, it's one of my favorite books. And I'm going to get House Harkonnen and make it to the book signing here in San Diego. And I'll buy House Corrino when it finally arrives. I like Frank Herbert's philosophy and his son's ability to swiftly carry a story. This book isn't exactly good to read at the beginning of the Dune series if you haven't yet read it. It has a lot of high action and can make you expect too much of the Dune series if all that you like is action sci-fi, which Dune certainly is not."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"What is this obsession with writing spin off books of popular sci fi series? Look at how pitiful and useless the Doctor Who &quot;Missing Adventures&quot; are (read my review on Interference by Lawrence Miles). There is something to be said about appreciating something upon its own merits and not attempting to recapture it out of greed for more money from the fans. Show some integrity. The &quot;original&quot; Herbert wrote with a style that didn't trivialize. He gave the readers the facts as they needed to know. This work knows nothing of minimalism as every specific action is drolled out. How over descriptive do you need to get before you realize Dune fans are NOT second graders? With this pop-Star Trek fiction approach the Dune characters are degenerated into sub-average 90s charicatures. And having Baron Harkonnen show up himself is as dumb as Jabba The Hutt crawling into a gratuitous scene where his bounty hunters should have sufficed. This is as lame as that Young Indiana Jones crud (see my review on Trenches of Hell). Show some class. Leave us the classic Dune and stick to junk trendy neophyte pulp like Star Wars year ten with Han Solo kids. These greed mongers better stay away from the Hobbit! Don't buy this. Junk."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"While noone could, or at least should, expect this novel to live up to Frank Herbert's master work, it is acceptable as a continuation of the storyline. While it is far inferior to both Dune and Children of Dune, it is a far better work that Chapterhouse. What it lacks in plot, however, it makes up for in perpetuating lines of stereotyping and discrimination.The additional plotlines woven into the text - the backgrounds for Ix, the Bene Tleilax, and Duncan Idaho in particular - provide a good solid backgrounding for the later books in the story. The Baron's story is a good format adopted here to show why he turned out to be so twisted, but the familial backgrounding is weak. The first half of the story dealing with Shaddam and Fenrig's scheming is excellent, but the latter half of this plot-line is contrived and reflects too much of Anderson's involvement in the Star Wars expansion books. The plotline involving Sister Gaius Helen Mohiam is quite ingenious.As far as the relationship between the text and real life go: the anti-union bias reflected in this text is horrid, the environmental considerations are added in only as a tribute to Herbert (it is obvious that the authors do not share his passion for ecology), the careful attitude adopted by Herbert towards non-European cultures is adandoned and degenerates into racist and xenophobic depictions, and the general background and serious research put into the novels by Herbert is replaced with irrelevant and utterly made-up sceince and biology.In short, while the book is interesting, the social message is one that should be taken into account by the reader. THe book abandons Herbert's course of wise progressivism in favor of reactionary and regressive stances towards socal issues. One has to read this book with a critical eye to avoid the sexist, racist, and (often) homophobic attitudes adopted by little Herbert and Anderson in the text of this book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Most other reviews here have pointed out the shallowness of the ideas in this novel, manifested in the hollowness of the characters, etc. All of this is true, but when it comes down to it, House Atriedes book simply suffers from bad writing, and ultimately, I feel, bad editing. The writer isn't always to blame. Authors sometimes get so close to their work that glaring inconsistancies become invisible to them. It is then the job of the editor to sort out these problems. That job has not been done well enough in this case. While there are many examples in House Atriedes, one that stood out was the description of a chair as &quot;comfortable&quot; in one sentence, and &quot;uncomfortable&quot; in the next. This was no attempt at irony, metaphor, whatever. Just bad writing. Everything else follows from this. The poor development of character, the debasing of any mythic resonance established in the original series (how about those Salusan bulls - straight out of Lost in Space!), the complete lack of insight or broad philosophical/historical ideas that made the original so exemplary. Worse still, and perhaps somewhat disturbing, was the role of females within the novel. When they weren't sitting around eating fruit and looking pretty, they were being raped, blasted, or eaten in scenes that lingered a little too long for my liking. While men in the novel suffered various noble deaths, there seemed to be a kind of sick delight on the writers parts in establishing and &quot;executing&quot; various cruel ends for the women. I really think this issue has to be addressed before the series continues."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Frank Herbert, before writing the original Dune novel, spent 20 years of research and story outline before putting one word on paper. What resulted was the book that every other Science Fiction book is compared to.Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson seem to crank out a Dune novel about once a year. The result is that this book, while entertaining, is nowhere as deep, thought provoking, thorough and engaging as the original. While the original had many feints within feints within feints, this one might get as deep as a feint within a feint.... maybe two. A big complaint is the dialogue as you have characters saying things that Frank Herbert would never pen. I actually found myself cringing with some of the conversations that took place.The biggest thing that stirred my ire was that there is a scene that was a blatant rip-off of a scene from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Continent. Don't worry, it isn't hard to spot, but it sent off warning bells immediately. Heck, I dropped an extra star just because of it. I would rather wait 2-3 years to get a really good Dune novel than one a year that takes from so many other stories. Come on, Brian and Kevin, let's try and do some original thinking here!With that said, I still found the book to be entertaining. These books were written from Frank Herbert's notes so the events that unfold are largely from the imagination of Frank. I found the pace of this book to be a bit faster than the other Dune books. A lot of people complained that Frank's sequels were too drawn out and long-winded (hard to argue with that) so the quickened pace of the plot development is refreshing.This does cover a lot of ground in the Dune universe. I loved the original Dune books and wish Frank could have written more, but this series is still fun to read considering I have nowhere else to go to fulfill my Dune appetite. So if Frank's original six books left you craving more than I would suggest that you pick up this book as well as the others. However, if you will not be able to handle visits into the Dune universe that are nowhere as wonderful as Frank's books then shy away from book.If you've never read Dune before and are considering reading this, I would discourage it unless you like those cheesy Star Trek novels that are basically cranked out in the same style. I would highly suggest you pick up the original Dune book first."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have read many reviews of &quot;Dune:House Atreides&quot; and every single one goes on to compare it to the magnificence of the original series. Nothing will ever come close to the engrossing, complex, and wonderful worlds that Frank Herbert brought to us (unless the Tleilaxu have secretly made of ghola of the man himself). But I think in all fairness that Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have made one hell of a go at it. The plot is rich with so many colorful layers and the daunting history of the DUNE universe. The charaters seem real and the familiar ones stand up to what they are to become later in the DUNE timeline. Yes, any diehard fan knows exactly what's coming, but going back to the pre-Mau'Dib era and seeing the events that led up to the original series is like looking back at an old family photo album with fond nostalgia. Also I think these two fine authors need this prequel trilogy to get their proverbial feet wet to get themselves and readers re-familiar with the DUNE universe so they can adequately take on the emense task of taking up where &quot;Chapterhouse:Dune&quot; left us hanging. &quot;Dune:House Atreides&quot; kept me reading and interested, made me feel and think. It felt like coming home to the DUNE universe that I and so many others have come to love. Not perfect, not Frank Herbert, but still worthy of a Freman's loyalty."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Hmmmmm. If I had not read the Dune series many times, or at all, I might like this book, but having read the series, I am dismayed by the failure of these writers to adequately research before writing. They both claim or have reason to be experts on Dune, yet make such obvious mistakes as having people be all amazed by a worm &quot;more than 200 metres long&quot; and describing said worm as an ancient member of its kind, when in Dune, average worms swallowed spice factories that were 150 feet long in one gulp and Paul's first solo worm ride involved a monster of half a league's length - at least 1 and a half miles long! Even worse, the Bene Tleilax masters run around all over the place being obviously small, grey and fanatical, though in Dune they took pride in staying on their own planet, felt dirtied by such running around and kept any religious beliefs strictly to themselves. Does anyone remember Count Fenring in Dune? In this book they have him think such banal thoughts as &quot;You can't aim any higher than that.&quot; Can anyone imagine Count Fenring thinking in any such modern fashion - the deadly killer with the manners of a rabbit? The partner of the cool and elegant Margot Fenring, Bene Gesserit ? I found this to be way beyond belief. There are many such inconsistencies to discover. The writing is never better than Frank Herbert's - don't believe that for a second. Frank Herbert would never have any character thinking &quot;You can't aim higher than that&quot;. The writing is full of flowery or heroic phrases - not the clean, hard, intellectual prose Frank Herbert wrote. If you are a serious Dune fan, this book really is not up to scratch. If you are not, or you just like the Dune books but don't love them, you may well enjoy the story - it has its good points and some things are quite interesting - like the Bene Gesserit punishment of Baron Harkonnen. However, Dune lovers may well find themselves often puzzled and irritated by this novel."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I've been thinking for a couple of days of putting my thoughts up here, except I'm not sure what I actually think of it. Of course, it's no Dune (which was very much a book of ideas). It couldn't be. Heck, the five Dune sequels written by Frank Herbert were no Dune. I wasn't expecting it to be. Based on those lower expectations, the book had some merit. Specifically,Pros:* The basic stories are interesting. Herbert & Anderson have done a good job of developing the original idea (presumably this is due to the fact that they are working from Herbert Senior's notes)* The authors have done a good job of fleshing out the basic ideas into a fairly fast-paced and well-motivated plot. I was definitely interested enough to keep reading (despite the bad writing) to find out what happened next. I will be reading House Harkonnen, the next book in this series, as well.* It's an easy read.Cons:* They spell everything out. The original Dune was well-known for its nuances and subtle writing. This book spells everything out for you; the political machinations in particular are beat to the death as the writers provide us with every single detail of who every single character arrives at a conclusion as to who's doing what and why.* The writing level is just not on a par with the original series. Herbert Junior is clearly not as smart as his father (who is?) and because of this writes as if the reader is also dumb. I may not be as smart as Frank Herbert, but I'm definitely smarter than the authors. This sometimes makes the reading monotonous when they review something for the reader for the third or fourth time. Some things (including most of what they spell out) are better left for the reader to work out on his own.* The character development is often not interesting or deep; some of the characters (e.g., Duke Leto's mother) are downright one-dimensional. It's often a mystery why they do what they do (can't elaborate without a plot spoiler, but trust me some plot twists are downright unbelievable).* They use the same short chapter technique as the original, but each section is just too short. As a result, the action often feels jerky, rather than the smooth transitions the original managed to achieve.* There are several disagreements with the original Dune series. So many in fact that they had to put out a spin sheet on their website to explain away these discrepancies and errors.* It's an easy read.So, where does that leave us? Still not sure, maybe 3 stars out of 5? The only thing I can say with certainty is that it's neither as good as nor as bad as some of the other reviews here would lead you to believe."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The original Dune series is one of my favorite works of fiction, but &quot;House Atreides&quot; does the original an immense disservice by association.&quot;Dune: House Atreides&quot; is a poorly-written, badly-constructed, and barely-readable effort. The characters aren't true to the original series, the technology is weak and contradictory, and the plot could be described in two pages. Also, I'm not sure the authors know the meanings of the words &quot;akimbo&quot; or &quot;penultimate&quot;.If you're a Dune fan, re-read the originals instead of wasting your time with this... book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The stories, some if not most developed by Frank Herbert, the original author of the six-part Dune series, are fabulous. Alas, the writing is atrocious. There are too many examples of awfulness to enumerate, so I will mention only one. The authors repeat information as though they think the readers aren't going to be paying any attention: in House Atreides, Kailea's &quot;emerald&quot; eyes are mentioned so often that I figured the authors had done a &quot;Find and Replace&quot; search on her name.... The book is wordy and loose, not at all like the tight, crisp writing of Frank Herbert (who died in 1986). Not a page goes by that I don't wonder why these books weren't edited properly. However, because the story line is so good, I keep reading. I would only recommend these books to someone who could somehow overlook form for function, just to get at the stories themselves. When Dune: House Corrino comes out in paperback, I'll read it, too, despite my complaints about the writing. [Two years later: I never did. I just couldn't get rid of the bad memory of these two Dune books.] However, I'm most looking forward to going back and rereading the original Dune once I finish House Harkonnen, just to get the taste of that terrible writing out of my mouth."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Dune is my favorite book of all time, so this &quot;prequel&quot; is hard for me to judge. Herbert's universe is so beautiful and richly complex that it would be difficult for me to dislike ANY book based on its world. It is always a pleasure to revisit Arrakis and the House Atreides.But fundamentally, this book does not contain the passion of Dune. I loved Dune for its intricate weave of tragedy and triumph. There was nothing more terrible than seeing Duke Leto die, and knowing that history would forget about him. But we got to experience the triumph of his son who became a legend. In &quot;House Atreides&quot;, I wanted to see the greatness of Leto and learn more about his history and his family. I got a little of that, but some of the story contradicted what I remembered from Dune. Specifically, I got the impression from Dune that Leto's father died from underestimating a bull (which I felt was a wonderful symbol). In this book that story becomes far more complicated.I was thrilled to learn more about one of my favorite characters, Duncan Idaho. But the passion of this story fell flat. While I loved the new information on Duncan's early life, I didn't get to delve into his struggles the way I thought I would. For me, Duncan Idaho has always been the &quot;Boba Fett&quot; of Dune, and I wanted an elaborate and passionate story about him. Instead, I felt like I got the cliff notes.Fundamentally, I feel this book suffers from a lack of vision. However, I will probably keep it in my collection because it does contain a lot of new information, especially about the House of Ix. There are other stories you get to learn about as well, such as House Tleilaxu, the story of Stilgar, Pardot Keynes and Liet Keynes, Hasimir Fenring, Baron Harkonnen, and the Padishah Emperors. I would recommend this to Dune lovers for the added information it provides with the caveat that I feel that some of the &quot;history&quot; has been altered for entertainment value.Overall, a fascinating and complicated history written in an awkward way. (4.5 out of 10)"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Ok, sorry, but I had to change my review. Initially, I was about halfway into this book, and enjoying it well enough to give it a three star review. Now, I feel the need to change it, because I'm getting closer to finishing it and I know what really bothers me and why this book has so many 1-star reviews and arouses a general hatred in any seasoned Dune fans. Let me list the problems:1) The characters are 1-dimensional. Boring, flat, lacking personality. Herbert wrote from a 3rd person omniscient point of view, and this book is far from omniscient. You never get inside the characters' heads, you just read one dreary event after another.2) This book was written by two people. Every time I found myself enjoying it for a few pages, the writing style would change sharply and you could tell that the other author had taken over. I'm not quite sure who ruins this book, but I have a feeling it is Kevin J. Anderson, with some of the worst writing making me feel as though this is a Star Trek Novel.3) The dialogue is AWFUL. As one other reviewer stated, there are phrases and conversations in this book that would make Frank Herbert cringe, but to be more appropriate, he would roll over in his grave now.4) The lack of political/religious intrigue. There is no \\"magic\\" to this book, nothing that makes you put it down and let your imagination run wild. No messiah, no Muad'Dib (thank god they didn't even attempt to incorporate Paul Atreides since he wouldn't have even been born yet.), and hence no mystery, none of those moments you felt in awe of the original Dune world when Frank Herbert wrote it.5) The plot-spoilers of the original Dune series. I fear that people are buying these prequels in order to prepare themselves for the original Dune, and when they read this hack of a novel, they will already know everything about the origin of Paul's family tree, the riding of the worms, etc... things that you were shocked to find reading the original Dune will no longer be shocking and exciting to new readers.6) Warning: plot spoilers: What is this crap about Kynes? The whole Kynes plot is horrible in this book. First, the would-be assassin simply falls on his own knife because Kynes Senior simply says \\"remove yourself.\\" Give me a break. Then, they take him on a 20-thumper ride into the deep southern desert, and guess what? There is ice down there! Fresh water! Plant life! If this was true, they not only wouldn't have needed Kynes at all, but they probably would have a ton of water already, it wouldn't even be sacred. Not once in ANY of Frank Herbert's novels does he suggest that there was an \\"antarctic circle\\" or \\"sheer cliff[s] overhead where ice and cold winds at the top gave way to warmer air in the depths\\"... \\"solar mirrors and magnifiers in the cliff walls to warm the air and melt frost from the ground.\\" At this point, I had enough. The Dune world had officially degraded into a terrible hack of a novel.I had to agree with all the one-star reviews at this point. If you are new to Dune, skip this garbage which is obviously written by two people, and almost overnight turned into a 6-novel series to cash in as much as possible. Pick up the ORIGINAL Dune series, written by a true genius, Frank Herbert.I could go on and on.. but this should be enough."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"At first I was mystified about the intensity of some of the other reviewer's hatred for this book. Of course, I knew there would be an obsession with comparing it to the beloved Dune (which is beyond comparison) by the Dune purists/fanatics. But now, I think it has more to do with House Atreides lack of any original philosophical insights. Also, it is nowhere near as dark as Dune. Be that as it may, the plot is tight and full of exciting twists and turns. The character development was great as well. Remember, as a prequel, the goal of this (and the next two) books is to set up and flesh out (in a contextual way) what is to come in Dune. I feel this goal was met and exceeded. As a matter of fact, I was so totally engrossed in Dune: House Atreides that I would occasionally feel compelled to say \\"This book is GREAT\\" to no one or anyone within earshot. It felt so good to be back in the universe of Dune with characters I knew and had always wondered about. The informational content on liked, disliked, and unknown characters was priceless, and the plot kept me guessing (even though I first read Dune over 30 years ago and actually studied it in college in an upper level English course).Suffice it to say that B. Herbert and K. Anderson have (to my immense appreciation), breathed new life into one of the GREATEST SF series ever written. If you have read any or all of the Dune books or ESPECIALLY if you haven't read any of them, I believe that this is the book you should start reading first."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"It is unfair to compare this book to those penned by Frank Herbert. Is \\"Dune: House Artreides\\" as well written as the first series...absolutely not...few follow-ups are. But I think that Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson do a wonderful job of creating an addition to the Dune world.They give us a wonderful glimps into the world of thr Imperium preceeding the time of Muad'Dib. They share with us, from Frank Herbert's own notes, things that Dune fans have always wondered about...the life of Old Duke Paulus and Elrood, the early years of Duke Leto, the conception of Lady Jessica, etc. I also appreciated the glimpses into the worlds of the Bene Gesserits, Bene Theilax, the early life of Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, House of Ix, and other players within the Imperium.Let us not judge this book by comparing it to the works of Frank Herbert, but let us judge it on its own merit. If you do, I feel that you will appreciate this wonderful story line and give kudos to Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson for taking us there."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The Dune books by Frank Herbert are the greatest of all sci-fi epics ever written, so naturally I thought it was a tough act for his son to follow. My hopes didn't get any higher when I heard he was co-writing it with Kevin J. Anderson. Thankfully, I can say I didn't have anything to worry about. Though not as great as the original Dune, this book was still wonderful! It managed to capture the political intrigue of the original without becoming dry and boring. It starts of with several seemingly unrelated stories in Herberts wonderful universe, and brings them all together slowly through out the book, finshing with an edge of your seat climax! A must for any science fiction fan!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This is my first Dune book. I saw the movie and always hesitated to read any of the books because I thought I would be disappointed. I am glad to read this PreQuell to the original Dune series.

Frank Herbert passed away in the 80's, his son Brian, and Kevin Anderson co-wrote this story and did a great job.

What a ballsy thing to do -- to take on one of the most beloved sci-fi properties in history --and attempt to bring new, fresh persepective to it.The easy way out would have been to simply plunder Frank Herbert's notes, &quot;clone&quot; (ghola?) his style and count on a hungry and sentimental audience to lap it up with an unsterilized plastic picnic spoon. But you didn't do that. You tell the story with a brisk voice and an energetic clip that suits the younger ages of the main characters (Vladimir Harkonnen has yet to become the &quot;floating fat man&quot; of his later years) and ties up all sorts of &quot;loose beginnings.&quot;I've recommended that a number of &quot;non-Dunies&quot; first read &quot;Dune,&quot; then this new prequel, then the remainder of the Dune series (which, let's all admit, grew a tad thin toward the last couple of books).A lot of self-appointed &quot;Dune Purists&quot; are rail against the effrontery of adding to the Holy Canon.

I had heard rumors about D:HA about two years ago and I have been eagerly waiting for it since. Finally, D:HA arrived and I loved reading it. Dune: House Atreides is the best book I have read this year. Dune: House Atreides is filled with all the factors that made Dune such an outstanding work. Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson captured the style, theme and spirit of Dune. D:HA takes place four decades before Dune and gives the reader wheels within wheels, plots within plots and conspiracies within conspiracies. D:HA is filled with political intrigue and family sagas and conspiracies. Baron Harkonnen hatches various nefarious schemes. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood continue their secretive breeding programs which even the most advanced Mentat has not solved. Many of the Great Houses are jockeying for favors from the Emperor and the spice melange affects everybody's life. Melange is only found on Dune, also known as Arrakis. Dune: House Atreides is as addictive as melange. I couldn't put the book down, but I also didn't want the book to end. It was great to revisit with House Atreides, house Harkonnen and the myriad cast of characters populating the Imperium. Dune: House Atreides is a superb addition to the Dune canon."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The book Dune: House Atreides offers an abundance amount of philosophy and political intrigue. The style in which it is written can be compared relatively close to the style of Frank Herbert, the creator of the Dune masterpieces. The book has many faces in which it could be viewed from many which are obvious and many which are subtly hidden. On many occasions the readers of this book as well as the other books in the Dune masterpieces will find themselves needing to read between the lines to find the hidden facets of the text. This book as its predecessors has such treasures within it. A bit of history on the books, that being that this book Dune: House Atreides was created by Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert and also with the aide of Kevin J. Anderson. The two from notes and scripts from Frank Herbert on ideas for the book Dune: House Atreides who unfortunately could not finish the novel before his death put the book, together. This book has in opinion, has many strengths and few weaknesses. There are a few outstanding unique things about this book that gives its strength. A thing that might be hard to see at first, but at the beginning of every chapter there resides a quote from a faction or person of the universe of Dune and this quote provides a second meaning to the chapter it is on: second meaning as in a lesson or further information about the chapter. Another unique outstanding feature would be the story itself. Another strength of the book aside from the quotes would be the way it slowly introduces everything to you: much like the way Dune does. The beginning seems fairly simple giving you the basic introduction and from there on slowly introduces you to a more complex Dune. There still are more strengths of the book to be exploited aside from these. There are a few weaknesses in this book. The book starts off slower than it should seem to be, which sometimes tends to take the hook off some readers. Another could be the fact that it still doesn't provide enough history to the universe of Dune. The author seems to put things in a way that you must read the book Dune to get enough information to comprehend some of the details of the book which on the end matter to the storyline the most. As for readers of the original Dune the characters seem weaker in this book than the original. Overall, this book is excellently written out and deserves appraisals and raves given to the book. This book is seemingly aimed for those who have interest in politics and political philosophy and also it is aimed for the people who have read Dune or for people who are willing to immerse themselves in a simpler alien environment. Also this book should be recommended to other people who might have interest in those two topics since most of the book is focused around those two things. As readers take more of the book into them they will realize that the book is focused on the two topics. Dune: House Atreides has much more potential than this page could explain and the styling of it is classic. Those people who want to have a book with more than a few faces should try and read this book, it may have the requirements to please the complex mind."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Having read the book that started it all when I was much younger, Dune: House of Atreides was a fascinating novel to read. Frank Herbert's legacy lives on, in this prequel to Dune.The intricate storylines are well written, and woven with such flair that although each section pauses to focus on the lives of the central characters, there seems to be no real break as Herbert and Anderson cast their gaze upon Leto, Duncan, C'tarr, Baron Harkonnen, etc.To divulge details of Dune: House Atreides would be to attempt to encapsulate the novel as a Navigator would fold space on a Guild Heighliner. Impossible to do...the best I can do is to recommend this for reading. The politics and treachery abound, with schemes that have far-reaching consequences, even past the seminal book, Dune.Peace Out."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Complex, brilliant and prophetic. Frank Herbert's award-winning Dune chronicles captured the imaginations of millions of readers worldwide -- and transformed their perception of what the future could be. By his death in 1986, Frank Herbert had completed six novels in the Dune series. But much of his vision -- vast, sprawling, and multilayered -- remained unwritten. Now, working from recently discovered files left by his father, Brian Herbert and bestselling novelist Kevin J. Anderson collaborate on a new novel, the first volume in the prequel to Dune -- where we step onto planet Arrakis -- decades before Dune's hero, Paul Atreides, walks its sands.An aging tyrant sits on the Golden Lion Throne and rules all of the known universe, while his son grows dangerously impatient for the crown. A quasi-religious order of black-robed women move their secret breeding program one momentous step closer to creating the god-child they call the Kwisatz Haderach. And a minor family among nobility, House Atreides, chooses a course of honor that will bring it to destruction at the hands of its mortal enemy, House Harkonnen -- or take it to new heights of power.Here is the rich and complex world that Frank Herbert created in his classic series, in the time leading up to the momentous events of Dune. As Emperor Elrood's son Shaddam plots a subtle regicide, young Leto Atreides leaves his lush, water-rich planet for a year's education on the mechanized world of Ix; a planetologist named Pardot Kynes is dispatched by the Emperor to the desert planet Arrakis, or Dune, to discover the secrets of the addictive spice known as melange; and the eight-year-old slave Duncan Idaho is hunted by his cruel masters in a terrifying game from which he vows escape and vengeance. But none can envision the fate in store for them: one that will make them renegades -- and shapers of history.Covering the decade when Shaddam wins his throne, the teenager Leto Atreides becomes the unexpected ruler of House Atreides, and Pardot Kynes uncovers one of the planet Dune's greatest secrets, House Atreides captures the grandeur and drama of Frank Herbert's epic. And while this new novel solves some of Dune's most baffling mysteries, it presents new puzzles springing from the sands where one day Paul-Muad'dib Atreides, the hero of Dune, will walk. But now, in these years before Paul's birth, an unforgettable new epic begins."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I started reading this book expecting it not to live up to my expectations.

True, there are some differences in style, but the book far exceeded my expectations.

Lots of familiar characters, but +/- 30 years younger.As the original Dune series grew, it grew tired. With this addition, it is disappointing to report that none of the vigor of the first novel is restored. Reading this was like reading a film novelization. Scenes are carefully laid out in cinematic terms, but there's little spark. Wheels within wheels, as the original Dune said, but a couple of the tires are a bit soft.There was a certain crispness in Dune that's lacking here. Too much recapping of what happened only a few pages before. Short attention span SF? Maybe another edit would have helped keep the tension up. Of course this will be the first of a new series. It is inevitable that the purpose of the initial offering will be to set the stage, put the players in action, but resolve some but not all of the conflicts. Hopefully some of the deficiencies noted here will be corrected.I'll read the next one and the next one after that.

Which happened to be one of the reasons I liked the original Dune so much.The characters did seem more simpler. For example: Fenrig is portrayed as a sadistic assasin... yet my take from the originals his assasinations were to further a goal, dispassionately and clinically... not enjoyably.I hope that they'll complete the other 2 prequels for the fun of it... but pass the baton on to other folk to work on postquel books.

Unfortunately, the events seem to unfold in a predictable fashion as opposed to Herbert's constant surprise of what's coming next. Much of the political jockeying is also more transparent than in the original series.

Part of the magic of the Dune series written by Frank Herbert was the use of language and colour ; that's lacking in House Atreides. Dune: House Atreides is a quick read; it's interesting but I'm not sure that I'd reread it at some time in the future as I've done with the works of other sci-fi authors."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The entire first half of this book was extremely painful reading for those like myself who hold Dune as high in the annals of sci-fi as we do. The discrepancies in continuity with the first six books have been well documented by other reviewers, so I won't rehash them here.My favorite parts of the book were the afterwords. I was amused by these because of the fact that both writers swear up and down that they re-read both the whole original series and the notes left behind by Saint Francis of Arrakis before committing to writing book seven. What I'd like to know is this: Herbert and Anderson claim to have re-read the books and the notes...did they read them in the dark? Were the notes written in English? How else do they account for all of the plot discrepancies?Recommendation for books Two and Three: Drop Kevin Anderson from the project! - Have you ever seen those Young Jedi books? Anderson writes those, which explains why _House Atreides_ registers so high on the dumb-down scale. Here we have a sci-fi writer who a) Writes a series of books solely for the sake of further commercial exploitation of an established sci-fi property (Star Wars) and b) Writes those said books for children. Brian Herbert ought to kick Anderson out and wing it on his own.-I end my rant with three warnings for Brian Herbert, culled straight from the work of his father, since I am still not convinced he has recently read any of Frank's work:1) Remember what Leto II did to the Nine Historians. You career as a writer is metaphorically threatened by the same fate. 2) &quot;The ability to control a thing is the ability to destroy that thing.&quot; 3) &quot;The sleeper must awaken.&quot;If the original Dune series was a doctoral thesis, _House Atreides_ is a high school book report. Anybody who rates this book above three stars is either out of his mind or a corporate shill for Bantam."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Whoa. There are very few books that I actually quit on; not in the first 20 pages, at least. This book, however, proved to be an exception. Immediatly upon beginning this book I felt as if I were wading through something. Midway through the second chapter, I realized what it was: Anderson (or herbert, whomever) tells, but does not show. Instead of re-creating the events of the story in our minds, the author merely describes them for us, piece by excrutiating piece. The result is a dry, entirely dispassionate narrative. Worse, this dry description continues at an excrutiatingly steady pace and level of detail, with time passing constantly at the exact same speed and all parts of the stroy being described in equal measure.Ultimately, very dissatisfying. If I had to compare the twenty minutes of my life i wasted reading this book to a single other experience, it would probably be either reading the phone book on the first day of summer or eating cardboard.I quit reading after about 20 pages, even after going to the trouble to steal it from my school library. I suggest that you forgo even beginning this book."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"...lacking in the details. This is obviously not by the same author who wrote Dune. Details show a different concept of the Dune universe. The Bene Gesserit seem ludicrously unobservant (using a mechanical incubator with &quot;monitor lights&quot; in their birthing chamber - something a BG acolyte could do much better). &quot;Foldspace&quot; seems to be a place that takes time to cross - more like StarTrek than F.Herbert. The Tleilaxu talk about religion all the time (it isn't the secret of the Dune novels). Thufir Hawat scratches his leg while his hands are clasped behind him (three hands, Thufir?). And this quote of Leto: 'His voice filled the room. &quot;Father, you left large shoes for me to fill.&quot;' - (large voice and large shoes, is he a clown?). Many details of the novels WERE included, but the flaws are obvious and detract from the quality of the story."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I finished reading D:HA a while ago, but in the name of fairness and a level head, decided to wait and mull over the book before I came online and wrote out a scathing review. Anyway, I have taken the time to wait, jot down thoughts and whatnot as the days moved along, seeing how I saw the book as time went past, jostling it around a bit in my mind to see what came out. And here it is.On the outset I would like to state that I have been skeptical, to say the least, about the existence and veracity of the ever talked about notes that Brian and Kevin claim to have found. After reading and mulling over the book, I am forced to reconsider. There are two distinct possibilities; either they do indeed have notes penned by Frank about the DC or they just went through the DC looking for ideas.You see, Franks's ideas are there, albeit rearranged, altered, and distorted. A conglomeration of Dune-ish ideas are mixed and changed into something that 'feels' like Dune but really has just been reduced to be merely a showcase of FH's rejected plot ideas. Configurations, or patterns if you will, of ideas that he felt wouldn't work, weren't fitting of the grand scope of Dune or were too lacking in depth, with interjections of poorly planned and written dialogue and characters far twisted from what this lifelong Dune fan has come to know and love.There are other problems as well:1. Elrood is played to be a doddering old fool, easily manipulated and not befitting a man who has maintained 100+ year of rule over the known universe, way out of character for the character, much like others we know and love/hate. Fenrig, Mohaim, the Bene Teilax, the Bene Gesserit, and others are all altered and changed, some so diametrically opposed so as to preclude them even realistically developing into the characters from FH's Dune.2. Too much is either not left to the reader to find and deduce on his own, explaining in painstaking detail, or not there for the reader to notice at all (i.e. basic character development). Both cases left and still leave me thinking 'don't tell me or make me just guess, show me dammit!'3(or 1 part II). I still want to know why it is made so obvious that the BT are religious zealots in HA and it is such a surprise in HoD and CH:D, as well as why House Atreides would take such risks with their heir apparent. It just doesn't reconcile with the character of these things in FH's Dune.4. And none of this even touches the either FH rejected, or Star Trek borrowed No-Ship anachronism, or even something as basic as the Baron's hair, which will undoubtedly, since it has been pointed out, be conveniently explained in the next book.But I digress. All this goes to say, if BH is the detail man of the two, then he really needs to go and look over his 'details' another time. These errors are inexcusable to people with sharp enough minds to even comprehend and enjoy FH's DC.Bottom Line: House Atreides is at best on par with a fan-fic work; it is almost as if someone is playing 'what-if' (i.e. giving the Hark's a no-ship and seeing what they would do, changing the BT or the BG and seeing what would happen, etc.) with the original Dune works. Marginally, House Atreides tells a story that, while somewhat entertaining, isn't fitting to be called 'Dune.' Dune:House Atreides is a day or two read, suitable a day at the beach or a rainy afternoon, but not much else. What could have saved this book, and at least given it a redeeming quality as a Dune for the pre-teens? New Characters, New plot vehicles, and New Settings, and avoiding using anything that is even mentioned in FH's Dune works."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I have never read Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" so I think that I can write a rewiev from objective point of view. I think that \\"Dune: Houses\\" are excellent books well worth of reading. Herbert and Anderson have (in my humble opinion) done very impressive work in making this unique world functional. There are many multi-layered characthers and many parallel cliffhanger situations which contribute to diynamics of the books. Charachters are realistic and very memorable. I can't wait for our book editors in Croatia to publish original \\"Dune\\". But, untill then I think I'll hold on to this one. Definetely worth of re-reading. I can not even imagine what are original series like when the prequels are so great. Buy it. Read it. Enyoy it!!!!!!Greetings from Cratia!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"No this is not Frank Herbert's Dune. That book was one of the greatest SF books of the century--nothing could compare.Judging this book on its own merits, I loved it! It gave me glimpses into the pasts of characters that intrigued me in Dune. I think the authors did a great job of bringing these historical figures to life. I think this is a very brave and skilled attempt to flesh out the history behind Dune and give us a galaxy-spanning tale of intrigue and adventure while doing it. Read this book and its sequels for FUN. Don't expect deep philosophical discussions, just expect to be entertained."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Honestly, I would have been happy years ago if the great Frank Herbert had ended the Dune Saga with the first novel, DUNE. But since he didn't, and since he passed away before he could really complete his vision, what could be better than this? Herbert and Anderson launched a great prequel trilogy with HOUSE ATREIDES. No, it's not as good as Papa Frank might have written, but it *is* very well written, and it's certainly faithful to the Master's vision. I had a whole lot of fun with this novel, and I'd recommend it to any old Dune fans. In fact, if you haven't yet read the originals, you might start here. What the heck--it *is* a prequel!"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"Now, don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Dune series. And it's great to have more to read. But the book held little edge-of-my-seat excitement like the original series. Because it is set in the past I know the ultimate outcome. It's still interesting and has new secrets and surrprises sure to be appriciated by any Dune fan. The lighter read is also good for people new to the world of the Imperium, who may find Dune a little too involved."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This book has an intrequit plot and a well developed interwoven group of characters. About a monta ago I saw the Dune film and I decided to start with House Atredies (Being the 1st prequil). I read this book pretty fast even though it is around 650 pages. The beginning might start out slow but around page 100 it picks up pace with sabotage, murder, lies and betrayel all across the imperium. I liked the massive inter-house conflicts and the overall complexity of the novel. The only bad part of the novel is the beginning being so slow. This book has encouraged me to read through the ENTIRE series. I would reccomend this book to anyone, no matter if you hate books like this, and especially if you love books like this. Dune House Atredies is a good read all around. Currently I am almost done with Dune House Harkonnen and am awaiting the arrival of Dune House Corrino at my doorstep in a week."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"This is a prequel to the original DUNE Chronicles, unquestionably one of the great science fiction stories of the century. Dune House Atreides is a lively blend of adventure and intrigue woven into a stunning embroidery of the Great Houses of the Emporium. It is set in a time before that of the original Dune novels. The authors take you on a journey from planet to planet, character to character and bring them all together in a lively ending. Dune fans will find the history fascinating and some characters familiar. Newcomers to Dune stories will get a taste of what we all so much enjoyed in the original chronicles.Sparkling descriptions of the environments of very different places and narrative portraits of some penetrating characters will keep your interest. A few of the characters are Elrood IX, ruler of the known universe, Baron Vladimar Harkonnen, Governor of Planet Arrakis, Pardot Kynes, Planetologist, Duke Paulus Atreides, ruler of the planet Caladan, and his son the young Duke Lito. The Baron Vladimar Harkonnen hunts people including a child named Duncan Idaho who eludes him. The young Duke finds himself in charge of his house at an early age. The Emperor Elrood's son Shaddam and his degenerate friend Hasimar Fenring are scheming evil plots. Meanwhile Pardot Kynes is discovering the ecosystems and native culture on Arrakis (a planet also known as Dune).In the mix are the Mentats (humans with computer like minds), the crafty Bene Gesserit witches, and the dirty Tleilaxu. The Spacing Guild has a monopoly on space travel. The CHOAM is a commercial organization controlling the all important spice melange (noted mainly for its geriatric qualities).Plots within plots, dark secrets and a few romances kept my interest for all of the 600 or so pages. I found this refreshingly well written and fluid. You will hate the bad guys and love the heroes. This book will leave you wanting more of the same and rumor has it Herbert and Anderson have at least a couple more Dune prequels coming out soon."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"The book was a good introduction to the Dune series. Explanations for characters that Frank Herbet couldn't provide adequately in Dune were given. I enjoyed reading about Barron Harkonnen's demise while sexually assaulting his Bene Gesserite breeding partner. The Ix story was good but one of the characters was left stranded, we are to assume that the evil Bene Txeileau did away with him. The Fenrig and Shaddam story provided some useful insite into the story that was never fully pursued by Herbert's father in the original. Overall I liked the story but felt the ending was a tad weak. I look forward to reading the next book in the prequel series.- Mr. Calm"},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I was skeptical about reading this one due to the number of negative reviews I saw. I am pleased to say I disagree with them. Once I started, I never put this book down throughout an entire weekend. Any book that causes you to stay up late reading it is fine by me. Is it as good as Dune? No. How many books out there are? There are a number of cool refrences to future events, and the development of several familiar faces was done superbly. Count Fenring is my new favorite character: mean, methodical, and no one in his or her right mind will mess with him. Unfortunately, you almost need to read Dune first, or the refrences in this one will not make sense. Either way, its definatly worth the time to check this one out. I only give 4 stars because I feel people give out far too many 5's (and 1's for that matter, nothing in between)."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"I really enjoyed House Atreides -- more than Chapterhouse Dune -- so I don't think the series will suffer in these hands. I did have one problem with the book: the Harkonnen no-field ship attack reeked of Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country. Not to mention that due to the length of time for a fold space trip (supposedly instantly) there wouldn't have been time for the string of events that occured to happen. Other events were predictable, but that didn't detract from my overall enjoyment."},{"Title":"House Atreides","review":"When trudging through the last three books of the Dune series, the only thing that I wished for was the end the of all this philisophical mumbo jumbo. What about the action, character development, and the whole new world presented to us in the first Dune book? Well, this book is everything I wished for and more.Initially, I was a little weary of this book because it was prequel. I later found out that this book exemplifies what a prequel should be. All those great characters, groups, and kingdoms from Dune are in here. It's a great novel in and of itself, but it re-energized my interest in the Dune series as well.This book is very, very, fluid; unlike Frank Herbert's writing style. Also, it's just bursting with action, interesting characters, and very interesting plots and sub-plots. The story of Duncan Idaho is worth the hardcover price alone!If you have read Dune, I highly recommend this book. If you've read the whole series, you MUST read this book."},{"Title":"The Pacific islands","review":"This book is a history of all of the Pacific Islands. Oliver was trained as an anthropologist and lived for an extended period in the region. He draws on both his training and personal knowledge to not only describe the different islands and their groupings, but also to analyze the reasons for their cultural, political, and economic differences.The book is divided into three main sections and an epilogue. In the first section, The Islanders, Oliver recounts the prehistory of the islands, noting their geological origin and development. He also discusses the first settlers of the islands, and how and why anthropologists have grouped them into Melanesians, Polynesians, and Micronesians. In the second section, The Aliens, Oliver turns to the subject of contact with Westerners, taking up explorers, whalers, traders, missionaries, planters, blackbirders, merchants, and miners in turn.The third section, Metamorphosis, is the most extensive. In this section, Oliver identifies strong influences on development in the region, and traces how they have affected the history of each particular island group or island. For example, he notes how the development of a coconut economy was primary in islands such as Western Samoa or the Solomons, while sugar dominated the history of Hawaii and Fiji. Other influences were missionaries (Tonga), Mining (Nauru, New Caledonia), and Bases (American Samoa, Guam). This island-by-island analysis is followed by an epilogue, in which Oliver describes some of the ways in which the islanders and cultures have both lost and gained by their being brought into the international community. The events of World War II are also described briefly, but at the time when the book was originally written, the longer-lasting effects of the war had not yet become clear.For a history book, the text is exceptionally clear and engaging. The analytical approach helps tie in details and makes the overall picture of the broad region much more comprehensible. The text is not footnoted, but at the end of the book, there is an extensive list of primary sources and suggested readings, organized topically. There is also an index."},{"Title":"License To Love (Harlequin Desire)","review":"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER\\"I'M PREGNANT!\\"Steve Saraceni couldn't believe his ears.

Atul through his organization, NeoIT, has played a lead role in shaping the sourcing strategies of global organizations and the book is both thought provoking as well as prescriptive.

The authors share their substantial data and case histories to illuminate each prescription. They address the entire process of offshoring, including country selection, customer models, supplier models, and most importantly, governance models. In particular, they describe the six areas of governance customers need to manage to ensure success: performance, financial, contract, relationship, resource, and operations. My favorite chapter is the total cost of offshoring. Too often, CEOs are mesmerized by the labor cost differentials, but our own research has found that the transaction costs of going offshore can represent 62% of contract value. The authors provide a total costing model of offshore, of which they found that wages are only 42% to 46% of the total costs of offshoring.I recommend this book to any C-level executive, as well as middle managers charged with delivering global sourcing of business and IT services. My MBA students are reading this book for class and just love it. They read Friedman's The World is Flat, which provides an exciting, yet overly-optimistic view of global sourcing. Offshore Nation is a great companion read because it tempers Friedman's unbridled enthusiasm with the reality of delivery.

I had reached the place where the topic of solar deities kept entering my radar. Signs of sun worship popped up in cultures around the world including the West, and it became a game with me to watch for sun worship symbols on products, websites, corporations, tee shirts and especially churches. When Richard Rimes, author of Too Long in the Sun, drew a connection between solar deities and the anti-christ, something clicked with me. This author researched well, and supplies the reader with abundant footnotes to substantiate his claims. The book was just what I needed. Richard Rimes also has a website [...] with short, rather startling video introductions to his DVD series.

I'm not talking about his references, I'm talking about cold-hard third-party data. Facts of History, and believe it or not, facts that the Catholic Church openly admits too. The reason I gave this a 4 star review, instead of 5, is simply because the information comes off a little hard to digest, even for the serious student. I'm also not a huge fan of the many different type-faces and sizes.

We must ask ourselves: is the Lord Jesus Christ's promise that \\"the gates of Hades would not prevail against My Church\\" without power? Indeed, the Ancient Orthodox Faith proclaims His Gospel in spite of the confusion in Protestant circles due to satanic counterfeits (i.e. myths of Tammuz, Sun gods, and Inanni). It's no wonder Protestants are left to their own devices, being without commentaries from His disciples which explain the Gospel. So, they are left to their rational minds, relying on the old Law, instead of a spousal relationship with our Bridegroom, Christ (Eph 5). We are saved FROM the Law according to St. Paul (which was our \\"tutor\\") and now are free in Christ Jesus to obey His gentle commands which fulfill all the OT Law: Love of God and neighbor. The old pagan feasts were \\"crushed\\" and forgotten by the Christian celebrations of the Nativity of Christ, His crucifixion and Resurrection fulfilling Passover. In His human nature, He passed from Death to Life bringing all of us baptized with Him into Paradise. The coming of the Holy Spirit, the \\"earnest\\" (downpayment) of our salvation, brings His joy and peace from Heaven!Our videos (cf Archbishop Lazar and Judith Irene Matta on youtube.com) are an easy way to learn the Gospel and legalisms - to learn how to be free in our loving Savior and Lord Jesus Christ, Who came to set us free from the Law and bring us into His holy paradise on earth. In spite of \\"crusades\\" and other killers from the papal church against the Orthodox Christians, the Faith of the Apostles in Christ lives and ever shall by the miracle grace of the All-Holy Spirit, the true Vicar of Christ on the earth (Jn 15-16)."},{"Title":"Too Long In The Sun","review":"I give this book 3 stars because of the quasi-research the author conducted on the history of sun worship throughout the ages (particularly those that suit his agenda) and because it made me laugh out loud. The author's ability to imbed religious propaganda, zealotry and indignation within a historically pertinent humanities topic is commendable. Those who think this book is eye opening have been hiding behind their hymnbook for too long. The idea the paganism is the foundation for Christianity and most of its holidays is an old, tired topic. What I found most hilarious about this book is that the author calls sun worship (that from ancient times - the societies from which we have built modern day government, society, education and architecture), \\"satanic\\". Satan wasn't invented until the New Testament, so how can this comparison be anything other than pure, uneducated, bigoted bias? The Church doesn't care if you read this, they already know it - the current Pope has openly acknowledged some of it (read the news). What I would have liked is for the author to go further and detail more about sun worship in Christian (Catholic) idolatry. Take, for instance, the halo. Or the pope's monstrance. Or the wafer. Heck, if he wanted to really show how those \\"satanic\\" sun/son worshipers have infiltrated Christianity, he could have mentioned the letters S, F, S found on some of the monstrances. According to those who study pagan mysteries, those letters correspond to the number 6. Do you follow me here? If one is so riled by the origins of one's religion, perhaps it is time to examine the foundation of one's faith. You should believe in anything without picking it apart or degrading the beliefs of others. For those of you who wish to research the credibility of an author before buying into whatever he is trying to persuade you to believe (or to be incensed by), you should consider researching Rives. It makes this book even more fun to read. This is a great book if you have an open mind and enjoy way out in space (no pun intended) nonsense ranting presented under the guise of \\"enlightenment\\"."},{"Title":"How To Be A Consistent Winner in The Most Popular Card Games","review":"I know his daughter and play trivia with her on Starchat on MSN...Trivia-Central She goes by the handle \\"BisqueQueen\\" Very nice lady and fun to play trivia with.

She moves on to providing a menu for 7 days for each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, plus snacks and drinks). For example, in the breakfast section, there are 7 days' worth of breakfast meals, and then in the lunch section, there are 7 days' worth of lunch meals, etc. In other words, there are a lot of recipes in this small volume!Each chapter comes with Elysa's advice and info about each meal, and then with each recipe comes instructions on preparing the next day's meal (for example, if soaking is required you know about it beforehand so that you can be prepared for the next day's meals).Each recipe comes with an approximation of how long it takes to prepare (and aside from time soaking seeds or dehydrating something, preparation tends to be very simple and quick). Many of the recipes do require at the least a blender or food processor (and electric skillet for warming, if desired--or just use a pan on the stove!). But Elysa also includes &quot;machine options,&quot; with other choices to use such as a Vita-Mix or a homogenizing juicer, etc. However, you don't necessarily need advanced kitchen equipment. The dehydrator may be the most advanced equipment you would need, but again, there is the option not to dehydrate, or it is suggested you use the oven on its lowest setting, or the sun. I would think most people would already have the minimal equipment needed, other than a dehydrator and juicer (which is necessary to make some of the juiced drinks, of course).In addition to &quot;machine options,&quot; there are also &quot;ingredient options&quot; with variations on the theme, and there are &quot;warming options,&quot; which suggest ways to warm the foods at a low enough temperature in order to preserve the enzymes and nutrients. The fact that the recipes are made to be eaten either warmed or not I think is great. Some of us interested in raw foods (and possibly even those who are very committed) may want a warm living foods meal sometimes. This book offers just that.As if this book didn't already offer so much, there are also several color photographs of the finished recipes that will surely make your mouth water.Overall, I have found this book to be a very helpful resource of recipes and information about living foods. The friendly tone, encouragement, and &quot;options&quot; have made the book very user-friendly. The &quot;next day preparation&quot; information for the next day's meals has been invaluable and a real help for someone who has a hard time organizing a week's meals which require soaking, sprouting, or dehydrating.The recipes themselves are very interesting. The ones I have sampled have been wonderful. Some examples of the recipes are: &quot;Scrambled Corn w/ veggie chips &amp; salsa 'verde'&quot;, sprouted cereal, soups, salads, loafs, &quot;eggplant pizza&quot;, &quot;cauliflower casserole&quot;, pates, &quot;unbaked beans,&quot; &quot;strawberry cream pie,&quot; &quot;ricotta 'cheese' spread with veggie 'chips'.&quot; Lots of fun stuff!I recommend this book to all those who need/want to &quot;warm up&quot; to living foods."},{"Title":"Warming Up to Living Foods","review":"If you are just getting started in raw food, this is the book for you. The recipies are simple, and you will love the taste of Markowitz/Cousin's food.

I highly recommend it, especially for beginners. (...)"},{"Title":"Warming Up to Living Foods","review":"This book is for those of you who have decided to switch to an all living foods diet.

For this reason, the raw foods dabbler may want to start with another cookbook."},{"Title":"Warming Up to Living Foods","review":"I found that most of the recipes in this book were either mildly &quot;gross&quot;, in lack of better words, or they need some work to be better organized. I suppose this book could be considered a semi-introduction to living foods. However, I bought this book in combination with the rainbow green live food cuisine book and found the latter not only tastier and healthy but also easier. I recommend that book if you're looking for a well rounded introduction and eventual follow through to raw food.

I had to read it for a book club and if I had the choice I'd have put it down after just a few pages. I muttered and rolled my eyes just to get through it.

I think these books are great for anyone at any age. I am 20 and I love them. My mom read this side of heaven so while shopping for a new book to read I chose ocean's apart recognizing the author.

I would recommend this book to everyone, it is moving!"},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"I have read several books by her, and I have found that I like her stand alone books the best. Her series get too bogged down with the number of characters and reminders of what happened previously.

I read it in about 3 hours one evening. It will definitely make any married person, or anyone planning to marry think about their relationship. I loved Max, he was such a cute little boy. I also felt quite a bit for Michele. I won't spoil the ending, but it's a tearjerker in classic Karen Kingsbury style."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Oceans Apart was wonderful--well done blend between mistake, responsibility, emotion, forgiveness and second chances."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Karen Kingsbury has outdone herself again! This book drew me in from the beginning. It had me crying for poor Max and pulling for him from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"While it was certainly pulled at the heartstrings and was enjoyable in parts, overall the tone of the book turned me off. The little boy character was like a symbol - too perfect - not like a real child at all. The wife character was unlikeable and unforgiving for 99% of the story. The story's treatment of the orphaned boy character, about how he was just some terrible mistake, and the fact that the characters even considered sending him away, unacknowledged, was a little repellent to me."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This book is very heartwarming and inspirational. As with all Karen Kingsbury books, you come to have a deeper understanding of the far reaching consequences of wrong choices and then ultimately the peace and joy that come when a person makes the right choices for their life. I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy of Ocean's Apart from Karen and Zondervan. When I finished I was ready for another KK book. I called my local Christian bookstore, located in a large church, to ask if they had a copy of the latest release in the fantastic Redemption series. The clerk said \\"yes, and others had been asking\\" but she wasn't familiar with Karen's books and wanted to know if they were really good. I brought her my copy of Ocean's Apart and apparently she loved it because the next time I went into the store, I saw 15 copies stacked under a poster announcing their book club. Ocean's Apart was chosen as their \\"Book of the Month\\" for the Club. I can't wait for the book club meeting at the end of this month."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Remember the movie \\"Ever After\\"? The beginning where the sweet old lady says: \\"How does it start? Oh yes, once upon a time....\\". It reminds me of Karen Kingsbury. She really should add a disclaimer at the beginning of her books stating it'll start off realistically & interesting, then somehow veer off into Fairytale Land where \\"once upon a time\\" turns into \\"happily ever after\\" no matter how ridiculous or outlandish the situation. In her world it never really storms- just a light rain. She never really has deep wounds- instead little cuts that can be covered quickly with a pink Band Aid. Unfortunately, I love storms, and I think our deepest wounds are what lead to thicker skin...and yes, scars.Never in my life have I heard of something so crazy as basically taking a little over 2 weeks (!!!) to get over the shock of finding out your husband has cheated with the end result of a child (of course it has to be a son, because they already had 2 girls...I mean, it would be much easier to walk away if it was a girl, right??). Blech. I have a hard enough time changing my grocery shopping days, so for me trying to understand how someone moves that quickly from betrayal to their perfect fairytale life so quickly is just not going to happen. I completely believe that Jesus is always there for us and will heal us...but apparently Ms. Kingsbury is trying to strictly reach people who still believe in the Easter Bunny, because this was mostly fluff. Sadly, the only realistic and redeeming quality of this book was how depressing the little boy's POV was. For me, it was the only part of this book that could actually happen. Just once I'd like to read a story from her that didn't end with swingsets, puppy dogs, and ice cream. Ugh."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Yes this book is predictable, and yes it's fluffy, but if that is what you're after, this is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This book is outstanding! Kingsbury does an excellent job of capturing real human emotions. She is not afraid to create flawed characters with real emotions who are dealing with a heart wrenching situation. It was very easy to relate to the characters and to feel what they were feeling. Many Christian authors stick with fluffy topics and create too perfect characters. I commend Kingsbury for tackling difficult topics and for creating a story that will hook readers and make them think. This book will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Kiahna Siefert and Connor Evans had a brief affair that ended as quickly as it had started. Now eight years later there is a plane crash and Kiahna's will asks that Connor be found, and her young son to be with the father that he did not even know existed.Connor has regretted that one night and never even told his wife about it. Now his marriage is stronger then ever. When the Lawyer calls him with a proposition of a two-week visit with Max, Connors world is flipped upside down. Will he lose the wife that he adores or will he have to give up the son he always wanted?Oceans Apart is a heart-wrenching story that starts out with a terrible tragedy and grips you from the first pages and does not fail to keep you wondering how it would end until the last pages. Max is such a doll of a character; you cannot help but fall in love with him and his simple trusting love of God. Oceans Apart is another winner in Karen Kingbsbury's long list of must read books.Torireviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"I have to say this book was only okay. It started off good. Some good characters and some interesting life changing experiences to deal with. Probably one of my favorite characters was the little boy named Max. He was sweet, innocent and just plain adorable. You can probably guess how the book ended and I am not saying it was a bad ending I mean it ended the way I wanted it to end.

Wonderful story of forgiveness, Love, and focusing on God's plan and not our own!"},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This book was fantastic, very emotional . It's about forgiveness and second chances. The characters were very well developed and realistic. Seven year old Max had more Faith in the power of prayer than most adults that I know. Michele reminds me of someone that I used to know that was in a similar situation; only it did not take her as long as it took Michele to forgive her spouse, because she was a true Christian woman. This does not mean that she felt any less pain than Michele. I don't like to give away the story, you'll just have to read it. This is the first time I have ever heard of this author, but I do know that I will be reading more of her books."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Oceans Apart by Karen KingsburyI am pretty sure this was my first Karen Kingsbury book (goodness, what took me so long?!?!)And I have to admit, she lives up to everything great I have heard about her writing.I ended up listening to an audio recording of this book. Everytime I got in my car to run errands I would listen to this book and surprisingly got through it really quickly. : Guess it shows I spend a LOT of time in my car).But, I also discovered that while baking pies (my newest hobby) it's great to listen to an audiobook! Very peaceful and relaxing. I will be doing this much more!Anyway, Oceans Apart is the story of Connor Evans and his wife Michele, and their two daughters. They are a happy family, and he and Michele share a deep relationship that many couples can only dream of.But one day, with one phone call, both of their lives are turned upside-down. Connor gets a phone call from an attorney in Honolulu, which is really random considering he lives in Florida. And the news is staggering: the woman he had an affair with 8 years before has died in a plane crash, and she left behind a son, their son. Her last request is that he have their son, Max, come stay with him for 2 weeks during which he is not told that Connor is his dad. Then at the end of the 2 weeks Connor has two choices: adopt Max and tell him the truth, or not adopt Max, do not tell him the truth and never contact him again.Michele is devastated. How could Connor do this to her? What was wrong with her that caused him to lust after another woman? Was it her weight? The fact she'd put on 30 pounds since their marriage? Is she just not enough for Connor as she thought she had been all these years? Was this the only time he strayed?Connor is full of excitement at meeting his son. The son he always wanted, but Michele is falling apart. While Connor takes his son and daughters on a camping trip, Michele cannot face the possibility of spending an entire week watching Max bond with Connor so she goes to California to see her sister, and to make a tough decision: stay with Connor? Or leave him, brokenhearted?And Connor has his own tough decision to make: Max or Michele? It's clear he cannot keep Max and have Michele, so which will he pick, his wife or his son?Read Oceans Apart to find out!I won't lie to you, this story is heart-wrenching and tear-jerking at many points. Tissues might be a necessity for quite a few. Especially when Max gets the news of his mother's death. He's only 7 and he just cannot understand how his mommy is gone and with Jesus but he cannot be there with her and Jesus too...This book is a great look at just how devastating an affair is to a marriage. Even if it only happened once. Even if it was 8 years ago. Time doesn't really soften the blow, especially if the affair was covered up for 8 years. Had Connor come clean right after it happened, they would have had 8 years to be recovering from his bad decision, but since he lied to her and omitted the truth for 8 years Michele has to face both adultery and lies.It is also a story about how keeping dark secrets can pull you away from a firm relationship with Christ, and even though you consider yourself \\"Christian\\" hiding such dark secrets causes a block that erodes a real relationship with God.I highly recommend this book to anyone. It's so well-written down to the descriptions that Karen Kingsbury writes. It was so easy to picture the mannerisms and facial expressions of each character with all the detail she went into.And of course, my heart broke for Max. To go through so much, to lose his mother and be unsure about what his future held. To want nothing more than to meet his real dad, but having no way to do so, and to have no choice in his own future... It made me want to cry and hug him. Such a sweet boy, and so resilient considering what he is going through.And lastly, I adored the relationship Max had with his best friend, and dog, Buddy. I totally understand the deep relationship that one can have with their pets, and to see Max at risk of losing his relationship with Buddy, the only stable thing in his life after his mom's death ate away at my heart.This really is a must-read.5 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"I started this book sitting on an airplane ready to take off for Hawaii, after 2 or 3 pages, I decided no this is not what I want to read now.

At times, it completely crosses into the unbelievable. Examples:1. 7 year old boy told he is going to stay with Mommy's friend but also told his father is out there somewhere...and doesn't connect the dots? Come on people, 7 year olds are smarter than that...especially when we are led to believe Max is a smart kid. How many times does he have to say \\"Mr. Evans, I wishest you were my real dad\\" before the light bulb goes off? Kids aren't stupid...and neither are readers.2. We are given THE most unrealistic infidelity scene in the history of storytelling. Two innocent characters struck by some supposed \\"true\\" love (although both content to never speak to each other again), the man is interrupted THREE separate (and comically impossible) times trying to say he is married (give me a break), every possible act of nature occurs to cause a co-sleeping situation (spare us), and then somehow the two conceive a child (I can't even compute the odds of both this created character deciding against using protection AND a first time and only encounter resulting in pregnancy).3. Father and son completely fracture their relationship because the father has TOO much money and is unwilling to LEND it to his son? People, this is not how life works. Complete Parent-Child fractures are rare as it is, let alone created over a simple disagreement over making a loan. You want this to be believable, have the father re-marry a younger woman the same age as the son and lavish her with the son's future inheritence.If you are into predictable and unrealistic Lifetime movies, then this book is for you. The author apparently runs out of adjectives and verbs after a few chapters and as a result, characters generally only \\"nod\\" and \\"bite their lip\\" to show emotion."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This was a great book.

However, it's good to do things you don't usually do sometimes. Variety is the spice of life.

But I enjoyed this story and wouldn't mind reading more from this author."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"He only slipped up once in his marriage vows and his commitment to living the Christian way, but it only took one night of giving into loneliness and temptation to give Connor Evans a son that he does not know about until the boy's mother is killed in a plane crash. When lawyers contact him to inform him of the sad news and the decision he now faces, Connor must confess to cheating to his wife, Michele. Though she attempts to cope, Michele is rocked and believes her entire marriage to be stained by lies. Even as Conner and his son, Max grow closer and their daughters begin to accept him as a friend, even though they do not know the whole truth, Michele struggles with the entire situation. Has Conner gained a son to lose a marriage? What is the path God would have them take?***** This is a book that will shake you up; Ms. Kingsbury, as usual, pulls you into the narrative and wires you into the characters' emotions. Max's simple faith, Michele's hurt reaction to being betrayed, and Conner having to face the results of his sin will all feel as real as the nose on your face. Once again, a strong Christian message is presented, but not in a wimpy way, like so many \\"inspirational\\" novels tend to do. The characters are beautifully realized with all their flaws and heartaches. Even more clear though, is God's ability to make miracles out of messes. *****Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews"},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This book was wonderful, as with all of Kingbury's books.

The tragedy is borderline unbearable. This book has a nice ending, and takes you through the struggle of infidelity, but the emotion is so raw, and the characters, especially that of the little boy, were a little too unbelieveable. I don't know if I'd be willing to give this author another shot or not, and I am an avid reader of Christian fiction. Should've gotten it from the library.Aimee"},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"The back of the cover made it sound interesting, but at first I thought to myself, there's no way the family can fix itself after this. Basically, a airline pilot, Connor, has a one night stand with a hawaiian stewardess during a snowstorm, goes home, and tries to forget about it, never telling his wife and two daughters. But he's not that lucky. Eight years later, Connor gets a phone call. Kiahna, the stewardess, has died in a plane crash- and her will states that before he's put in foster care, her son must meet his father. Connor brings the boy into his home- and the family falls apart.My heart went out to both Kiahna, who didn't know Connor was married and who dreamed of becoming a doctor before she got pregnant with Max, and Michele, Connor's wife, who is heartbroken by her husband's infedility. Most of all my heart broke for Max, who doesn't understand what's going on around him, and who just wants to find his daddy.My only problems with the book are that some of it was slightly unbelievable. After a snowstorm, Kiahna offers Connor her couch for the night, and he conviently doesn't tell her he's married until after they have sex. (Your average man.) I didn't really buy Connor's excuse for sleeping with Kiahna, since he's so in love with Michele: he rolls over in the morning and grabs Kiahna, thinking she's Michele: yeah, right. And Michele's choice on what to do about Max- while it makes the reader happy, it's just a little too happy to not be corny.Despite its flaws, however, this is a good book, and its message, sprinkled throughout the book in bible passages, make it more than just a great read. I recomend it to anybody, even me, who ususally doesn't go for inspirational fiction."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel and could relate to the reactions and feelings of the characters.

Conner and Michele Evans have the perfect marriage and the perfect daughters but what causes Connor to have the affair and the whole affair just does't seem real to me. The only parts of the book I loved were the parts with Max the son that Connor fathered. I loved the little boy and could not understand how Michelle could not fall in love with that little boy.

What a wonderful book about forgiveness and not giving up! Karen Kingsbury is an amazing writer!"},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Just when we think we have our past all neatly bundled in a forgotten little knot, and just when we think we can handle things on our own without the help of God, things start to unravel and the cost of poor judgement and past sins come to find us. Thus is the case with Conner Evans. But just when you have come to the end of yourself and your shame and guilt are ready to consume you, then comes the second chance and God's mercy and loving kindness to turn the situation around.Ocean's Apart is a gripping story of not only forgiveness and second chances, but the consequences of our decisions on our lives and the lives of those involved. It shows the depth of God's love for each individual that is affected by the situation and gives a glimpse of His mercy in ways we cannot fathom. It also reveals how much we need to center our lives around our Savior, putting Him first place in our lives, keeping Him and His word before us every day; and being able to let the love of God shine through us."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Wow!

You can't go wrong with a sweet little boy and his dog."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This was my first Karen Kingsbury novel, and I was expecting its underlying Christian message, but not done quite so heavy-handedly. You could tell how it was all going to end from the moment the boy loses his mom.The characters are almost cardboard cutouts the way they deal with the situation, Connor the nave husband who made a real mistake, as we discover in the course of the book, the virtuous fallen woman who loved the son that the series of mistakes creates, and the wife Michelle who has to deal with the consequences, and comes to see that yes, it was her fault that he strayed.....Well, not quite, but it was almost going there, which does women a disservice. She was fat, had postpartum depression.... And so on. She comes over as very unsympathetic on a lot of levels, and though eventually redeems herself, I am not so sure it was fair of the author to portray her in that manner. I loved the son and his dog, both too perfect for words, but the daughters' reactions were unbelievable, IMHO, and the adoptive couple were just too clich&eacute; for words.In the end it is a feel-good book, with a positive message, but anyone looking for any depth will be disappointed. It all got tied up nicely with a big red bow, but unfortunately, real life is seldom like that. So if you are looking for an 'escape' read, this is way too full of harsh emotions. If you are looking for a fairy tale, ditto. It sort of falls in between the two, as a solid, worthy, but uneven, average book to help pass the time."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This book was unrealistic. The adultery portrayed in this book was exposed, forgiven and then given a happy ending in what seemed like weeks. Poor story line."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"After enjoying other books by this author, I decided to give Oceans Apart a try. In the end, all it did was take up time that I could have spent on other books. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.A significant portion of the writing was from the 7-year-old child's perspective. I couldn't stand it when the viewpoint shifted to him. It was just painful to read his thought process and about \\"butterfly days.\\" His character didn't come alive to me. I also didn't enjoy the character of the wife. She was exceedingly shallow, in the sense that her character was not well-developed. Understandably, she was upset by learning her husband had an affair years ago, but what the author \\"told\\" me about her character didn't jive with how she acted. I didn't find her actions believable, and I didn't enjoy the writing from her perspective either.The plot was predictable. You knew right where it was going to end up. I don't necessarily mind this if the path there is enjoyable, but it wasn't this time. Even if it required an unbelievable about face, the happy ending was going to come.I would not recommend this book. It kills a few hours, but any book can do that. I would instead recommend the author'sUnlockedwhich I gave a 5-star rating orA Time to Embrace (Timeless Love Series), which I gave 4-stars. I am not sure if I will check out any further books by this author, as I'm only 2 for 4 in rating 4 stars or better."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This sounds exactly like the award winning film titled MASOOM (means INNOCENT) produced in India in 1983.

I found myself really loving the Hawaii characters, Kiahna, Max and Buddy and Ramey. They were my kind of people, sweet hearted and just a genuine family.For me Max's journey is what makes this story so touching. A little boy of 7 suddenly finding himself all alone in the world. His faith was strong for a young boy, reading his Bible every day and praying, getting feelings from God. I loved it. Also, Max's phrase-ology was too cute...things like 'heart beeps' and ruffel bags had me smiling and tearing up some.I did not like Michele Evans at all. She was so full of poison for almost the entire book, even going so far as to be mean to Max. I understand why Karen wrote the story the way she did, I just wasn't drawn to evil, unforgiving Michele at all, which I guess is the point. She didn't really grow on me until the very end of the book when the ending makes you bawl your eyes out.Strong 4.5!"},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"I have never had a negative exoerience with Amazon.

He went back to his story book wedding while she was alone. There was a hint to a future romance but she really didn't love that guy. When he advised her to let herself love again, I wanted to gag. I really thought the whole thing unfair to her. This book (Oceans Apart) though was much better. The guy commits adultery yes, but in no way did he get away with it. Having to chose between his wife and the son he fathered in his adultery was really a story that held my interest. I liked the way it ended and his wife, Michelle turned out to be a very special lady yet she wasn't expected to forgive overnight without working through things. So many authors teach forgiveness in their books but do not give the characters time to work through things. Adultery can't be forgiven overnight. Karen realistically brings out love and forgiveness without glorifying the sin. If I could title this story it would be, \\"Be sure your sins will find you out.\\" No one wins in an affair and not once was the affair justified. I give it 5 stars. I read it in one evening, it was that good."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Karen Kingsbury has done it again! This story of love and forgiveness is a powerful testimony to what God can do when people allow Him to do His work in the heart. I don't usually cry while reading a book, but I must have been a sight walking on my treadmill while reading my Kindle with tears running down my cheeks as I finished this book! I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good love story! Karen never disappoints."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"A tear jerker as always.

Now Max is alone in the world and he needs a family. But is the Evans family it?This was the first book that I read by Karen Kingsbury and I really enjoyed it. Ms. Kingsbury gave real emotions to her characters. She also showed about faith and forgiveness and how it is important to ones life. Overall, I would be interested in reading more from Karen Kingsbury."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"I have good news for readers who are Karen Kingsbury fans, and even better news for readers who are not: this is far and away the best novel I've read by this bestselling author of something like 30 books. It's a powerful story of forgiveness, reconciliation and grace, wrapped up in a genuine page-turner. And if you've never read Kingsbury before, this is the one to start with.The promotional material from Zondervan, including the synopsis on the back cover, refers to the \\"perfect\\" life of airline captain Connor Evans and his wife, Michele, and their two daughters. Frankly, that word is an immediate turn-off for me; it implies shallow, stereotyped characters, an overdone scenario, and unimaginative writing. If I hadn't been assigned to read this book, I probably would have ignored it.The Evanses may have a decent and privileged life, but it's not a perfect life, the kind populated with cardboard characters. These are real people who happen to have it pretty good until an airline crash in the Pacific shakes things up for them in Florida. That's when Connor discovers that an indiscretion years earlier resulted in more than a good time. He has a son, and he has a choice: forget about him and pretend the one-night stand with the boy's mother never happened, or come clean with his wife, meet his son, Max, for the first time, and make Max a part of their family, at least temporarily.One of the elements that sets this book apart is the light hand the author uses throughout. She skillfully weaves in the faith message and allows the story to unfold naturally. It's not until late in the book that we learn the circumstances that led to Connor's unfaithfulness; it would have been so easy, and ultimately so unsatisfying to the reader, to place those scenes early on in the book in an effort to simply get them out of the way. Nothing about OCEANS APART feels \\"wrong\\"; even the Florida setting rings true, which isn't always the case in the hands of non-native writers.The forgiveness theme in particular never feels forced or superficial. So much forgiveness is needed on so many levels, and Kingsbury lets the process that leads to forgiveness develop over time. Equally impressive is the way she handles the theme of \\"second chances,\\" and not just with regard to the obvious second chance that Connor needs. All of this reflects a multilayered effort on the author's part, and one that she carries off well.Readers who have found some of Kingsbury's plots to be implausible --- ONE TUESDAY MORNING and its sequel, BEYOND TUESDAY MORNING, come to mind --- should be pleasantly surprised with the achingly realistic story line in OCEANS APART. And the characters --- you just may find yourself loving Max and respecting each of the major characters, along with the decisions they end up making.OCEANS APART won the ECPA Gold Medallion Award for fiction, which means it was selected as the best novel of 2004 by both retailers and a panel of independent judges. It's certainly the best, or among the best, from Kingsbury, and the accolades it has received should encourage her to maintain the higher standard she set for herself with this book."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Kingsbury makes you think about how you would react about life situations. After reading one of her books, you put your faith and beliefs in check. As with all of her books, I leave several tear soaked pages and pass them on to my daughters to read, who in turn pass them on to their friends, who pass them on to their mothers!! It's a great way to share God's love."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"I usually like Karen Kingsbury books but this was just too much. The characters were so unreal. The seven year old boy was perfect. Totally unlike a normal seven year old especially going through the loss of his mother.The book was way too mushy for my taste. It was also too predictable. An affair in a marriage is devastating. Not something that can be fixed in a few weeks.The other thing that really bothered me what the way she wrote when the boy was talking. I really didn't like the little kid talk she wrote in. Everything was \\"my mommy\\"... or some mispronounced word. It was kind of like reading Junie B Jones.I did not like this book."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Karen Kingsbury continues her string of amazing writings with Oceans Apart. Once again, I couldn't put this book down, and my husband was amazed at how fast I read. Secrets can destroy anyone, and it almost happens here. God's grace and love are personified in Oceans Apart. Max is so innocent and wise, and everyone will learn from his trusting heart. Kiahna's plans for her son may tear apart a family, yet God intervened. Have that comfy chair and box of tissues once again as you read and appreciate the gift that God has given Karen Kingsbury."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This was the second book that I have read by Karen Kingsbury, and I gladly admit that she is the best writer when it comes to real life issues. My husband laughed when I cried endlessly while reading this (he hates reading ficiton), but little did he know how incredibly real it seemed. Somehow Kingsbury always creates such unending depth in her characters and their stories, that I can't but stand in awe of the gift God has given her for writing. What an incredible ministry. Thank you Karen Kingsbury."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"There is so much foreshadowing in this book you'll know how it ends if within the first few chapters. This book posses no twist or turns. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is cheesy, and the book is filled with preachy undertones. I suppose I should have done more research before purchasing the book, and I would have known better, but I was expecting more \\"literature\\" but found it to be \\"chick-lit\\".I won't be purcahsing any more Kingsbury's novels.On a positive note, it is a quick-read."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"As the wife of an airline pilot, I was a little unsure if I wanted to read this book. Just like I don't care to read books about airplane crashes. But I began reading and couldn't stop. Although the pilot's affair isn't justified, you can see where the marriage had trouble.The book reinforces the fact that a woman needs to pay attention to her husband. A woman who treats her husband with the respect she gave him while they were dating should never fear him wandering.If I was the wife of the Connor, I would like to think I would have forgiven him. With God all things are possible.This is a terrific book about marriage, forgiveness, and returning to God."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"This book is about an airline pilot, Connor, who seems to have it all, but then a secret from the past comes back to confronthim. Connor and his wife, then struggle to put together their marriage, and has a very important decision to make.Kingsbury is not afraid to deal with difficult issues. In this case, she writes about Connor's one-night stand and about theson that results from that. The feelings that Michelle felt upon finding out came out so good in this book--the anger andthe hurt. The book deals a lot with forgiveness. Michelle ends up forgiving, but also, she puts a child's welfare ahead ofher own hurt feelings and makes a big sacrifice for her husband, which I really admire her for. And she falls in love with the boy, too. And Kingsbury does a greatjob of promoting the idea that the marriage relationship is such a significant relationship.I love Karen Kingsbury. She is one of my favorite authors. I hope to read more books by her."},{"Title":"Oceans Apart","review":"Once again Karen Kingsbury delivers a wonderful story of real life with heartache and joy. She gives you insight into the destruction of an affair and how easy it is to fall into one if you do not heed the Spirit's warning. Since I am an avid reader of Christian fiction, I can usually predict the ending and not get emotionally involved, but with this book I was guessing until the end and it made me cry THREE times...that has to be some record.

I have lived in Mexico, was raised in New Mexico, am very fluent in Spanish, and am part Cherokee. This helps me evaluate the degree to which Azuela grasps the sentiments of the characters he portrays. In my opinion, he does a masterful job on all levels. Even the relative simplicity with which he describes historical and social factors communicates authenticity, in that intelligent but uneducated peasants such as Demetrio did not comprehend the sociological complexity that underlay the Revolution.This is a novel that so deeply moved me that I still recall its last sentence even though I last saw it twenty years ago: \\"Y Demetrio Mac&iacute;as, sus ojos fijos para siempre, sigue apuntando por el ca&ntilde;on de su fusil.\\" This, in sum, is a very memorable novel."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"More than a review this is a comment to those who wrote reviews before me.First of all, this is NOT a history book. If you're interested in learning about the Mexican Revolution pick up a history book.Second of all, you didn't get the point. It's not about the life of rural Mexico, or how people lived, or how they lost their ideals. It's about joining &quot;la bola&quot; the mass of people fighting for no particular reason. The &quot;campesinos&quot; didn't really join the fight because they believed they were getting land and freedom, they joined because they believed in their leaders, joining the fight for the love of their &quot;jefe&quot; or simply to join &quot;la bola&quot;.I'm sure many of you will disagree with me, and I'm sure there were exceptions to what I'm saying, but I'm only commenting on what Mariano Azuela was trying to get across; don't forget, Azuela fought in the war."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"Among the earliest editions of this important, objective, journalistic, anti-war novel, which thus speaks much to our brutal and lethal presence in Iraq, is that presented by Englekirk and Kiddle around 1940, again in 1971 (the edition which I have) and again twenty years later.Englekirk prepares us for understanding the historical context and significance with a forty page biography of the author, Dr. Mariano Azuela, who as well as writer served his long life as a doctor, providing free medical care to the poor in fulfilling his lifelong ideals. Five more pages present the Mexican revolution of 1910, and twenty additional pages are dedicated to discussing the language read in Los de abajo, the dialect of the poor campesinos of the northern and western area of Mexico, a Spanish which is not Castilian. A bibliography of works by the author follows, as well as a listing of critical studies.An over fifty page glossary completes this very comprehensive volume, which has often and long been used in teaching Spanish as a second language to high school students. We realize of course the better way to teach students a second language would be for them to trace the author's footsteps for a few years in Mexico and thus to hear and to speak only this language for their very survival and comfort, but this text offers a distant substitute which might put too many pupils to sleep but nevertheless tantalizes with the promise of vivid tales of adventure and of ideals.The two editors note the early phenomenon in second language education of expurgating texts which were deemed \\"overly realistic\\" and remark in the preface: \\"This excessively protective attitude on the part of both editors and publishers amounted to a form of censorship. Such a procedure is highly out of place today. Our present edition of 'Los de abajo' is, therefore, the complete text of Azuela's novel (p. vii).\\"We perhaps have returned to an \\"excessively protective attitude\\" in our schools, watchful for liability and offending parents, and despite the easy availability to our youth outside of school, in fact in the home, of material far more offensive. Perhaps the earthiness of this novel would find censure by certain school boards, which fortunately do not read, and which do not normally read Spanish. Perhaps this novel could also find accusations of Marxism, accusations which have never been inhibited by the utter lack of any evidence. Nevertheless, it is a great novel for our children to read, and an important novel for us all to read.Several other editions are easily available, and an early if shortened filming as well (Los de Abajo), but certainly this edition with the certain guidance and assistance from Englekirk and Kiddle renders this great novel most comprehensible to the US reader unfamiliar with the history and language of western Mexico.Highly recommended not only for the history and language lessons, but above all for the universal lessons of the destructiveness of war, that war cannot create peace and social development, that war only destroys, including its most unfortunate survivors. This is the most important lesson for us now. Read the book."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"Azuela nos muestra un escenario naturalista de lo que fue la Revolucion Mexicana.

Es un libro, que como mexicano, hay que leer.Recomiendo que los interesados en la Revoluci&oacute;n Mexicana lean los libros de historia y las novelas revolucionarias, porque s&oacute;lo as&iacute; se podr&aacute;n identificar con lo que sucedi&oacute; y con las motivaciones de las diferentes partes."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"Los de abajo is a great read for anyone interested in the Mexican Revolution. It's characters are deep and it is known as THE novel of the mexican revolution. It's also interesting from a linguistic viewpoint, with it's presentation of both the vernacular and erudite tongues of the early 20th century Mexican populace, somewhat akin to the way that Faulkner captured the vernacular of the (North) American South."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"This story about the Mexican Revolution is written in a very creative Spanish style. The theme is centered around the fights of the Revolutionaries as they travel throughout Mexico. It is very bloody, grusome, and brutal, but apparentaly very true to history in that sense. It is medium to advanced Spanish level reading but a very good piece of literature."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"Me gust&oacute; mucho este libro. Soy estudiante estadosunidense y lo le&iacute; para entender mejor la Revoluci&oacute;n del punto de vista del pueblo mexicano. No solamente muestra la vida diaria de los revolucionarios, sino tambi&eacute;n se escribe con im&aacute;genes bonitas y intensas. El &uacute;nico problema que tuve yo fue las palabras del dialecto de los campesinos."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is quite a good Spanish-language novel about how war changes people.The characters, simple hill folk, are slowly but surely sucked up into the Mexican civil war rapidly becoming more and more callous toward the very people they are supposed to be representing.They become the stuff of legend but along the way they betray every one of their ideals, falling in with murderous and deranged fellow-travellers until they finally become practically undistinguishable from the Federales they have set out to defeat.&quot;Los De Abajo&quot; is rather vague on historical detail and there is practically no attempt to show the reader &quot;the big picture&quot; or the background to the war, but in a way, this doesn't really matter. This is a book about ALL wars. The powerful live off the powerless and the poor are murdered and downtrodden no matter who is in power.It SOUNDS like a pretty good read, and it is. The only problem I have with this book is that I'd already read &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; where the subject of war and the way it corrupts is given a much better treatment.On the positive side, where &quot;One Hundred Years&quot; is concerned with the one character, &quot;Los De Abajo&quot; has a lot more &quot;vignettes&quot; showing the common people and their attitude toward the civil war. The writer also has a good ear for dialogue (although at times, the poorer characters are a bit hard to understand). The descriptions of the revolutionary armies, gaudy, barbaric and bloodthirsty but so very much alive are also quite good.All in all, &quot;Los De Abajo&quot; is a good if somewhat bitter and depressing book which could have been better, but it's still well worth reading."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"I read this book at Thundird Graduate school while taking Spanish. It is a wonderful but dificult book to read in Spanish, due to the vocabulary and slang used through out the book. It does how ever give you a taste if the suffering of the indiginous population during that period. It is a wonder that having lived in mexico for 4 years and traveled trough many rural 'pueblitos' that life has not really changed for indiginous population. Actually there are 128 different languages spoken in the country.I had decided to read it since my father in law was part of the revolution and used to be part of the 'villistas', so he provided colaborating evidence also of those times."},{"Title":"Los de Abajo: Novela de la Revolucion Mexicana (Spanish Edition)","review":"This novel based on Mexican revolution takes you to the start of this century and allows you to live some revolutionary scenes and gives an idea of the way the fight was"},{"Title":"The Book of Cranes (in slipcase)","review":"This book is GORGEOUS! It is a hardcover accordian-style book in a hardcover slipcase (VERY impressive and classy looking) with gorgeous watercolors on each page. The text describes each respective type of crane. It is beautifully written, helpful and informative for everyone who loves cranes (Asian symbol of longevity, and known to mate for life). I can't imagine anyone who enjoys beautiful things not loving this book. Because of the aforementioned symbolism, it would make a meaningful wedding gift, anniversary present, or birthday gift (especially for one getting on in years)."},{"Title":"The Gay Adventures of Captain Goose","review":"I read this book a while ago, and when I lost it, a good friend bought me a new copy from Amazon. The story is grabbing, the scenes are believable, though I wish there had been a few more 'adventures&quot;, but all in all, one good read. The fact that it is set during the Revolutionary War, makes it even wilder and exciting. You won't be disappointed, believe me!"},{"Title":"The Gay Adventures of Captain Goose","review":"NO review order was cancelled--You need to update your software. This is the second item I have order as instock that was cancelled and not shipped."},{"Title":"The higher arithmetic: An introduction to the theory of numbers","review":"This book is an AMAZING introduction to the Theory of Numbers. It assumes no previous exposure to the subject, or any technical mathematical knowledge for that matter. Its prose is lucid and the style appealing. Davenport chose NOT to write a lemma-theorem-proof kind of book, and the result is a marvelous, eminently readable introduction to the subject. Its wonderful to read a book where good prose is used to appropiately substitute a massive collection of uninviting symbols. I've also been reading other books on Number Theory, such as Hardy &amp; Wright, but none are as clear as this one.I found the chapter on quadratic residues (which includes the reciprocity law) to be especially well written. The section on computers and number theory is excelent as well. A concise and coherent discussion of crytography and the RSA system is included here. The organization of the book's chapters is fantastic. Each chapter builds up on results proven in the previous ones, showing well the connections between the different aspects of Number Theory. The exercises of the book range from simple to challenging, but are all accesible to someone willing to put effort into them.This would be an excelent source for learning number theory for mathematical competition purposes, such as the ASHME, AIME, USAMO, and even for the International Mathematical Olympiad. The book contains much more than what is needed for these competitions, but the olympiad/contest reader will benefit greatly from a study of Davenport's work.The book can certainly be used for an undergraduate course in Number Theory, though it might need supplementary materials, to cover a semester's worth of work. I know the book has been used in the past in previous editions as the main text for Math 124: Number Theory at Harvard University.I would also recommend this book to anyone interested in acquanting themselves with Number Theory.Awesome! There is simply no other word that describes The Higher Arithmetic."},{"Title":"The higher arithmetic: An introduction to the theory of numbers","review":"The principal virtue of this text is that it can be taken up by readers with no more than ordinary high school level mathematical maturity yet it can aptly serve as the text for an undergraduate level first course in Number Theory. It is a model of clear and concise mathematical enunciation."},{"Title":"The higher arithmetic: An introduction to the theory of numbers","review":"Well, this is definitely a very good introduction to number theory. The author provides clear, readable proofs of all the most basic theorems on topics such as congruences, sums of squares, etc. He explains things quite well. However, despite costing almost 2.5 times as much, I would recommend Hardy and Wright's book An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers more highly than Davenport's book. Seriously, although it may seem good that Davenport doesn't require a knowledge of calculus as a prerequisite for his book (which Hardy DOES require), one probably shouldn't learn number theory until one has a good backrground on topics ranging from improper integrals to infinite series. Because Davenport does not require calculus as a prerequisite, he neglects HUGE aspects of what could actually be considered BASIC number theory: namely, the basic analytic aspects (such as Tchebycheff's results on the Prime Number Theorem) and the additive theory (i.e. partitions and such, as well as the basics of the generalized theory surrounding Waring's problem for high powers of integers). So, my recommendation is, wait until you know integral calculus and the theory of infinite series BEFORE buying a book on number theory, and then buy Hardy and Wright's book rather than this one."},{"Title":"The higher arithmetic: An introduction to the theory of numbers","review":"The higher arithmetic is more commonly known as number theory and is one of the most enjoyable and complex areas of mathematics. Simultaneously simple and hard, the problems are generally easy to understand yet can be horrendously difficult to solve. Furthermore, the initial areas of number theory are easy to comprehend; in general it only takes a basic knowledge of algebra to manage the main points.In this book, Davenport takes you through the basics of number theory, starting with prime factorization and going through some simple Diophantine equations. The chapter titles are:*) Factorization and the primes*) Congruences*) Quadratic residues*) Continued fractions*) Sums of squares*) Quadratic forms*) Some Diophantine equationsThis book is a solid introduction to number theory and can be understood by the advanced high school student. The primary drawback for the modern reader is that there is no coverage of the use of number theory in modern encryption techniques."},{"Title":"The higher arithmetic: An introduction to the theory of numbers","review":"I've purchased this book based on the rave reviews it's received on Amazon.com, both on this page and elsewhere. I've been greatly disappointed.This is the eighth edition, and, as such, is low on error count, so if all you're looking for in a math textbook is that it be error-free, this may be the book for you.If you are looking for a little more than that: say, an interesting, well-motivated and pedagogically sound lecture, you'd be better off looking for it elsewhere, for instance in Jones & Jones' superb \\"Elementary Number Theory\\".\\"The Higher Arithmetic\\"'s style of writing is unstructured prose (as opposed to the Definition-Theorem-Proof structure), supposedly rendering the text less rigid and more \\"friendly\\", when, in fact, it accomplishes the exact opposite effect: You're never sure where a proof begins and where it ends. This compounds unnecessary intellectual and psychological strains on top of those already naturally present whenever one learns new material.The unstructured-ness also makes this book quite useless as a work of reference.The proofs aren't particularly elegant or insightful (in fact, they are quite difficult to follow in some cases, for no good reason).There's very little in terms of historical background and in terms of interesting applications and recreations.Finally, the book is uncannily devoid of that geeky sense of humor that embellishes the best of math textbooks (e.g. \\"in this sense, at least, the prime 2 is very odd!\\", Jones & Jones, 1998, p. 106).This book can best be recommended to those who have already studied number theory, and would like a refresher of the main topics an introductory course is likely to include.P.S.This review is based on my impressions of the first three chapters (which constitute roughly one third of the book in terms of number of pages). I simply couldn't bear reading any further. I can't preclude the possibility that it gets better down the road."},{"Title":"The higher arithmetic: An introduction to the theory of numbers","review":"The title leads one to higher expectations than the textactually delivers?The book has some basic topics in number theory,but isn't so new or so well written as one might expect.That the book has gone past seven printing seems to show that it has been a popular seller?As for me I don't find myself desperate to buy it."},{"Title":"The monkey's paw: A story in three scenes (French's acting edition)","review":"The Monkey's Paw is an entertaining story especially for those who like shudder, suspense, drama and the supernatural.

It's the only book I've read more than once, probably six times by now and each time I find something new in it and it starts me thinking. Everyone has a Socrates somewhere, it isn't always as obvious as Dan's friend but someone, somewhere is watching our for each of us. Throughout our lives we have many teachers, often they are disguised or appear when we least expect them however, we must always be ready to learn so we don't miss a valuable lesson in life. This book will teach you a few lessons. Read it once at least and then decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Unlike Redfield, Millman knows how to write.

Also read the &quot;Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior.&quot;"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Millman's writing style is simplistic, which puts more of an emphasis on the meaning and philosophy behind the words. It was an eye opener in that things are not always as they seem in this world. This didn't exactly 'change my life', but has certainly transformed and redirected the way i view and think about it. Any message that is positive deserves a chance, and i would suggest this book to anyone of any age who has an open mind."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Fifty years of my life has passed and in every minute of each of those years I spent part of each moment redigesting the past and anticipating the future. Is it any wonder that my memories are not vivid. Millman's message: &quot;What time is it? NOW! Where are we? HERE!&quot;, is for me a perpetual reminder to turn my focus inward to the wealth of strength and creativity that I hold within. Saying those words to myself jog me out of my personal habit of reviewing my failures and worrying about my future losses. Those simple utterances: the HERE AND NOW hold deep meaning HERE AND NOW. Thanks Dan Millman, I'm am most appreciative for your insights, I GOT IT!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The basic plot is about a young collegiate athlete who meets an incredibly humble, intelligent, and talented man (whom he amply nicknames \\"Socrates\\") who mentors him toward reaching his potential and living a more complete life. I think Dan Millman's books are a more entertaining way of reading personal development titles. He knows how to tell a good story, and at the same time inspire the reader. When we experience the growth of Dan into the \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" it inspires us to believe in our goals and reach out and grab them. It's an entertaining book, and it will help the reader on a human level."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I do. I read the book when I was eighteen, 40 now, and back then and still I like it a lot. In some ways, it is my favorite book. I'm really more literary in taste, Nabokov, Delillo, but this the writing in this is superb I think. Very compelling story of one guy trying to help another.When I say I want to know more I understand that there are lessons in this book galore. And all of them are good lessons. Help others, stay in the moment, what else? Is that pretty much it? Don't take life too seriously. Laugh more. I just don't see how, for myself a book can change a life. I guess you think about what you read and then take action, right. But no one writes about the action. They just say \\"This book changed my life.\\" And is sounds to me like some platitude, but my not be. Let's talk further in the comments."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I have read several of Dan's books in the past (i.e. The Warrior Athlete,No Ordinary Moments and The Journey of Socrates), and I find this one to be a bit contrived and shallow. The idea of touching someone and having this \\"out of body/mystical experience\\" just seems like too much LSD.Some of the basic concepts of this book seemed to be rooted in some type of \\"wishy-washy Zen\\" philosophy without the philosophy. I believe he would have done himself a greater service by representing the story in more realistic terms without the hokey, unrealistic mysticism. On a brighter note, I did like the fact that Socrates did try to teach him some practices that are helpful, such as meditation, abstinence, proper diet and the concept that we are all fallible.Pass this up in lieu of \\"The Journey of Socrates\\". This book is more realistic and a better written story. I think Millman himself has evolved into a better author since this book was penned. But as I heard him say in a youtube interview...He isn't here to make think any which way. He wants you to have your BS detector on, and learn for yourself from life itself. This I agree with."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Excellent book to help you achieve success in all areas of your life.

It's a story that could be about anyone and the journey that we take in our lives to find our own path. Even when we stray from our destiny, somehow there is some force that sets us back on the path that was meant to be. A pretty good read."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Feeling the burn in this, our time-starved, fragmented, info-overloaded world? You might do well to adopt the warrior's path, that of freedom from ego, release from attachments, and finding happiness in the service of others. It's easy to see why this book has been changing lives for nearly 30 years.Dan's break from training made for the most poignant part of the book for me. Sent away by Socrates, Dan lives 8 years of his life and wonders if he's just starting all over again. Who on the path to a better self hasn't felt that way? Learning the principles is one thing - living them is something else again. Daily practice takes the courage of a warrior.That said, I have to be honest: the poor writing kept me from truly getting the most out of the experience of reading this book. Obviously it hasn't hurt the book's success in getting its message out into the world, and for that I'm glad, but it did make for some rough going in spots. I couldn't help but wonder what might have been had the book NOT read like an endless parade of \\"And then this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened...\\"That the messages are as relevant as ever (if not more so) and this book's stature in field make it required reading for personal growth aficionados. But for lovers of the written word, it's a bit like eating your broccoli: great for you, but no picnic going down.Lastly - do check out the movie! While there are differences, I was very impressed with how director Victor Salva captured the spirit of the book with gorgeous and effective visual storytelling (there's a scene where Dan meets himself on a rooftop that I'm thinking of in particular)."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The book is a gift but I received it very quickly.

A student at the University of California at Berkley, Dan's life revolved around school and gymnastics. Stressed with his life Dan left his apartment and took a stroll around town. What he did not know is that this walk would change his life forever. His experiences and outlook on life changed once he entered the doors of the infamous gas station. Dan walked in the gas station and saw an old man sitting in a chair. When he walked out of the gas station, the same man was on the roof. Wanting to know how the man got on the roof, Dan returned nightly to obtain his answer. Over numerous years, Dan learned lessons that aided in his quest to become a Warrior.Dan Millman is a University of California at Berkley graduate, a world trampoline champion, and member of the Gymnastics Hall of Fame. He was the director of gymnastics at Stanford University, and later became a professor at Oberlin College. He has written 13 self-help books and gives talks and seminars all over the United States and abroad. He currently lives in Northern California with his family.This book is incredibly powerful and leaves the reader with a new perspective on life. The vividness of word choice creates a surreal vision. An explanation of The Warrior is offered by Socrates, Dan's guide on his new quest. Socrates, 94, incorporates Eastern philosophy and Western fitness to embark on a spiritual odyssey to discover the meaning of life and becoming a warrior. Socrates uses humor, kindness, and love in his teachings to convey that happiness, creativity, and fulfillment can be achieved by developing one's human potential. By the end of the book, it is difficult to have dry eyes. The reader really connects with Dan and has a desire for him to be successful in his journey.This book was very hard to locate and is found in the New Age section of bookstores, an unusual area to search for a personal growth/fiction book. It is a story based on true aspects of Millman's life.This book is recommended for teenagers and older. It is important to have a good grasp of vocabulary and some life experience to understand the concept of this book. Other books by Dan Millman are: The Life You Were Born to Live: A Guide to Finding Your Life Purpose, and Wisdom of the Peaceful Warrior: A Companion to the Book that Changes Lives. The reader must be open to new ideas, and new ways of looking at oneself and the world to appreciate this story.Way of the Peaceful Warrior has been made into a movie starring Nick Nolte, Scott Mechlowicz and Amy Smart. The movie version recently came out on DVD."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, after hearing many good things about it. After reading about 25 pages, I had to stop, because it is so badly written. The setting with the old guru at the gas station is completely contrived, and not enough detail is provided to give the story any credibility. For instance, in one early scene,the old guru is sitting in a chair. Then, when our trampoline-champion hero looks again a moment later, the old guy is up on the roof looking at the stars. No way! How did he get up there! Then, the guy keeps asking the old guy, for several pages, \\"how did you get on the roof?\\" The old guy just laughs, and basically asks mysterious questions that suggest, \\"you really don't know anything that you think you know.\\" This is real drivel, that might be considered precocious if written by a 12-year old. Stories which have supernatural characters are effective only when the setting is made to seem realistic. The attempt at realism is lost when the writing itself is poor, and the details are contrived. \\"The Greatest Miracle in the World\\" by Og Mandino and \\"Illusions\\" by Richard Bach come to mind as successful well-written examples of this genre. But in this book by Millman, there is no such believability established. The guy comes upon this gas station, and this old guru simply starts teaching him the meaning of life. For this to be a reasonably well-known book that has a \\"20th Anniversary\\" edition is rather shocking. Simply put, this guy is not a good writer. His sentence structure and word choice is awful, and his scenes have a wooden falseness that renders the whole thing unreadable. And don't tell me \\"it's the message, not the medium\\" which is important. The message--that we are all too self-absorbed, that we need to embrace the universe, awaken to reality, etc.-- has been forcefully transmitted by so many great written works, that we don't need second rate stuff like this to tell us what we already know. Admittedly, succeeding in this \\"wise-old-guy-who-teaches-regular-guy-mysteries-of-life\\" genre is not so easy; but this effort is an appalling wreck that cannot seriously be considered as literature. I have nothing against the author. More power to him for his success with this book. I have never had anything published, so I am not looking down on him. It's just very surprising to me that people think this book is good."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Millman's book - Way of the Peaceful Warrior - follows the journey and development of the protagonist (Millman himself) as he undergoes a spiritual transformation and \\"self-realization\\". Millman uses a mysterious teacher character, Socrates, to convey life's important lessons. The plot is very straightforward - it is a standard quest-for-knowledge. Think of the movie, The Karate Kid, and you get the gist of the plot.It's important that you read the book as an allegory and is only meant to be read semi-literally. This is important because Millman's writing is very rough at times, the dialogue made me cringe, and there are random moments of misogyny. Also, Millman throws in various supernatural events, which gave me a few \\"Huh?\\" moments. Towards the end, the book feels like Millman tried to pick up the pace of the novel, which felt ackward given the pace of the first three quarters of the book. So, minus two stars for the bad writing.Once you can see through the poor dialogue and supernatural events, you can pull out the lessons that Millman is trying to convey:- Take care of your health and eat well. Your body will reward you.- Avoid stress and use anger positively. Meditation is a good tool.- Don't fuss over the past; it's done. Learn and move on.- Don't fuss over the future; it's too unpredictable.- Go all-in or don't play at all. Moderation is for bores.- Life is a journey to understand yourself and in doing so, understand your own way to happiness.- Live for now and enjoy the present; be aware and avoid passive understanding.To the informed reader, this novel doesn't really express anything new or ground-breaking; it just bundles some basic advice nicely in a story that is easily read by most Americans. I didn't find this novel life-changing or phenomenal or great but rather a simple suggestion of ways to achieve happiness. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and thinking about Millman's suggestions but it did not live up to the hype."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Depending where you are in your life, this book will be hit or miss. If you're starting to feel disillusioned about life and its meaning, then this book could be a story you'll really relate to. I read it when I was 15. Even though it's a story in some ways I couldn't relate to - I wasn't in college, and I didn't have an unlikely teacher that I met in gas station - I could relate to his struggle to feel alive and give his life meaning. I could remember in high school how the few real moments I had were playing soccer or spending time with a special girl. Kind of like the book's protagonist until he meets Socrates. Outside of those fleeting moments, my life felt pretty unspecial and meaningless. I felt very lost without purpose. The positive messages and the profound questions in this book are really inspiring, moving, and uplifting. To read of Dan's adventures grappling with culturally-obscured truths to life was exciting. So this book will always have a special place in my heart. It spoke to that sleeping part of myself that thirsts to \\"know thyself\\". But now I've moved on to new books, having used Way of the Peaceful Warrior as a stepping stone.Wonderfully bright, active prose helps keep the pages turning. This is helpful when there are so many stunning ideas that don't need obsfucation caused by sophisticated mumbo-jumbo. One mistake I notice is that people tend to think because the book is easy reading for a student in middle-school that the ideas are unsophisticated. Go ahead and read Being and Nothingness, and then come back to Way of the Peaceful Warrior. I'm sure you'll have a larger, more complex vocabulary, but I'm not sure you'll have any deeper ideas. I think it's a tribute to Dan Millman that he could present fundamental philosophical questions in a way that connects them to real life and everyday happiness and suffering without writing about war, climbing a moutain, or something else extreme. I looked at my own life in new ways after reading this book.Hopefully you'll enjoy this book like I did."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I have bought this book some 10 years ago and share it with a lot of people since then. My boyfriend, who is more insterested in martial arts than in spirituality, shared this book in turn with some of his friends from the martial arts (Muay Thai) club, specially those who felt stuck at a crossroads. One of them had a dream to fight in Thailand, but was immediately discouraged by his Thai instructor and told that, as a black man, he would never make it in Thailand. After reading this book, this fighter packed his bags and left for Thailand anyway. Not only did he succeed there, he became a world champion fighter and is still winning fights in Thailand.

Some of them more than once. I have been very discriminating - seeking out books that I determined contained true knowledge. I based this on opinions from other seekers and various book reviews. I judged Peacefull Warrior by its cover - wrongly, I might add. Only after I saw the trailer of the upcoming movie did I get interested in reading the book - so I bought it. It turns out that I have deprived myself of an absolute treasure for many, many years.This is a book that actively teaches you something as you read it - effortlessly. Millman has a way with words. I can't adequately describe it - it is simply enthralling.I liked it so much I then read \\"The Journeys of Socrates\\" (which was advertised at the last of the book). I loved this book even more! I could not put it down. It was like I was watching the story being played out before my very eyes. Amazing. And such a revelation at the end. This book caused me to experience every emotion while reading it. You must read this book - but be sure to read \\"The Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" first!\\"I feel very grateful to have had the opportunity to read these books. They truly have worth beyond measure.

This book, after reading it changed my life, as well as inspired me to become a Peaceful Warrior myself. That was almost 10 years ago, but I keep coming back to it from time to time reminding myself of some of the simple pleasures in life and to remember to lose myself in the moment. The book unlocked my rigorous thinking to move on and look at things differently and more uniquely. Definately a book that is highly reccomended for anyone, but also for the beginnering philosopher to change their ways of seeng reality and life."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"When I was 13 years old, I was always in a lot of trouble, getting expelled, etc. A substitute teacher eventually came to me and handed me this book. I thought he was crazy but I read it anyway. I did not understand it at all. I asked him many questions. He responded similarly to Socrates ways of answering questions. I put the book away for many years. Now I am a senior in college. I found the book and read it more than once. Last night I started reading it again. It's amazing that I could cry while reading a book. I hate reading. This book still confuses me, but it makes me think. And any book that can make me think about myself, I mean really think about myself, is a good one. I am going to read it again."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Wow! What a great book! Really. Author and main character of \\"Way Of The Peaceful Warrior,\\" Dan Millman weaves a fast, catchy and easy-to-read story-line that is also slow and penetrating enough to seep into the pores of consciousness with words by enigmatic teacher and \\"warrior,\\" Socrates - a name given to the Japanese master upon the first meeting of the two.The journey shared within the pages is bound to create a magical enlightenment for some readers, a familiar knowing and relate-ability for others. It promises to be uplifting and inspiring for all, reminding us that we truly are spiritual beings who temporarily live in a physical body.Near the end of the story, as Dan made his escape from \\"the box,\\" finding the gateway to reality, he wishes to tell everyone: \\"There is no need to search; achievement leads to nowhere. It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor, and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life; just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, you are already free!\\"This is a book I plan to re-read.

Everything in this book (allmost) is stuff that i have made a plan to do for the rest of my life...problem though is that i have been teaching myself to live this way through books, i am not lucky enough to have a teacher to show me.It is possible to live a life like the one described in this book, but it is allmost impossible to do without becoming kind of \\"aberrant\\" as far as societal normality goes...But what fun is the state of normality?There really are people that wander around the world that ARE allmost on the level of the Buddha or Christ as far as \\"enlightenment\\" goes, and it really is possible to strive for that state of mind, but there is no one single path to get there, the way is different for every person. This book is not made to be followed to the letter, but the themes, if someone really is serious about going this way, CAN be followed. This book is only an opening to where you want to go with this, only the first step, the very tip of the iceberg, there is far more to this than what is in this little book, but the value of the book lies in the fact that it shows that there IS a path that can POSSIBLY be followed by any person, if they so choose, it isnt easy though, it is not by any means the path of least resistance. This is just the doorway, the first step to those who are serious.Some other books like this are 'Siddhartha' by Herman Hesse, 'The Hope Valley Hubcap King' by Sean Murphy (great \\"journey tale\\" of this genre, with comedy and satire thrown in, very very good book), and some of the stuff by Carlos Casteneda perhaps.If anyone else really has the will to try to build beliefs and \\"habits\\" like those in this book, good luck in finding what you hope to find in the end, it isnt supposed to be easy though...then again \\"easy\\" is just a label.If any of those who are like Socrates see this and need a dedicated and able student... =)This book does not automatically change lives, you are not \\"different\\" just for having read it. If you want to make a change in your life for the better, you have to have the will to MAKE change, dont expect it to just float into your hands, it is not that easy.I would recommend reading some Stuart Wilde if you really want to go far more indepth into the Warrior/Sage persona...If you are serious about this book, you will get very good and much more detailed information from the Taos Quintet by Stuart Wilde."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"this book really has showed me to way to change and be free of my mind. i guess when they say free your mind they mean free your mind from you"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I read this about 25 years ago and list it as one of those books that really influenced my outlook on life. I'm just finishing it up again and still love it, as it has those gentle reminders we all need for the bigger picture and some very enjoyable plot twists and scenes.I am absolutely shocked, however, by the number of typos, especially for a book this well-known. There are several dozen typos in the Kindle version. Needs a Kindle edit."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Many of the events in this book are said to be true, but the book is fictional. Right from the start, I was yearning to hear Dan Millman's true story, not a fake one. And I never got past that. As a guide to changing lives, as the title suggests, I applaud the author's efforts to introduce spiritual elements into everyday living. An introspective way of life can be rich and rewarding, and for those searching for deeper meaning this tale points the way. Clearly, many people have found it useful.As a novel, the characters are one-dimensional and the dialog clunky and there's not much of a story. It's seems to be stuck between fiction and non-fiction with elements of both mixed together, although we don't know which is which. There doesn't seem much point in reading a fake autobiography unless it has a good story arc. Maybe if the main character's name wasn't the author's name I wouldn't have been so hung up on this. It's kind of Dan Millman's story, but not really. If it's going to be a novel, I would've been more interested in a captivating story that demonstrates spiritual growth and development rather than fictional characters telling me how to do it. However, I'd rather Dan just write a autobiography that's true. Either one would've been better than something in-between.If a reader wants to learn meditation and an introspective way of living, I'd suggest one of many good authors/teachers in Zen or Work-centered practices. Not this book. However, I gave this book 2 stars because it may lead someone to deeper study in these areas and, for that reason, it would be worthwhile."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I had not read this book for over twenty years and wondered what had made me pick it up in the first place. It is somewhat dated but speaks to a way of life all of us could share or, practice, no matter what our religions or callings are - zen b is a 'way' to our beliefs.This book holds up over many decades and provides a step by step approach of strengthening the being to accept the world as it is, but in a modern day 'parable'. Dan and Socrates are engaging characters and their relationship draws one into the story of Dan's spiritual internship.These teachings are also available through many sources,including Pema Chodron and B. Alan Wallace, but Warrior perhaps, is more readable.This is worth the second glance -"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The subtitle says that this is a book that changes lives, and it certainly can. First published in 1980, this semi-autobiographical novel takes place in the mid-1960s, and it reflects the kind and intensity of the spiritual quests many of us were on back then. The bits of wisdom sprinkled throughout the book have been echoed in books and movies of the last 30 years, from \\"Star Wars\\" to \\"The Karate Kid\\" to \\"The Dead Poets Society\\" and many more, so the concepts will not likely be new to most. This book collects them in one neat volume, and would be ideal for someone -- of any age -- who is asking some of life's big questions. Decently written, the book's first-person approach and gentle humor keeps this book from being heavy-handed and preach-y. This is a book that's staying in my collection -- I'll definitely be turning to it again."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"A former star gymnast stops by a gas station late at night, and hooks up with an unlikely guru -- the gas station attendant, who leaps to the top of low buildings in a single bound, pumps gas with a smile, and has attractive female friends. This is The Karate Kid for college students. It felt like a movie, and lo and behold, I searched and saw that it is. It's a fun read, and who could not be attracted to the mysterious young woman, Joy, who outruns a trained athlete? And manages all the unreality without drugs (for that, see Castaneda.) But I'm just not sure if the messages come through in this cute story, even though they're stated. Live like you're about to die. Train your soul as well as your body. Everything in moderation, but OK to break out every so often. You could read Maimonides instead -- he said the same things, but without the gas station."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is yet another in a series of life changing books I have been reading of late.

This is a first in a Trilogy that includes Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior and The Journey of Socrates.

Any of Millman's books are great tools for personal growth."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I definitely enjoyed reading this book and its many different insights. I'm a notoriously slow reader and the pages still flew by.....but I actually think I went too fast. If you do decide to read this book, I would highly recommend taking a deep breath after 30 or so pages just to sit back and soak in the story and its meaning. There really are a lot of concepts thrown to you at once and it only makes sense to take the time to understand their impact. There's no doubt I will read this again (I'm going through the sequel right now) and will make it a point to slow down a bit.There were some parts of the book that really hit home for me and others that seems a little \\"bit much\\", but, overall, I thought the presentation was done well. Near the end of the book I was a little bit diappointed at how fast the author decribes his life events after college; I guess I was just expecting more meaningful discussion about what he went through. (EDIT: Some of the \\"holes\\" are filled in by his other books)I'm looking forward to seeing the movie adaptation just to compare how Millman's Socate's character translates to the big screen. The most important question I ask myself after I read this book is: \\"Do I feel that it made an impact (big or small) in my life?\\" I would definitely say \\"yes\\" just for mere idea that past and future are simply subtle barriers that can impede our progress today."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The book was even more inspirational than the movie- and we loved the movie.

The friend was addicted to heroin at the time and had just pawned off my acoustic guitar I lent him in order to buy more junk. He came to me shortly after the event and told me he had something for me while reaching into his backpack.I knew my guitar wouldn't fit in the bag... and I wasn't using heroin.. so I had zero idea what the hell he was about to give me. Out of his bag he pulled out a beat up copy of \`Way of the Peaceful Warrior', handed it to me with a smile, and said \`I never give my books to anyone, but I want you to have this'. I glanced at the front cover, which boldly claimed it was a \`Book That Changes Lives', and automatically thought \`heard that one before', said thanks, and put it in my bag. In retrospect I noticed he was a lot calmer than usual, but I didn't make any connection between that and the book he gave me. At the time I was so absorbed in my own little world that I had minimal awareness of other people and my environment.I read a couple of pages a day or two later, and deciding I wasn't interested in the story, put it back in the bookshelf where it collected dust for a while. That was maybe a year ago, I can't recall, but quite recently I saw the friend again, after a long absence, and found out that he was leaving Melbourne for good to move to Hawaii. So I decided I would read that book he gave me; after all, he had previously introduced me to The Alchemist, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Shantaram, so I figured he was a on a roll with good books. I read the book in Bali in a couple of days, and I didn't want it to end. After I finished it I felt a zest that I hadn't felt in a long time; I bubbled with energy and appreciation for life. Has this book changed my life? Definitely. Infinite gratitude goes to the friend who gave me the book, whose life appears to have changed as well: he has now kicked his heroin addiction, is practicing a vegan diet, and is getting married to a beautiful girl in Hawaii!It's a good thing I didn't read the book when I first received it, because I don't think I was at a stage in my life where I could appreciate such a book, or absorb its insights. This is the sort of book that will come to you when you are ready, and I don't doubt that you will read it more than once when that time comes. As for the story, it's not important, but I'll humour you and say it's about a young gymnast named Dan Millman (the book's author: it's a partly autobiographical book) who discovers an old nameless man at a gas station, whom he develops a teacher/student relationship with. Dan calls the old man Socrates, which is a very fitting name for two reasons: 1. Socrates, the Greek philosopher, was very wise. And 2. No one knows whether Socrates really existed, as he only exists within the writings of Plato, his pupil. Socrates is for the most part shrouded in mystery, but what does get revealed to you about him I will not ruin. This is a book that I think is best to know as little about as possible before reading. All I will say is that the book follows the relationship of Dan and Soc till the very end as Dan, and the reader, struggle to come to terms with the new world Socrates has opened up - a world of infinite energy and potential."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book reminds me of The Guru Delivery, or Illusions, in that it is a wonderful story of an unexpected master/student relationship.

This unusual book is a wonderful introduction to deeper philosophies like Zen, but it's written in a light, upbeat style that is very approachable. As a result of reading this book, my life really did change. I ended up as a \\"student\\" of Dan Millman's, of a sort, when he became my Editor and I published in a bestselling series under his direction.

I've kept it there since it was once recommended to me, but I never felt the inclination to read it until now. Upon facing life-changing choices about schools, career, residence, following spirit, and going with what life hands me...I finally decided to open this book. As it was when I was a kid and read the Tolkien Trilogy, reading the pages of this book transported me to an altered state while flying from Montana to California. My awareness and excitement were expanded. With this book I realized that I cannot make a wrong choice in whichever direction I take; I can use these two years of school training to also train my awareness as a female warrior of the human spirit. I can see the perspectives revealed in the book as applicable in my life and I look forward to how I will put them to work. The next book of Millman's that I may read will be the Mind Body-Inner Athlete book, but only after I allow the ideas from the Peaceful Warrior to unfold in my life in a new residence, school, and career path; in physical and mental healing, in running, being happy, and being OK with having/doing a regular job.

As my life changes, the way I see the characters changes and the messages I can take away from the story change as well.To anybody who plans on reading this book:Don't go into it with any expectations, accept the story as it comes, allow your mind to slip away and fall into pace with the amazing story before you. You must go into this story open to new ideas. If you do, you will find an amazing new perspective on your own life.I have recommended this book to everyone I know.On a side note, the movie, as in most cases, doen't come close to living up to the story on paper.

Close your eyes to the juvenile manner in which it is written and listen to the message it sends.

In a nutshell, it says to exercise and be disciplined, be wary of your thoughts, and eat healthy (and without meat!)-Which I agree with.With that said, let's get to the bad...and it is bad. For one, the author is quite possibly the most pompous person I have ever heard talk. I am pretty sure that much of the Asian philosophy that he draws from conveys that you need to avoid being egotistical, but he seems to have missed the memo there. The beginning and middle sections suggest that he was lost and hopeless, but turned his life around after following the philosophy set by this magical old man. And towards the end after essentially reaching nirvana, he walks up and down the street and says that he sees so many people who are slowly dying and lying to themselves about their lives (I paraphrase here). It is nice to know that this author not only reached nirvana, but gained the ability to judge others without ever even talking to them.I was on the fence about whether to give this a 2 or 3-star review, but went with 2 for the simple fact that I wouldn't recommend this to friends."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"If your'e interested in a little self-help and motivational reading, this is the book for you!

It's a coincidence because I just grabbed the book randomly on my friend's shelf to take on a roadtrip (I don't even read that much usually) and the subject of the book is exactly what I'm going through in my life right now so I will give it a review.I'm a Chinese myself and have practiced Qigong and Buddism for six months now, and have found tremendous spiritual growth since then, and I could tell you that the book is good but it is definitely only half of the story, and here's the other half- you have to learn to meditate and even better, learn Qigong to start to see the spiritual experiences that is illustrated in the book, then if you are persistent you'll have a different viewpoint on life. I know most people are skeptical like I was before, and that's the only reason why I started this journey so late.Now while I enjoyed the better half of the book, here are my insights of the not so good parts. First, I do not know why the author never explained the inner workings of meditation and of Qi when he wrote about so many practices that are derivatives of the two, such as healing Dan's leg and giving him vision, or becoming one with nature, those are all possible and even I could take away some physical pain for a moment or two through manipulating Qi energy. Without the slightest explanations of those phenomenons readers will be lost. Honestly I doubt the author understand that half of it at all and feels like he merely place in the most important doctrines of Buddism inside dialogues as a progress of his journey, but what about his own physical and mental awakening? Secondly, I do not think Dan ever found enlightenment because of the way he illustrated it at the end of the book. The ONLY way to become enlightened is through deep meditation and achieving high level of Qi energy, I don't think the author knows that so he just pretty much cheated with a vision and let it be. Another mistake the author made while trying to illustrate the path of searching for enlightenment is the wrong and stereotypical Hollywood version of neglecting families and going around the world for eight years trying to find answers. There are absoulte no answers to be found in the outside world but inside yourself and Dan should know that if Socrates had taught him that far, yet Dan has to sqeeze that part into the book, guiding the readers on a wrong path.Even with those faults, the story is entertaining and inspiring with many essential teaching of Zen Buddism and Taoism. I love it for that, as an easy to digest book that immerse and educate at the same time, I have not read another english book that's quite this unique on the subject of finding your soul. Remember, if you want to go on a real path of enlightenment, find meditation (Vipassan or Zen meditation, not new age BS) and/or Qigong (a lot harder to find the right teacher, but worth the search), then you'll have your answer."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The title of this book aroused my curiosity; however, after 3 or 4 reading sessions, I found it easy to just let the book rest and pick up something else to read.

I can't put my finger on why. Yes it was a good story and yes it was well-written. But Dan Millman, like Richard Bach, has a way of communicating between the lines to places our rational minds cannot comprehend. All I know is that I felt uplifted and inspired by reading it. And when I wrote my book, To Bee or Not to Bee (an allegorical tale of awakening), Dan was kind enough to write this endorsement: \\"A book for the child in all of us....a simplicity that is powerful, a purity that reminds us of the light we all are.\\" It's now in 11 languages and exploding.

It has illustrated very entertainingly how mind can get in the way of life and drag one down. The story has inspired me to become a witness to my own inner dialog / illusions which have kept me from taking action to creat what I want out of life. There is no self help tone to this book. It is just pure fable with some truth mixed in (or is it the other way arround) unlike many of the books out there on mindfullness.

If you've seen the movie, \\"Peaceful Warrior\\", I would definitely suggest to you that you read this book because it will change your life.My final words are...Are you 100% happy and satisfied with EVERY aspect of your life? Are you living a perfect/horrible/ or \\"so-so\\" human life right now??

I've read it multiple times. And every time it reminds me of important things and helps me in my life. It chronicles the journey of a man struggling to find himself, something most people I know can relate to, not to mention myself. It tells of his discovery of what he was looking for, his purpose, it helps you to do so also. This book changes the way you think and affects your life in many ways, it teaches you about moral and purpose and the realities of life. Although it isn't one of the most extravagantly written books, Dan Millman does an incredible job of conveying his message through his medium. This book is truly a work of art. I would recommend Way of the Peaceful Warrior to anyone. Period. No matter who you are I believe you can find something for yourself in this book."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is a reasonable fairy tale which can help to pass the time while on the train. However it is very simplistic and not at all inspiring since it's nothing you haven't heard a million times before. The 'insight' into life is given through a mystical, supernatural old hippie called socrates - this makes the story far too abstract and cannot be applied to real life. Dan Millman has made a lot of money out of some very gullible people. If you want to know about the meaning of life etc then go to the experts and read the views of a real philosopher. Hey..what about Socrates. Or else, try 'Sophie's World' by Josteein Gaardner, which is a far more insightful and intelligent read."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"If you expect to discover bad habits, change your attitude, and improve your life just by reading a book....good luck. Everyone should know that it takes hard work, self-knowledge, and lots of time. Still, Dan Millman tells a compelling semi-autobiography that resonates with many readers, including this one.It's heavy on sports analogies, which I don't identify with, much, but insightful reading can apply it to other frustrations in life.I would purchase this book again for myself, or for someone else on the given conditions: 1) that you feel something is wrong with your level of happiness and you need to identify and follow someone's trials, 2) that you know something is wrong and can't quite identify it, or 3) that you are in a transitionary stage - between jobs, between mates, between goals. If you don't fall into any one of these categories, or if your intended reader doesn't, you probably won't get anything useful from this story.Having written the above, I sincerely believe that this book is an engaging and easily digestible recipe for improving self-awareness regarding your life, your goals, and your frame of mind.I give this work 3 of 5 stars because it's good, but it wouldn't be included in my desert island library."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I found this tale to be both boring and a waste of time.

Before I even finished it I thought it was a good book, but then at the end I was disappointed to discover that it was just trying to butter me up to buy products from the NUMEROUS ADS in the last pages, ads for things like horoscope and Tarot readings.Twenty years later I have picked up the book again and started reading it. Choppy writing, empty platitudes, and a fake story about a Socrates, Mama Chia (CH-CH-CH-CHIA!), and a man who has everything he needs in life and is still unhappy. All I can say is: I'd rather be rich and miserable like Dan Millman than poor and miserable. Maybe Dan Millman should count his blessings. After all, the story takes place in Hawaii where he was vacationing, and my own financial situation is such that I can't even afford to take a vacation, much less travel to Hawaii and \\"find myself.\\" I'll never see Hawaii.POOR POOR DAN MILLMAN!!!!Sorry Dan, but your book didn't live up to its title. It didn't change my life. I could not identify with the protagonist. I did not believe in CH-CH-CH-CHIA!

Strange.Looking at the cover, and reading the title, I got the impression this was a book about a wanderer who came to hang out at a gas station, a quiet, calm man who was also a great brawler, held with strong moral codes and beliefs, somewhat like Cain on the old \\"Kung Fu\\" TV show.Instead, \\"Socretes\\" is an old gas station attendant with seemingly magical powers and unique worldview, who inspires the author in his own spirtual quest.I can't claim this book has really \\"changed my life,\\" but it has made me think. Among the lessons I've learned by reading this book are: There are no ordinary moments, eat properly, live NOW and HERE, enjoy what you have, and take full responsibility for your actions."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"&quot;Way of the...&quot; shows how a gymnast named Dan realizes that his way of thinking, living, and being is inherently flawed and self defeating, by way of a mysterious teacher.The book is good in it's presentation, and also I found it very inspiring. The warrior's life almost exactly mirrors a very Buddhist ideal, but never made mention of that, which I thought was good, so as not to promote one thing, and make the book's message fully available to everyone.So why 4 stars? My main problem with this book was it's portrayal of anyone living the warrior's life as being some sort of mystic or magician. I didn't mind Socrates' jumping, or some other things like that, but I thought sometimes the whole visions thing, the glowing, and especially Socrates' death were really too much. When Socrates touches Dan on the head and makes him forget something I think that it serves very little purpose in the book, and just makes it seem more surreal.Also, the role that &quot;Joyce&quot; played, and Socrates' death were a little too neat and tidy for me. It was just wrapping itself up like a Disney movie for adults.This book could have been written in a more down to earth sense that would have made the warrior's life and the whole message of the book seem closer to people instead of something that you have to train hours a day for, and totally change yourself, etc. I did however like Dan's focusing not only on the mental/emotional/intangible elements of training, but also physicality as well. I think some books on Buddhism would be good accompanying texts for this."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Dan Millman is one of the greatest writers of our day.

(A book that changes lives) It made me want to be more disciplined, and to clear the mind of excesses. But I had a few problems with the story. Maybe it was written so that even a ten year old could understand it. I had trouble with the fact that this man had no real, long,intimate relationships with anyone other than Socrates. His marriage was also pushed aside, like it didn't really matter who he hurt on his path to self enlightenment. I also had trouble believing that he could become so submissive to somebody whose real name was kept secret.Does vegetarianism and drinking herbal tea really make that much of an impact?

But my expectations were not met at all, probably because I'm just not in tune with all this new-age stuff going around these days. I certainly won't pick up 'The Celestine Prophecy' now! I read the amazon.com interview w/Dan Millman, and noted that a favorite of his is Hesse's 'Siddhartha', which strikes a cord, because that's a favorite of mine as well. -That was a book that brought about much reflection and insight- but for some reason, 'The Way of the Peaceful Warrior' fails to evoke these responses. Maybe I let the excessive melodrama of Dan's character get to me. Or maybe it was the writing style in general. I mean, what do you think of this??: &quot;But Joy, you know I want you to be with me always. I want to have children with you and keep you warm at night.

But I finished the book, and feel humbled in the respect that I ask, &quot;Can some-one explain to me what that was all about??&quot; There are principles in the book that I agree with and practice myself, but the thought of this book being an eye-opener, or dispensing wisdom beyond the basics of Buddhism, does not pan out.

Dan if you are out there, and remember this - please get it touch with me. All I remember is that the back of the book gave his hometown. From there I was able to get his home phone number. I remember calling him late at night, well late for me as a 7th grader anyway. I just told him that I really liked his book. That was about it. It seems like a magical dream.

Through numerous exchanges with an old saintly Wizard named Socrates, the narrator expands his perspective on the journey of life. To truly becomming a peaceful warrior, one must continually explore, retain, and focus in on the present, sub-consciously feeding one's life meter with new experiences and observations upon which to accumulate and feed off in future years. Just as a saintly oracle would profess, Socrates' message is to always strive for more optimism, better relations, and more knowledge and curiosity by being in the now."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I am going to keep this review simple and to the point. 'The Way of the Peaceful Warrior' is one of the best books I have ever read. A good American friend of mine lent it to me whilst I was studying in Germany and I couldn't put it down. I was constantly thinking up excuses to feed my friends so I could slip away and read another chapter. The language of the book is simple and easy to read. The moral content of the story is more profound and so I think it is fitting that the language is basic. The spiritual messages are easily accessible. What you do after you have accessed them is up to you, however. Having said that, I would not want anyone to think that the book's language is like a young child's school reading book. Some parts are extremely well written and poetic.I persoanlly thought that it was the most profound and spiritually uplifting book I have ever read. Another friend of mine, however, read it and when asked afterwards what she thought, pondered the question for a moment before saying 'I guess it IS important to laugh'. I think she missed the point... several points the size of elephants.This book will not be everyone's cup of tea as we say here in England. You may find the medium which the author uses to tell his story and to get his message across simply too unbelievable. You have to be willing to just suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this book and get anything out of it.I was walking around on a spiritual high for weeks after reading this book. I just bought my own copy and am about to start reading it again. I vowed to myself after I finished reading it the first time that I would not forget some of the life-lessons the book taught me.That's all I have to say. I hope this book will inspire others as much as it inspired me."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Simply put, in shining, simple prose, Dan Millman conveys many lessons and great inspiration through his book &quot;The Way of the Peaceful Warrior.&quot; Some of my fellow reviewers enjoyed this book and some didn't. I believe that you have to be ready to read a book like this, and that you absolutely must be open. Most people are too caught up in illusions like knowledge (see reviews) to appreciate the full benefits of the story, even when the limits of knowledge are unquestionably pointed out. This is all part of our individual progress. However, for those of us ready to think about it openly &quot;Peaceful Warrior&quot; can be a great book indeed. Also, heed Dan's words from &quot;Living on Purpose,&quot; &quot;ten percent of what I say may be wrong for you at this particular time, so listen with healthy skepticism and take with you only what you find useful.&quot; I challenge all of you, those that liked it, and those that didn't, to &quot;empty your teacup,&quot; as it were, and try reading it again without imposing your assumptions on it.Best wishes for all,Allan"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I read this book when I was in my twenties and it has remained on of my all time favorites even 20 years later.

Rather than just being another self-help book, Way of the Peaceful Warrior put concepts that I had been thinking about and stuggling to understand, into a story that brought everything to life and was wonderful to read. It showed me that you can be both a warrior and peaceful which is the most important lesson of all."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I read this book years ago; however, every time I pick it back up, I find something more inside of it to appreciate. The story is so good because:A) it's a true story about real suffering and growthB) it's just as much about the main character's inner journey as it is about his external one.This book was highly relevant to me because it describes in Western terms, the essence of a traditional guru-disciple relationship. This relationship is as old as time, and most of the greatest world's teachings have been passed on directly in this way. As a student of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Zen philosophies with a personal mentor myself, everything that Dan's mentor, Socrates, said in the book rang true. It's one thing to simply read about ideals, but how many people truly practice them? That's where the mentor becomes so important - they are the external observer necessary to check on our real progress and keep us on course. Most people live like Dan did before he met Socrates; Dan was insulated from the world by a thick cloud of judgments and reactions to every experience that came his way. Little, if any, knowledge he had was based on real experience or wisdom. The sequence of conversations he has with Socrates form a rich dialogue that progressively opens Dan up to deeper truths about life and what it means to really be happy. Whenever Dan deliberately tries to impress Socrates with his egotistical side, Socrates shows him how much he is making a fool of himself. Yet when Dan is forced by a sudden turn of events to learn how to become humble, then the lessons really begin. Many people have termed any spiritual pursuit as an escape from the world and its problems; yet Socrates confirms that after you give up your attachments, you do not try to escape from anything- you embrace your challenges instead with real focus and clarity.On the superficial level, it's an impressive story about a young man who turns a devastating tragedy into a stepping stone for success and fame; however, don't stop there. If you read carefully, you'll see that even by the end of the story, Dan has just begun a new journey that's about much more than \\"how to succeed\\"- he is learning how to really live for the first time.-Joy S.

The key is to transform the energy of emotion into constructive action.Food:First, give your complete attention to what you are making.Second, love is one of the primary ingredients in everything you make.Purifying, regenerative practices are essential.You'll need to refine every human function - moving, sleeping, breathing, thinking, feeling - and eating. Of all the human activities, eating is one of the most important to stabilize first.That means your good habits must become so strong that they dissolve those which are not useful.Eat only what is wholesome and eat only as much as you need.The pleasure from eating is more than the taste of the food and the feeling of a full belly. Learn to enjoy the entire process - the hunger beforehand, the careful preparation, setting an attractive table, chewing, breathing, smelling, tasting, swallowing, and the feeling of lightness and energy after the meal. When you pay attention to all elements of the process, you'll begin to appreciate simple meals.Avoid foods that contain refined sugar, refined flour and meat as well as coffee, alcohol, tobacco, or any other drugs.Focus on fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.Breakfast: fresh fruit meal with occasional yogurt.Lunch: your main meal should be a raw salad, baked or steamed potato and wholegrain bread or cooked grains.Dinner: should be a raw salad and, on occasion, lightly steamed vegetables. Make good use of raw, unsalted seeds and nuts at every meal.Find your thrills in fresh air, fresh food, fresh water, fresh awareness and sunshine.Let feelings flow; then let them go.Any unconscious, compulsive ritual is a problem. But specific activities are both bad and good; every action has its price, and its pleasures. Recognize both sides; then you can make the warrior's free and conscious choice - to do or not to do. Responsibility means recognizing both pleasure and price, action and consequence, then making a choice.My actions are conscious, spontaneous, intentional and complete.There are no ordinary moments! Treat every moment as special, worthy of your full attention.Satori - a Zen concept; occurs when attention rest in the present moment, when the body is alert, sensitive, relaxed and the emotions are open and free.Your task is to expand this clarity into your daily life. Satori must become your everyday reality. Satori is your key to the gate.Meditating an action is different from doing it. To do, there is a doer, a self-conscious \`someone' performing. When you meditate an action, you've already released attachment to the outcomes. There's no \`you' left to do it. You become what you do, so your action is free, spontaneous, without ambition, inhibition or fear.The master dedicates his training to life.House Rules reveal that you can control your efforts, not outcomes. Do your best; let God handle the rest.The birth of the mind is the death of the senses.Jesus of Nazareth once said you must become like a little child to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.The dry concepts of the mind obscure your direct perception.You have to \`lose your mind' before you can come to your senses.There are two ways to be rich:1) You earn, inherit, borrow, beg or steal enough money to meet all your desires; or2) You cultivate a simple lifestyle of few desires; that way you always have enough money.A peaceful warrior has the insight and discipline to choose the simple way - to know the difference between needs and wants.The secret of happiness is found in developing the capacity to enjoy less.There is the way of the peaceful warrior and the way to the peaceful warrior. As long as you tread the way, you are a warrior. The way is now; it always has been.A fool is \`happy' when his cravings are satisfied. A warrior is happy without reason. That's what makes happiness the ultimate discipline. Happiness is not just something you feel - it is who you are. Sometimes sorrow, sometimes joy. But beneath it all, remember the innate perfection of your life unfolding. That is the secret of unreasonable happiness."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"One of My favorite books. I was introduced to it by a friend who said it will change your life! Pppfft! was the sound that came from my lips in disbelief! Little did I know that after reading it I was forever changed by what Socrates had taught and said! I had to have more! So, I dove in and read all of Dan Millman's writing that I could get a hold of! ... and each one changed my life! Thanks Dan!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Having heard it mentioned on more than one occasion that \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" was a life-changing story, I felt compelled to pick up a copy. I ordered one used from Amazon.com, and quickly started reading as soon as the item arrived. It didn't take long before I found myself completely enthralled in the story. The author does a good job telling a story that we can all relate to. Whether I believe that this is non-fiction is a different review in itself. However, I absolutely loved this book. As a forewarning, this story includes several Buddhist principles, and the author does not try to finesse them at all. However, the lessons provided within these pages are definitely worth while to people looking for some inspiration. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for something different."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Excellent book that truly forces you to analyze the weaknesses in your life and how to change them.

An easy read that is full of insight."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Let me start by admitting that I found the book very riveting except in some of the places where they start narrating 'stories'. And even within the fantasy the events seemed to be lifted from old Zen stories (for example, where Socrates keeps filling the fuel tank even though it is full - just to drive home the point that you if you are full of ideas you cannot receive wisdom). All these (like carrying the woman over the water, illegitimate child, etc) were picked up from the wonderful bookZen Flesh Zen Bones: A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writingspublished in the late 1950s. The book is also a lot irrational: the mind trips caused by Socrates touching Dan, erasing of the memory of Joy by a touch, etc., look implausible. But what I found interesting was the way Dan struggles through life to evolve physically and spiritually - that part was depicted admirably well. I wish the author had acknowledged where he got his ideas from and come clean. Once you don't acknowledge the source of stories it makes you wonder where else he has copied the other 'undetected' parts... If you haven't read much Zen, then this is a definite must read esp if you treat this as a fantasy and not as a real story."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The premise of this book piqued my interest... but it never really flowed well or made much sense.

What was the message in this book? I missed it. Laugh at life? That is a given.

It brought me center and gave new meaning to every life matters and is here for a purpose.

I read this in 2 sittings. I enjoyed it so much I didn't want to put it down. Reading it through is almost inevitable the first time, but I think this book deserves to be read slowly so that the lessons and points can sink into your mind. As I was reading, I found myself wanting to take notes, but couldn't stop reading to do so. There is so much here to learn, and it's presented well.This book is about a man who 'stumbles' upon his guru who teaches him lessons in both life and spirituality, and of disciplining one's mind and thoughts.This book reminded me a lot of \\"The Millionaire's Secrets, Life Lessons in Wisdom and Wealth.\\" There's an abundance of information here on how to \\"awaken\\" from our dream, written in story form. I think the novel style is helpful to us in remembering the information better. Humor mixed throughout also helps to bring the messages across in a real way.Excerpt:\\"To really get it, you must observe yourself to see what I mean. You have an angry thought bubble up and you become angry. It is the same with your emotions. They're your knee-jerk responses to thoughts you can't control. Your thoughts are like wild monkeys stung by a scorpion.\\""},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I found this book a true inspiration! When one thinks of the wonderful spectacle of the Summer 2012 Olympics, and the energy and sacrifice. I wondered h-m-m-m if only the world could channel that energy to relieve poverty, disease,provide decent housing,and work toward ending war. Wouldn't that be a great example of what this book encourages?"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Having written extensively in this genre myself,The Evolution of Thought (The Great Flood of Western Thought)andA Ripple in Time (Time Without End), I would say that this is definitely one of the books that changed my life. There are a few cliches thrown in here and there, and you might get a sense of \\"Modern American Buddhism\\" throughout, but I don't have a problem with any of that. If you work in an office, enjoy sitting behind a desk and enjoy living an \\"ordinary life\\", you're not going to \\"get\\" this book. But if, on the other hand, you are open to, and accept the tagline \\"There are no ordinary moments,\\" then this is a book that does have the power to change your life.But you're only going to get out of it what you're willing to put in. In other words, this book is only going to meet you half way. So, no, reading this book will not change your life. But, you might just decide you can change your own life after you finish it."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"So glad I rented this audio from the local library.

It shows you the great possibilities that are in store for every human being, most of which are untapped resources. In this respect I find this book extremely powerful and helpful.There is one thing, however, that I find to be disturbing. The story is based on fiction as well as fantasy. This fact wouldn't be bad by itself, however, the reader gets the impression that this book is a sincere autobiography - which it is not. Thus, while appreciating the fantastic story, we should not take the story itself for real. We may, however, learn from the lessons it contains."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I couldn't put it down!

If you like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Barney the Purple Dinosaur, this book may be for you. Yeah, this book changed my life.........for the worse. The 6 hours of mindless, self-absorbed fantasy drivel in audio form nearly sent me looking for a hanging tree. I stuck it out to the bitter end hoping this story would just END. I didn't care if the guy got hit by a train or got VD from one of his numerous trysts or if he ever figured ANYTHING out.

I've read and heard so much about this book and from the get-go...well I had to let it go and quickly. So bad. It appears that another get-rich-scheme has come and gone, with Mr. Millman being the winner. I wouldn't pay 50 cents for this book, I'm glad I didn't add to the profits by actually buying this. The library had a copy available. save your money. This is a work of fiction and a bad one at that. Not some life-changing read that you can't live without. Soooo bad!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Thats all I can say. Its a childish stupid book. Its ok for an 8 year old. Its naive and fantasy like. I dont know but I cant be inspired about personal growth by some ghostly figure at a gas station that teleports itself from here to there in 0.5 seconds. I'm not sure why so many people are rating it high or what they liked in it. Repeating some other 1-star reviews:- \\"This is real drivel, that might be considered precocious if written by a 12-year old\\"- \\"This book is a dip in a kiddy pool, let's try for the deep end.\\"- \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior changed me. It transformed me into a being who will never trust the title of a book again.\\" (lol)With that I also support another reviewer's comment that Nathaniel Branden is much better, if you're looking for realistic, non-gas station super man stuff.This really tells me how bad a highly reviewed item can actually be. I will pay more attention to negative reviews now. Thank you, Dan Millman. If the book was useful for any of you, more power to you."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior changed me. It transformed me into a being who will never trust the title of a book again. The degree pseudo-intellectualism and ridiculous insight within the pages of this book are only surpassed by the one-dimensionalness of the characters. I was forced by an employer to read this book and it only took a glance at the cover art and quick scan of the blurb to blow the top off of my lame-o-meter. The \\"sage\\" is a rude mystic who seems to hide every nugget of insight within a crusty coating of belittling insults. The progagonist is a somewhat dense, however sexually satisfied jock, who undergoes supernatural experiences vaguely reminiscent of peyote induced spirit quests. The entire time I read this story, I felt like I was listening to the ramblings of a person who has been brainwashed by a cult. If I were less opinionated, I would say that this book is not for me. Because I AM so opinionated, I'd say this book is not for anyone. If you haven't bought it, don't. If you have already purchased it, you could use it as a coaster."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The way of the peaceful warrior does an excellent job driving home how precious and short our time on earth is. It teaches to live less seriously but more intensely. For that Dan Millman deserves credit. On the other hand, it has plenty of falsehoods that really detract from the book's value, and some of them were downright dangerous. The mentor, Socrates, spends the book teaching Dan the peaceful warrior's way to live. Among other lessons, he drives home the point that life's goal is not gaining knowledge. Dan Millman then demonstrates his lack of knowledge in many of the things he writes. First, &quot;peaceful warrior&quot; is like &quot;sleeping insomniac&quot; or &quot;vegetarian shark.&quot; They don't go together. In one scene, Socrates is forced to subdue some attackers in self defense. Acting in self defense hardly makes one a warrior, and Socrates displays great proficiency with something similar to Aikido. Yet never does the author mention where, how, and why our peaceful warrior gained this proficiency. Second, Socrates uses tales of Ninja youths being taught to jump over a corn seedling as it grows until it reaches its full height, and the young ninja can do incredible feats. Corn was developed in the Americas, and I don't believe it found its way to Japan until after the Ninjas were largely gone. And a long daily regimen of jumping falls into the realm of plyometrics, exercise with little documented benefit and large documented risk of joint damage. Third, Dan is introduced to a strict vegetarian diet, with the exception of cheese. A quick look at any vegetarian literature shows that cheese's health benefit ranks equally with that of whole milk, ice cream, and bacon. Vegetarian with cheese is like Low fat diet and Dunkin Donuts. The book is worth reading once, and most of the lessons are valuable to anyone. But don't take it too seriously, especially any references to willful ignorance."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"It was good but it was to long the listen to the whole thing"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book is an excellent book, I stumbled upon it in school, by an English teacher.

It offers really good insight into how to lead your life in a more positive way for yourself and others. This is an excellent book for those who are, for the first time, seeking the answers to the &quot;why&quot; questions in life. For those more advanced in their spiritual journey this book may seem trite or obvious. I picked this book up during a time when I was &quot;finding myself&quot; and it was very instrumental in my discovery. On the negative, the story is difficult to take seriously and seems a little ridiculous. As a realist I had to remove the ideals from the story line in order to continue. Also, some of the ideals are unattainable to a beginner. Some of them take years to master (like giving up sex and meat!).

Here is what I gleened1-The less attached you are to objects, ideas or goals, the more happy you will be. Your happiness simply IS: it does not depend on external events.2-Hard work and getting down to the essentials of life is one way to strip away the attachments and get back to the natural self--again, the happiness that IS3-No actions are good or bad, habits and states of being areAll this is interesting, and I find great sympathy with it, even though at times it is impossible to impliment. Since Worrier is written in fiction style, it is sometimes hard to internalize each lesson in your mind--a lot of the ideas are extremely abstract. Even Dan has not really gotten it when he is so sure he has. Perhaps a summery of concepts as an apendix would help.I also wonder: Is this the path to enlightenment, or DAN's path. Are the techniques Socraties uses his, or is he shape shifting just for what Dan needed at the time.As a learning coach myself, I am not a beliver in demanding more and more, the best not being good enough. Socraties can be pretty hard on Dan, but is this his inharent approach, or just the one he morphed around Dan's initial brattiness and vainess.Please: i am inviting comments on all of the above, though i am sure i will read and learn from this book many more times."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Some ideas from this book:1) The greatest battles are fought in the inside2) Learning how to cope with experiences3) Great fables such as the farmer and neighbors, the king and the townspeople, the mother mourning his son, along others.It is light profound reading, which it the kind of reading that you can do very quickly with a profound meaning.Read it."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I enjoyed this book.

The reason is because its wonderful message reached me at a time when I really needed it. In 1991, I was purposeless and in a depression I could not come out of. It was a therapist who gave me Dan's book to read. The easy paced action and enjoyable interaction between Dan and his teacher, Socrates, absorbed me completely. I escaped into a world that filled my own world with enough hope to lift me out of my negative state. Uplifted, I began to live again.I believe the ancient truths contained in this book are the best way for a human being to live and relate to others and life. Awareness takes the ordinary and makes it extraordinary.

I cannot thank Dan enough for sharing his experiences with that crazy old man at the gas station.Recently I was cleaning my bookshelves and again &quot;accidentally&quot; stumbled upon it. Ten years later and the teachings ring as true today as they did the first time. I had forgotten many of the teachings and again, it was just what I needed to get me back on the path. Amazing how it keeps surfacing at the right times? For those of you on The Path, it's a must. For those of you who have read it, read it again.

I was young and didn't know who or what I wanted to be and I can honestly say without a doubt that I am one of the lives that was changed by \\"Way\\". It's true, as some other reviewers have pointed out, that the concepts and spirituality here are nothing new, but why try to reinvent the wheel? Dan Millman embraces ideals from a variety of places that fit together to form a framework for one of the best written stories I've ever read.The book takes spirituality to a new level by taking the core values of several faiths & religions and illustrating them through a very colourful and enjoyable story that allows the reader to cast him or herself into the lead role without feeling \\"preached to\\"."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"A friend has been raving about this book for years and years. In some ways, I was disappointed, but in others, quite rewarded, when I finally picked it up and read it.First, about its merits: when reading WAY OF THE PEACEFUL WARRIOR, keep a highlighter handy and be prepared to use it a lot. It's full of wonderful truths that will help you become a warrior whose &quot;life is not about imagined perfection or victory; ... [but]about love.&quot; Many of the truths the book has to offer, I have had to learn through experience. I rather wish I'd read it twenty years ago. It might have saved me a lot of time! It's great to have some of my personal beliefs affirmed, and of course to become a true &quot;warrior&quot;, there are things I still have left to accomplish.As for the literary aspect of the book, I found the writing rather clumsy. Most annoying to me was Millman's habit of trying to set up little &quot;zingers&quot;. There is very little craft in this book, and perhaps it would have been more honest of the author to just say what was really on his mind, without the excuse of having a character meet Socrates in a service station.A very worthwhile book. Read it for the ideas--now that you know the truth about the writing style, as Millman puts it, &quot;when you know the horse is wild, you can deal with it appropriately.&quot;"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"An enjoyable, enlightening and compulsive read, almost impossible to put down. In many ways very Castenada-esque with many similarities between Socrates and Don Juan Matus and between Dan and Carlos, although less in depth and detailed than Castenada it carries it's message and story with effortless fluidity. Not exactly \\"a book that changes lives\\" in my opinion, but a book that gives you a lot of food for thought whilst being a humorous, well-written and interesting novel. This novel shouldn't be likened to books such as Working on Yourself Doesn't Work by Ariel and Shya Kane as suggested by a previous reviewer as I don't believe it is intended to be a \\"Self Help\\" book. Dan Millman more or less covers in one small section of this book everything that Ariel and Shya Kane harp on about in their entire dull and condescending book about instantaneous transformation. I look forward to reading the sequel: Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior, and hope it is as entertaining thought provoking as this book."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I remember when an older cousin gave this book to me when I was about 15. I read it as a story the first time. But later I understood the impact of the words as they became ideas on how to view the world. The view that Dan imparts is not some complex, new age philosopy of personal power, but a simple, heartfelt path towards peace and service to your fellow humanity. These things are not achieved through some miraculous overnight transformation to an elevated state of consiousness, but through an effort to realize that nothing is here but now. An effort to make every day a living meditation. (By the way, it's not supposed to be easy... it's life not nirvana). A great read for anyone and serves as a great intro to Dan's other books."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book is a classic of its kind: one man, one teacher, on the path to enlightenment. Once the book gets rolling, it is a riveting, multi-stepped journey, dramatized by the protagonist's resistance to self-realization. It reminded me of the Kanes' book Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation. In both books enlightenment is not about finding some cure-all, but seeing things as they truly are. With the Kanes, however, you don't have to wait for a magical teacher to find you. Their books are excellent guides in having life itself carry you to clarity."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This one of my favorite books. It is not that it is such a well-written book. However, it is one of the few books that has a nice and interesting story, is easy to read and has profound spiritual lessons. There are a lot of spiritual books but few are novels which are easy to read. Another plus is that the story sets in our time and the main character a normal person we all can relate too.For me the best books are interesting novels with spiritual lessons, such as this one. I like to lend this book to my friends who are starting out on the spirtual path. They get a nice and easy to read novel and while they are at it, learn some powerful spiritual truths. I wish there were more books like these!Thanx Dan and Socrates for this truly life-changing book!Be Blessed..."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is a wonderful story, although I will stop short of saying that it changed my life, I would recommend it to anyone. I found the fiction surrounding the real characters entertaining and capable of conveying a message of spiritual growth through perception of yourself and your surroundings. It definitely reminded of how not to let life embitter when an individual is confronted with personal hardship. It has been very helpful when applying simple rules to life - rules that each of us have known at one time or another."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I read this book back in 1991. It was the right book at the right time and it was in the hands of the right person, as it turned out. I needed inspiration. I wanted to do something very different, very challenging, something that could change my life. Why I picked up this book is a memory lost in the past at this point, but it was not the kind of book I would normally ever buy. Whatever, I bought it, read it, and it picked me up. While quite a few people have read Dan's books and have seen the movie based on this book and while I imagine many of them felt inspired as well, I doubt they did what I did at age 46. Because of this book, I finally found a gymnastics coach who would work with a middle-aged guy who had no gymnastics background whatsoever. Six years later at 52, I was the oldest competitor at a fully sanctioned gymnastics meet in the US, as well as the oldest athlete member of the US gymnastics federation. It was an incredible experience. But the real story was the six years from the day I read Dan's book to the day of that meet. I would never have persevered and finally stood there with my team, the oldest of whom was 35 years younger, ready to do what had only been a ridiculous, crazy dream, if it hadn't been for Dan Millman and this book.I have no idea if this book can be of any use to you. I only know it was for me. I am thankful for that."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I first saw a trailer for Peaceful Warrior when I attended a film festival in Washington DC back in April of 2006, to see Hard Candy. I didn't quite grasp it, and forgotten it - then somewhere along the line, Peaceful Warrior has resurfaced (the June 30 release) I haven't seen it in theatres, but my interested had once again peaked. I then watched the trailer countless times on youtube. I finally saw the film, and was amazed. It had struck me, and I've decided to purchase the book right after my viewing.Last Wednesday, it had arrived, and I started reading - I have only a few pages to go before I am finished..and I can safely say, this is one of the best books I have read in my life. I do not judge it on entertainment, or on escapism or writing, or anything else (although yes! this book IS entertaining) i judge this book on the LIFE LESSON it teaches, and I can't recommend it enough. This book will be passed on to my friends and to everyone I know, who is willing to OPEN THEIR EYES and to REALIZE what has been missing in their lives. Constant thoughts were running through my mind when reading the book - and as I read it, I highlit every lesson Socrates taught. Some of them hit home so much, some of them made me realize and open my eyes a little bit (Yes, I can't say I have yet opened my eyes, I'm only a fool in kindergarten by Socrates standards!). Since reading the book, I've been practicing the lessons taught, and I've been trying to be more self-aware. I have been searching for something like this, searching for something I did not know myself - I was searching for THIS LESSON that THIS BOOK TEACHES, In movies, and in film but could never find it - and THIS is the one literary work that SATISFIES my search. We can choose to start living NOW, PRESENTLY. I will continue my journey through reading more of Millman's works, and my journey in general."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Let me see... I was loaned a copy of this book, and at the time I was self absorbed in the pointless routine of my life. I read the book in 2 days. It is easy reading, but it makes some great points. What time is it? Where are you? Who are you? Are you truly happy? Granted, these aren't things that you haven't heard before, but this book showed them to me in a different light. I do have a diffrent outlook on life because of this book. I would also recommend Sophie's World. That was also a great book."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I read this book at a low point in my life. I had never realy read much, but I was at a point where I needed direction in my life. The book has taught me a lot of important things about life and about myself. I used to be very depressed, but such basic concepts as &quot;let it go&quot; have enabled me to clear my mind and live a more healthy life. The writing style was very easy to read and the story was gripping at every point - I could hardly put the book down.Altogether it was an excellent book, the best I have ever read, it has inspired me to continue reading more and more literature."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I see that the 5-star reviews use terms like \\"life-changing,\\" \\"enlightening\\" and \\"self-discovery.\\" Be afraid. Be very afraid. Maybe if you're twelve years old this would be readable, but an adult of average intelligence - even a teenager - will find this book nearly unreadable.I am reminded in reading this that it's in the same category as the Ayn Rand novels. They \\"work\\" when you're 17, but are ridiculous at 27. Men often relate to the hero; women to the heroine. I'd be embarrassed to admit I related to either of the characters.Millman says, \\"Act happy, feel happy, be happy.\\" I agree. But the way it's presented, is, for an adult, nearly moronic. What happens when a parent is slowly dying of cancer or your son didn't come home from his tour in Iraq. The book is entirely simplistic, on a level of a four or five year old's first story books. Be sad, grieve, be anxious, nervous, afraid. Nature gave us those emotions to use when it's appropriate. And the rest of the time ...be happyThe book in brief? Accept reality - it's all there is. Stop whining. Make the most of what you have and stop feeling sorry for yourself. Make every day count, and always ask yourself, am I doing the best I can. And try very hard to accept others as they are. There. I just saved you a couple of hours that you'll never have again.And if you are absolutely insistent on reading an adult book about self-discovery, try Wherever You Go, There You Are by Jon Kabat--Zinn."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I loved the book. But the transformation from paper to kindle was horrible. Tons of typos that left me trying to figure out exactly what word was supposed to be in that place. I felt more like a copy editor at times."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"An interesting philosophy, though seemingly unatainable, which, to those non-warriors, would be the likely response.This is definitely a different way of teaching a philosophy. Way of the Peaceful Warrior is a cross between a new age, spiritual, self help, fantasy book with a touch of Gandhi. It is meant to teach the lessons that Dan had learned in his life experiences, to impart a bit of a man that he names Socrates upon his readers through a fictional format. Granted the storyline is unbelievable, but the lessons are the core of what he is trying to get across, touching upon drinking, violence and other topics and how his philosophy views them.In the beginning his style is sophomoric and forced, but as the story unfolds you begin to let go of the conventional comprehension of styles of writing and allow the story to unfold. By the end I didn't really think about the style of writing and instead enjoyed the ending.I wouldn't say 'run out and buy it', but if it is sitting around or at the library, pick it up and give it a go."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Stop waisting time and read this book, then read the 2nd book. Then read them both again and again!! This book is for anyone (beginers or those already on a spiritual path) and should be read by everyone! Its not a self help style book, its a story that everyone can relate to.This book is one of my favorites and I highly recomend it as a first read if you are new to the spiritual scene.It goes hand in hand with so many other &quot;non preachy&quot; spiritual books and it doesnt sound like a grandmother preaching the bible.If you liked - Celestine Prophecy, Power of Now, Life &amp; Teaching of the Masters of the Far East, anything written by Krishnamurti, The Spiritual Tourist, Sanctuary - Path to Consciousness, Carl Jung, Deepak Chopra..... just to name a few. or... if you read this book I suggest reading any of the above as each book is connected to the other and will point you to the next step on your path.I am a true &quot;Spiritual Seeker&quot; who wants answers to the many questions that haunt us all and have led us to the spiritual relm. I owe it all to this book as it was the first spiritual type book I read and it became the First Step on the Path to my awakening and it gave me the drive to continue to seek and become more conscious of what is.I have no idea what my life would be like if I did not read this book. I would probably still be an MTV drone like most people out there who is only concerned with themselves and creating a fake image that we like to think makes us a superstar, which I now realize is as far from reality as it gets. If the whole of society would only wake up!!!!The book is such an easy read with such an impact.. you dont even realize that you have changed until you catch yourself thinking in a different way that then makes you realize that this world we live in is fake, ignorant and is made up of bad habits. But not to worry, its a good thing!!! because the more conscious of it we are, the easier it is to get off this crazy train we call everyday life. That is what this book does, it shows us the way off the crazy train of our own life situations!If you want to break free, if you have a desire to seek for the truth, if you want to be YOU and not a fake image of someone or something.... than this book is for you!!! You wont have to dress like a monk... you wont have to light candles and incense or chant like a freak, you wont have to look in the mirror and pretend to like yourself, you dont have to give up your job and posessions. You just have to wake up and be the REAL YOU. The YOU that you have always been.... and this book will show you the way!!Now think about this...If you are reading this review and are thinking about reading this book, you ARE READY to start on your journey. Something has brought you here that is beyond our comprehension. Dont fight it, just accept it. It will change your life one way or another!!!!!Remember this - To dwell on your past is to rob your future. To worry about the future is to rob the present....We all do it and that is why we are so angry, anxious, grouchy, bitter, and depressed.So, in order to be free from the haunting past and the &quot;what if&quot; future. YOU MUST LEARN TO LIVE IN THE NOW. (how you ask? just read the book - what do you have to lose?)"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book definitely has the potential to change your perception of life.You can casually read this book or you can let your heart absorb its lessons and learn how to live a more peaceful, simplistic life. Either way it is enjoyable.This book can teach you how to slow down and actually TASTE the food you eat and feel the air you breathe. It is about appreciating life and waking up to the joys around us.I cannot imagine anyone not loving this book. It is strange to read some of the negative reviews. I guess some folks are very resistant to change.It's worth a try. Who knows, it might be the one book for you that will actually help you look at life in a more joyful way."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I read this book, which was given to me by my girlfriend, because she saw how I had been suffering recently due to the loss of my best friend. I was hesitant at first, thinking nothing could ever alter my current state of mind. It sat on the desk for a week or so, but I decided to pick it up. I had nothing to lose, besides, it came highly recommended from someone I hold in very high regard.I will cut to the bottom line. Dan Millman, in writing this book, has the ability to change lives as he indicates on the cover. If you practice even a few of the lessons and disciplines that are taught by Socrates (the teacher), you too can reap the benefits of being a peaceful warrior. I have made tremendous strides only 3 days after finishing the book. I plan on reading it again, mostly to write down or highlight some of the practices and lessons and put a strategy together to follow each day.Peace to you, D."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I remember when I first saw this book I was at a rummage sale at a church. I was in my early teens, maybe 12 or so (I'm now 27). I fondly remember my intrigue with Dan and Socrates, in the humble setting of a gas station near a college campus. The spirituality is powerful and the lesson profound, I don't remember it being a quick read, persay; nor the most mainstream transcript - but I'm still talking about the book to this day and I'd consider myself an avid reader. Great book."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman is an autobiographical book about Dan's journey from being a selfish, ignorant gymnast to a wise, caring husband. The writer of this book is a former world champion athlete, university coach, martial arts instructor, and college professor. Dan has written thirteen inspirational books so far and has had a movie adapted from The Way of the Peaceful Warrior. Dan currently lives in California and speaks at seminars and workshops from time to time. He hopes to influence others as he continues to write.The beginning of the book starts off with Dan going to college at Berkeley University. Dan was one of the best gymnasts in the country; however, being the best didn't satisfy him sufficiently. He got depressed. He had nightmares about death, and in his nightmares, there was an old man named Socrates. One night, Dan woke up from a nightmare. Since he was awake, he decided to take a walk to a gas station. Oddly enough, the man who was working the late night shift looked exactly like the man in Dan's nightmares. Dan nicknamed him Socrates and frequently visited the gas station after that. In time, Socrates became his close mentor.Socrates became Dan's teacher on how to really live life to the fullest and how to enjoy the simplest things in life. Dan didn't understand why Socrates helped him at first, but as the lessons advanced, he understood that Socrates was just trying to help him. Dan learned that experience is the key to learning and the only way to show knowledge is to act on what has been taught. Socrates knew that as Dan learned, he would find the answers he has been searching for.Dan was always a busy gymnast who never had the time to find happiness in the littlest of things. Socrates told him, \\"You are rich if you have enough money to satisfy all your desires. The easiest way is to cultivate a simple lifestyle of few desires; that way you always have enough money.\\" Socrates showed Dan how to tell the difference between needs and wants. Socrates said, \\"The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less.\\" Socrates helped Dan take a step back and breathe so that Dan would have time to get to know himself.There are so many things in this book that really make a person think about life's big questions. If you want to know what Dan learned in the end, you'll have to read the book and see what happens to Dan after he leaves college and what happens to Socrates. If you're the kind of person who likes philosophy and deep thinking, I would definitely recommend this book. I am the type of person who loves anything that involves a lot of wisdom so this book was a pleasure to read because it talks about experiences and shares lessons. If I could summarize this book with one word, I would use the word \\"Happiness\\" because that is big picture in life that this book is trying to remind us of. I think sometimes people get so caught up with work and business that they forget how to live. This book opens up reality and can really make you see the world a different way if you open your mind up to it. The book really tries to emphasize that we should do our best to live right here, right now. If you do decide to read this book, remember not to rush while reading it. Enjoy the little humor that is set in it and reflect on its ideas."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],B={key:0},C={key:1};function M(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",C,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(q,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-a48adda7"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/58.md","filePath":"glossary/58.md"}'),L={name:"glossary/58.md"},O=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{j as __pageData,O as default};
