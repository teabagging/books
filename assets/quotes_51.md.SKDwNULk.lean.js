Armstrong III and Marc Singer, respectively), the other being Net Worth \\"which builds on a number of the themes originally developed\\" in this volume. As Hagel and Armstrong point out, Net.Gain \\"systematically [analyzes] the economic drivers for value creation that exist on networks. It [uses] one particular business model -- the virtual community -- to illustrate the unique capabilities of digital networks and how these might be harnessed to create a substantial business with very attractive economics.\\" The material is carefully organized within three Parts: The Real Value of Virtual Communities, Building a Virtual Community, and Positioning to Win the Broader Game. Hagel and Armstrong also provide a \\"Management Agenda\\", followed by excellent suggestions for further reading.In the Preface, Hagel and Armstrong acknowledge three inevitable limitations in writing Net.Gain: \\"The first arises from the profound uncertainties associated with evolving electronic networks and the myriad business models emerging in the primordial brew known as cycberspace....Second, the need to be concise has led us to make some generalizations about the likely evolution of virtual communities and the key principles for success....Third, we do not expect virtual communities to be the only 'form of life' on public networks. Indeed, many other commercial and non-commercial formats (including dictionaries, market spaces, 'web'zines,' corporate sites and game areas) will thrive on these networks as well.\\" Working within these limitations, Hagel and Armstrong succeed admirably when describing the power and potential of the virtual community concept. Also, when explaining (a) how to target the kind of community to start-up; (b) the principles of a successful entry strategy, emphasizing the need to generate, engage, and lock in traffic over time; (c) characteristics of community organizations; and (d) criteria by which to select the right technology. Then in Part Three, Hagel and Armstrong shift their attention to explaining the fundamental ways in which the emergence and spread of virtual communities will alter traditional business.My strong recommendation is that this book be read first, then Net Worth. My further recommendation is that both books be used to formulate the agenda for a workshop or what is generally referred to as an \\"executive retreat\\" (preferably for two days and located offsite) with all participants required to read both books in advance. In their Epilogue, Hagel and Armstrong suggest that \\"the most radical potential impact of the virtual community may well be its impact on the way individuals manage their lives and companies manage themselves. Communities will serve to connect, much like the postage system and telephone before them. But they will go several steps further than the telephone or fax, as they help the individual to seek out and find. Souls in search of relationship, colleagues in search of teamwork,, customers in search of products, suppliers in search of markets: the virtual community might have a place for them after all.\\" Those who share my high regard for Hagel's two books (co-authored with Armstrong and Singer, respectively) are urged to check out Peter Senge's The Fifth Discipline as well as O'Dell and Grayson's If Only We Knew What We Know. Both can also help with the planning and implementing of the off-site workshop recommended earlier."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"Many networked industry managers probably still do not know what they are doing, and this book points them to a clear direction&iexcl;XVirtual Communities. Contrary to the concept that the internet industry belongs to the high-tech sector, this book tells us the opposite. In other words, doing business in the vast ocean of the cyberspace cannot count on technology alone, because what is really important here is not how good your R&amp;D ability is but how good your marketing ability is.This, in my opinion, tells almost everything. When the Internet was still in its infancy, technical research and development should be done to improve its function, but when it comes to commercialization, things become much more different, and complex. What we must deal with now is not only some computer languages or a set of codes, but also people without clear identities from places we cannot know all. From this point of view, nobody can claim a share only because they are technically competent. Marketing becomes crucial, however, marketing is a great challenge itself.From this perspective, this book is helpful in that it explains why managing virtual communities is crucial to any internet companies, gives good ideas as to how to come close to the desired targets and achieve market shares step by step, and backs up the writer&iexcl;s argument with economical theories and examples taken from experienced companies."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"If you want to know how to create a virtual community this book cannot lack in your shelf. This is the first book that deals with the matter in a way it really ripens. The authors defend the thesis that you need to do three things: To generate the traffic, to concentrate the traffic and later to maintain the traffic of visits to your community. This book is for who is really working with a digital business or wants to set up one. Besides discussing each one of these steps, it finishes with a list of what to do for the management of a project. A must read!"},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"If your objective is to gain a solid understanding of why and how the Internet has become what it is today then this is the text for you. In clear terms it explains the key components of a successful Web venture (commercial or otherwise) through the identification of browsers aggregating towards communities. That growth on the Net is not subject to marketing gurus or advertising execs but rather through an organic evolution. Sounds a bit esoteric? Not at all, the real benefit of this book is that it breaks down each statement and supposition into clear, defined terms that can be verified through real-life examples, examples which the reader can investigate on the Net for themselves (hey, you learn by doing!). There is a very useful section on the lifecycle of a Web community and how to create one. It stresses quick entry onto the Web and gives clear advice on what the entrant should aim for at each stage of the creation of their 'community'. Best of all, through what the authours call 'Fractal Breadth' it lays out how a 'community' can expand and branch out. The Final sections of the book are especially useful in that they outline how a traditional company's infrastructure should change to accommadate a Web presence. Clear, conscise, non-insulting to the intellect and focused.

This book deals with both technical and economics aspects of developing and running a virtual community.I liked the part where the book explains how a long term gain from a virtual community will be a hinderance to short term gains. It also explains how a very carefully planned cashflow plan is required to develop a virtual community.The book talks about the cumulative effects of various parameters which will lead to exponential profit increase once the virtual community reaches a critical size. It is surprising to know how certain key members of a virtual community can keep the community together."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"Net Gain posits a very deep business model, in direct contradiction to prevailing paradigms. Most executives have no idea how radically the world will change through electronic commerce. If they don't read this book soon, it will be too late for many of them to recover. I predict that at least one quarter of the dominant bricks-and-mortar category-killer retailers will be displaced by virtual communities.If you're skeptical, consider my experience trying to purchase Sony's WebTV+. I thought I would try to order it online, through Best Buy, Circuit City, etc. Guess what? All their web sites do is direct you to their local stores. So, I call my local Best Buy and find out they are out of stock, but to place a special order I must nevertheless make the trip to their store (to give them my address and credit card number!). So, I drive for 25 minutes to get to the store, waste 10 minutes finding someone who can help me, waste 25 minutes at customer service just to place an order, and spend an additional 25 minutes returning home. The whole trip took an hour and a half. Guess what? When WebTV arrives at their store, I have to go back to pick it up -- they won't deliver it to my house!Best Buy is widely considered the ascendant leader in bricks-and-mortar. Could a virtual community with online ordering deliver greater value at lower cost than Best Buy? You bet. It's only a matter of time before consumers pull the plug on this nonsense. In fact Best Buy is selling the engine of their own destruction: once Sony can reach me directly through my TV, they don't need Best Buy, Circuit City, or anyone else to push their products. Virtual communities will displace whole retail categories, to the benefit of their customers.Net Gain describes why and how this will happen. Is anyone at Best Buy reading this book?"},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"This book is destined to be a classic in the field of virtual community development.

In other ways the book is flawed. It proposes that commercially organised virtual communities are &quot;Increasing Returns Business&quot;. This may be true, but the arguments presented lack intellectual rigour. We are presented with some quantitative predictions based on &quot;dynamic computer models&quot; about which we learn little, other than that they appear to be based on the multiplicative combination of a set of hypothetical virtuous circles. Elsewhere in the book it is widely assumed that members of virtual communities will be happy to supply information to community organisers in order that they (the members) may be sold to on an individual basis. My gut feeling is that many people would not be prepared to do this. It would, in effect, be a voluntary transfer of power back to the vendor. A third criticism is that the book does not clearly distinguish between bulletin boards set up by specific vendors as an aid to marketing their own products and multi-vendor communities set up by a third party which effectively pit one vendor against another. This lack of clarity makes some of the arguments difficult to assess. The book is clearly thought provoking but, in the last analysis, it does not live up to its hype."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"I attended Wesleyan University with John Hagel, who now heads up McKinsey &amp; Company's Silicon Valley office. I knew him then to be a thoughtful, leading-edge thinker with a passion for changing the world. His latest book shows me that, after twenty-five years, he retains that passion and has now turned his laser-like intellect to developing Internet business. Hagel's thesis is that it is not enough to simply be &quot;on the Web&quot;. He sees the Internet as a primary, not a peripheral, locus for business transactions in the next few decades. Executives need to be aware of a potential &quot;end game&quot; that can drive them off the playing field if they do not swiftly move to organize and nurture communities of customers on the Net.

The &quot;hypothetical&quot; projection charts of sales and growth are indicative of the financial bubble kind of thinking that leads to... collapse of bubbles. It is critical to remember that e-retailing is still retailing and the tendency will be for margins to be squeezed as they are in all areas of retailing today. There will be no &quot;magic box profits&quot; that are extraordinarily higher than market averages because ... because markets tend to function competitively. Online booksellers, for example, are still booksellers. And precisely if teh web market grows as exuberantly as Hagel thinks it will (driven far too much by the easy access to capital), the squeeze on margins will come even more rapidly than it otherwise might. And very, very few firms will ever hope to achieve the kind of market share that a few amazing companies like Amazon have managed to gain and hold. Yes, the web is for real and will become one of the five most important media forms in America. But actually establishing and maintaining a profit margin will be much more difficult than Hagel implies.

Amazon attracts member-generated content which is a key part of its business model which uses the passionate interests of its own customer base to increase its business value. Many doubted the vailidity of this proposition when this book came out, but the evidence does appear to increasingly support it.Arguably, many might now say that this book is dated, on-line businesses having mushroomed and failed since this book appeared, yielding new lessons that this book could not have foreseen. Many of its claims now seem overhyped.While this and other criticims may all be well and true, I suspect that this book will come to be regarded in future business histories of the on-line business as one of the seminal pieces of strategic business thinking in the late 1990s.

Even though released in 1997, this book has pretty much mapped out where we are now, and possibly to where the web will evolve regarding Virtual Communities. A community is started with an initial investment - a learning curve investment - then receives the positve network effects. The web is used for three basic purposes, to find content, to interact and to complete transactions. They discuss the 'critical mass' of memebers that a community must acheive before it becomes self-sustaining. They project a curve of this new web envirinoment of villages, constellations, coalitions, to finally infomediaries (a state yet to be achieved).There are four factors of initial growth: the size of the potential community, the value of being online, the intensity of commerce, and the fractal depth of the community. The fractal depth is the number of possible sub-communities that can be developed through time.Consumer-based communites are either geographical, demographic or topical. Business-focused communites are either vertical (same industry), functional, geographical, or in a particular business category that meets the needs of other businesses. The authors discuss the virtues of each of these.A fast start-up would be aided by a strong brand name, established customer relationships, or content to keep browsers interested. Skills to get and retain members are key.The first emphasis is on generating traffic, then concentrating traffic - convincing the browsers to spend time there - you must always be expanding the offerings and creating excitement through participation. One must then lock-in traffic. This can be done by fostering a relationship between members, improving community functions, and tayloring resources to individual members. Keep the sub-communities small. Give them resources to start additional sub-communites.Sounds like they are right on track.Five Stars"},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"This is a very serious handbook for how to create communities of interest, provide value that keeps the members there, and establish a foundation for growing exponentially from day one."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"I work for a leading on-line community and for me this book was required reading.

This narrative is interspersed with the account of a pair of Irish homesteaders on Tasmania, one of them the ancestor of the main character, and the \\"original sin\\" that was committed in the main charcter's family's past that goes toward some explanation of his actions in the novel. Thematically this doesn't hold out as well as the delineation of some the characters and descriptions of daily life.One of the great setpieces is about halfway through when the monsoons hit the mine and outside supplies can't be flown in for a few months thereby preventing the delivery of beer and the chaos this creates amongst the no-longer beer-pacified miners. They have plenty of liquor but it's beer they crave. It's a memorable metaphor for the harsh irony of existence: during the dry, dusty and hot months they have plenty to slake their beer thirst but during the rains they become cruelly high and dry."},{"Title":"Moss Rose","review":"This book by Joseph Shearing is loosely(very loosely) based on a murder thatoccured in 1872 in London.IN a seedy, downtrodden part of London were many music halls. This is about BelleAdair a dancer who had come down in life about as far as anyone can go. She livedin one room in a house that rented to otherdancers. Half the time she couldnt affordheat; her clothes were ragged looking andshe went without food alot. She had seriously considered suicide which was theway out, sadly foro many of these unfortunate girls. In the room next to Belle lived, Daisy another dance hall girland on one particular night all of thegirls could hear a man,s voice in daisy'sroom but couldnt make out the words anddaisy wouldnt tell them who he was exceptthat he was a gentleman and they couldtell he was refined by his voice. laterthat night Belle steps out of her roomand sees a man darting into the streetfrom Daisy's room. The next morning BEllewent to find out all about Daisy's youngman and found Daisy lying in bed withher throat cut and a German Bible onthe floor and note written by a man toDaisy. Belle began to wonder what shecould make out of this situation. Here shewas with nothing, hardly able to surviveand she had seen the man leave Daisy,sroom. The man turned out to be a youngGerman minister who was in LOndon gettingtogether with a well known minister togo to Brazil to preach to the natives.At the trial everyone in Belle's housesaid it was his voice they had heard inDaisy's room but Belle said definitelynot. Belle at one time had been of ahigher class in life so the court tendedto believe her and let the minister go.Since the police had supposedly made amistake arresting this minister, thegovernment presented him with a checkfor alot of money. Plus he was wealthyas it was. To Belle she surely couldbenefit from all of this. After all shewas the one who got him off of anmurder charge. She went to his hoteland first talked to the minister's friendgoing on how she got the minister fromBelle,s room a hanging charge indicatingshe had information they might like tohave (Bible and notes). The minister saidhe did not kill Daisy that she probablycommitted suicide(wonder how many atthe trial believed daisy cut her ownthroat!). She tells the ministers thatall she wants is to leave the awful lifeshe has and that now they are going bckto Germany(Brazil cancelled due tonoteriety) and suggests the youngminister take her and she can be acompanion to his mother who lived in aforest in Germany.

From a distance we see the big picture of an historical event, without noticing the distortions apparent on closer inspection. In World War II, the big picture is that all of Europe ganged up on the evil Fascists in Germany and Italy, except for a few sacrosanct neutrals, such as Switzerland and Sweden. As \\"Neither Friend Nor Foe\\" points out, this is not the whole truth.At the start of World War II there were four belligerent states: Germany, Poland, France and the United Kingdom. Every other European state declared its neutrality. Only five would maintain that neutrality throughout the war: Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. This book is the story of how each of them avoided the ravages of war by a careful and varying balancing of relations with the powers warring around them.I suspect that most people view the neutrality of Switzerland as an accepted fact of European politics. In this book, Jerrold Packard shows how it was jeopardized in World War II. In cooperation with the Nazi program to unite all German people under one Reich, Pro-Nazi political parties in Switzerland supported the incorporation of at least the German speaking cantons of Switzerland into that Reich. The Swiss tradition of hospitality toward the refuges from its neighbors s an irritant to Germany. What ultimately saved Swiss neutrality was the fact that it was of more value to Germany as an independent nation than it would have been as a conquered one. The Swiss had a plan to destroy its industrial facilities and defend its \\"Fortress Switzerland\\" would have rendered useless an essential source of supply to the Germany. Switzerland survived the war as a neutral site for clandestine meetings between belligerents as well as an industrial supplier to the German war machine, at prices dictated by the purchaser. As the tide of war flowed in the Allies' favor, the Swiss willingness to supply Germany diminished proportionately.The Swedish situation was similar to that of Switzerland, in that its willingness to supply the German war machine with the output of its industry provided it with a degree of security. One concession to German arms was as its permission for German forces to cross its territory to attack Norway As with Switzerland, Sweden shifted its allegiance as the fortunes of battle changed.Portugal had been a long time ally of Britain. It was caught between the traditional British Alliance and a newfound Iberian identity. The threat of British invasion of the Portuguese colonies and Iberia itself versus the danger of substituting German vassalage for a British one was a strong inducement for Portugal to keep Iberia neutral.Spain is, in some ways the most interesting of the neutrals. Exhausted from its Civil War in which Germany and Italy had provided assistance to the Fascists, Franco nevertheless resisted strong German pressure to enter the war as a belligerent. It did provide some aid to Germany, such as allowing naval use of the Canary islands.Ireland is unique among the neutrals in that it was located squarely in the British sphere of influence. Irish neutrality was a result, in large measure, of continued hostility to an Empire from which it had won its independence only 20 years before. The tradition of Ireland as an route to invasion of Britain was also an important consideration. A major Anglo-Irish issue was the use of the Treaty Ports on which Britain had long relied to support its naval defense into the Atlantic. Had not Britain surrendered its rights a year before the war started, Prime Minister De Valera knew that Ireland would have been considered a legitimate British military target and Irish neutrality would have lasted little longer than that of the Low Countries. Throughout the war, De Valera played the card of tweaking the British noses both to convince Germany of the fact of Irish neutrality and to warm the hearts of Irish nationalists.In today's climate, any want of vigor in opposing Nazism is considered cause for condemnation. In light of the devastation suffered by the European belligerents, I think that the leaders who saved their nations from the ravages of war were leaders who served their countries well.Which individuals emerge as the most memorable leaders among the neutrals? I nominate Franco as the hero. Indebted to Hitler and Mussolini and envious of Gibraltar, an entry into the war as an Axis would have seemed to have been a natural course for him to follow. I suspect that it took tremendous courage to save Spain from another dose of the agony of war.I evaluate Eamon De Valera's record as the most mixed. His visit to the German Ambassador to extend the condolences of the Irish nation on the death of Adolph Hitler may have carried protocol to an unnecessary extreme. In his address to the Irish nation in response to Winston Churchill's victory message, he may have provided the most memorable utterance by a neutral. The address reached its high point with the inquiry:\\"Mr. Churchill is proud of Britain's stand alone...Could he not find in his heart the generosity to acknowledge that there is a small nation that stood alone not for one year or two but for several hundred years of aggression, that endured spoliation, famines, massacres, in endless succession, that was clubbed many times into insensibility but that each time on returning to consciousness took up the fight anew, a small nation that could never be got to accept defeat and has never surrendered its soul.\\"This is a rousing conclusion to a splendid book."},{"Title":"Neither Friend Nor Foe: The European Neutrals in World War II","review":"Jerrold Packard tackles the uneviable task of having to sort out how five very different countries managed to stay neutral during World War II.

Derderian combines rich, journalistic descriptions of each year's race with engaging biographies of individual runners -- winners and non-winners alike -- many of whose stories are chronicled across successive chapters. The book should be especially pleasing to those interested in reliving the era of American marathon dominance in the 1970s and 1980s: they'll not only get to read more about Bill Rodgers and Joan Benoit Samuelson, but will also be treated to vivid and inspiring accounts of perennial also rans like Tom Fleming and Patti Lyons Castalano. Equally fascinating are the tales of the Japanese, Finnish, and Kenyan runners who have enjoyed their own periods of preeminence over the years. If you are training for an upcoming marathon, you should definitely keep this volume close at hand for motivation."},{"Title":"Boston Marathon-Centennial Race Edition","review":"The book gets quite tedious towards the end, but the stories about the earliest races, as well as the arrival of women in the 1960s, are very interesting.Each year's story concludes with a list of the top finishers, which after 1966 included women (although not officially until 1972). The way the earliest women runners dressed (Carol Brady blouses and beehive hairdos) almost merit another star in itself. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Uta Pippig, the German champion featured on the cover, was later stripped of many of her awards when it was discovered that she used performance-enhancing drugs."},{"Title":"Boston Marathon-Centennial Race Edition","review":"I picked this book up while getting ready to run in the 104th running of Boston and it truly heightened the whole experience. It enabled you to pick out the landmarks throughout the course (Kenmore Square, Newton Hills, the 25 mile Citgo Sign, the screaming Wellesley girls/I high-fived one of them, the Brookline cemetery in the netherworlds of the last 5-6 miles) and most of all get a good grasp and appreciation on the history that had run before.It's amazing what a complete detailed history the author was able to put together and how he was able to pick out a unique individual aspect from each race. What stands out are the American Indians running at the turn of last century with Tom Longboat, Clarence DeMar's dominance in the 20's, Kelly Senior and Junior, Bill Rodgers, Ibrahim Hussein, and Cosmas Ndeti. They are all there with details from the race, details from the runner's lives, details of the victories, and more interesting details of the not quite victorious. What really stands out is the focus on the plight of women runners in the marathon and how difficult it was for them to break the barrier in the 60's to enter the race. Bobbie Gibb, Kathrine Switzer, and Sara Mae Berman were true pioneers and had to face harassment from race officials to even be allowed to run in the prestigious Boston Athletic Association great race. Perhaps my favorite story though is that of Rosie Ruiz in 1980 that jumped the barrier from the ranks of the spectators and ran the last miles and took credit for the women's victory for a contentious period of time. She proved a little mentally unbalanced and to this day swears she won the race. This book captures all those quirky details and puts together a great history of what the 26.2-mile jaunt in Boston is all about.I hold back giving this 5-stars because the non-runners may not find this book so engaging as myself, but if you care about the sport and especially if you are getting ready to run Boston don't miss picking up this book. Boston only gets more interesting year from year as a South Korean broke the Kenyan dominance last year and maybe just maybe Fatuma Roba will take the laurel wreath away from Catherine Ndereba.The people of Boston love this race as is evidenced by not a single stretch of the course passing by without throngs of spectators handing you oranges, water, beer. Consequently the rest of the world has caught on to the enthusiasm of the Bostonians, as Boston has become the marathon to run. There is prestige, there is sweat, there is heartache and heartbreak, and there is a wonderful history all captured in this book. Run on."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Past","review":"I looked forward to reading this book. I've never read any of Ms. Chambers' work before. In reading the blurb on the back cover, this book sounded like a great &quot;western&quot; tale, Lee Parker &quot;of the Parker Ranch&quot;, and Karen Latham the niece of an antique shop owner in the small town of Twilight. Karen inherits the antique shop upon her aunt's passing and returns to the town. It seems that she spent many happy summers there with her aunt.Her connection to the Parker family (who by the way ranches near the area, but doesn't frequent the town) was that seven years ago she was jilted literally at the altar by Alex, the younger Parker brother. Lee, who was to serve as best man, has always had Karen in the back of his mind, these past years. Lee doesn't even live on the ranch, but rather is a producer of sorts for some kind of Americana travelogue.So for seven years she carries around this venomous hatred of all things Parker. The main plot of this story seems to focus on some implausible premise of a big movie production company using the little near-deserted town for a press premiere of their latest movie. There is more writing devoted to this than the actual relationship (such as it is) between the two main characters. Lee is in town to film a story about the premiere for his tv travel series. In the midst of her trip to Twilight, she has a serious suitor 'back home' who is pressuring her to marry him. It almost seems as if her attitude is to keep him around until something better comes along.For the first 100 pages or so, the heroine doesn't even talk to the hero, other than to spew invective when she couldn't avoid him altogether. There is a brief kiss exchanged in the 120 page range, then back to the droning saga of the movie people. Then suddenly near the 200 page mark, Lee's great aunt Mae appears and has a brief conversation with Karen, and everything is (unbelievably) fine. All these bad feelings she'd harboured are negated overnight and she makes a 180 degree change in her attitude. All without any interaction at all with the hero.Of course there's a big misunderstanding, and she's back to hating the Parkers. This see-sawing almost drove me nuts to read it. There is some controversy about a legend regarding the town and Lee's team uncovers it. The movie people were interested in the town based on the existence of this legend as historical fact. For many more pages than I care to count, this was the plot and setting.The story dragged on and on and I found when I had finally plodded through it all, I was very disappointed and unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"While I imaginge this book is a very useful aid to scholars for quick reference, beware that the book does attempt to cover a little too much ground.

Is that people are assuming there is one version of a myth and that it is fact and the be all end all of it. Which its not. The Greek Myths were all originally oral work. Even that of the Illiad and the Odyseey started out as oral work. As time goes one the myths had changed before they were put into written form and standarized. I think Graves does a wonderful job it trying to present a complete picture of something that has been so effected by time, he does not attempt to give you one account of the myth and leave it as that is the only right view. He does present the different views that were held, and he documents where everything came from clearly so that if like myself your a scholar you can pick up a copy of Metamorphisis or the Theogony and find the reference in its original format/language.If you want a clear overview of the Greek Myths or just a complete view of them I would pick up this book. (Don't be scared off by the word overview...unless you want to read about 3000-4000 pages this is one of the most completle listings there is). I would highly suggest this book to anyone interested in Greek Mythology"},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"I don't doubt the knowledge of Mr. Graves on classical literature and mythology, but I feel that somewhat these works could have been put in a more organized fashion, at least for the tape listeners.

But this is the definitive edition because it gives the literary sources, from Homer to Pausanias and many others. I also own the Folio Society's slipcased, handsomely illustrated edition of the same work. For reasons that I cannot even guess at, its editors decided to omit the sources, an omission that I believe destroys its value. The only problem with the paperback edition is that it wears out sooner rather than later, but the price is such that replacing it is affordable."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"Robert Graves' \\"Greek Myths\\" is an innovative review of Greek Mythology. The book provides compiled summaries for each main Greek hero and deity. Graves then provides his own evaluation as to the anthropological origins of the myths in the context of early Greek civilization. His focus is primarily on Minoan and pre-Mycenean civilizations.Through etymology and historical analysis, Graves contends that Greek mythology is a compilation of two distinct religious practices that were later merged. Graves argues that cults for female godesses such Hera, Diane, Athena, Hecate, etc., were the product of early Greek matriarchal/amazonian societies. Graves argues that myths such as the castration of Kronos and the labors of Herakles refer to the practice of mock-kings who were used for ceremony in fertility rituals. Such mock-kings, Graves recites, were sacrificed at the end of the ritual by the Amazon Queen. Graves suggests that the traditional patriarchal triad of Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon was introduced later when the Myceneans invaded Greece and conquered these matriarchies.Overall, the book offers a direction of study that would be useful in corroborating a facinating theory about societies in Ancient Greece and how their evolution was presented through mythology. Unfortunately, as is usual with virtually an myth, the reason events usually become mythical is because there were few hard facts left behind to corroborate the truth that lies behind them."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"This was a very helpful read, i have always been interseted in Greek mythology. This book is excellent for helping students in their research and is considered as a reference book."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"Graves confirms that the only way to learn of the Greek myths is to read what the Greeks themselves wrote. If the desire is to understand what the Greek myths actually mean then Graves should be avoided. Robin Hard, in his translation to Apollodorus' Library of Greek Mythology, published by OUP, writes \\"the interpretive notes [to Graves' Greek Myths] are of value only as a guide to the author's personal mythology.\\" (p.xxxiii). I cannot agree more.Graves' immediate failure is that he remains oblivious to the ouranographic nature of Greek myth: their myths were related to the heavens. Further, Graves fails to understand the relationship of Greek myth to the development of Greek philosophy; that the key to understanding Greek philosophy, science (& hence mathematics & engineering), is the mythology. If you read Graves you will understand neither Greek myth or philosophy.In Timaeus Plato wrote that when the creator \\"had compounded the whole he divided it up into as many souls as there were stars, and allotted each soul to a star.\\" (Timaeus, 42).In Apollonius' Argonautica we read of the argonaughts who paused as \\"the goddess Persephone sent up to them the mourning ghost of Aktor's son, who craved to see some men of his own kind ...[and having done so, he] Then sank down again into the great abyss.\\" Book 2, lines 920.In Homer's Odyssey we read that \\"Rose-fingered Dawn fell in love with Orion... outraged at her conduct... chaste Artemis rose from her golden throne, attacked him in Ortygia with her gentle darts and left him dead.\\" Book 5, lines 121-124. When given directions for sailing, Odysseus kept his eyes \\"on the Pleiads...or the Great Bear [who] looks across at Orion the Hunter with a wary eye.\\" Book 5, 272-274; and once in the Halls of Hades, which lie beyond the horizon, Odysseus' \\"eyes fell on the giant hunter Orion, ... armed with a club of solid bronze...\\" Book 11, 571-575Aristotle explains to us what all this means: \\"From old - and indeed extremely ancient times there has been handed down to our later age intimations of a mythical character to the effect that the stars are gods... further details were added in the manner of myth.\\" Metaphysics, Book Lambda, 1074b.If you read Graves you will not encounter any understanding of the heavens, the basis of Greek myth, in which the planets and constellations were the detritus of times past, rendered immortal and writ large in the heavens. This absence is explained by Graves, when he extols his belief that even \\"the 13th century Excidium Troiae is, in parts mythically sounder than the Iliad.\\" p. 13. What Graves claims is that an author who commented on the myths over 2000 years after Homer actually wrote down the myths, understood them better than the person who expounded them.Instead of looking to the sky to understand these myths, Graves claims that the only way to properly understand them is when \\"archaeologists can provide a more exact tabulation of tribal movements in Greece and the dates.\\" p.20; and that consequently \\"A large part of Greek myth is politico-religious history.\\"(p.17). This is seriously misguided!Graves as becomes evident has an agenda which he lays bare when he claims Greek & Jewish myth is a product of:\\"The Jews as inheritors of the 'Pelasgian', or Canaanitish, creation myth..\\" p. 35; that is that the people of Greece, before the arrival of Greeks were the same people as those who peopled Canaan (Palestine, which is utterly unsupported by any archaeology). What Graves attempts with this ridiculous tome, is to provide a syncretist misinterpretation of Greek myth to reconcile it with the irreconcilable Biblical beliefs and he imagines he achieves this when he weaves into this his \\"matrilineal v patrilineal\\" theory as some sort of corroboration. This explains why Graves claimed that a later, Greek Christian from Byzantium, wrote a sounder mythology than Homer: the Byzantine, being Christian, had the same disposition to reinterpret Greek myths to make them more acceptable to a Christian viewpoint, as does Graves.Greek myths are beautiful if they can be understood. Graves omits the ouranographic dimension of Greek belief because, as he makes clear, he is actually attempting to reconcile it with Jewish (hence Christian) belief. No such reconciliation can work if the author is honest. The Greeks studied the heavens; the Jews were forbidden to do so on pain of death, eg. Deuteronomy 17.2-5 & Jeremiah 10.2. Graves' book is embarrassingly silly.(...)"},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"The previous reviewers are right; this is not a litererary work. What it does is give you a concordance to the myths. It tells you exactly where in the ancient sources to find a mythological reference."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"This is indeed a complete book of all of the Greeks myths, however it is only a reference. This book has very little literary flair and should be used to refresh your memory of the myths as opposed to actually learning them. Most of the myths are reduced to basic facts and rarely extend beyond one or two pages."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"I ordered the Graves book \\"The Greek Myths\\" because I was looking for book that would explore deeply the various Greek myths without being inaccessible to a newcomer--I've never read anything on the Olympian deities above a third-grade level. On the second count, Robert Graves succeeds perfectly, with an almost overwhelmingly broken down table of contents that lets the reader easily and quickly find the myths he's looking for. The prose is somewhat difficult without being obtuse--younger readers might feel out of place--but I liked the usage.On the first count, he also seems to have done a wonderful job. The anecdotes are fleshed out without being wordy, and include popular alternative conceptions. They are meticulously documented from their Greek (or Latin) sources, and eminently readable.In addition to compilation of Greek Mythology, Robert Graves includes his historical and mythological analysis of the myths. On the one hand, it is excellent, and Graves is well able to show off his mastery of mythography by finding in the myths clues for various Hellenic invasions or the deaths of various sacred kings. On the other hand (as other reviews have noted) every third page is a reference to the Moon Goddess in Triad. This in no way detracts from the rest of the work, but it dulls the impact a little of Graves' commentary for casual readers.In sum, I recommend this book for readers who have some background in the Greek mythology, but would like to learn more. Those interested in Graves' research on the Moon Goddess might prefer his other book, the White Goddess."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"The collection is quite useful as a reference. For example, if you want to find the text around a particular character in mythology, it will provide a very complete set of references and background notes. This is not the place to go if you would like to read the bigger stories as narrative.For each myth fragment, Graves structures his approach by:Recreating the primary mythCiting the sources he uses for the recreationAnnotating his view on the origins and/or meaning around the mythBe warned, Graves has his own ideas about history and the source of myth. Many people today can and do quarrel with these notions. It also is not always clear in his notes which bits are really well accepted by other scholars and which bits are his own interpretations.However, The Greek Myths is remarkable for its comprehensive scope and clearly useful as a source guide. Take it for what it is, and it proves its worth."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"In teaching classical mythology there is always a point where a student wants to know why different versions of the same myth exist. If the textbook does not adequately explain the variant sources that exist then I immediately turn to \\"The Greek Myths\\" by Robert Graves to learn the source of each variant and craft my explanation. That is because this remains the best reference book I have found for cataloguing the breadth and depth of Greek mythology, even if it has not been updated since Graves himself did so in 1955. This is because he draws from literally every scrap of ancient writing that touches on these myths and meticulously documents all of the variations that exist on every single Greek myth, including ones of which you have never heard, so be prepared for information overload. That is why this is a reference book and not one I would recommend using for actually teaching mythology (unless you are dealing with graduate students who intend to be classical scholars).\\"The Greek Myths: Volume One\\" covers chapters 1-104, beginning with the stories of creation and ending with the stories about Theseus (Volume Two deals with the Royal Houses of Thebes and Atreus, Heracles, the Argonauts and Medea, the Trojan War, and the wanderings of Odysseus). Specifically, what you will find here are the various creation myths (1-4), the births and battles of the gods (5-40), the early heroes and lesser myths (41-94), and the stories of Theseus (95-104). Clearly those middle sections comprise the bulk of this volume. When it comes to the gods and goddesses Graves deals with the Titans, gives each Olympian at least one chapter, and covers all of the minor deities. The early heroes like Orion, Perseus, and Bellerophon are covered, along with the familiar myths of Europe, Pygmalion, Midas, and Daedalus.Each myth is recounted as a narrative, with paragraphs identified by italic letters, followed by a list of sources, numbered in accordance with the text references. Then Graves offers explanatory comments divided into paragraphs identified by italic numbers. You will find cross-references from one explanatory section to another using the myth number and paragraph number (e.g., 43.4). So be forewarned that if you love Greek mythology you can get lost reading about all these variations and following the cross-references.Graves provides countless citations for the original sources, along with maps covering all of the locations mentioned and a fairly straightforward index. So if you want to know every classical reference to Sisyphus from Apollodorus to Eumelus, quoted by Pausanias, then this is the place to go. Again, I am not recommending this book be read instead of the Homeric Hymns or Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses,\\" but that it is a valuable supplemental text. It remains the book I turn to first when I have a question my mythology textbook cannot answer (yes, even before I google anything on the Internet)."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"Like no one before him Robert Graves is able to tell the Greek legends about gods and heroes for modern readers. In 'Greek Mythology' he proofs that by his outstanding way of telling stories and by his impressive knowledge of Greek mythology he can capture the imagination of contemporary readers.Greek myths didn't form a logical and metaphysical unit like the Bible does. Many variants of the same mythological story existed in the Mediterranean world.The main text constantly refers to an extensive list of notes, comments, and mythology sources after each story. At the same time Robert Graves gives one ore more interpretations - or variants - of the same story. Mostly more than one interpretation of the myth because from one story there were many variants depending the region in Greece where the story was told.In his introduction he gives a very interesting account about early societies who created the main body of mythological stories. In the beginning those societies were matriarchal (see Demeter and her daughter Persephone). Many myths can only be explained by using elements from those matriarchal - and later on patriarchal, see Zeus and his father Chronos - societies. In a very captivating way Robert Graves explains the change from a matriarchal society into a patriarchal society.Many myths tell in some kind of a literary code - for instance the birth of Athena (goddess of Wisdom): she rises out of the head of Zeus! - the change from matriarchy into patriarchy.Robert Graves's main literary source is the so-called 'Apollodori Bibliotheca' (Library of Apollodorus)."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"Second half of Greek mythology reference and stories.A swashbuckling adventure story writer Graves most certainly wasn't, but that didn't stop me reading this many times.

The Greek myths are presented in plain English, and written in chronological order, so they can be enjoyed separately or as a single, unbroken narrative. Citations from numerous sources are given after each story. Robert Graves notes even minor variations on each myth, and the notes that follow give some of the historical basis in which the myth may be rooted. Well worth the cost."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"\`The Greek Myths' by Robert Graves is a perfect example of what poets do to pay the rent when they are not writing poetry. This is, of course, a gross simplification, as Graves was also a professor of poetry at Oxford University and the author of several relatively successful novels about the ancient world, the most successful of which was \`I, Claudius', the semi-fictional story of the fourth emperor of Rome.Robert Graves was also a great student of mythology and in addition to this great survey of myths, he has written volumes on the nature of myths, in much the same genre as the great work \`The Golden Bough'. While these other works, such as \`The Golden Ass' are pretty opaque to the non-specialist, his work on Greek myths is a great presentation of the material for the layman and a great antidote to famously popular works such as \`Bullfinch's Mythology' and \`Mythology' by Edith Hamilton. I read both of these works when I was in Junior High School and was initially enamored with the Greek myths. What these popular works failed to do was to give any connection to the sources of the myths. One gets the highly illusory sense of the myths' existing in some kind of Jungian collective consciousness, with no thought given to the documents where these were first written down and to variations in the myths' narrative from different sources.One may ask why it is important to study myths, and therefore be careful about understanding the myth's documentary sources. Probably the most important reason for studying myths is that understanding them is simply necessary to understand a great body of world literature, including much of English literature beginning in the Middle Ages and continuing to the present day. I don't even need to cite Shakespeare, as there are two recent episodes of CSI which make reference to the Chimera, Icarus, and the Furies, three lesser figures from the Greek Myths. Just to include at least three more modern sources, there is a reference in a Woody Allen' film to both Narcissus and to Zeus, a major recent science fiction trilogy by John Varley is based on the names and characteristics of the twelve Titans, and a retelling of the Trojan War in \`Troy' with Brad Pitt as the great Achilles himself.Reference to myths is great cultural shorthand. Ezra Pound, a wealth of obscure literary references if there ever was one, stated that the value of writing could be measured by how much meaning can be packed into the fewest words. This, a reference to Achilles can evoke images of invulnerability, great prowess in combat, revenge, eventual graciousness to enemies, and being wronged by allies. All that from a reference to the legendary Achilles. Talk about a name to be conjured with. Don't get me started on Odysseus, especially since James Joyce already pretty well covered that subject in \`Ulysses'.One could write volumes on the definition of myths. In simple terms, they are stories of larger than life figures who may or may not be based on actual historical people. Some, but not all, myths arise out of religion and prescientific cosmology, as in the Greek creation myths. One sure sign of mythic quality is an intermixing of the human and the divine, as in the case of Achilles of the Iliad, who is a son of a mortal man and an immortal nymph, daughter of Zeus, Thetis. Some famous characters from Greek myths such as Theseus, Jason, Oedipus, and Odysseus may not have had divine parents, but they certainly had larger than live adventures with both assistance and interference from the Olympian gods or their surrogates.The book is divided into 171 stories, although many of these individual sections may be part of a larger story such as the tale of the Trojan War that takes up fourteen (14) of these sections. This division is partly due to the fact that the full story of the figures in the Trojan war may include references to sources outside the Iliad, which was not a novel written by Homer like Hemingway's \`For Whom the Bell Tolls'. It is much more like the New Testament gospels, written several hundred years after the historical events and based on oral tradition and documents since lost to history.In addition to the Trojan war, which concludes the book, and the creation myths which open the book, there are stories covering the genealogy and carryings on of the Olympian gods, a flood legend, the story of Prometheus (see the stature in Rockafeller Center), Sisyphus, Perseus, Bellerophon, Midas, Narcissus, Minos, Daedalus, Theseus, Medea, Oedipus, Orestes, Heracles (Hercules) and his 12 Labors, and Jason and the Argonauts. A perfect example of an important function of some myths is the story of Orestes and Agamemnon, where a cycle of revenge comes to an end only after the intervention of divine authority.If you are interested in this book and you happen to be looking at the two volume edition, it is essential that you buy both volumes at the same time, as the index to both volumes is at the end of volume 2. It is also important that all the scholarly trappings of footnotes, references, and alternate versions do not put you off. The stories are entirely readable without them, and you can go through them secure in the knowledge that this is how the Greeks, Chaucer, Spencer, and Shakespeare saw these stories. And, if by chance a reading takes you beyond the simple stories, there is more than enough to connect you to the original sources in Greek and Roman literature. And, as another reviewer notes, if there are questions about Graves' version, you have everything you need to check it out. You cannot say that about most other texts on these myths."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"This is not a book to read for fun.

Originally published as a two volume set in 1955 with author revisions in 1957 and 1960, this single volume text does not abridge the original text but merely confines it to a single binding.One's reaction to THE GREEK MYTHS will depend to some extent on one's purpose in acquiring it. This is an exhaustive collection of Greek mythology that far outstrips any other modern anthology that I have encountered, including myths both better known and extremely obscure. Each myth is presented in concise, graceful prose, and where possible Graves includes genealogies of the characters and major variations of each myth; an interpretive essay also follows each myth.While Graves' retelling of the myths themselves have been widely praised, his interpretations of the myths have been somewhat criticized--and justly so. Graves tends to see incarnations of the &quot;White Goddess&quot; and the &quot;Sacrificial King&quot; in every third story; more dangerously, he tends to tie the myths to historical events in a highly speculative way. While this does not undercut the interest of his interpretations, it does hold a number of traps for the casual reader, who may assume that Graves' essays offer standard, scholastically unbiased interpretations based on proven historical events.For myself, I use Graves' THE GREEK MYTHS as both reference and pleasure-reading, and I enjoy it a great deal; it is an indispensable purchase for any one with a serious interest in Greek mythology for any one who must frequently reference the same for scholarly purposes, and I strongly recommend it to them. At the same time, however, I would hesitate to recommend it to readers who have not previously been exposed to Greek mythology or who wish only a general knowledge of the major Greek myths; in such cases I would instead recommend Edith Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY: TIMELESS TALES OF GODS AND HEROES."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"I could make a hobby out of \\"Graves-izing\\" popular stories. How about Cinderella? If Robert Graves got hold of that story, he'd say something like this: \\"Cinderella's name means Ash-lady, which denotes her as the ash-pale Death-goddess of winter. She and her two stepsisters form the classic Triple Goddess. Originally, the sisters' names were probably Destruction and Pestilence. Cinderella's transformation at the hands of the Fairy Godmother was really a late patriarchal addition; no doubt the original goddess transformed herself, showing her Love-goddess face rather than her more spectral one. Her dance with the Prince is an example of the White Goddess's choice of the King of the Waxing Year as her consort. In the version that has come down to us, she loses her shoe, but certainly in the uncorrupted, original myth, it was the Prince who lost his shoe, as the sacrificial king was often marked by a limp. This can be seen in the Welsh story of Math ap Mathonwy, and Dionysos's epithets also hinted at lameness. At the hour of midnight, that is to say, the witching hour, Cinderella reveals her terrible, ravening face by turning back into the ragged Death-goddess. Undoubtedly, the story ended with Cinderella's murder of the Prince, and her mourning for him by painting her face with the ashes of his funeral pyre, as the Welsh women mourned for Llew Llaw Gyffes. The happy ending we are familiar with is actually the record of the patriarchal takeover, when the White Goddess was forcibly married to the Year-King who had become the supreme god of the new mythology.\\" Hey, that was fun!Graves wrote in a poem once, \\"There is one story and one story only.\\" This story is the myth of the White Goddess, beautiful and faithless, seducing her consort and then betraying him to death at the hands of his rival for her love. This is the only story Graves can see, and everything in this book is filtered through \\"White-Goddess\\"-colored glasses. Every myth in which a male figure dies is a record of human sacrifice to the Goddess. Every female figure is assumed to be triple, whether the myths show her in triple form or not. And he always chooses the bloodiest interpretation possible. For example, whenever the root \\"Perse\\" appears in a name, he insists it should really be \\"Pterse\\", \\"destruction\\". He is so caught up in his morbid mythos that he doesn't realize it might just really be \\"Perse\\", which means \\"light\\". So, certainly don't take this book as gospel. It is colored by the biases and assumptions of its author, and should definitely not be the only book you read on the subject of Greek mythology.That said, I was fascinated by _The Greek Myths_. I had trouble following his _White Goddess_, but this book is more structured and easier to keep up with. And it gave me some tantalizing ideas for my neo-pagan practice. Just because the history may be dubious doesn't mean this book can't be inspirational--as long as one remembers that the theories came from Graves and not from the ancients."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"Procrustes was a gentleman who made travel upon the byways of ancient Greece interestingly hazardous. He had an iron bed onto which he placed any traveler who fell into his hands. If the traveler was too long for the bed, jolly old Procrustes lopped off the excess. It the traveler was too short, Procrustes stretched him to fit. One day Theseus appeared before Procrustes' door and allowed the old bandit the opportunity to measure himself on his bed.Robert Graves wrote with the intention of expounding and explaining Greek myths. Unstated but implicit in this intention were two ideas: that there is a more or less self-consistent thing called the Greek myths and that they have a more or less consistent meaning. Neither of these things is necessarily true.The influence of Thomas Bullfinch is so all-pervasive that we are almost blind to it. He provided the English-speaking world with a convenient handbook of myths that made it appear that the Greek (and derivative Roman) world had a central core of beliefs as definable as the Bible, the Qur'an or, for that matter, the Book of Mormon. Admittedly, Graves offers some variant versions, but then, so does Genesis. Years later, Edith Hamilton, with more scholarship and a lot less charm, re-emphasized the lesson.Was it Bullfinch's intention to assemble a handbook of Greek myths? Not really. In his preface, he makes his intention clear. He was a teacher whose students were unable to understand allusions made by great poets of the English language, Shelley, Byron, Wordsworth and their ilk. His handbook is not of Greek myths but of English poetical allusions to Greek myths.In Bullfinch's time and for many generations before, classical learning consisted of a great deal of Latin and a few snatches of Greek, as demonstrated by the fact that Pope's great translation of Homer has Jupiter, Minerva and Neptune rather than Zeus, Athena and Poseidon. It followed, then, that the two primary sources of mythology for those boasting classical education were Ovid's Metamorphoses and Virgil's Aeneid, both of which were entirely artificial constructs assembled during the time of Augustus Caesar. By and large, that's where the poets found their allusions and, by and large, that's what Bullfinch gave us.Even in Bullfinch's time, the amount of mythological material from ancient Greece was greater in scope, even though it was only a tiny fraction of what once had existed. That material had a characteristic that Bullfinch suppressed: it was wildly inconsistent and self-contradictory to the point of anarchy. What two sources could be more authoritative than the poets of the earliest dawn of classical culture, Hesiod and Homer? Hesiod unequivocally states that when the children of the Titan Cronus were born, he swallowed up all but the youngest of them, Zeus. Homer, with equal authority, says that the eldest of the children of Cronus was Zeus, and that it is because he is the eldest that he is king of the gods. Then there is Pausanias. He was a born tourist who traveled up and down the Greek speaking lands, putting in at every tourist trap that he could find while writing a popular guidebook. He was perfectly happy to accept that this hero or that as buried here, there, in another place or in as many places as you want. Sightings of the gods and the rituals associated with them were even more varied. Sometimes he heard a local story that is familiar to us from Homer, but almost invariably the local story is grimmer and bloodier than Homer's version. Clearly, Homer edited out the less respectable bits in exactly the same way that Disney edited the Brothers Grimm.If there is not necessarily a consistent corpus of myths, what about their meanings? About 2000 BC, tribes of tallish, fair-haired people (see the physical descriptions in Homer of almost every Greek hero except Odysseus) who some generations earlier had bid farewell to their cousins who spoke a variant of their shared language that would evolve into Latin, moved southwest toward the Greek peninsula. They carried with them a god whose name was Zeus who undoubtedly had a consort or two or three (dozen) and a set of stories attached to him and his family. Around 1200 BC, their descendants who lived at a place called Pylos were overwhelmed by sea-borne raiders. In the burning of their palace, clay tablets bearing their routine administrative records were miraculously preserved. Their gods included Zeus, Potnia (\\"Our Lady\\") and Enyalios. Eight hundred years later, Socrates talked about \\"the god,\\" presumably Zeus, as a moral figure, using words very like those Christians might choose for their God. In Roman times, the indefatigable Pausanias jotted down that Enyalios was a title of Ares and made references to Athena Potnia (\\"Our Lady Athena.\\") Is the truth of a tale of the Zeus of a proto-Greek speaker who has never even set foot in Greece the truth of Socrates' Zeus? Are the blood-soaked superstitions recorded by Pausanias more true than the rationalized heroic lays of Homer? Would Our Lady of Pylos even recognize Our Lady of Athens?Procrustes had a number of Twentieth Century descendants. One was Robert Graves, who lopped and stretched the Greek myths onto the bed of his own imaginings. Scan down through these reviews until you come to \\"Green Melusine,\\" who very cleverly applies Graves' technique to Cinderella with predictable result. (While you're at it, look up the tale of Melusine and wonder with me why anyone would adopt that particular moniker.)The Greek myths are an intellectual and scholarly Rorschach test. In the Nineteenth Century whole universities of bearded German professors elaborately proved to their own complete satisfaction that the tale of Troy was nothing but an allegorical weather myth. They were much put out when Schliemann started digging up gold, not allegories. In the Twentieth Century Sir James Fraser, Edith Hamilton, Robert Graves and Joseph Campbell have all seen wonderful things in the Rorschach myths and have fitted them perfectly onto their Procrustean beds.But Theseus always comes knocking at the door."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"I am reviewing the two volume edition of Robert Graves's &quot;The Greek Myths.&quot;For many years I have used Robert Graves's &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; as my primary source for information about Greek mythology, but recently I have had to reevaluate the book. The book should be used with a great deal of care and caution.The need for this reevaluation started innocently enough. I was reading &quot;Hercules at Nemea&quot; a poem by Robert Graves, I wondered about the first line: &quot;Muse, you have bitten through my fool's-finger.&quot; I wondered which muse bit through Hercules's finger. So I went to his &quot;Greek Myths&quot; vol. 2 p. 104 where I read that Heracles wrestled with the Nemean lion, not a lioness, and it bit off one of his fingers, but he held it in a chancery and choked it to death. So Graves was free with his material and the poem, which makes poetic sense, does not make mythic sense. Still some questions remained like who were the muses? I was stymied there. In &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; Graves tells us who the Fates are: Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. The Erinnyes: Tisiphone,Alecto, Megaera. The Charities: Euphrosyne, Aglaia and Thalia. The Seven against Thebes:Polyneices, Tydeus, Capaneus, Hippomedon, Amphiaraus, Parthenopaeus, Adrastus, and some say Eteoclus. He even names the Sirens with all the variations: Aglaope, Aglaophonos, Leucosia, Ligeria, Molpe, Parthenope, Peisinoe, Raidne, Teles, Thelxepeia, and Thelxiope. But he does not name the Muses. In volume 1, page 53 Graves says that Zeus fathered the Three Muses on Mnemosyne with whom he lay nine nights, but in volume 2, p. 317 Graves says there are nine muses. How many muses are there? For the parentage and number of the muses Graves cites an Orphic fragment which I do not have, and Apollodorus 1. 3. 1-2. as his sources for this story. I checked Apollodorus and he states that Zeus and Mnemosyne are the parents of the nine muses and goes on to name them. In volume 1, page 55 Graves wrote that &quot;Zeus's claim to be their [the Muses] father is a late one; Hesiod calls them the daughters Mother Earth and Air.&quot; In &quot;Works and Days&quot; and &quot;Theogony&quot; Hesiod says that Zeus and Mnemosyne are the parents of the Muses (see pp.3, 83-85 and 145 of the Loeb volume #57--&quot;Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns&quot;). Perhaps Graves is confusing the parents of Mnemosyne, Earth and Heaven, with the parents of the muses. Hesiod does names the Muses: Calliope, Cleio, Euterpe, Thalia, Melpomene, Terpsichore, Erato, Polyhymnia, and Urania. Also on page 55 Graves cites Pausanius to say the number of the muses is three, but the citation he gives, ix.19.2, is wrong. The citation is actually ix.29.2.This is not the only example of Graves' carelessness or his uncritical use of material. Graves does present a great deal of material, and generally he does present lively versions of the Greek myths, but you have to remember that these books have to be used with great caution. I would recommend that you use Graves' Greek Myths in conjuntion with other references."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"I came to Graves' the Greek myths full of high expectations, having absolutely loved I,Claudius and knowing Graves' excellent reputation as both poet and scholar. Unfortunately, what I found was a textbook, not a retelling of the myths ala Edith Hamilton. I am not qualified to opine on The Greek Myths as a textbook; I'll leave that to those reviewers who teach mythology. As a lay reader, however, The Greek Myths is a bit cumbersome. Far too many of the myth stories consist of &quot;but others say that his mother was XYZ, or YXZ, or ZXY and that this happened at QRS or TUV, but still others say . . . .&quot; I found myself skipping entire paragraphs to avoid all of the variants on the main story. Graves' description of the Trojan War and Odysseus' journey are very well-done but are too little, too late to make the work as a whole truly enjoyable. The commentaries range from interesting to deadly dull - again, in this lay reader's opinion.Bottom line, if you merely enjoy reading the myth stories you learned in childhood stick with Edith Hamilton. If you are looking for a more detailed *textbook* (or, as others have said, a *reference* book), then pick up Graves."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"Many of us had to suffer through some rehashing of classical mythology when we were in high school, as often as not Edith Hamilton's book &quot;Mythology.&quot; While having the stories re-told to us when we were young is a part of a literary education (a dwindling part, sorry to say), sooner or later you have to graduate to a more authoritative retelling of the myths, to use as a reference and a doorway into other disciplines, such as anthropology.Graves' book fills that gap. He provides sources for all of the myths he tells, and gives variant readings. He also retells what the classical authors had to say about the myths, and gives a wealth of etymological information about the myths as well, which given that Graves was a formidable classical scholar is saying quite a lot.The only reason I'm not giving this book five stars is because like a great deal of Graves' anthropological commentary in his various books, what he has to say is out of date. I suppose that this was inevitable with the passage of time, but on the whole this does not detract from the literary effort. Graves is still the only classical mythology reference on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"This book was a revolutionary work in it's time. It examined the Goddess religion and pre-Greek beliefs in an objective and interesting way. The fundamental problem with it is that Graves was not an anthropologist. He links practically every Greek myth with Pelasgian/Minoan king sacrifice rituals. This is really irksome in that while the Pelasgian/Minoan model was neglected by chauvinist academics for years and years (and still is), he makes some statements about pre-Greek Aegean culture which is pure conjecture and presents them as fact. Also, he states that Orphism came about because of Egyptian refugees fleeing from the Amonist backlash against Ahkenaton. Never mind that the dating does not work and he presents absolutely no material proof for this. He does this type of thing through the whole work. The bottom line is that sometimes he is dead on the money and other times he could be talking about \\"Star Wars!\\" The basic problem is that Graves approached the subject inductively, rather than deductively. So, one MUST read this book with a critical mind."},{"Title":"Greek Myths 1 & 2","review":"Despite being nearly 40 years old, Robert Graves' brilliant mixture of poetic prose and scholarly exegesis continues to make his Greek Myths a stunning read as well as a valuable resource for ancient greek mythology. As a poet, novelist, classicist, translator, historian and literary critic, Graves' had the ability to blend &quot;poetic intuition&quot; with scholarship to bring the myths of a distant time to life. As Graves himself always claimed, the ancient past is no less knowable than a contemporary political cartoon; however, a contemporary political cartoon seems easier to understand than an ancient myth because it's a product of what we know well. Graves sought to bring the past to life so that the ancient myth would seem as current and knowable and understandable as the present. Classicists and historians often reject Graves *because* he demystifies the knowledge they claim as their own.Anyone at all interested in Greek mythology must come to own Graves' work. They can serve themselves well by also reading his The White Goddess, and The Hebrew Myths.

At his best, there is no one better. His storylines take you places and show you things you have never even imagined.Unfortunately, the premise for Dead Aim doesn't stretch credibility, it tears it up into little pieces. Here is what we are expected to swallow:A month-long \\"self defense\\" school for rich people that costs over $1000 a day, where students are screened for revenge issues and those students are discreetly told that they can \\"hunt\\" their enemies (or some stranger) for $25,000 a head. For this $25K, the customer gets individual training from several people, who also research the target, set up the spot for killing him, and also kill all witnesses (five in one case we see, four in another) who see the customer make the assassination. This goes on for several YEARS.We are to believe that this school schedules multiple murders involving rank amateur assassins, and no forensic evidence or routine police investigation work (i.e. who had motive and opportunity) ever trips them up, and NO ONE of these amateurs ever says something to someone who says something to someone else who drops a dime. We haven't seen fiction this implausible since Clancy's Rainbow Six.Finally, there is one *massive* coincidence near the end that is inexcusable and unnecessary. You'll read it and want to throw the book down."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"Thomas Perry is a great authors-- his books are fun and suspenseful-- great 'beach' reading for the summer. Those are all true of &quot;Dead Aim&quot; as well. The only problem is that the plot is completely unbelievable.The protagonist, Robert Mallon finds himself being hunted by an unknown assailant after delving into the life of a woman who he has unsucessfully tried to stop from killing herself. This sounds like a fantastic plot device, but instead of developing the character and flushing out his conflicts, Perry falls short-- the last 300 pages are reminiscent of a video game, with Mallon killing anything that gets in his way. The ending is predictable, though completely unbelievable were this in reality.If you're a Thomas Perry fan, or if you have a very good suspension of disbelief mechanism, then you should definitely read this book-- it's a fun read."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"A calm, almost affectless manner accentuates the jarring discordance of violence in Edgar Award-winner Perry's (\\"The Butcher's Boy\\") latest thriller, which begins with the protagonist's rescue of a suicidal young woman from the waves off Santa Barbara. Robert Mallon, a successful builder who struck it very rich in a development deal and then retired after his divorce, has been in a stall for ten years. The girl, who won't even tell him her name, awakens something more than his Samaritan instincts and when she succeeds in killing herself two days later, Mallon determines to find out why.What's begun on a whim turns deadly as Mallon and his private-eye friend, Lydia, probe, uncovering different, contrasting sides of Catherine Broward, unearthing uglier, sadder secrets as they go. The reader will be well ahead of Mallon in figuring out why Catherine killed herself, but the reader has a fair amount of help, as Perry keeps pace with Mallon from the viewpoint of Parish, a rather stereotypical (but no less scary for that) mercenary hunter.As always Perry's writing is a pleasure and from Mallon's quiet, dogged awakening emerges a man of determination and thoughtful sympathies with a growing understanding of how little we can know anyone and how easily people dupe themselves. There are, however, some unbelievable plot elements. Take, for instance, the idea that affluent white people - and all witnesses - could be efficiently dispatched without anyone making a fuss. But a less-than-stellar Perry is still head and shoulders above the pack."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"Thomas Perry's &quot;Dead Aim&quot; is the suspenseful but ultimately far-fetched story of Robert Mallon. Mallon retired at thirty-eight with a hefty bank account, an ex-wife and a great deal of time on his hands. He lives a low-key life among the affluent residents of Santa Barbara, California. Now, at forty-eight, his life has settled into a predictable rhythm.This rhythm is disrupted when, one day, Mallon pulls a suicidal young woman out of the ocean. The woman refuses to tell Mallon her name, and not long afterwards, she disappears without a trace. Mallon has the time and money to find out the identity of this woman and he decides to hire a former colleague, Lydia Marks, to help him with his investigation. Too late, Mallon discovers that he has placed himself and Marks in grave danger by meddling in this unknown woman's affairs.Perry's fast-paced narrative and crisp dialogue make &quot;Dead Aim&quot; an exciting and suspenseful thriller. Unfortunately, the truth behind the strange events that Mallon uncovers is absurd. There is one particular coincidence that will make you groan. What a shame. Perry is an extremely talented writer and Mallon is one of those good-hearted and straightforward characters whom you can't help but like. The action sequences are nicely done, but Mallon's ability to take on his enemies make him seem more like James Bond than a retired construction worker. &quot;Dead Aim&quot; is an enjoyable escapist novel of suspense, but you will need to suspend your disbelief over and over again as you read it."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"Robert Mallon, in his forties and retired in affluence for ten years, is stolling along a beach near his home in Santa Barbara, California.

However, the next day, Mallon hears of the young woman's death. He wonders what drove her to suicide and looks into her past. He hires a friend, PI Lydia Marks, to look into this stranger's death. They soon find themselves up against a network of assasins run by a paramilitary leader named Parrish. He inexplicably begins to hunt Mallon in a game to the death.DEAD AIM is one of the weakest novels written by Thomas Perry in years. The plot lacks any real basis in reality. Mallon is a less than inspirational hero which leads to a lack of reader empathy. Stereotypic characters abound in this predictable and silly tale."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"Thomas Perry has written a number of excellent thriller; his last one, Pursuit, was well-plotted. Unfortunately, Dead Aim features uninteresting characters, a dubious premise, and an unbelievable ending. The main character, Robert Mallon, is a successful builder forced into an early retirement after a bitter divorce results in him having to sell his business. The plot begins with Mallon saving a woman from committing suicide, only to have her later leave him and finish the job. He eventually discovers that she killed a former boyfriend; she was given training in how to do this from a group of people who run a self-defense camp and who will help their trainees kill people for a fee. Since the trainees kill their victims for a motive (this is not a camp attended by serial killers), one would expect that they would be questioned by the police at some point, and that sooner or later one would give away the scheme. However, nothing like this ever happens.Not helping matters is that Mallon is a very bland character. A female private detective he hires is more interesting but doesn't survive long enough to carry the book. ....Let's hope that Perry's next book is a return to form."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"\\"Dead Aim\\" sets up an interesting situation: A man, Mallon, saves a young woman from committing suicide, which she eventually does anyway. He then gets sucked deeper into her life and its aftermath than he ever intended. The story starts off well, but eventually becomes implausible beyond belief. But even with that, I was willing to along for the ride. My biggest problem with it was the fact that we so often leave the main character behind to focus on those who are after him. A little of this would be fine to enhance the feeling of peril for Mallon. But way too much time is spent on these people and way too little time is spent on Mallon and his attempts to extricate himself from the tangled web in which he finds himself.Also implausible is the fact that just about everyone that Mallon comes across in the story, including people he's known for years, are tied into the bad guys. That truly stretches our willingness to buy into the story.And then there's the ending. Instead of satisfying it simply boils down to a standard shootout.Still, with all these issues, I kept reading to the end. Part of it was that I kept hoping it would get a little better. But part was that I was simply interested to see how Mallon would get out himself out of the mess. And though the end was less than satisfying, I would still be willing to give Thomas Perry at least one other chance."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"I am a big Perry fan. I loved Butcher's Boy, Sleeping Dogs, the Jane Whitefield series, and Pursuit. I was not so crazy about Death Benefits. In fact, I can barely remember the plot.This one has to be the worst. The plot was too incredible, the hero was too boring, and there was no investigation to speak of by either the police or the hero. The most unbelievable thing was how kick-ass the hero was, even though Perry gave no rationale for why this was so."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"This novel seems to be two books. The first half was a bit slow. I kept thinking that this needs to pick up some pace. Not much by way of character or plot development. I toyed with putting it down.But then I hit a part in the book where things began moving quite nicely. To be honest, I went back a few pages and re-read, fearing that I'd missed some transition - the difference was that apparent.By the end of the book I was enjoying the characters and twists the author threw in. There were a few gaps in the action (things where you think to yourself...'I'm not really sure it would happen that way'), but all in all this was a decent book. If the first half had been better I would definitely recommend. As it stands now, I'd say read Perry's novel \\"Pursuit\\" - it's much better."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"\\"Dead Aim\\" is my least favorite Thomas Perry novel. The events that occur in this book are just too difficult to believe or accept. For starters, Professionals kill an entire family of four including a five year old, to eliminate one potential witness to murder. Robert Mallon, the main character, saves a young woman from drowning, has sex with her, goes for carry-out, and returns to find her gone. After learning she committed suicide, he becomes obsessed with the idea of learning why she did it. Of course, he is rich and bored. It turns out she was guilt-ridden over murdering her low-life ex-boyfriend. She was taught to kill, and assisted in the actual murder of her boyfriend by a school that teaches the idle rich how to hunt and kill other humans for revenge, and sometimes with special students for fun and excitement. When Robert Mallon attracts the attention of this school, they send two four-man squads of trained killers after him to rub him out. He is untrained, has no warning, and the killers are strangers to him. Still, he manages to get the drop on them and kill several of them. Then he goes to the school at night and wipes out everyone there. You'd think he'd have a lot of explaining to do to the police, but he just plans to go away somewhere and build a house or something. I'm hoping in Perry's next novel \\"Nightlife.\\" due out in March 2006, he will return to the tightly constructed plots and interesting characterization of his earlier works."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"This is a decent book by a writer who has written a number of great thriller books such as Metzger's Dog, Butcher Boy etc and the Jane Whitfield series. Mr Perry at his best, is reminiscent of Ross Thomas but in this book he has fallen back to the pack a little. Nevertheless, I look forward to his next book eagerly."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"Robert Mallon is content with his life. A millionaire as a result of hard work and accidental perfect timing when his divorce forced him to sell off his homebuilding business, he lives quietly on the California coast. Then he sees a beautiful young woman walk into the ocean and attempt suicide. He rescues her, but then she goes away and is successful on the next try. Haunted by his inability to reach her, and by unresolved issues from his sister's suicide years before, he begins to investigate the young woman's life in an attempt to understand why. The investigation raises even more questions, and then his friend who is helping is killed, and someone tries to kill him. The result is an intense, gripping story. There may be flaws: maybe one or two coincidences that strain the suspension of disbelief, and a middle-aged somewhat sedentary man is unlikely to be able to foil the machinations of young, trained, dedicated, and psychopathic killers. Still, the story captures the imagination and the skilled writing captures the attention."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"I almost did not buy this book because of the editorial review and glad I decided to get it anyway. As always, Perry makes this an engrossing read and a fast one. He delves into an interesting premise of doing something good by saving a life and ends up getting involved in murders and a creepy expensive self-defense training school. If you enjoy reading to escape, buy the book."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"Thomas Perry does it again. This is a great read that you will not want to put down. As the story starts, all sorts of &quot;potential plots&quot; come to mind. If Perry is in the process of developing new characters, he sure has a great one with Bob Mellon. The story is full of twists and turns with a surprise ending. A copy of all of Perry's books are in my small library. It is a pleasure to report the success of his latest novel. It always is a dreadful thought to consider how long it will be until his next release."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"As we scramble to cope in a world imploding from violence, self-defense training has become as common as swimming lessons and drivers education. Women of all ages are attending classes in marital arts and increasing numbers of citizens are arming themselves and heading for shooting ranges. In Thomas Perry's fertile mind, it follows that some savvy entrepreneur might market the ultimate self-defense experience, a sort of pseudo-military resort, in which the insatiable rich can reap the practical skills to thwart potential assaults and the bragging rights to the hottest trend within their social circle. It is this camp --- The Safe-Force School of Self-Defense --- that becomes the center of the concentric ripples of violence in Perry's latest mind-blowing thriller, DEAD AIM.After the initial murder scene hits you straight between the eyes, the story switches cadence with the protagonist, Robert Mallon, rescuing a young woman from an attempted suicide on a California beach. After the intimacy of their encounter, Mallon is stunned when the young woman kills herself a few days later. Ridden with guilt because he wasn't able to dissuade her, he becomes obsessed with learning why Catherine Broward felt driven to end her life. Mallon hires Lydia Marks, a private investigator and former law enforcement colleague, to help him sort through the troubled woman's past. They soon discover Catherine had been romantically involved with a man whose unsavory alliances may have resulted in his murder --- the murder that we're witness to in the opening pages of DEAD AIM. Was Catherine running in fear of those same assassins that murdered her boyfriend? It seems like a plausible explanation, particularly when it is revealed that she spent the previous month attending an exclusive self-defense school hidden away in the hills above Santa Barbara. But the police are uninterested in reopening the case and the school's headmaster refuses to reveal information about his students, forcing Mallon and Marks to dig deeper into Catherine's puzzling life. When Mallon suddenly becomes the target for a group of unknown assassins, it appears that his benevolent intentions are unearthing a much darker secret, affirming his preliminary theory that Catherine's death may not have been a simple suicide.The fundamental storyline alone would make DEAD AIM a compelling novel, but it's Perry's originality that puts him head and shoulders above mainstream thriller writers. Not content to examine one central character from all of his or her angles, Perry probes the multiple minds of protagonists and antagonists with a precision that eliminates the usual extraneous detail and ignites the reader's speculation. Michael Parish, master of the self-defense school, is unnervingly evil and manipulative; his dedicated staff a cross-section of intelligent, highly skilled misfits. All come complete with a sufficiently murky background, a lack of moral conscience and a frightening thirst for violence. As Perry's underlying premise of The Safe-Force School takes a leap into the scarier extremes of what humans are capable of, the plausibility of his masterful fiction is thought provoking and disturbing.Robert Mallon seems, by contrast, the more comfortable composite of ordinary emotions. His obsession with Catherine's suicide is driven by a personal despair --- the type of tragic life experience that leaves wounds that never heal. He reflects our own frustrations in trying to grapple with events that are out of our control and the inevitable rage that results when we try to and fail. The only troubling question for readers may be in rationalizing the Samaritan turned aggressor in the final confrontation. Some reviewers have found this to be a weakness in Perry's otherwise well-crafted storyline. This reviewer believes they've missed the point entirely.While Thomas Perry's remarkable body of work continues to inspire many notable writers whose names frequent the bestseller lists, his name has remained relatively unknown to the reading masses. His Jane Whitefield series has recently broadened his audience with the happy result that some of his earlier out-of-print novels will soon be reissued. What is his reasoning for eschewing the limelight? \\"It has always seemed to me that the least interesting thing about a book was its author.\\" With sincere apologies to Mr. Perry, I've continuously done my best to undermine that philosophy in the last several years.

Robert Mallon, retired from the construction and property development business ten years ago, now lives quietly and simply in Santa Barbara, going for long walks on the beach and reading a lot. One day he saves a young woman from drowning herself, loses track of her, and then learns she went off and killed herself anyway. He has to find out why. And that modest quest leads him gradually into a confrontation with a group of hunters who pursue the real sport of kings. And this quarry is more than they expected. As always, Perry does an excellent job on the back stories of his main characters, and even some of the supporting players. At the beginning of the story, he deliberately allows the reader to become a bit confused about what's happening -- in other words, experiencing things mostly from Mallon's viewpoint. Then, as you meet the others, things become more clear. However, the ending is a bit abrupt and untidy, leaving you to wonder what happens next.

I always groan when I find another one, as it means I won't get any sleep that night. It's a real problem.Dead Aim keeps driving forward. Thomas Perry is especially interesting in that in some books he goes into the psyche of some truly bad guys. And the scary thing is ... we go right along with him.

Sorry, no cigar this time, Senor."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"In his recent books, Thomas Perry has extrapolated on the human potential for both good and bad. In Dead Aim he offers the possibility of providing wealthy, jaded people with the opportunity to kill people. It's an intriguing concept in that very few of us haven't at some point or another declared--out of upset or anger--that we'd like to kill so and so.Perry's central figures are always thoughtfully constructed and believable. Robert Mallon, hero of Dead Aim, is a decent, good-hearted man pushed by the suicide of a young woman he's rescued from a first suicide attempt to try to comprehend why she was so determined to take her life. Anyone who has known a suicide wonders about the reasons. It's an act so shocking and so counter to the majority whose optimism (no matter how minimal) and whose life-curiosity keeps us ticking along day after day that it's difficult to grasp the concept of an interior darkness so deep that no light can illuminate it.So Mallon sets out to find answers and becomes a target for the wealthy killing machines who've been trained at The Safe-Force School of Self-Defense. And he manages repeatedly to survive the attempts on his life.Where the book falters is in the final confrontation(s)--Mallon single-handedly taking on half a dozen highly trained assassins. Without sufficient background information to substantiate it, he morphs from mild-mannered, decent fellow into someone so skilled at and knowledgable of armed combat that he emerges Rambo-like as the victor. It's an ending that is, on the one hand, very satisfying: the good guy wins, the bad guys lose. On the other hand, it's a little hard to buy.That said, this is--as always--another enjoyable effort. Reading a Perry book is never a waste of time. Any writer who can make you think is a good writer. And if you can remember anything about the book half an hour later, then the author is better than good. Always intelligent, Perry's writing is lean and well-constructed. The idea of a high-priced killing academy is not inconceivable. And despite a slightly abrupt ending, Dead Aim is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Dead Aim: A Novel","review":"See book summary above.An invigorating and tightly written novel that you've come to expect from Thomas Perry, with a couple exceptions.The character of Robert Mallon was indeed shallow.

One is never really sure.And where the heck did this guy at the end come from? Sure his name was Mallon but no where did I see his nickname as 'First Blood' Mallon.An overall entertaining novel with a couple flaws."},{"Title":"Why the West was Wild","review":"Review By Robert Young, Lane ESDwww.lane.k12.or.us/bookreviewWhy the West was Wild provides a fair amount of information about certain aspects of life in the Western United States from the mid to the late 1800s. The author focuses on law and order during this time period and provides information about different well-known criminals and officers of the law. Because this is a paperback book and not library bound, it will not survive many readings. This book is informative and provides some details which the young reader may not readily find in other books about the West in the late 1800s. Many of the pictures in the book are authentic and thus give the reader a real life view of the people during this era.

Black-and-white as well as color illustrations and photographs nicely bring to life this fascinating survey which devotes a two-page spread of basic information to a wide variety of topics including Old West Boomtowns, Cavalry, Range Wars, Indian Wars, and much more.

My understanding is that someone who \\"attains the age of reason\\" is someone who is willing to act decisively and to take responsibility for his actions even if it might result in a loss of personal freedom. Well, Matheiu appears to be more free at the end of the novel than he does at the beginning even though he did act decisively at the end of the novel with regards to Ivich and Marcelle. Is Sartre trying to suggest that acting decisively and assuming responsibility actually increases one's freedom? In that case, what is freedom? Does one exercise one's freedom by asserting responsibility? In Mathieu's case, I guess he got lucky because his actions at the end of the novel, which he might have ordinarily expected to have reduced his freedom, actually ended up increasing it. The fate of Daniel, with the loss of his personal freedom, was his just rewards for being such a villain throughout. Does anyone know whether Marcelle in this book and Paula in Beauvoir's \\"The Mandarins\\" is actually the same character? An unsatisfying element of Age of Reason is the question of Boris - what happened to him? Also, Lola left the book angry, and that anger went unresolved. The character Bobby made a brief but unforgettable appearance. Why did Sartre choose not to develop him better? Maybe I should read the next two books in the trilogy! Anyway, good book....not heavy reading as commonly assumed...but does give brief pause for thought. I think Sartre's existential ideas are out-dated now, but at the time of writing they were probably very intriguing. To me, Sartre comes off as self-obsessed and a bit immature. The recent biography of Sartre and Beavouir by Hazel Rowley reinforces that notion. I would not trust Sartre to keep an appointment, for example. That's the problem with these folk who are obsessed with their own personal freedom. They make bad buddies."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"When does a broke philosophy teacher with a pregnant mistress attain the age of reason ? How can &quot;philosophy&quot; (read higher consciousness), &quot;freedom&quot; (read utopia), and &quot;a life that doesn't cause misery to oneself and others&quot; coexist ? Is that at all possible ?Sartre ponders upon these questions as does Mathieu, the central character of this book. Mathieu is obsessed with the idea of freedom and does not want to lose it at any cost. On one hand he refuses to marry his mistress of 7 years and on the other, he refuses to join the Communist party when asked by his best friend. Sartre examines the ambiguity of freedom and philosophical formulas at a time when the need for collective effort and active involvement was acute.The dialogues between Mathieu and other characters - his friends,his brother, his mistress are engaging. Still, at times the book seems a drag but I guess that is because Sartre is painstakingly descriptive about some of the &quot;vacant&quot; characters.Sartre does not come to any conclusion in this book (of course, its the first in the trilogy), yet does not leave the reader unsatisfied(you know what I mean). Personally I didn't find Sartre's ideas in this book to be either original or truly brilliant. What I love about the book is the writing.

The rest of the novel is Mathiue's attempt to remedy the situation and presrve what freedom he has before it is lost forever.One of the overall themes of this novel is freedom and the individuals attempt to remain free.

Sartre addresses a topic the Simone de Beauvoir does in All Men Are Mortal, what does it mean to be really free? As the main character Mathieu deliberates on a lifechanging choice, the scourge of World War II threatens Paris and his way of life. But an inner battle rages, too (apologies for what may be too heavy-handed of a metaphor...) and Mathieu realizes a period of his life is coming to an end, no matter what his choice. The theme Sartre and de Beauvoir have in common? When men and women are free to make their own choices, we must sit helplessy by as they often make the wrong, wrong, wrong ones.Sartre and de Beauvoir both illuminated, to me, the principle that freedom is the goal. The choices humanity makes using that freedom can be devastating, but the option to make devastating choices is an irrefutable aspect of life, and, to my mind, is a very compelling one.I approached this novel by Sartre, after reading Nausea several years ago with some trepidation, but with determination after spending a lot of time on de Beauvoir. I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The story was lifelike with a philosopher's vision and view, a slight aloofness that gives the reader a window not only to the life of Mathieu and his circle but also to Sartre's philosophies and carefully worked out beliefs."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"Like many of his more philosophical works, Jean-Paul Sartre dealt with almost taboo (at least in the 40s) social issues on the Age of Reason, usch as abortion, concubinary, the quest for personal freedom, and the government.

A penniless professor, he impregnates his girlfriend, Marcelle, then schemes to beg, borrow and steal to pay for her abortion. Mathieu even toys with the idea of marrying Marcelle. Mathieu is also in love with Ivich, a young woman whose self-inflicted wound Mathieu childishly emulates on a dare. Sartre's novel also contains a self-hating gay man, Daniel, who plans to save Marcelle, but only by further degrading himself and Mathieu in the process.Sartre's writing style is true to life, naturalistic, and is never less than totally engaging. With the author we visit various Paris nightclubs and bars which have just the right touch of darkness and sleaziness. Sartre's characters are hopeless but recognizably human. Lola, a sad, aging nightclub singer, deeply in love with the completely useless Boris (Ivich's younger brother) evokes strong sympathy nonetheless. Even Mathieu, as despicable as his conduct often is, believes by the end that he has finally \\"...attained the age of reason.\\""},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"Its paradoxical, sardonic, satiric, and pedantic... its a glance into Sartre's life.

On the other hand, if the concept of Freedom is approached with good faith and an eye towards the chaos of stars, this is a dreary, depressing, godawfully tedious vision of the creative possibilities of freedom. With friends of freedom like this, who needs enemies? In my view, Nausea is a thousand times more powerful than this book, which despite its sometimes bleak tone, has more ambience and frankly more conceptual power, which makes it more affirmative. Of course the power of freedom includes the possibility of making bad choices ; how redundant. I'd rather see more monstrous choices. He could afford to be dark rather than dreary, surreal rather than realist in a dull fashion, and give us a sense of possibility : the possibilities for monstrous transformation. These are present in Nausea, where we get a sense of the world slipping from a man in order to open up an incredibly fertile chaos, and through this the possibility of losing the cage of humanism and discovering the beauty of insanity, our true nature, which gets covered over by the fetters of identity and roles with which we condition ourselves. This is the positive message of existentialism, one in which we lose our humanity not to discover an inhumane or poorly botched set of choices, but an alien consciousness whose botches are brilliant and full of surprise. These people's lives are boring and unexplorative ; they need to break loose from their stupid normality and discover the wildness of being. Maybe Sartre was on quaaludes when he wrote this ; in any case, I far prefer Nietzsche's existentialism to this tedium any day."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"My big problem with this book is that it is so ridiculously tendentious. That is, it so obviously serves as a mere vehicle for Sartre to get his &quot;existentialist&quot; (or whatever you may call them) ideas across. The characters are (purposefully, of course) insipid and full of a malaise that makes for plodding reading except for Sartre's most devoted recruits (and there are quite a few of them to judge from the reviews).All that really happens, so to speak, is that the book's protagonist, Mathieu, wanders around with acquaintances of various sorts (one can hardly call them friends or lovers, in any substantial sense of those terms) wondering what to do about the pregnancy of his mistress and how to finance her abortion.&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; ostensibly, as referred to in the book, indicates Mathieu's own age, 34, at which one is supposed to shift from a restless, Bohemian existence and settle down to responsibility. On the deeper, more ironic level, it is a prolonged sneer that the so called Age of Reason (whose French exemplars include Descartes and Voltaire among others) is now debunked and effete, and that we now know that (as shown by the characters in the novel) there is no real rhyme or reason behind men's actions. Man is not, &quot;the rational animal&quot; as Aristotle would have it, and the onset of WWII is there to prove it.As Mathieu puts it, &quot;Perhaps it's inevitable; perhaps one has to choose between being nothing at all and impersonating what one is. That would be terrible,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;it would mean that we were naturally bogus.&quot;The thing is that there's nothing particularly new or original even in the philosophy as spelled out above. Shakespeare said the same thing hundreds of years ago, &quot;All the World's a stage, and we are merely players.&quot;Simply put, I can't stand this sort of rot. Even the enthusiasts of Existentialism and the &quot;condemned to be free&quot; mantra have a hard time making sense of it and are still pathetically quibbling over what these terms mean.Look, if you want to read great French literature, read Proust. If you want to see the barren meaninglessness of life displayed in remoreseless detail, read just about anything by Paul Bowles.This book, as the main character says of himself, is a washout. If you think you're reading something profound here, you're fooling yourself...much as Sartre did."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"If this novel had been my only exposure to existentialist thought, I never would have considered the philosophy seriously. The characters in this novel are so obnoxious I'd feel more comfortable hanging out with Dick Cheney in a dungeon full of scorpions, and I feel sorry for anyone who identifies with them or knows people who are like them. Sartre intentionally makes the characters so hateable because he wants to show us the necessity of taking responsibility for one's freedom, but I'm not sure his point works; such people may decide that they willfully want to own up to their whimsically obnoxious ways.

Obviously the idea of freedom is subjective and Sartre certainly does not presume to have found the answer in absolute terms. He uses the protagonist, Mathieu, as well as the peripheral characters, to examine different view points; albeit, with mixed results. The Age of Reason can certainly be read as an independent novel, but if one is to truly understand Sartre's vision, it will be necessary to read the other works in the trilogy, The Reprieve and The Troubled Sleep. Both are excellent and follow up on the secondary characters that are first introduced in the Age of Reason. The three novels, known collectively as The Roads to Freedom, represent, to me, the most significant analysis of what freedom means to a given individual. It will force the reader to reexamine long cherished views and address their own concept of freedom. If you haven't been introduced to the writings of Sartre, The Age of Reason is an excellent starting point."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"the age of reason is the 1st book in a trilogy, roads to freedom. i have not yet read the next two books, but after this one, i plan to. this is an excellent novel.it is a thinking man's book not an action thriller. it's concepts are existential in nature and deal specifically with the concept of freedom.the story, which covers only a few days in the the life of character mathieu in 1938 france, deals with mathieu's obsession with his personal freedom. he has just been informed of the unwanted pregnancy of his girlfriend. i personally did not see the pending war as a significant element in the story. it is there, but does not drive the quest for freedom. this is most likely picked up in the later novels. as mathieu searches for funds to abort the child, we meet his friends. all of them have hidden personal problems of their own. the results of this quest and the resolution of his problem make up the storyline.the interesting issue is the understanding of freedom. what does mathieu think about it in the beginning and how does that change as he reaches the age of reason.the story is best summed up in mathieu's comment near the end:\\"i don't know what i would give to do something irrevocable.\\"this is a book that raises amazing questions and has the potential of changing your life."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"Mathieu Delarue, a 34-year old philosophy professor, has led his life so that he has maintained complete freedom, which he defines as closing off no possibilities in his future. This makes philosophical sense to Mathieu, who wants his freedom in place, if and when he is required to perform a great act of conscience or begin a mission of self-fulfillment. It's 1938 and going to Spain to fight the Fascists has been tempting but not quite right. Meanwhile, Mathieu remains interested in the life of Gauguin, who, in his forties, left a Sunday-painter's life in France to become a great painter in Tahiti.While Mathieu has lofty philosophical ideas, the effect of his freedom, he admits, has been to \\"dexterously construct an undistinguished but solid happiness upon the basis of inertia and to justify himself from time to time on the highest moral grounds.\\" He is, in the words of other characters, a small-time government official, a solid member of the bourgeoisie, and a person whose relationship with Marcelle, his long-time girlfriend, is indistinguishable from a marriage.Then, Marcelle becomes pregnant and Mathieu, who wastes his money drinking with students in bars, has to choose. Will there be an abortion, enabling Mathieu to preserve his so-called freedom? Or, will Mathieu marry Marcelle and basically recognize the nature of the prosaic life he has made?Then, add to this dynamic an evil and manipulative friend who resents Mathieu's bogus sense of freedom, a childish female student who has come to represent freedom in Mathieu's mind, and a lack of money to pay for a safe abortion. The effect of this literary concoction is an absolutely great and riveting tale, where Mathieu comes to terms with his illusions and responsibilities. And, it has a surprise ending!But say you don't like novels in which a protagonist confronts the nature and limits of his or her life? Then, read THE AGE OF REASON anyway, simply to enjoy Sartre's amazing writing. In this case, read with a ready eye for his numerous descriptions of light in Paris or for his amazing facility with similes and metaphors. You're only in Chapter 1, for example, when you read:\\"Her mouth snapped out the last words: a varnished mauve-tinted mouth, like a crimson insect intent upon devouring that ashen visage.\\"\\"She collapsed on to his shoulder, sobbed a little, but she did not cry. It was all the she could allow herself: a rainless storm.\\"A great book and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"Having already read *The Reprieve,* I have now finished two-thirds of Sartre's \\"Roads to Freedom\\" trilogy--that's over 800 pages--and I cannot wait to begin the third volume...that's how compelling I find these novels. It's difficult to explain their appeal. In *The Age of Reason,* a philosophy professor discovers his lover is pregnant and spends the next two days frantically trying to raise enough money for an abortion. His life zigzags haphazardly through a rich cast of characters whose stories and intertwined fates--complex, tragic, absurd--continue in the next volume.What Sartre does is immerse us in the struggles of these characters as they each attempt to define and make sense of their lives...this struggle informed, of course, by the existential principles of Sartre's own philosophy. What Sartre does so well in *The Age of Reason* is to portray the psychological torment of men and women under even fairly ordinary circumstances. Here is the quiet drama of consciousness, the sufferings of daily life...at least as it is experienced by those who give it any thought.What does it mean to be free--to have a life that means something? These are the questions that obsess Mathieu as he runs into one dead-end after another in his search for the abortion fee and at the same time wallows in a hopeless erotic obsession with a self-destructive young female student. All the distinctive trappings of a French existential novel are here--the drinking, the brooding, the caf&eacute;'s, the jazz bars, the intellectual dissection of every act and motive, the relentless self-analysis...it's a riveting read if you don't require a lot of explosions, kidnappings, and sordid murders to entertain you.Unlike his stylistic experimentation in *The Reprieve,* Sartre narrates *The Age of Reason* in a traditional, straightforward style, but it's no less briskly-paced; if anything, there is a higher pitch of emotional intensity in this novel and less ennui than in *The Reprieve.* Its not absolutely necessary to read *The Age of Reason* first, I didn't, but I would definitely recommend doing so, as it enriches vastly your understanding of the characters in the second book.As I mentioned in my review of *The Reprieve,* I can hardly believe that the Sartre of *Being and Nothingness* fame was capable of writing in such a lively and entertaining manner, *Nausea* aside. So this series has so far come as one of the most pleasant literary surprises I've had in years. If the French, their philosophy, or existentialism appeal to you at all--or just a good novel about interesting characters facing the void within life--then I'd unreservedly recommend you take a look at *The Age of Reason.*"},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"I feel out of my league reading the thoughtful and well-informed reviews provided for this novel, but still desire to add my own thoughts. I read this first when I was 18, and I do not purport to have any great knowledge of the philosophy of Sartre. It is several years later and over the course of my college career I have picked it up time and again to read a chapter or two.I am unsure of whether or not this book is a mere front for Sartre's philosophy--I do know it is a sort of fictional application of Being and Nothingness--but what continues to drive me back to this book is the sheer power of the narrative. Only in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man have I found such an encyclopedic representation of human struggle and motivation in twentieth century literature.While I am no true student of philosophy, I have no use for a thinker who cannot provide an accurate depiction of the real world. If they are not presenting reality properly, they are not observing it properly. Sartre seems to be a man with an immense mind and a remarkable pen. Although his conclusion grates with my own feelings about life, I respect his standpoint because the journey towards the conclusion portrayed a world with such real pain and such familiar people that I cannot help but be moved."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"Jean-Paul seems like such a likeable character. Especially towards his later years, when he became quite politically active in anti-colonial issues. But a lot of his early work is inconsistent. This novel, the first of a trilogy, was written leading up to and during the second world war, and is a compelling portrait of a parisian bourgeois as the shadows of fascism grew longer. This bourgeois professor, mathieu, fancies himself a prime actor in his own life, a man free to act as he chooses because he doesn't have any illusions. But that is his worst illusion. He is 35 years old and acts like a modern spoiled american university student. He can't commit to anything, whether it be to head to spain to fight against franco, marry his pregnant mistress or demand that she have an abortion, or act decisively enough to win the heart of his OTHER girlfriend, a spoiled early 20's russian emigre.SO the whole novel passes with us watching these spoiled bourgeois lunk-heads wander around and do nothing with all their vaunted freedom.But That's the point. As you get into the trilogy more, you see that mathieu's problem is that his life is unbearably light, to steal from Kundera here. And it is Kundera's \\"unbearable lightness of being\\" that provides a great insight into what Sartre is getting at here. Our freedom as human beings comes into play when we make choices, not avoid them.So, I recommend this book, but stick it out because this first volume is tough at times. The characters herein are all fools. But they are all learning to act, and as Hitler draws closer, you can see they now know that they will HAVE to make a choice in the near future.And after you read these three volumes, read Kundera's book, which is about a lot of the same issues but is a lot more humane and sexy too. Say what you want about Sartre but he wasn't really a sexy writer. In fact he kind of reminds me of wallace shawn in \\"manhattan.\\" But that's another story."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"This work discerns Sartre in his element. Reason characterizes the modern age: through reason, we abstract our realities, turn away from experience and into the \\"cognitive\\", \\"mental\\" field, and consequently loose our grounding.This novel is a phenomenological journey into the absurdities of life; through it, we delve into the mood of the times: one in which anxiety towers over our very Being, one in which anxiety is the primordial mood in which we dwell. Anxiety, a consequence of Being turning (into) \\"pure abstract\\" Thought, reminds us that without a full acknowledgment of our \\"being-in-the-world\\", we remain homeless, uprooted, fearful of that which is. We value the \\"supersensuous\\" over the sensuous, \\"mind\\" over \\"body\\", and as such, loose sight of our concrete existence and meaning-making possibilities.Through strikingly insightful \\"experiential\\" writing (i.e., descriptive, not explanatory), Sartre, dare we understand him, engenders in us a despair at our current state (and many who do not \\"like\\" Sartre use this as a defense of their position: he is too dreary, too \\"depressing\\"). Yet if we choose to listen carefully we observe that nothing he says is out of the ordinary, out of touch with our own experiences: rather, his descriptions sound at least vaguely familiar, attentive as they are to the nature of commonplace Being itself.This is not only a masterful philosophical work (though certainly not by some philosophers' definitions of philosophy), but a beautifully written art work as well. The two belong together in Sartre's case; this becomes clear when one considers that to obtain a truly powerful description of that which is, language must be attended to deeply and fully."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"It's always puzzled me that this book gets so little attention when Nausea is so acclaimed -- and even Nausea gets trashed by many of the more academic critics. I read a series of interviews with Sartre at one point, after all of his major books were a ways behind him, and he himself did not seem to consider the Roads to Freedom trilogy of particular significance or importance. I find this puzzling because the Age of Reason is one of the best novels I have ever read. It is more of a story than Nausea (and more of a story than its sequels, from what I've read of them), and, well -- it's just incredible. The psychological accuracy and moral neutrality with which Sartre places himself, and the reader, in each character's shoes, is remarkable; the existential &quot;adventure&quot; of the book is intoxicating, and there are some simply incredible moments. As with anything Sartre writes, it is a bit self-indulged, and the characters will not appeal to everyone, but personally, I found this an incredibly rewarding book; it left me feeling giddy."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"Sartre's characters are shallow, self-centered worms bent on self-destruction. However, because of a broad streak of narcissism, they are unable or unwilling to do significant harm to themselves. As a consequence, they turn their destructive ambitions toward their unsuspecting, but nevertheless deserving, acquaintances. Each character is deluded in the belief that he or she is seeking some noble objective, for example Mathieu's quest for ultimate freedom, while in fact settling for cheap self-indulgence at others' expense. These characters are irredeemable and certainly not worthy of the several hours required to read Sartre's novel. One wonders which character, if not each of them, represents Sartre's alter ego."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"This is the first volume of the trilogy entitled \\"Roads to Freedom.\\" The other two volumes, in English, are entitledThe Reprieve: A NovelandTroubled Sleep: A Novel. The trilogy concerns the lives of a variety of French people over a period of two years, 1938-40, which covered the lead up to, and France's disastrous defeat at the hands of Germany in the Second World War. I first read the trilogy some 40 years ago, and was exceedingly impressed with Sartre's power as a novelist, and a chronicler of the human condition. I was most impressed with the middle volume, started with it on this re-read, and was not disappointed. I'd advise the first time reader to tackle them in order. Although they can be read independently, there will be a much deeper understanding of the characters if one \\"begins at the beginning.\\"And the beginning in this case is the summer of 1938. The novel's motive force is a wanted/unwanted pregnancy, which precipitates a \\"mid-life crisis,\\" in both principal characters: Professor of Philosophy, Mathieu Delarue and his long-term \\"partner,\\" Marcelle Duffet. There are several other major characters, including two young Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, the brother and sister, Boris and Ivich. Boris has a significant relationship with a woman roughly twice his age, a nightclub singer, Lola. Ivich fears that she has just failed her exams, which will necessitate a return to her home in the detested provincial town of Laon, and seeks solace from Mathieu, with results that are not necessarily predictable. There is also Jacques, Mathieu's bourgeois lawyer brother, and Sarah, who is married to the artist Gomez, who left the Parisian life to fight in the Spanish Civil War. And there is the homosexual, Daniel, who feels that the \\"mark of Cain\\" is upon him. Another character, Bruet, asks Mathieu to join the Communist Party, when it seemed like such a sensible choice, save for the necessity of following \\"the party line.\\"Mathieu and Marcelle had previously agreed that if there was an \\"accident\\" she would get an abortion. Ah, the theory, but there is much \\"right to life\\" queasiness when the \\"accident\\" is no longer theoretical. And then, alas, as the seemingly unlimited choices of youth become more circumscribed, was it really an \\"accident\\"? For so many of us who have been through the realization of middle age, Mathieu's summation of Marcelle's position resonates: \\"Her last chance\\"...\\"Between thirty and forty, people staked on their last chance.\\"Even though in his 30's, and a Professor, Mathieu does not have the money to pay for an abortion that would be properly performed, and thus the spectra of a \\"back-alley butcher\\" hangs in the background if he cannot borrow the money. He makes the rounds, from Daniel, who has the money but claims he does not, to his brother, Jacques. Sartre deftly sums up Jacques, as being in the \\"older but wiser\\" category, and if he was an American, would have become a Republican: \\"Jacques was very proud of his youth... for five years he has assiduously aped all the fashionable dissipations, he had dallied with surrealism, conducted a few agreeable love-affairs, and occasionally, before making love, he had inhaled ethyl chloride from a handkerchief.\\" But now, ah: \\"...what is bohemianism, after all? It was amusing enough a hundred years ago, but today it is simply a name for a handful of eccentrics who are no danger to anybody and have missed the train.\\" Mathieu retorts that \\"your age of reason is the age of resignation.\\" Later he debates with himself: \\"Marry her, you shoddy bohemian, marry her, you have reached the age of reason, you must marry her.\\"And does the \\"resignation\\" come for Mathieu, as it does for all of us? \\"...he had finished the day, and he had also finished with his youth...disillusioned epicureanism, smiling tolerance, resignation, flat seriousness, stoicism-- all the aids whereby a man may savor, minute by minute, like a connoisseur, the failure of a life.\\"The reader knows, unlike the characters, that all these concerns of bohemianism and the bourgeois would soon be swept away, first placed in abeyance by the \\"reprieve\\" of the week of the Munich agreement in the fall of '38, and then finally by the fall of France in 1940. This volume lacks the stylistic brilliance of \\"The Reprieve\\" and has a few nightclub scenes that \\"drag,\\" so I'd only rate it as 4.5-stars, rounded up."},{"Title":"The Age of Reason (Bantam Classics)","review":"I'd love this Paul Sartre tail because I'm 30 and I became to see the world in a diferent way.

Add to this annoying stylistic tendency a career in philosophy, and you have the makings of a literary disaster on the order of Jean-Paul Sartre's THE AGE OF REASON. Amazingly, this book is the first of a trilogy - one can hardly imagine what treats follow this opening volume.The story takes place in Paris (naturally) over a two-day period in the summer of 1938, as the Spanish Civil War rages and Europe sits on the precipice of Hitler's war of conquest. The shadow of world war is undoubtedly intended to add meaning and import to the story, but only ends up with a Jew in 1938 referring to concentration camps. Matthieu Delarue, a professor perpetually short of funds has enjoyed a seven-year relationship with a woman of questionable repute named Marcelle who has unexpectedly become pregnant. Matthieu unilaterally decides that abortion is the only appropriate response and sets out on a quest of sorts to obtain the necessary funds. Revolving around Matthieu during these two days are Matthieu's sycophantic student Boris Serguine and his borderline paranoid schizophrenic sister Ivich, Boris's clinging, almost-over-the-hill dancer/girlfriend Lola, and Matthieu's long-time acquaintances Daniel and Brunet. They spend most of their time visiting one another, seeking cheap thrills (shoplifting, petty larceny, drowning cats, or cutting themselves just for the sensation), eating, drinking, dancing, taking drugs, loathing themselves and each other, and generally looking down on everyone else around them. As a group, the characters are thoroughly unlikable, either whiny narcissists or pompous didacts (or both), the best fate for whom would be the suicides they seem to dwell upon so endlessly. No wonder the Nazis overran France in a matter of weeks.The ostensible theme of THE AGE OF REASON is personal freedom, but as it plays out for Sartre, being free apparently means having no guiding principles, assuming no responsibility for one's actions, committing to nothing, and sacrificing nothing for another person or a greater cause than oneself. Presenting a group of characters who see themselves as free but are paralyzed by inaction and chained by their own self-doubts is rather an obvious form of irony. The only halfway likable character is Daniel, a homosexual who breaks sufficiently free of his chains to \\"come out\\" to Matthieu, expresses genuine concern for another human being's welfare, tries to guide Matthieu toward the morally correct course of action, and ultimately takes responsibility for another person's future well-being.Matthieu's life \\"hemmed him in...it had a vague and hesitant purpose, a kind of insistent futility, a smell of dust and violets...'I have led a toothless life,' he thought. A toothless life. I have never bitten into anything....What's to be done? Break the shell? That's easily said. Besides, what would remain? A little viscous bit of rubber, oozing through the dust and leaving a glistening trail behind it....And suddenly, above his besmirched body...there hovered a pure consciousness, a consciousness without ego, no more than a mere puff of warm air; there it hovered, in the semblance of a look, it viewed the shoddy bohemian, the petty bourgeois clamped into his comforts, the futile intellectual,...the listless dreamer immersed in his flaccid life, and the verdict of that consciousness was: \`The fellow is a wash-out and deserves his fate.'\\"If you can stand the prospect of 400 pages of this and worse, then by all means, go ahead, but don't say I didn't warn you. Sartre's \\"explorations\\" of personal freedom take place within the psyches of an insufferable group of utterly unrealistic characters.By the end of the novel Mattieu claims he has truly \\"attained the age of reason,\\" and most readers will have reached a state of exasperation if they haven't completely lost their minds and turned suicidal.Having disgorged this diarrhetic stream of unremitting despair and despondency, it comes as little surprise that Sartre had earlier written a first novel fittingly titled NAUSEA. The big surprise is learning that he was chosen for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1964; what WERE they thinking? Naturally, Sartre turned it down -- how truly French to disdain a Nobel Prize.I approached this book optimistically, on the assumption that a philosopher of Sartre's stature would have some interesting philosophical insights to render in a fictional form. Regretably, I find it impossible to offer any good reason to read THE AGE OF REASON. I'll take Malcolm Lowry's UNDER THE VOLCANO or Paul Bowles any time over this. One star for the story, a second star in recognition of Sartre's intellectual reputation and his forwardness in 1947 to write frankly about abortions, prostitution, homosexuality, and drugs (even as he was horribly stereotyping blacks and Jews - hey, nobody's perfect)."},{"Title":"Spy killer (Classic fiction series)","review":"As a fan of modern day murder mysteries and thrillers, I have become accustomed to the writings of James Patterson, Clive Cussler, Agatha Christie, and Stephen King. Imagine my surprise after reading a most unpredictable, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat pulp fiction account by no other than L. Ron Hubbard of \\"Dianetics\\" fame! The author delivers in this fine example of American Pulp Fiction, where there are twists and turns at every corner, and nothing is what it seems. The hero, Kurt Reid, takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride of an adventure, where he confronts danger, sinister forces, beautiful women, and even death. His journey is complicated by enemies from everywhere, and the beautiful but dangerous Varinka, a Russian vamp with questionable cohorts, and a secret agenda of her own. I recommend this book as a must read for anyone who longs for the suspense of a true spy thriller, where the plot twists several times, and the ending is anything but predictable."},{"Title":"Spy killer (Classic fiction series)","review":"\\"Spy Killer\\" is a classic L. Ron Hubbard story from 1936. Published prior to the wave of espionage novels inspired by Eric Ambler's \\"A Coffin for Dimitrios\\" in 1939, Hubbard had anticipated the espionage genre's popularity with this startling tale. \\"Spy Killer\\" is a well-written thriller, and readers will encounter the mysterious Russian woman Varinka Savischna. Hubbard's blazing talent is evident in beautiful lines like this: \\"The steam that rose from her cup of tea was not less elusive than the quality of her eyes.\\" The audio book is outstanding. Each audio book features a multicast performance with music and sound effects reminiscent of radio's golden age. Starring the voice talent of Lori Jablons and featuring R. F. Daley, Shane Johnson, Jim Meskimen, and Tait Ruppert, \\"Spy Killer\\" is the perfect audio adventure when your driving long distance."},{"Title":"Spy killer (Classic fiction series)","review":"L. Ron Hubbard is probably best known as the founder of Scientology and creator of Dianetics. These days, his name is largely connected with the antics of the some of the more \\"outspoken\\" members of the religion, overshadowing the fact that the man really knew how to tell an entertaining story. All 150 of the stories Hubbard wrote for the pulp magazines of the 1930s and '40s are being rereleased in paperback and audio under the evocative title Stories from the Golden Age.The recordings I've tried so far are just terrific. They are a professionally produced combination of traditional narrated audiobooks (with narration deftly handled by R.F. Daley) and old-time radio, with skilled actors playing the characters (often multiple roles) and genre-specific music and sound effects rounding out the experience.When bucko mate Kurt Reid escapes the ship Rangoon (with help, it turns out), he has two choices: go into hiding as a fugitive of the Chinese government, or assist Russian beauty Varinka Sevischna in her project against Chinese intelligence. Since hiding in unlikely, and Kurt is always \\"spoiling for a fight,\\" he accepts her offer -- and soon finds himself in over his head, hot least of which when Varinka's friend (and Kurt's ex-fianc&eacute;e) Anne Carsten resurfaces with an equally enticing offer.Soon the two women disappear, however, and Reid is faced with Chinese warlord Lin Wang, who offers freedom from pursuit. In a delicious ironic twist, in order to avoid punishment for the murder he did not commit (and the reason he was a prisoner in the first place), Reid must murder someone else, namely a Japanese spy named Takeki (\\"the courageous\\"). But when Reid gets there, he recognizes Takeki and has to make a difficult choice.Author L. Ron Hubbard fills Spy Killer with action and suspense in a land where death waits as a consequence for nearly every decision -- especially inaction. But he also offers up a love story (however implausible) that adds an extra layer to events to this wonderful example of the \\"yellow peril\\" genre.Lin Wang is a great villain -- deformed physically and mentally -- and Tait Ruppert plays him with gusto. Likewise, Lori Jablons is terrific in her dual role of Varinka and Anne, underscoring the fact that the two women embody separate halves of Reid's ideal.Anyone who pays attention to things like dialogue that makes no sense unless something unspoken is true, will figure out the big twist early on. (Those who solve TV mysteries by assuming that the guest star with the least amount of air time must be the murderer, will also have an advantage.) Despite this flaw (if it is one), and its slight overlength for the breadth of its story, Spy Killer is still a pretty good adventure tale of Oriental espionage, provided you don't mind overlooking implausibilities and suspending a certain amount of disbelief. But, then, many pulp fiction enthusiasts merely consider that all part of the experience."},{"Title":"Spy killer (Classic fiction series)","review":"Kurt Reid is falsely accused of murder. In Shanghai he gets caught by the Chinese who coerce him into killing one of their political opponents. \\"Spy Killer\\" is another one of Hubbard's 1930s pulp adventures that will keep you entertained for the short time it takes to read it and be forgotten shortly afterwards.

Then when I listened to the audio book, I was there listening to radio theater, reminded of when I used to listen other dramas on the radio as I would drive to or from work. Only this time, the quality of production brought it to a new level. I could hear Kurt as he dived off the Rangoon seeking to escape an obvious set up. Then the waves lapping around the boat as he climbed aboard. The rest of the story was no different - I was there and only needed my own vision of what was occuring to complete the story as it was being rolled out."},{"Title":"Spy killer (Classic fiction series)","review":"I enjoyed this story and could not put it down once I started.

At the time I was working in a facility teaching students ranging in age from 16-24, many of whom were on a (4th grade or lower)reading level. Teaching English to the students was difficult especially when it came to reading because it was difficult to find interesting content matching their reading levels. This series worked amazingly! The students were able to listen to the stories while following along in the book. I created a Pulp Fiction Book club using MANY of the selections available through Galaxy Press and the students who joined the group improved their reading skills by leaps and bounds. The stories are interesting, exciting, and appropriate for the young adults I was teaching. The way the audio was produced kept the students' attention easily. If you have struggling readers, I highly recommend \\"Spy Killer\\" and other selections from Stories from the Golden Age to help them out. If you don't want to teach the books as a pulp fiction mini unit, you could just have numerous titles (with accompanying cd) available in your classroom library. You would be surprised how many students ask to borrow them to take home! Can't say enough good things about this series!

It's nice and long, which I love. It has intrigue, action, romance, believable villains, a wonderful hero, and all in a fast-paced pulp fiction adventure story written with a marvelous quality of writing. When the scenes with the villain are so evil they make me cringe and the action is so exciting it keeps me breathless, I know the book is a winner, and that's what Hubbard achieved with this.I listened to the audiobook version and it's phenomenal - the acting was great. The female(s) keep(s) you interested and guessing, while the actor playing the hero does well at being a dashing likable leading man. The actor who plays Lin Wang (the villain) exemplifies pure cruelty at its worst (without anything being too terrible for readers of all ages to enjoy). The sound FX and music lend themselves well to the story and really make it come to life like a movie in your mind."},{"Title":"Spy killer (Classic fiction series)","review":"This is my first time reading this kind of book and I was not disappointed at all. Storyline grab and kept my attention all the way to the end. luv it."},{"Title":"Spy killer (Classic fiction series)","review":"I'll admit that I only grabbed this book through a mix of curiosity about the pre-scientology days writing of L. Ron Hubbard and the fact that it was a free e-book for my kindle. Imagine my surprise when I found out that the guy could actually spin a good yarn. Sure, it's a corny tale from the very first sentence, but the action builds up quick and it's a breezy read with twists that change the nature of the mystery coming every few pages so don't be surprised if you find yourself drawn in and unable to put it down until you're done.While the story itself is entertaining the prose is very workman, it moves the story forward and not much else. Sure, a few of the phrases are evocative, but most of the time it's flat and peppered with meaningless analogies that fail to deepen the story. Of course that's forgivable as the book also contains background information that gives context to the nature of pulp narratives (although take L. Ron's biography with a grain of salt as they include some of the more embellished aspects of his life). Some of the book's shortcomings are understandable when you realize that this was written by a guy who was belting out stories as fast as he could with little to no revisions because that was the only way he could make a living. It's amazing he was able to write anything this readable and those flaws actually add flavor to the story when taken in that historical context.What I can't really forgive in Spy Killer is the outright racism. This is a story about attractive, intelligent white people outsmarting conniving, violent, ugly Asians. Any Asian character with a meaningful role is an evil force that is mere cannon fodder for the infinitely more capable hero, Kurt Reid. The setting, pre-WWII China under Japanese occupation, is unique, but it's never really taken advantage of and as a result I never felt like I was being transported to another country. There's references to tea houses and cranes and other things one might think of as Chinese, but you never get the tangible details that brings everything to life. You get the feeling the L. Ron Hubbard didn't have a whole lot of interest in the culture and the setting is just a place for the action to take place and not much else. From a guy who actually spent time in the Orient you'd expect it to be brought to life in a more vivid fashion.Still, despite some fairly damning flaws, it's an interesting story from one of the last century's most interesting people and taken in the proper context it's a fun read."},{"Title":"Spy killer (Classic fiction series)","review":"I am just as surprised as others that Mr. Hubbard could write such an enthralling tale.

He's accused of a murder he did not commit, runs into a Russian spy (who happens to be a gorgeous woman, of course) and gets tangled into a conflict between her and a Chinese gangster.Seems like a complex plot -- it is -- but it flows well at its 88 pages. The pulps usually ran these kinds of stories through several magazines, but here the reader gets to read it all in one go.The reading is fairly easy, and any words used at that time are clarified in a glossary in the back.The most gruesome scenes are the torture scenes as fingernails are being ripped out by pliers or guys are getting shot messily between the eyes.

I only brought this book to replace the one I lost at the library."},{"Title":"The Rich Girl (Fear Street, No. 44)","review":"The premise of The Rich Girl is much better than the actual book. I love R.L. Stine and his Fear Street books, as you know, but this was not his best - at least in my opinion. It was over dramatic to the point of annoying actually. The way the plot moved along was completely unrealistic to me. Emma and Sydney find a duffle bag full of money. While Emma wants to keep the money, Sydney is hesitant but finally gives in and agrees to keep it, on one condition: they must bury it and not spend any of the money for two weeks on the chance that someone will come looking for it. After being pressured by her boyfriend to tell him what was wrong, Sydney tells Jason. But things start to happen.... things that seem to have only one explanation. Emma is pushed down the stairs at school, and her car's break lines are cut. For Emma the only explanation is that Jason is trying to kill her for the money. Then weird things start to happen to Sydney as well...Again, for me, the dramatics of this book were not believable - I'm not saying that any Fear Street book is \\"believable\\" (that is why I love them!) but I just could not connect with this one. I figured out what was going on rather early, and I am sure that played a part in my opinion as well. The one thing I will say I liked about this book is what ends up happening to Sydney - now I know this probably sounds mean, but when you read the book this part of the plot gives it a real highlight.Overall I was a bit disappointed in this installment but I will not be deterred from my love of Fear Street and R.L. Stine. You can't win them all!"},{"Title":"The Rich Girl (Fear Street, No. 44)","review":"The rich girl, was a very amazing book I read, I was extremely into reading it. SoIt starts off with a girl named Emma, and her friend Sydney, They find cash, out of no where, so they decide to hide it underground. Emma and Sydney promised they'd never tell no one, not anyone about it. Then Sydney couldn't hold in the secret no longer so she told her boyfriend Jason. Jason started to get a bit jealous, because they said they were going to share the money, equally, but Jason didn't like that. Emma killed Jason, but then Sydney started getting letters from someone with the same signature as Jason's handwriting, she tells Emma about it, but Emma doesn't possibly believe Sydney.

Stine's \\"Fear Street\\" is a classic series. He is one of those authors who's writing appeals to people of all ages, no matter how many years have gone by since the books were published. I for one, have been a fan of \\"fear Street\\" for many years now. In fact, I started with the ever popular \\"goosebumps\\" series, and then moved onto \\"fear street\\" and have been reading and collecting the series ever since. Even though I'm 19 now, I still enjoy indulging myself in these books. Sure, the storylines are a bit corny for someone of my age, yet I still find great enjoyment in reading them.I'm very fond of this particular book in the series, because it was the first \\"fear street\\" book that I ever read. Now that I've read the book numerous times, I realize that the plot is a bit ridiculous (even more so than some of the other books in the series) but there's also a great twist, and a really clever ending, which helps to make up for the semi-lame plot.The book is about two best friends, Sydney and Emma, who find a bag of money in a garbage can outside of their workplace. Sydney, the rich girl, is hesitant to keep it, but Emma, the poor one, convinces her that they should keep it, and they decide to hide the money and agree not to tell anyone about it until their sure its safe. Sydney breaks the agreement and lets their secret slip to her boyfriend Jason, and Emma becomes convinced that Jason is planning on murdering the both of them in order to keep the money for himself. In order to ensure their safety, emma and sydney agree to let Jason have a share of the money, but Emma ends up \\"killing\\" Jason after he tries to take the money for himself. Afterwards, strange things start happening to Sydney, and she's convinced that someone saw her and emma in the woods the night that they killed Jason, and she's also convinced that Jasons ghost is haunting her.But is Jason really dead...?If you've never read a fear street book, I do recommend that you read this one. Even though its not my favorite one out of the series, its the one that managed to get me addicted, so I'm sure it'll do the same for you!"},{"Title":"The Rich Girl (Fear Street, No. 44)","review":"Emma and Sydney find a duffel of money in the dump.

I have read the majority of his books. The reason I thought this is his best book is because it talks about peer pressure and steeling, not just his usual murder topic.Peer pressure is an important topic; it teaches kids how not to give in to it. It shows that bad things happen when you give in to peer pressure.I like R.L Stine because he uses suspense alot. I never know what to expect next.

A couple of days later, Emma and Jason were walking down the stairs and Jason pushed her. She fell and Landed on her head. Jason felt so terrible about what he had done, he fixed Emma's car. He fixed it so well, she almost died again. He'd cut her brake lines. Emma and Jason had a plan to make Sydney crazy. They did this because they knew that she would go to the police and they couldn't let her do that. This is a great book. It is suspenceful and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. For example, Jason came to sydney's house after Emma hit him with a shovel. He came pretending to be dead, and tried to kill her. The characterization was wonderful too. There were bad things about the book too. Sometimes there was very little detail, like when R.L. Stein was describing Emma.

Suddenly bad things start to happen and Emma believes that Jason is responsible. She thinks that Jason wants to kill her so that he could have a say to the money.

With the Germans making themselves international bad guys by starting the First World War, ERB took advantage of their moving against British possessions in Africa to kill off Jane in this seventh novel in the Tarzan series. \\"Tarzan the Untamed\\" was first published as a six-part serial in \\"The Red Book Magazine\\" in 1919 with the story continued as \\"Tarzan and the Valley of Luna\\" in a five-part serial in \\"All-Story Weekly\\" in 1920. The result is one of the most atypical Burroughs pulp fiction yarns, in which the standard romantic adventure has the hero (whether he is Tarzan, Korak, John Carter, David Innes, etc.) pursuing his beloved (Jane, Miriam, Dejah Thoris, etc.) across a dangerous environment (darkest Africa, Barsoom, Pellucidar, etc.). But in \\"Tarzan the Untamed,\\" the hero is out for revenge. The result is arguably ERB's best Tarzan novel, past paced and with a prose style that rises above his average effort.This is amply proven in the opening chapter. Hauptmann Fritz Schneider and his men stumble upon the estate of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, in British East Africa in the fall of 1914. Tarzan and his son, Korak, are away, and Lady Jane does not know that war has broken out between German and the British Empire, so she welcomes them to her home. Meanwhile, Tarzan learns of the war in Nairobi and hurries home only to find the smoking ruins of his estate when he returns. Wasimbu, the son of Muviro, has been crucified on the wall, and the rest of the natives are all dead. Tarzan also finds the charred body of his wife, recognizable only the rings on her fingers. Cursing the Germans, Tarzan swears vengeance and leaves behind the trappings of civilization. During a tremendous thunderstorm, Tarzan kills a leopard, symbolizing the return of the Lord of the Jungle--and this is just the first chapter.Tarzan heads south into German East Africa and almost immediately begins wrecking havoc on the Germans, displaying same sort of animal cunning and creative cruelty that he displayed as a youth in \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" (and covered a bit as well in \\"The Jungle Tales of Tarzan\\"). Even encountering an entrenched German army does not stop Tarzan from getting his revenge on his enemy. Eventually he finds an English flier, Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick, who is captured by cannibals and in need of rescue, and who becomes the character who argues, rather unconvincingly I might add, for Tarzan to be civilized in his one-man war against the Germans. But nothing is going to stop Tarzan from hunting down every last one of the invaders who destroyed his home and killed his wife. Of course, the circumstances of Jane's death lead us to suspect the surprise that awaits Tarzan at the end of this adventure and which sets up the next novel, \\"Tarzan the Terrible.\\"The Tarzan series does become extremely formulaic by the time you get halfway through the twenty-four volumes, but it is worthwhile to at least make you way through the first eight volumes (maybe a bit further, especially if you like lions). \\"Tarzan the Terrible\\" is perhaps the quintessential Tarzan novel and the original \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" is the one essential ERB novel to read, but I would agree that \\"Tarzan the Untamed\\" is the best yarn in the bunch.

World War I has made itself known in Africa, and Tarzan gets embroiled in things.Bertha Kircher, is a german double agent that Tarzan is forced throughout the novel to rescue over and over again and respect as well--as she rescues him many times. He hates her though, because she is German.I was excited with this premise because here was a man right in the middle of World War 1 setting up a very strong female and German character. However, the last page of the book ruined this for me. Because instead of being a new lesson on how there could be one good person, or something to admire in a people, it is instead about Burroughs usual schtick, on blue-blood running true.There are a few new jungle people in this book as well, an odd tribe that is insane--Burroughs uses outdated science to describe how Tarzan and others can recognize these people's madness. Facial and scull structure, posture, etc.This is very much a book of its time, as Burroughs was very much a man of his time. Its an interesting story and one that would be interesting to study from a social/historical stand point.

If you want to go a little further, allow me to suggestJourney to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1),The Tracker,Path Notes of an American Ninja Master,The Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy,Chi Kung: Way of Power, andHouse of Shattering Light: Life as an American Indian Mystic. These will all get you started on understanding more of what Tarzan would have had to be, had he existed in the flesh. I note related books because that is the most useful part of a review for me. I have found gems that way. I encourage others to do likewise."},{"Title":"Tarzan the untamed","review":"This book was originally published in magazine form as two separate stories; \\"Tarzan and the Huns\\" and \\"Tarzan and the Valley of Luna\\". The plot is somewhat disjointed, probably because it was originally two stories. It takes place in 1914. It starts with Jane being brutally murdered by Germans and Tarzan seeking revenge on her killers specifically and Germans in general. After Tarzan gets his revenge, suddenly the book changes direction and turns into a story where Tarzan and his companions find a \\"lost city\\". It is an entertaining book for fans of ERB's type of adventure yarn, although some may be offended by the racist portayals of Germans and Africans."},{"Title":"Tarzan the untamed","review":"There is no doubt that Edgar Rice Burroughs was a wonderful storyteller. However he was also a writer who reflected his times. There are many references in this book to the then popular belief that if you had African blood you were somehow inferior to the Anglo Saxon race. I read this book out loud to someone and as I was reading it I kept the good, adventurous parts as the author had written them, but because my audience was African American I had to edit out the profoundly ignorant instances in which Africans were referred to as practically as stupid and simple as lower forms of animals. Germans were also reviled, but in the context of the story which is about Germans invading certain parts of Africa I can see why. That Tarzan should hate certain Gomangani (as he refers to black people) I can also understand since it was a black warrior who slew his ape foster mother. But the frequent references to the intelligence and morality of ALL Africans is a bit much to take. Still, if you can overlook all of these and edit them out as you read, this is still a fantastic adventure and Tarzan himself is still one of the most iconic characters ever created."},{"Title":"Tarzan the untamed","review":"It's very good and keeps you in the plot but try not to judge it by today's standards.

Chapters provide overviews of the shooting fundamentals such as grip, stance, and positions. More advanced techniques regarding weak hand firing, reloading, use of flashlights, and covert carry are also discussed. However, the most beneficial topic concerns the mental aspects of combat shooting and training. Mr. Buttler describes his philosophy and techniques for improving the inter-connection of the mental and physical aspects of self while using a firearm. This mental discipline provides a necessary skill and competitive edge for law enforcement officials or others interested in combat pistol shooting."},{"Title":"The Armed Option: Zen in the Art of Combat Pistolcraft","review":"In my opinion this is a must have for anyone that owns or is interested in firearms. he breaks down the fundementals and gives you great training exercises.

I think we owe it to this brilliant man to at least read his books the way he intended them!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"For those interested in the history of science fiction, it can be debated as to who wrote the first science fiction story. My personal choice has always been Mary Shelley who wrote Frankenstein, but others have argued for Poe or others. Then there are Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, who were more-or-less the first true science fiction authors, that is, authors who really wrote in that genre.Verne predates Wells, but I still can see argument for Wells being given priority. Wells seems to have done more to give the genre definition; Wells is more interested in using the fiction to speculate about the future and the nature of man. Verne, on the other hand, uses science more for a plot device to tell adventure stories. Probably it's impossible to ever settle the matter, but the way I see it, Wells was the deeper thinker, but Verne was the more entertaining writer.Journey to the Center of the Earth is a typical Verne story. In it, the narrator Axel relates the story of an adventure with his uncle and guardian, the esteemed Professor Otto Lidenbrock. Lidenbrock has stumbled upon an old parchment, which when translated, tells of a passage to the center of the Earth through a volcano in Iceland. Axel, well-educated himself, is more skeptical than his obsessed uncle, but is compelled to go along (it doesn't help when Axel's fiancee thinks the journey is a good idea.The bulk of the novel deals with the trip to Iceland (where they pick up an assistant, Hans), then to the extinct volcano, and finally into the bowels of the Earth. What they find there defies their expectations, and I won't spoil any of the fun by revealing it.Like other Verne tales I have read, this one is written with a light touch and is an easy read (Wells is a bit more inconsistent in this regard). Compared with today's works, this is pretty tame and simple, but for its time, it must have been a lot of fun. In fact, it's still pretty entertaining, and if you're a science fiction fan, this is a good look at one of the early works in the field."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"First, let me say, try to get your hands on the \\"complete unabridged\\" translation of this novel, since there are several apocryphal (i.e., abridged) translations, which are more like adaptations than faithful renderings of the French.The Deus ex Machina at the end is a bit cheesy--how in the world could three men on a raft survive a volcanic gunshot to the Earth's surface? But the novel, with its abundance of real science (of that era), always made me want to turn the page, even if it took ninety of those pages just to begin their descent, and just over a hundred more for them to enter the subterraneous world of giant mushrooms, prehistoric reptiles, and colossal troglodytes who herd mastodons (I wonder, is it for their meat, their milk, or both?). The novel ends abruptly: instead of making contact with the Ape Gigans, the men skedaddle topside. I wish Verne would would have (also) written the Saknussemm account of the journey, it would have been fascinating. But he didn't. A great read, but 20,000 Leagues is his all-time best, probably because Nemo is really a shadow of Verne."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This was an entertaining read, but kind of ridiculous, and ultimately not very satisfying. The main premise of the book is that there exists an entrance (through a volcano) into the depths of the Earth, that leads to an entire subterranean world. When the book was written, I believe this was considered - if not plausible - at least a possibility. And that's fine. Even today, the deepest hole ever drilled is only 7.6 miles deep, and we know surprisingly little about what lies beneath the Earth's crust. So I'm on board with ignoring the inconvenient matter of geothermal heat. You want me to imagine a subterranean world? No problem; I'm happy to suspend disbelief.But then Verne goes and botches all the details that needn't have been botched! His protagonists go without water for seven days, while wandering through underground passages. They get thirsty - yes - but they still have energy enough to chip through a foot of granite with a pick axe and a crowbar. Reaching a subterranean ocean, they build a raft out of a few logs, and sail it through a veritable gale, without the craft falling apart, and without losing any of their provisions. Later, they ride this raft at 120 miles per hour as it first descends and then ascends through a giant hole in the earth. And eventually, they are blown out of the top of an active volcano, whence upon they casually walk away from the flowing streams of lava.I am an evangelist for what I call \\"realism in fantasy\\". My opinion is that a good story requires consistency. In this case, Verne wants us to imagine that the world we live in contains a hitherto unexplored land beneath its surface. Cool! But in the real world people need water. People can't chip through 1 foot of granite with a pick axe. And people do not ride rafts through storms on oceans. The alternative that we are left with, then, is that the world Verne describes is *not* the real world...which of course ruins the magic of imagining that it is. I think this could have been a great book. Instead, Verne misses the mark by a mile."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I grew up on the James Mason movie, \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" (1959), so it was quite a shocker to read the book. You could imagine to my dismay the absents of quite a few characters and the center of the story is Germany not Scotland.Now for avid readers you could care less about old movies, I can truthfully say that this is one of Jules Verne's best stories and well told.What you will find more interesting and fun about this tale is the characters and their interaction. One of my favorite parts is when Harry who did not want to go to the center of the earth with his uncle, Professor Hardwigg; he turned to his affianced, Gretchen, and was planning on her to stop him. Her answer is shockingly disappointing to him.\\"While there is life there is hope. I beg to assert, Henry, that as long as man's heart beats, as long as man's flesh quivers, I do not allow that being gifted with thought and will can allow himself to despair\\"Be prepared as the bulk of the book is really a geological journey back through time and forward again painfully spelled out by Harry whom is the first person narrator.The Kindle version does not have actual picture of the runes in chapter 1. Moreover, a tad off on pronunciations. Other than that, it is more than worth obtaining along with a hard copy for your library.Journey to the Center of the Earth"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This short book is one of the founding classics of science fiction literature. It details the story of a German scientist who comes across a map to a place that leads inside the Earth. He puts together a crew, and of they go to Iceland to find the volcano that serves as the entrance. From there, he and his crew journey into the Earth and encounter environments with their own plants, animals, geography and weather. They collect samples, evade dangers, and have hair-raising adventures. The group travels back to the Earth's surface, but lose much of the samples to prove their trip.The book moves along quite quickly, and has fewer dinosaurs and other animals than seen in the various movie versions. Instead, the book focuses more on the internal dynamics of the group, and how they react to their discoveries, and to each other. All in all, a book that is easily read in a couple of hours, and more worth the time than watching any of the movies."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"When Professor von Hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the Earth is possible, he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward, Harry, into an expedition, first to Iceland, and then into the Earth. Harry, a young man, sees no good that can come of this expedition, but dutifully agrees.So begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published, Jules Verne's \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\". I'm hardly a Verne expert, but I've read many of his other classics. \\"Journey\\" is unique among his work. It's one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of Harry. Moreover, unlike his other books, \\"Journey\\" is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic. Verne, through his various characters, slyly implores his readers' indulgence, reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don't know.Verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters. From \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Seas\\" on, Verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists: the brilliant and calm professor; the professor's loyal apprentice, and; the non-scientific, cantankerous, pragmatic, but steadfast man of action. Here, Verne mixes and matches these traits, making for a more interesting cast. Hardwigg is a brilliant scientist, but he's also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy, demanding his fellow travelers press on, perhaps beyond all reason. The man of action, the Icelandic Hans, is loyal, but by no means cantankerous. He simply does what must be done, and is steadfastly loyalt. Finally, Harry, rather than the unquestioning apprentice, is quite skeptical of this expedition. Hardly steadfast, he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times. Thus, with these interesting characters in the mix, the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable.While the premise is fantastic, the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic, albeit more mundane, threats of natural disaster. Rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave-men, our heroes must deal with being lost, the threat of starvation, underground lakes, exhaustion, and exposure. Naturally, just as all hope seems lost for our heroes, fortune takes a hand. Obviously, if Harry is narrating, they probably get out okay. Still, there are some moments of true white knuckle tension, as Harry is lost in the caverns, or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food-supply.Wisely, Verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here. He's less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery, and concentrates instead on a great rip-roaring read. Admittedly, the conventions of Victorian-era fiction don't always allow the book to rip or roar. The first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting Harry and the Professor to Iceland and recruiting an expedition. It's more of a travelogue than an adventure tale, which makes the book more realistic, although not consistently exciting. Once our heroes are underground, however, the book takes off.In the grand scheme of things, \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is probably not my favorite Verne book. It lacks a remarkable character, like Captain Nemo. It also lacks some of the sharper satire Verne brought to his other books, like \\"From the Earth to the Moon.\\" It doesn't quite have the pacing of \\"Around the World in 80 Days.\\" Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and charming read, and certainly has earned its place among the classics."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I absolutely loved this story. The beginning dragged some but after 20 pages the story is rolling. Verne's imagination into unknown territory and his scientific reasoning is fascinating. Very good read!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Journey to the Center of the Earth (Optimized for Kindle)First let me say that I read a lot of the reviews on Journey To The Center Of The Earth, by Jules Verne, the free editions and found them somewhat disturbing because a lot of people complained. Some said names were changed from the original and such to make it easier to read. From what I understand Jules Verne did not write in english. Everything he wrote has to be translated to english, therefore my decision to buy the optimized for Kindle edition. I do not regret this decision. Heck for a buck it is well worth it.If you're going to get a free edition you really have no right to complain about the translation or whatever you feel is messed up. Stop being so cheap and spend a buck.I would have gladly spent up to six bucks for this.Verne wrote as all other Victorian era writers did. There is a deep sense of propriety, of the customs and manners of a very polite society- even though that society probably never really exisited. Todays novelists would never get a way with this. But for the era it worked well.This is the first time I read any of Verne's works. Yes, I've seen the movies. But never read any of his books either in school or as an adult. And let me say that I am astonished at how much the movies really vary from the original written work. Even the one from the 1950's (if I have the decade wrong, so what?) starring Pat Boone. I figured that one has to be somewhat close to the book. But no.The first thing that stands out to me is that in the book there is no woman that goes on the trip with them. Yes, I understand script writers have to have liberty to change things to make it work better for the screen.But I'm not going to waste time pointing out the differences. I'll probably forget to mention something and upset somebody...At times I thought the writing was a bit slow or boring and overly proper. This is why I give it 3 stars.There are other times that are exciting like when Hans, Professor Von Hardwigg and Harry are on the raft in the interior of the earth. Or when Harry became separated from Hans and the professor and was lost.The story is written from the first person perspective of Harry, Von Hardwigg's nephew. This, combined with Verne's high sense of propriety (in my opinion) sometimes makes it hard to stay with it. But I'm glad I did. I can finally say I've read Jules Verne.I am going to buy and read other works from Jules Verne hopefully optimized for Kindle. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Over the decades, I have read \\"Journey ...\\" a few times.

Having the book read to me by my favorite actors enhanced the experience rather than diminished it. I'd read the book back in high school, but Nimoy and DeLancie really bring the story to life. This is a wonderful work of science fiction which was way ahead of its time. Written in the late 1800s it still has the power to touch us today.

They reach the center of the earth to find but an emty sherical room with a great ball of magma floating in the center. In minutes of arrival the magma erupts spuring out heat that would have melted an average man on contact. Luckily they catch a floting chunk of rock and ride it from the center of the earth to the skies above their land. They land hard and abruptly, their journey over???"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Somehow, in my youth, I missed reading \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\". Now, as someone well into middle age, I thought it timely to catch up with a classic.Jules Verne has written a book which, in my mind, is almost of the \\"boys' own\\" genre. The story is very far fetched. Indeed, too far fetched. An old manuscript is located which, when deciphered tells of a portal to the centre of the world. An extinct volcano in Iceland leads three explorers, Professor Hartwigg, his nephew, Harry, and their local Icelandic guide, the phlegmatic Hans, to a subterranean world. Together they traverse a vast network of ancient tunnels before coming upon an underground sea complete with pre-historic creatures from the time of the dinosaurs. I should also add that for the entire journey, they have access to electric lanterns and then, when on the sea, there is a strange artificial light by which they can see. Eventually, they are thrust to the surface upon a raft they construct. Their point of re-entry is the island of Stromboli in Italy.I suspect that many might think that I am being too critical. Just remember that it is a work of fiction and go with the flow so to speak. This is a valid point. However, at many tmes during the novel, I was brought to compare this book with the works of the great British novelist, H.G. Wells. They were both approximately contemporaneous. Yet, Wells was by far the better story teller. He wrote of invasions from outer space and time travel. In other words, they were both writing of science fiction in many of their works. Wells's work is by far the superior.So, in summary, I recommend that people read \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\". It is an interesting tale that moves at a good clip. However, do not expect a great work of literature."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This work has Jules Verne's normal scientific explanation of things. However, this work was particularly interesting because of its interaction between the journey and the historical worldwide flood."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"***This review may contain spoilers and is based on the English translation that labels the Professor as \\"Hardwigg\\", his nephew as \\"Harry\\", and their Icelandic equipment porter as \\"Hans\\"***Ironically, Harry was right of course about the Earth's composition. Earth's center is fiery molten iron/nickel core, not a prehistoric underworld. But James Verne was probably not aware of this discomfiting fact when he penned his classic science expedition adventure \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" (hereafter, JCE). It's inconsequential, because Verne went ahead and captured the true essence of how an expedition begins, how it is prepared for and equipped, and what data the expedition records. Verne also illuminates the vivid but widely diverse personalities of the three men who embark on this stunning trek, the obsessed leader of the trip Professor Hardwigg, his unwilling but scientifically competent nephew Harry, and the industrious, phlegmatic, dependable Hans (but no duck, Gertrude or otherwise).Professor Hardwigg's discovery of a parchment by the late Arne Saknusseum (hereafter A.S.) launches the tale. \\"A.S.\\" is widely believed to be the first person to reach Earth's center and return alive. Hardwigg eagerly believes the parchment is a road map to the center and attempts to decipher it, without success. On the other hand, Harry's last thing on his mind is a mad, dangerous subterranean trip; he is more interested in marrying his fiancee and enjoying his bourgeois comforts. The manic Hardwigg will have none of it; he insanely vows that he (and Harry) will not eat until the parchment is deciphered. Abstinence and hunger are not among Harry's pastimes, as he describes an ordeal he suffered as a little boy, when he accidentally got stuck in a chimney while trying to remove a bird's nest, and waited for hours for rescue. In a bit of foreshadowing Harry absorbingly describes the hallucinatory toll his hunger took on him, until the chimney masonry his belt is stuck on crumbled and he tumbled to safety. At length, Harry stumbles upon the parchment code; it is not in a non-German, foreign language, but simply in cunning backwards German! Alarmed, Harry attempts to keep Hardwigg from learning the answer, too, but his fast and his compassion for his uncle's mental anguish force him to divulge the secret. To Harry's further alarm, Hardwigg resolves to follow the map and A.S.'s clues (and initials) to Earth's center.However, even the impulsive Hardwigg realizes that he needs careful preparation for the trip. First, in a fairly comic chapter, he compels Harry to overcome his acrophobia (fear of heights) by climbing to the top of their town's church spire repeatedly. After all, a lot of climbing and rapelling will be involved. Next, off they go to Iceland by boat (where Hardwigg, to his irritated embarassment, suffers seasickness). Mount Sneffels, an extinct volcano A.S.'s parchment describes as the doorway to Earth's core, is located there. However, before the ascent and descent, Hardwigg secures the services of the brawny, laconic, and reliable worker and porter Hans. Hans is a workhorse, provided he gets his weekly 3 Icelandic rix-dollars. The trio lay in their supplies: food, climbing gear, bedding, and chronometer (which will measure the depth and distance from Sneffels of their descent. Verne devotes a chapter each to the ascent and descent of Sneffels. Then the expedition begins.As I said, Verne realistically captures the obstacles and obstructions of a scientific expedition, from cave claustrophobia, to rock-slides, to wrong directions, and especially the want of water, which really affects Harry. Although he may seem querulous and whiny to his uncle and to us, Harry is actually quite sensible about the necessities of an expedition. No matter how consumed Hardwigg is with his quest, the trip will fail without water. Only the discovery of internal hot springs and Han's patient release of that torrent saves the trio from thrist and incidentally releases a trickle that will lead to the core.However, as the trio follows the stream, Harry inadvertently gets separated from the group and finds himself lost with almost no food and water. Naturally, he panics and despairs. Fortunately, he is in a cavern that conducts sound well and successfully uses it to call his uncle. By deducing sound's speed through rock, Hardwigg informs the faltering, weak Harry that he is 5 MILES away from them. Nevertheless, Harry stumbles forward until he falls down a shaft and loses consciousness.Harry awakes with a head injury and tender care by his anxious uncle. To his amazement, Harry sees a beach with giant mushrooms and an ocean stretching to the horizon. Meanwhile, Hans is methodically building a raft. After Harry's convalescence, the trio set sail on the Central Sea. They endure storms, lightning, prehistoric ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs and even a magnetic ball that lands on their raft. When they finally reach land, they are stunned and disappointed to learn that the wind pushed them back to where they started! Hardwigg fumes until they find A.S.'s initials in a hole in a seaside cliff. Providence is with them.The trio spend a couple of days exploring the beach and find a treasure trove of ancient fossils. Harry and Hardwigg wax rhapsodic about their finds, especially when they discover an ancient blade that could have only belonged to Saknusseum. Even more shocking, Harry and Hardwigg discover a herd of living mastodons (elephant-like creatures) feeding on trees, and being tended by a giant caveman. At Harry's insistence, they wisely don't get any closer.Finally, the trio enter the cave in the cliff and follow A.S.'s trail until they reach an impassable boulder, which fell after Saknusseum's time. The trio decide to dynamite the boulder. Bad move. The explosion does remove the obstacle, but the seismic shock also causes the sea to pour into the new gap. The trio has barely enough time to ride the swell along the shaft. Along they go (with Harry having an amusing but horrifying dream about an \\"Ape Gigans\\" chasing him) until they improbably enter the shaft of a live volcano with lava about to erupt. At length, the volcano (which turns out to be Stromboli in Italy) spews out the trio. Fabricating a shipwreck tale to describe their haggard appearance, they receive aid from Italian fisherman and a voyage home to a heroes' welcome in Konigstrausse, Germany. Hans receives his proper wages from Hardwigg and returns to Iceland. Impressed by Harry's feat, his fiancee agrees to marry him. However, despite the accolades, Hardwigg is upset because the compass he brought along on the journey no longer pointed north. Harry comes to the \\"rescue\\" by explaining that the magnetic ball on the raft reversed the polarity. Now everyone can be happy.Again, if you can overlook the scientific inaccuracies (including the premise, the impossibility of riding hot lava, and being spewed miles away without death and injury) JCE gives you an exciting, engrossing, easy-to-follow, largely realistic scientific expedition. Through Hardwick, JCE also reminds us expedition leaders NEED to be indomitable, obsessed, and even slightly mad to be effective. Nevertheless, expeditions need to balance the Ahab-like megalomania with cautious, quietly competent, hard-working, and loyal followers (personified by Harry and Hans) to be focused and successful. And yet, I noticed a (I think) slight flaw toward JCE's end. The expedition brought NO tangible evidence that they traveled beneath the earth (of course how could they, being spit out by a volcano?). So why is the Professor and company being feted? The movie version of JCE starring James Mason as the Professor at least acknowledges that oversight by modestly stating that he doesn't deserve the celebrity because he brought no souvenirs of his trip.

The book isn't that hard so people of younger ages can also read it. The translation is very nice. The book starts out with Axel's uncle, Professor Otto Lidenbrock discovering a piece of paper containing a secret message from Arne Saknussemm. Professor Lidenbrock decodes the message which tells them to go in to a volcano and descend in to the center of the earth. Axel doesn't want to do it but his uncle is determined to. To help them out, they hire a man named Hans to be their guide. The group of explorers start to descend in to the volcano towards the center of the earth. Soon they are running very low on water. Axel and his uncle are depending on Hans to find a stream for them. If he he doesn't find some water quickly, they will all die from thirst.

The book requires some suspension of belief that three men can travel hundreds of miles underground for months without fresh air and limited supplies, not to mention find fantastic prehistoric creatures living underground, but if you can look past the logic you can still enjoy it. The professor's arguments for the center of the earth not being a molten core are almost convincing, even if we know he's wrong. I found the professor to be the most interesting character in the novel.

Joseph Campbell speaks of the Hero Cycle involving many things, such as a dismemberment or crucifixion being associated with the threshold crossing. As the trio enters the volcano, there is nothing horrendous about their passage. There is no \\"elixir theft,\\" although Arne Saknusemm's dagger could have fit the bill. Lastly, there is no real character development. You have the clash and tension between Harry and the Professor: young-old, scientist-novice, driven-reluctant. But there is not enough to drive the story, and no enchantment.There are some mythic elements, but they seem a bit haphazard. They exit the earth, the \\"belly of the whale,\\" by way of a torrent and lava, the Masonic fire and water trial. IT pushes them out and up, in a mock rebirth. Then they land in paradisiacal Italy, contrasting with cold and dead Iceland. This is the motif of a \\"sacred grove,\\" but it is never utilized fully.Furthermore, there are some structural problems. Specially, Verne has two backtracks. The first is in Chapter 18, when they take the wrong road, and then Chapter 33, with the storm blowing the raft back to the starting point. Aesthetically, this is wonderful parallelism, but by the time you get to the discovery and the back track, you feel cheated. All the reading you have done up to that point was pointless.The ending is rushed, and the denouement seems like a slipknot at times. I would have preferred a bit drawn out enduing and the possibility of a sequel. After all, who is Arne Saknusemm, and is there more to mysterious and even Christic figure? He is a Buddha, an enlightened one who leads the way for other to follow as they go through the underworld that is middle earth.It is Verne's second book, so he is still in the process of becoming \\"Verne\\" or the icon we have depicted in \\"Back To The Future III.\\" Despite my criticism, you do see the wonderful characters and Technicolor and three-dimensional scientists at work. They are not the flat logic boxes or computing machines, like Sherlock Holmes, or the campy \\"Professor\\" cutout character on bad TV programming.Vern can spin a yarn, and mix enough technical scientific detail to make it believable. I am not familiar with Verne's scientific background, but he understands that science is merely part of the backdrop to any science fiction story.Leonard Nemoy's afterward in the Signature Books Edition (0451528964) is worth reading. He does an analysis between the father-son relationship of Harry and th Professor. He caught things that I had missed, in my frustration of the backtracking problems. Read after reading the text."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Yea, yea, I know this one is a \\"classic\\". But sheesh, it's just not a good story imho. So much of it spent in the bickering between the professor and his nephew, and the \\"science\\" part of the science fiction really seems to be missing in most places. And I just flat out didn't like the reader for the audiobook. I go through a lot of audiobooks, and I consider this to be one of the worst I've listened to."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A lumbering read, alot of talk about the ground. Three characters, one is monosybolic, one is TOTALLY commited and the first person account whines all the time. He wants to hook-up with his cousin. Hmmm. A read to say you have read it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"One thing I did not realize about the book Journey to the Center of the Earth was that it was originally written in French by Jules Verne. This book is my first reading of any of his works, and after reading Journey to the Center of the Earth, I am somewhat apprehensive but feel confident in reading more of his other books. The story of Journey to the Center of the Earth is started out beautifully &agrave; la in the prose of John Steinbeck, and I thought I was going to be taken on a great ride. Somehow, I was getting more disappointed as the more I got to know to Professor Lidenbrock, who of course influenced the creation of the Doc character from Back to the Future, because he is such a hard-headed a-hole. I just didn't like the one-dimensional mindedness that he carries along with his absolute pedantic method that makes me want to punch his nose every time he goes on his \\"I am right, and you are wrong\\" argument. Therefore, I felt sorry for the nephew who had to put up with him. In the meanwhile, the journey to the center of the earth begins in Iceland which influenced me greatly to look up the internet the history of the country and the pictures, so anytime I think of the book, Iceland will come to my mind, or vice-versa. Of course, the feeling of the adventurous trip is much akin to Indiana Jones movies except the sacrilegious fourth part. Before that journey was embarked, I just can't help but feel how utterly stupid the idea is and the nonsensical undertaking is. Then again, I have to remind myself that the book is purely science fiction. I want to make two points of mention from early chapters of the book. The nephew is right in calculating the number of combinations twenty letters can make but only twenty distinct (no repeats) letters. How the math is done is that it is 20 times 19 times 18 times 17 times...3 times 2 times 1 letters (multiplication format, as I mean). Actually, this is not a combination but rather a permutation. So, that's a small change in the wording but a big difference because the ordering of the words does not matter at all during combinations yet the nephew is concerned about putting the words in an order which is exactly the definition of permutation. The next point which I think the uncle made a serious error when it came to calculating the temperature of the center of the earth. He said that the radius of the earth is over 4,000 miles and to go to the center, it takes one degree for every seventy feet below. In end, he calculated the temperature of the center to be over two million degrees. Whether that is in Centigrade, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, he doesn't say. There are 5,280 feet in a mile, so in 4,000 miles, we have 2.1 x 10^7 feet (or 21 billion feet) and then to divide that by 70 feet, we get 301,714 degrees. If that is in Centigrade, then it is 543,117 degrees Fahrenheit. If it's the other way, then it is 167,601 degrees Celsius and also 167,874 Kelvins. So, the uncle is wrong, wrong, wrong! Of course, he goes further with more techno babble elsewhere in the book that I can't really say if he is right or not because I have zero expertise in geology. In short, a guy like Andy Dufresne would immensely enjoy reading Journey to the Center of the Earth, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if that book influenced him to take up geology. On a second thought, as for myself, I think I will do so the same and credit the book for sparking my interest. As for the reading of the adventure to the end, I think Jules Verne has really captured my attention because of the rush and tension that came with the journey, but too bad that every chapter was spoiled by its heading. For example, Chapter 22 is the search of water, and the next Chapter kills the suspense with its heading \\"We Find Water.\\" Another is Chapter 28 where the nephew is in the dark the whole time and is completely lost and I wonder if he gets rescued. The next two chapters come with the heading \\"I Hear Voices\\" and \\"Saved.\\" Hey...thanks a lot...way to go...lovely....really lovely. Of course, during the trip, I can't stand the uncle and was dying to finish the book and be done with it because of him. All in all, Journey to the Center of the Earth is a great read that is suitable for all ages although a great deal of suspension of disbelief is required, and I only ask for the uncle to be replaced with somebody else with a better personality."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book was the equivalent of a 3D movie in the 1800's, meaning it had virtually no plot, but lots of visual effects. Jules Verne was exploring the scientific intrigue at the time, as science fiction became more popular. While some people like this kind of writing, I certainly didn't."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"The book Journey the the Centre of the Earth was not as good as I had expected it to be considering that the other novels that Jules Verne has written have been better. In my view, I would have to say that there was too much science terms and in doing so it made things extremely confusing. I would definetly never reccomend this book to anyone unless they really like science novels. I think that the book described things a little fully and at a point I was bored. I only found about three pages that actually engrossed me into the book. There was a beginning middle and an end but the middle was very long.

I myself like to have a journey to the crater of a volcano. One of the exciting story about volcanoes is this book. Though it is somewhat surealistic, Jules Verne was able to present a life-like story that is able to draw the readers' minds, as if as they were in the story themselves. Through his words, we can feel the beauty of the scenery in Iceland, the suspense and thrill of the characters' adventure, the imagination of the living creatures inside the earth, and the joy of the characters after their success in 'go down to the centre of the earth and back in three pieces (the Professor, Harry, and Hans)'.

The images that this conjures are just breathtaking and it's full of suspense and edge of your seat excitement. Verne just takes a painting, a masterpiece and depicts a massive underground ocean and a raging storm, all while in the center of the Earth. No, they don't actually make it all the way, but you root and you cheer, crossing your fingers, hoping they don't slip and fall. Then you're sort of disappointed when they don't make it, but who cares, they went on a journey even the slightest fraction of a way through the center of the Earth, it's utterly fascinating."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Narrated by Spock & Q?Can life get any better than that?Cheers"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"JULES VERNE BOOKS ARE AWESOME WHEN I READ THEM IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY THERE EVEN THE MOVIES"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"no much comments, classic fiction novel. help me understand more in my literature class but I do not remember where I put it now..."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Before you read this, please understand that I liked this book in some places. Here is a timeline (that may contain spoilers) of my thoughts on the book.The beginning was epic. I was thinking, \\"Heck yea, I'm reading a classic that has dinosaurs, rocks, science, etc. I'm reading heavy stuff.\\"The start of the book was amazing. With Leidenbrock finding the code in the old book by A.S. and they make their way to Iceland. I especially loved the dealing with the code and the confusing and fear of Axel. Grauben sounds like such a doll.When they get to Iceland it was still kind of interesting. Axel has to deal with his fear of heights and I liked the idea of climbing the tower every day.Here is where the book starts to get a bit dull. From around page 60 to page 90 I call it Journey to the Center of Boredom. I don't need 30 pages to tell me they went here, stopped here, there was grey rock here, they stopped for the night there. Realistically, this is what would happen. Then again, I want to read a fictional novel, not a travel guide.Getting inside the mountain was quite clever. I specially liked the idea they had for rope. Their travels inside of the darkened hall was most excellent, but then, again, the book takes a turn for the worst. Magically they find a stream when they are about to die of thirst. And, as one reviewer said, they magically have enough stuff to be able to survive for so long. I mean honest to God, they are literally carrying hundreds of pounds EACH. Ladders, 400 feet of rope, 3 months supply of food, sleeping wear, medicine kits, rifles, 50 pounds of explosive powder, a torch, lanterns, that's just the beginning! Don't forget the compass, the 5+ different types of equipment they have to measure the temperature and their depths, etc. Then you have the books they carry to mark everything. It all starts to add up. And, keep in mind, they are walking around 90 leagues a day (a league, if you look it up, is around 3 miles). So they are wearing hundreds of pounds, going downhill, and walking so fast when the average person in a 12 hour period walks about 36 miles without wearing weight. Doesn't that seem a bit odd? And as for a gripe about the water, they started a stream they nicknamed the Hansbach that was a little trail of water that went downhill. They followed it and when they needed a drink they stopped and got from this stream. If you think about it, though, a little stream going downhill for even ONE mile would be SO polluted with sediment that it would make you sick to drink it.So they get into the interior of the Earth after the ungodly smart 16 year old narrator, Axel, has passed out about 3 times already. It's possible that life could, technically, survive down there. Plants CAN grow without sunlight.Perhaps it was because I saw the movie before I read the book, but I was disappointed that there were no T-rex's! I won't hold it against the book, though. What I WILL hold against it is that for a book so heavy with science, Verne should have known that these creatures would have evolved. In this book the fish didn't have eyes and there were mastadons. Technically that wouldn't happen. They would all become different over time.The last of the book was kind of a pain in the butt. I had this problem with the movie was well. They are on some type of floating device (the movie had a dinosaur skull, these guys had a raft) that, for some reason as they are going around 90 miles an hour with the water pushing them that fast, NEVER clip the side even a smidgen. Their floating device stays in the same position for literally a whole day in the book whether it's when they are being shoved at a high speed horizontally or through the geyser at the end. That doesn't fly with me. Not to mention, if they were shot out the top of the volcano on a raft that had been under intense heat and being weakened with water for hours, they would have been decimated as they hit the ground. How does Verne get past this? They are going up, up, up, all of a sudden Axel wakes up outside with Hans over him. They landed.The writing in this book is absolutely excellent, but I am asked to believe just too much for this story to be real. It's a great book if you want to stretch your imagination so much that it will leave marks, but not for a reader of fiction that wants realistic fiction.John McAdamEnoch and the ExtraterrestrialsAreothWesth: Sun Thieves (Areoth Adventure)"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is better than any movie version I've ever seen or will probably seen.

I rate this book four stars because this book has great imagery and is very believable considering the fact that this journey never took place.This book deserves four stars because Verne's imagination makes this book an easy read with his use of vivid descriptions of the journey. The journey starts off with a scientist who finds a map to the center of the earth. Himself, his nephew, and a guide journey down an old volcano towards the center of the earth. On their journey they find all kinds of, thought to be extinct, animals and cavemen.Although the three men find many exciting things they also encounter many hardships. The men are suffering from lack of food because they are miles from the surface of the earth, and they lack water because there are no water sources nearby. The men somehow find a river that is boiling hot due to the fact that they are inside a dormant volcano. When they find the underground world they also get food from the wild plants growing around them.In my opinion this book is one of the greatest science fiction books that I have read. Jules Verne is an excellent writer who wrote many great books. This book is about three men who go on an expedition to the center of the earth.

And come to think of it, there is yet another world miles under our feet!The story is narrated in very simple way with very few scientific details and terminologies used unlike '20,000 leagues under the sea' by the same author, where he used so many of complex marine terms that a person not familiar with them get frustrated.A good adventure book just like rest from Jules Verne.

Its most prominent advocate was Capt. John Cleave Symmes, who advanced the theory in about 1818. Symmes was so convincing that in the 1820s he got twenty-five members of the United States Congress to vote to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where they would enter the center of the earth through a 4,000-mile-wide cavity in the earth.It was then believed that the Lost Tribes of Israel lived on the North Pole behind a wall of ice. This theory found its way into the revelations of Joseph Smith, who in the Book of Mormon and later, said that the Lost Tribes would break down the ice and return from the \\"north countries.\\"Also, check out \\"At the Earth's Core,\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs.Land of Terror (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Verne's first true piece of Science Fiction (and one of the earliest of all that genre) is nothing less than fantastic. A short and simple story that will be enjoyed by readers of all ages, this is a 'Must Read' for all fans of science fiction. With a heavy dose of legitimate science, Verne gives this story a strong feel of authenticity that has been forgotten in much of today's SF novels. Verne's imaginary subterranean world reveals the powerful vision of the fantastic that he has become known for as a pioneer of SF. Richly detailed and certainly out of this world, Verne's creation has inspired science fiction writers and even scientists themselves for over one and a half centuries.The characters that people this novel are some of Verne's most unforgettable. The eccentric and reckless Professor Liedenbrock presents the stereotypical scientist obsessed with discovery even at the expense of safety and practicality. The stoic Hans represents the fearless devotion and calmness under fire that we still proscribe to the man's man frontiersman. And the frightened and pessimistic Axel provides the perfect reluctant hero. Each of these characters have helped shape the personas of innumerable other characters since their creation.A non-stop adventure to a fantastical world, this book remains one of my favorite in its genre. Its label as a young adult novel in unfortunate, in that people of all ages will find this one highly enjoyable. Exciting, amusing, thought-provoking, this book is not to be missed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"When I was a kid, I used to read lot of Jules Verne. In those days I couldn't read neither English, nor French so I was destined to use translations which were few and of varying quality. Nevertheless, I think I'll always remember captain Nemo and his mysterious ship, his exile on the island and his death. Stories of Jules Verne always stirred my fantasy, and I guess that he should be blamed, together with Poe and Tolkien, for me entering the world of SF&F; and staying there for a long time.Today, I'm much more cynical, writer of literary criticism in my own language, somewhat versed in few branches of Theory, result of which is, however paradoxical that may sound, growing inability to read and enjoy books from my childhood memory. Only thing that I'm capable of is sort of a nostalgic remembrance, which overlooks the style of ages, straightforward ideology, and overpopmpousnes of Verne's work. And this is a bad thing, 'cause my intellect shows me the drawbacks of this book, but my memory says otherwise. Balancing those two, I'll give in to the memory and say that \\"Journey to the center of the Earth\\" is a fantastic novel of mysterious nature and adventuring in the dark. It is a part of Fantastic voyages series, written by Jules Verne, series that tried to explain geographical and topological characteristics of various places on Earth by using latest scientific discoveries and presenting them in form of a novel. To reader of today, Verne's style may be troublesome, and many a young reader because of it will probably put book aside not feeling drawn enough into it's story, and being attacked by the language of mid 19th century sure won't help in those feelings. Today, when modern fiction has covered almost every aspect of adventure, having in it's pages every imaginable mystery solved, written in contemporary language, it is hard to imagine someone willingly taking Verne's work and reading it (unless he also feels nostalgic or has a school paper to hand in). And you couldn't blame them for that. Strength of Verne's work comes from mystery and unknown, mainly of scientific nature (psychological readings of captain Nemo I should put aside for now), mysteries which are far better explained in contemporary prose, with greater ability in novel writing and various other things.Verne's time has passed and today we may only look upon him as a pioneer of SF adventure, or as a fond memory from our childhood. Sure, we could apply modern Theory on the text and see with what we'll come out, but in a long run it won't help. One can't fool the reader so easily.\\"Journey to the center of the Earth\\" will remain fond memory but nothing more than that."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Saw the movie with my son, then bought the book. I'm reading him a chapter every night and he's digging it. So am I."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I bought this book for my 9 year old son and he really liked it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"The book A Journey to the Center of the Earth, by Jules Verne has many different pros and cons. One of the pros of the book is that it sometimes has some explanations of difficult or important things. Another pro is that it is on a very interesting topic, which of course is going to the center of the earth. It has a few attention-grabbing parts as well. It is a very good book if you are interested in rocks and geology and science in general. But this book also has many cons. These cons outweigh the pros most of the time. An important one is that it gets very confusing. The main character is known by two names, either Harry or Henry. It makes it harder to understand what is going on. Another thing that makes it hard to understand is that Jules Verne's choice of words do not help the reader work out the actions taking place well. Another con, and probably the biggest one, is that sometimes it becomes quite boring because it is like reading a textbook with endless explanations of different types of rocks, theories, and scientific happenings. It is also repetitive because the narrator goes over the theory on how the earth formed several times. The ending was pretty disappointing as well. I would only recommend this book if you have a great interest in scientific theories or geology. It goes extensively through the different stages or the formation of the earth, the stages of evolution, about the different layers of the earth and how certain features below the earth's surface were created. If you aren't interested in that type of stuff you may find most parts of this book extremely boring. Overall I think this book was average despite of its many errors."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Over the decades, I have read \\"Journey ...\\" a few times.

Only one place on earth, Iceland, can be the beginning point for such a fanastic venture. Even the early versions on screen added Hollywood schlock to ruin this fantastic story.

Action, Adventure, Sci-fiey goodness, it has a good plot followable text (for my lexile level that is). I've always been a fan of sci-fi so if your like me dont miss out on this book by Jules Verne."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time. True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible. Yet, this novel is still a joy to read.With a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist. Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno. I won't serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint. Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time. Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth. Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body. And if you take Verne's theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible.However, I do have a couple minor gripes. Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel. Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line. Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic. During their rapid ascent (the details I won't reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., \\"the bends\\"). Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss.The nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time. A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne's vision of a subterranean world. Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book is great!

They need to go out of a volcano.Fortunatly the volcano is about to erupt.They get shot out of the volcano and arive safely back home.This book was very exciting. They made it sound like it was possible for them to get to the centre of the Earth. I just would have made it have more action and less scientific talk. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is one of Verne's best works. The characters wonderfully believable and the plot is absolutely brilliant. Okay, so you're not going to find many people that believe in the hollow earth theory these days, but who cares? It's easy to suspend your beliefs and just get caught up in the story. Admittedly, the discourses on geology can drag a little for some readers, while others may find it part of the 19th charm, it all comes down to preference. Personally, I love the 19th century \\"info dumps\\" it's an insight into how people saw the world at that time. Verne had a reputation for writing fast paced adventures full of unexpected twists and turns and Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A breathtaking fictional journey through the bowels of the planet that we the readers live on and think we know so much about. Cleverly worded, the novel grabs the readers attention from the beginning and doesn't let up until the end. Also Jules Verne's choice of plot scheme made the book a very enjoyable read. In this epic tale, A Greek professor finds a secret parchment stating that another scientist has been to the center of the earth. Taking on the adventure as a number one priority,He packs his things and literally drags his nephew with him to Iceland, where they are to begin their awesome journey. It seemed to me that everything that took place in the novel took place where it should have, one of the marks of a true author.Also, the novel was not rushed, which is one of the most common problem with adventure stories. This book made me want to read more of Verne's writting. The novel definitely deserves to be aclassic."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne&#65533;s classic novel Journey to the Center of the Earth is a must read for any science fiction book lovers. I rate this book four stars because this book has great imagery and is very believable considering the fact that this journey never took place.This book deserves four stars because Verne&#65533;s imagination makes this book an easy read with his use of vivid descriptions of the journey. The journey starts off with a scientist who finds a map to the center of the earth. Himself, his nephew, and a guide journey down an old volcano towards the center of the earth. On their journey they find all kinds of, thought to be extinct, animals and cavemen.Although the three men find many exciting things they also encounter many hardships. The men are suffering from lack of food because they are miles from the surface of the earth, and they lack water because there are no water sources nearby. The men somehow find a river that is boiling hot due to the fact that they are inside a dormant volcano. When they find the underground world they also get food from the wild plants growing around them.In my opinion this book is one of the greatest science fiction books that I have read. Jules Verne is an excellent writer who wrote many great books. This book is about three men who go on an expedition to the center of the earth. The question that you have to ask yourself before you read this is will they make it out alive. Well you will have to find out yourself by reading this great novel."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book by Jules Verne chronicles a \\"journey to the centre of the earth\\" in 1863. This was one of the earliest of Verne's \\"voyages extraordinaires\\". Alas, it's not as exciting as some of his later books. The trek down to the earth's core is long and often monotonous. Verne tries to make the whole thing as plausible as possible, using the scientific information available at the time, but of course the whole thing is totally implausible based on what we now know.

A Journey...was not an especially appealing tale for me, but I must complement the people who have brought so many classic stories to life in a short form, then gone on to give a great deal of detail about the authors, the times in which they lived, the characters, plot summaries, and even thought-provoking questions at the end.

I feel the portrail of Professor Lidenbrock was too harsh while at the same time the portrail of Axel was too weak. Professor Lidenbrock seem angry all the time rather than a curious scientist. Axel was afraid all the time and did nothing but wish to return to the surface. The music and sound effects added very much to the overall story and was done very well.

I thought I was in for a cheesy, unbeliveable story but found that Verne's work is so much more than that. Credited with beinng the father of science fiction, Verne lives up to the hype, especially when you consider that this was written around the time of the Civil War!

Every word printed comes to life in your mind as it would on the big screen. And when you go on that journey with them you will find treasures that you'll remember.

In this book, he chronicles the adventures of a German professor, his nephew, and an Icelandic guide into the depths of the earth. When I read it, it was very different from what I expected. Having been exposed to various film and television versions of this story, I imagined some sort of drilling machine was involved. Also, I had thought that there was some interaction with primitive tribes in the underground realm.On reading this book, you'll discover a very different story. The professor buys and old book, and finds an ancient manuscript written by a famous alchemist in which the alchemist claims to have journeyed to the center of the Earth. The professor inspired by this claim rushes to Iceland to retrace the alchemist's footsteps. He drags his reluctant nephew along with him, and hires a guide in Iceland. These three men proceed to walk into the crater of a volcano, and they follow the empty lava tubes into the depths of the Earth. This is more of a survival story than anything else. They face shortages of food, water, light, and more. Verne really knows how to keep a story moving. For adventure fans, this is a great book to read!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"\\"Et quacumque viam dederit fortuna sequamur\\"\\"And whatever route fortune gives, we shall follow\\"This IS your great-great-great-grandfather's adventure story, so reader beware. There's a lot of walking, a lot of exposition, and quite frankly, not a lot of action. But keep in mind...this is an original. Our modern day sensibilities expect high action out of our adventure stories...monsters, critters, thrill-a-minute. But in a much different time when society was in a much different state, \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" set the table for the adventure/scifi stories of the future.The story revolves around German Professor and \\"Savant\\" Otto Lidenbrock, though is narrated by his nephew, Axel. The two come across a manuscript that references an Icelandic explorer's expedition to the center of the earth. Upon deciphering the document, Lidenbrock exclaims: \\"Let no one take it into his head before us to try and discover the center of the earth.\\" And off they go.While much of the middle third of the book reads like a travelogue of northern Europe and anthropological tour of Iceland, the driving force of the story is the eccentric genius of Professor Lidenbrock. The professor is characterized by a certain \\"madness\\", as described by Axel. This obsessiveness is a driving characteristic that one can see across the literary spectrum of those who break new ground. In fact, one can see it across the spectrum of real life explorers as well. For without a little \\"crazy\\", who might have the strength and fortitude to forge ahead almost heedless of circumstances. Without the single-minded obsession and force of will, how would humans be driven to the hearts of darkness that lie at the root of all discovery?Like modern science fiction, Verne delves into the 19th century equivalent of cutting edge science with much speculation on portable artificial light, and various natural sciences related to deep earth biology and geology. Whereas Michael Crichton turned the real science of the possibilities of cloning extinct dinosaurs, Verne speculates on evolution, and deep earth temperatures.I couldn't help but compare the early chapters of Jules Verne's \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" to H.G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Lost World\\". They share a certain vibe in their respective late 19th/early 20th century writing style and tone. They're reminiscent, but different...\\"Journey\\" has much more of a sense of humor, and is particularly light-hearted during the early stage-setting scenes in Germany.I liked it.

I am not much for reading alot of books, but when I do read he is the authur that I choose. I thought that Journey to the Center of the Earth like all of his books was very well writen and very well developed.I especially like these types of books because, they seem that they could actualy be real and certain places mentioned could actually exist. The book starts off with a young boy telling the story. His name is Harry and he lives in Hanburg with his uncle. His uncle's name is Professor Hardwigg. He is a professor of many different sciences like philosophy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and many other sciences. In the beginning of the book the Professor makes a discovery. His discovery is a small piece of paper that is called a Runic manuscript. The hard part was trying to figure out what langauge the paper was writen in, but once it was deciphered it appeared to have directions that lead to the center of the earth. So professor Hardwigg being the adventurer that he was, was ready to set off for Ireland, which is were the paper said to go first. Harry being only 13 had no choice in the matter but to go. They took a ten day trip on a boat to Ireland and when they got there, they were supposed to go to base of a mountain where there was a cave that they would enter that would lead them to the center of the earth. The cave seemed to go down and down forever where it lead them to the very depths of the earth. When they reached the center of the earth they came across a blue sky and an ocean. They built a raft to go across it and in the middle of crossing they ecountered two prehistoric monsters fighting around them. In the story they also encounter living fire. In the center of the earth any wrong step of wrong turn could lead to most certainly death or being trapped down there forever. To find out more details and what happens in the rest of the book, you will just have to read it for yourself.Like I mentioned before the reading experience of this book was very good. The characters were very well developed, because of the information given about them and also how they were used throughout the story. Professor Hardwigg for example was a great character because he was a very smart man, but also a great adventurer. In the book as soon as the professor figured out what the paper ment he was ready to begin the journey. Harry was another great and well developed character, because of the information that was given in the beginning. Also, who would have thought that a 13 year old boy could have cracked the code before his smart uncle, so he plays a great role in this story.The plot was very well developed and very well laid out. The story went step by step not leaving out anything and everything was very well explained. In the story they talked about having to learn to repel and in the story it told exactly how and why they did this.I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and to people that think that this could actualy happen.

An amazed and fascinated France eagerly awaited the weekly installments, as the unbounded genius of the young author captured the imagination of Europe and soon the world. Countless boys and even adults were inspired by Verne's ability to grasp the potential of inventions for the future, and to focus serious attention on hitherto unexplored regions of the earth (or beneath it, or the ocean), or over it. Obviously for such literary spotlighting of mankind's present and future endeavors, Verne required a new kind of hero--the Scientist, rather than the swashbuckling romantic of the Romantic era.JOURNEY is admittedly Verne's most improbable adventure, yet readers marvel at his detailed foresight in the provisons required, plus in his ability to insert theories of the earth's formation into the actual plot. Unlike most of Verne's protagonists, this one is neither French, English nor American but German. Young Axel is both orphaned nephew and student assistant to his brilliant geologist uncle, Professor Lidenbrock of Hamburg. When the latter discovers an ancient manuscript in an antiquarian book purchase, he becomes instantly obsessed with its translation and then with the passion to follow in the footsteps of a medieval Icelandic exlporer, Arne Saknussem.Axel is wary of such folly and argues the dangers, but the single-willed professor counters all scientific reasoning with a logic of his own, both before and during their arduous journey. With their stoic but resourceful guide, Hans, the three men undertake to seek the center of the earht, using the Icelandic volcano of Sneffels as their portal to mystery and danger. Is academic fame a sufficient lure for one, or mere weekly salary for another? Axel's own personality (often dreamng of his beloved cousin)undergoes a true metamorphosis as the result of months of hardship in the bowels of the earth. Still fresh almost 150 years later, this adventure tale is certain to entertain and enlighten. (Ignore subsequent movie versions with change the cast.)"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"The Great Illustrated classics are great (no pun intended) Journey To The Center Of The Earth is so cool.

On theme is you should never give up. This is showed by Axel's uncle, he keeps going on without caring about the dangers that lay ahead. He also can persuade them by his voice that is all knowing leads Axel to believe that he should keep going on. This act of bravery helps them through their toughest challenges.This book is somewhat believable because they describe the scenery so well that it seems real not just in a book. But the book seems unreal because we all know what happens in real life so this book breaks the natural laws of the earth.

However, unlike Lord of the Rings this book takes you UNDER the ground and in the 1800s and therefore does not have mythological or middle-earth dialogue.

I got my hands on and read a book at my local library called &quot;A TRIP to the Center of the Earth,&quot; by Jules Verne. The main character was named Professor Hardwigg. Of course I've heard of &quot;A JOURNEY...&quot; by Verne. Now I learn the professor (main character...?) in that book is named Lindenbrock. The professor's nephew has a different name in each book too, but the Icelandic guide (Hans) is the same. From everything else I can tell, the settings, plots, etc., are IDENTICAL.

If you haven't read it yet you should read it because I think you would agree with me!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"In nearly all cases where a book is turned into a movie, I much prefer the book. This is one case where the screenplay is superior to the original story.Almost everyone has seen the movie (now out on DVD) starring James Mason and Pat Boone as the intrepid explorers, so the comparison is inevitable.I had just finished Jordan Stump's new translation of Verne's 'Mysterious Island' (Publisher: Modern Library; December 10, 2002) and was thoroughly delighted, so I was eager to read another of Verne's works.While the book starts out in good form, it really starts to drag a bit and getting to the actual point of the descent into the interior of the earth takes too long. Once there, we have only the Professor, (Hardwigg, in my copy's translation); Harry (Alec/Pat Boone in the movie) and Hans. No academic scoundrel (Professor Goetaborg) to race them to Iceland; no evil Count Saknussem to dog their steps and wreak havoc; no Mrs. Carla Goetaborg to keep the crusty Professor in line; and no \\"Gertude\\" to add comic relief. Instead, we are treated to a rather, well, unexciting account of what is of course a very imaginative journey.Frankly, without the additional characters and plot elements provided in the screenplay, it gets a bit boring down there. Which is, of course, why the screenwriters livened up the story to include, especially, the evil Count Saknussem. It needed that element of a diabolical plotter out to thwart the expedition to increase the tension and mystery.If you want the best of Verne, read the aforementioned new translation of 'Mysterious Island'. You will not be disappointedIn the present case, buy the wonderful DVD instead and grab the popcorn."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"While not the most riveting Sci-fi thriller, JTTCOTE should certainly be on every science fiction fan's shelf. The plot is quite suspenseful but a bit anti-climatic. Please keep in mind that it was written in 1862, the damn Civil War was on! The end is a bit silly, but everything else is written brilliantly.

He did considerable research in geology and he attempts to make the story as plausible as it can be based on the knowledge of 19th century science. Even though we now know that the &quot;journey&quot; can't be made, Verne is still successful in his tale. A German scientist, the irascible Professor Otto Lidenbrock, and his nephew Axel, uncover an ancient manuscript that reports of an earlier explorer's journey to the center of the Earth. The two travel to Iceland and, with the aid of the quiet and resourceful Hans, they enter an extinct volcano. In their travels, they discover an underground ocean, forests, and have to return to the surface via an active volcano! I enjoyed the novel even though I already was well aware of the story."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This was a very good book. It is basically about a Professer Hardwigg and his nephew Harry who with their guide Hans try to make it to the center of the earth in the footsteps of an Arne Saknuessem. They don't make it to the actual center of the earth, but they do come very, very close. Until they get blown out of a volcano! This book was very interesting. There was never a dull moment. I really LOVED this book."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"When I first read this book I was thrilled! It only gets better when you re-read it. Verne uses excellent descriptions so that readers can walk right along side Axel, his uncle and Hans on an expedition to reach the center of the globe! This is a novel siuation that no &quot;traveler&quot; ever recounted before so there are many surprises. The numerous adventures and use of first person narritive highten the supense. Fans of science fiction and of great lituature will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"The free Journey to the Center of the Earth ebook is a very poor translation with a main character named Harry. The plot is butchered and the narrative is a mess. If you would like to shell out a couple of dollars and get a very good translation and a much better read, you should look in to the Literary Classics Collection version (Journey to the Centre of the Earth - Full Version (Illustrated and Annotated) (Literary Classics Collection)) or the SF Classic edition (Journey to the Center of the Earth (Illustrated Collectors Edition) (Active Table of Contents) (New Translation) (53 Illustrations) (SF Classic)). Regardless, the main characters in the \\"good\\" translation should be Axel and professor Lidenbrock."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I enjoyed Journey to the Center of the Earth a surprising amount. Before finally reading this unabridged version, I had become very familiar with the basic plot by reading an abridged version several times in childhood. That (10 made me aware of the novel's obvious flaws, such as the wimpy narrator, the preposterous science, and the sudden ending, and (20 seemed to assure that I could not be surprised by much in the story.But I was. The premise and story were just as ridiculous as I expected and the characters were sort of cartoons, and I loved it all anyway. there's an undeniable charm, and even humor, to Verne's narratives and to his narrative voice, and the sillier the novel was this time, the more I enjoyed it. The ending is still a little too easy for my tasted, but I was also just sad, at that point, that the quick-paced ride was ending. I doubt that I will understestimate a Verne novel again."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I still very much enjoy this book decades after I read it the first time -- still a fascinating idea with intriguing characters. It's no surprise that Hollywood has been able to use it routinely as a gold mine for new film projects decade after decade (the best, in my opinion, is still the James Mason version).And, yes, the science can be a bit dated (I mean, what do you expect more than a hundred years later?), but in a way that's part of the fun of the book, too, picking out those things that you're like \\"Whaaaa? That's not right.\\" Heh. Or trying to track down some of the places or items Verne mentions and see if they really are real. The writing can also be a bit slow, but again that's expected given the era in which it was written, when pretty much all the writing of that day had those sort of pacing, but nevertheless it's an enjoyable read. You just need to be a little patient with it.And it's nice to find this book and so many others free for download here on Amazon. It helps me revisit all those classics I loved as a kid."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This review is for the Robert Baldick translation, published by Puffin Classics. I have not read any other version, but from the research I have done, this seems to be one of the more faithful translations available. In the essay, \\"Journey Without End: On Translating Verne\\" William Butcher (a respected scholar who has published some of the most recent - and some might suggest, most faithful - versions of some of Verne's works) has spoken highly of Baldick's translation.While the science behind the story is obviously outdated, the story is still an excellent one. Not only is it a rousing adventure, but it provides an insight into open minded thought at the time it was published. In this context, it hardly matters that the theories presented have been disproved, because the manner in which they challenged the status quo is admirable. Professor Lindenbrock even states, in the course of a discussion with his nephew (slightly paraphrased, as I do not have the book in front of me at the moment): \\"Science is a series of mistakes, but mistakes which it is useful to make, for they lead us to the truth.\\" As a bonus, the Puffin edition comes with some extra notes that explain our modern understanding of the center of the earth.The eccentric professor and his timid nephew engage in a series of adventures that are now familiar territory for science fiction (decoding of a long forgotten message, discovery of an ancient world, etc.), but are none the less entertaining. The introduction of the book goes so far as to claim that Professor Lindenbrock is the very first \\"mad scientist\\" in fiction, and it is at least certain that his character provided inspiration for the plethora that would later inundate literature and television.This book was my introduction to Verne, and it has inspired me to check out his other works. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"In the age of instant gratification, this one is special. Preparing slowly the adventure, making sure every small detail was well thought off and well planned, taking the time to prepare the plot, the characters and the scenary, you won't find many books like this today.I gave it four stars, even though I think it rightly deserves five, because people, especially kids, will probably not have the patience to enjoy the slow pace this book unfolds.

The story begins when Professor Hardwigg finds a very old book with a piece of parchment in it. On the parchment was a form of writing in some secret code. When the Professor and his nephew, Harry, discovered its meaning they were both shocked to find out it was the instructions for a journey no man thought possible, the journey to the center of the earth! Almost immediately they went on the journey picking up a man by the name of Hans to be there guide. There were many hard times in this adventure. For example, the Professor thought that they would find water in an abundance only to find that there was none till Hans made the discovery by drilling through a wall. Who knows how they will ever survive.

It was easy to read, enjoy and visualize, and I quickly finished it.The story revolves around a young man and his uncle, who is a scientist. They discover a route to the center of the earth (hence the title), and the novel is about their journey. Once you get 100 pages into this book, you aren't able to stop. The things they find boggle the mind, but seem so real.100 years from now, people will still be enjoying Jules Verne, because he captures the imagination of the young explorer."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Recently I read this book for school.

It takes a while before the team finally starts down to the center of the earth. But one good thing about this is the fact they don't use a drill to go down (They hike instead). Also, sorry to ruin the book, but they don't even make it to the center of earth. The book however is still enjoyable. A wonderous and excellent tale I would reccommend for fans of Jules Verne or of adventure stories."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Forget for the moment the established theory that the center of the Earth is a ball of fire, and enjoy this wonderful adventure written over a century ago that offered an alternative view. I'm a big fan of Journey To The Center Of The Earth. I've read the book and seen the movie countless times, and still never tire of it. Alien Voices attempts to tell the story in a way that would suit a modern audience, while still retaining the spirit of the original. Long, descriptive passages can be circumvented in the aural medium with a few lines of dialogue or sound effects, and tighten the pace. Projecting the fascination of the unknown and portraying science in a highly positive way is indeed very Verne, and in this Alien Voices get it exactly right. Leonard Nimoy is an unsurpassably brilliant actor who brings the crotchety and irascible Professor Lidenbrock to life with panache. This is one man whose voice is perfectly suited to audio. John DeLancie unfortunately overdoes his part way too much for my liking, being too soppy and emotive as Axel. Still, that's the way Axel was written, so I can't say he got it wrong! The acting all round is competant, though it's mostly Nimoy and DeLancie who we hear, and they are seasoned professionals in film and t.v anyway. Put this on the headphones, and the sound quality becomes most evident, and you'll soon be taken away into the past. A worthy interpretation, for the most part, certainly to be congratulated for being far truer to the novel than the nonetheless highly enjoyable 1959 film."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Download all the great classics possible.

Seeing as it is free and the Kindle can hold thousands of books, there is no reason not to download this amazing novel. for Jules Verne diehards like Emmet Brown, I will warn you that there are a few veery slight discrepamcies between this digital copy and the original text, but it is not different at all in story or plot. For those unfamiliar with basic geology and other sciences, DO NOT belive everything in this book. Verne was an extremely inelligent ma ahead of his time, but that cannot replace a century and a half of sciemtific progress since publication. However, what we now view as inaccuracies (theories of te period debated and expressed by two main characters) in no way mar the book or make it the least bit less pleasurable to read. Despite having progressed from science fiction (for at the time the book\`s events obeyed all contemporary assumptions on geolgy and prehistory) to fantasy, I would recommend this enduring classic to anyone I know, and as I am doing right now, to people I don't know. While not tremendously long(if you read just an hour a night you'll be done inside a week) it is certainly worth your time and will not fail to entertain you."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"It took me a little while to get through it because it goes into so much detail, but overall I enjoyed it.

They start off in Iceland where they pick up a guide named Hans who speaks so little in the book you often forget about him. The story moves along slowly until about half way through the book. That's where the action begins, I have seen I think two movies based on the book and neither were close in story to the book. The science is dated and even a little silly, however it does not take away from the story. Not the most memorable of the (Classics) I have read but an enjoyable read all the same.."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"It's an oldie but a goodie. That's what I like to say about books that are written so long ago and yet they still remain relevant and entertaining. A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception. While the original publication goes back to 1864, it is a fun romp nonetheless. It should be noted that, over the years, different translations of the book have been made. This version from Amazon comes at the low, low cost of free. One notable difference between this translation and the original is that the name of one of the main characters is changed. But these things are trivial, as the story of a professor, his nephew, and a loyal guide is entertaining the whole way through.The Good: There were a few things I really liked about this book. First, the adventure. The excursion into the unknown was fascinating. Nevermind that what happens in the book could never actually be real; when you are reading the story you imagine that it is. You feel the danger and suspense as the three explorers go deeper into the earth and discover many fascinating things. Also, I found it interesting that the story is written as if it is an actual, educational account. Throughout the entirety of the book, the narrative explains the meaning of certain scientific terms and past discoveries that are relatable to what the explorers see and experience. It certainly is a fun journey to follow them as they make their way to the center of the earth!The Bad: One problem with a book that is so old is the terminology and phrasing. There are many words and phrases used that we just don't use today. At times, I had some trouble understanding exactly what was being described or talked about. For instance, on more than one occasion it mentions how the explorers stopped to have \\"repast\\". This isn't a term most would use today, and it simply means they stopped to eat or have a meal. Also, the pacing in the beginning is a little slow, and the real fun of the adventure does not begin until about a third of the way through the book.The Ugly: This one is not really a fault of the book, after all, I have to take the time period it was written in into account. This book has seen a few adaptations in the film industry. The result is that I was expecting some of the things I have seen in the movies. Despite all the wonderful things seen on their journey, all of what they see is plausible for the time period written. Instead of finding areas with lack of gravity or floating rocks, the explorers happen upon a world stuck in the far past, thousands of years before their journey. All of it, in a sense, was real at one point. Many of the movies today depict things that have never happened in the earth's history, and fantastical things that it will probably never see either. If you are expecting an account following what has been shown in film, you may be disappointed.Overall, I really liked A Journey to the Centre of the Earth. It was fun to see into the past in more way than one and appreciate the perspective of a science fiction writer from a century and a half ago. I highly recommend you read this, if you haven't already. This is classic science fiction. Like I said at the beginning, it's an oldie but a goodie."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Excellent story; Verne is the master of science fiction! The story has a constant pulse of science and adventure that kept me reading. The story is also steeped with various metaphors and insights into Verne's personal life.Verne was truly a genius - I know many people will disagree because of the fact that clearly this story, overall, is impossible but first of all it is actually solidly backed by the amount of science that was known at the time and second it was written to entertain and hopefully educate people in some science/geology and hopefully encourage them to begin analyzing the world around them and to go on an adventure.The story could be enjoyable as a light read but I would encourage people to really read into it, especially the father/son relationship between Axel and the professor as this will prove to be a very insightful look into attitude towards his own father. Also, the series of discoveries through mistakes and chance provides a rather different, if not comical, look at the true art of scientific discovery that Verne invested so much of his life.I would highly encourage anyone, especially if you are interested at all in science, to read this and other of Verne's works. If nothing more his books will certainly entertain you and open your eyes to the wondrous world all around you, even under your very feet!"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I haven't been an avid reader for ages.. that is, until I found this book.

I had to explain that the movie had references to the book and that the main characters used the book as research. My son was mystified. He asked if he could have the book to read it. I immediately called up the Amazon store on my iPhone and ordered the book for him. This specific version was so terribly inexpensive I could not go wrong (even better with my Prime account). A few days later the book arrived and my son began reading it. About a week or so later he has finished it and loved it. I noticed that he just checked out \\"20000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" so I think he has been bitten by the \\"Big Boy Book\\" bug. These books are among the first books he has read front to back that included NO PICTURES (yeah). It is great to see him dive into it like he did."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"It had been many years since I had read a Jules Verne novel, and to be honest, I couldn't recall his skill as a writer at all. When I dug this book off of my bookshelf I admit, I was simply bored and looking for something mindless to read while the children fought over gluing cotton balls to construction paper.I admit that it took my mind a while to re-acclimate to the writing style of the time, not that it was difficult to read, it was just far too easy to skim. So, bringing my mind to a screeching halt, I sat down and began to truly read this wonderful novel. Let me begin with saying that the science in the novel is extremely outdated but at the time of it's writing, was plausible. If you can get your mind past the huge hurtle of your current scientific knowledge, you can appreciate this book for what it is: a brilliant science fiction/adventure novel. The conventions of the time include misunderstandings of the makeup of the earth, and the propensity to marry one's own cousins.The book is written in the form of a diary at times, and a retelling at times, of events that had passed previously. The voice of the book is the character Harry, nephew and assistant to Professor Von Hardwigg. The novel begins with the professor's discovery of a secret parchment which when decoded gives the location that a previous explorer used to enter the bowels of the earth. The immediately set out to follow in the footsteps of this great explorer of centuries before. Joining them is Hans, the apparent superman of Iceland. He never complains, rarely talks, and saves the lives of those around him on a regular basis. I cannot help but to believe that this is Verne's ideal man, his \\"Adonis\\" if you will. The Professor, though he loves Harry, is a closet ADHD case hidden behind a brilliant and stubborn mind. There is great adoration for his nephew, on those occasions when he stops moving or talking long enough to notice him. Harry, who is telling the story, is easily written off as a coward; however he is so much more than that if you take into account the beliefs of the time. He is following his uncle on a dangerous journey into the unknown to a place he does not even believe exists. (Harry's beliefs are far closer to the reality that we understand, however in this novel they are all completely incorrect)Upon entering the depths of the earth many hardships and terrors await the three, ranging from dehydration, starvation, dinosaurs, many falls, getting separated, raging storms on underground seas and volcanic eruptions. I won't go into great detail suffice to say that the movie, though highly entertaining, does no justice to this story. Spray painted iguanas with horns are far from what is described in this book. If you have spare time on you hands, this is an excellent read and I would highly recommend it to anyone. There is a reason that this is considered \\"Literature.\\"4 of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Journey To the Center of the Earth was always one of my favorite movies and after all these years, I finally read the book. The book is not like the movie at all. Honestly, I liked the movie better however that is not to say I was in any way disappointed with the book. It moved along quickly and drew me in such that I couldn't put it down and so read it in one sitting. A geologist, his eager young nephew and an Icelandic guide make their way to the earth's core following the footsteps of a previous mysterious explorer into the dark subterranean world of weird plants, animals, rocks and unforeseen dangers. There was no woman with them as in the movie but a female companion might have spiced it up a bit. The Icelander didn't have a pet duck along as in the movie but he was an indispensible partner in the venture. All in all, it was adventurous and fun and worth my time. I enjoyed it very much. Sure glad I finally read the book!Betsy"},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Lost races, dinosaurs, volcanoes, what more could a kid want?

The expedition includes his young nephew, presumably so younger readers have someone to relate to."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's _Journey to Center of the Earth_ (1864) is an incredibly imaginative work, enlivening a reader's capacity to draw mental pictures and dream impossible concepts in concrete, believable terms. The German Professor Van Hardwigg, his teenage nephew Harry, and their stolid Icelandic guide, Hans, descend into the dormant volcano, Mount Sneffels, in Iceland at the end of June in the 1860s. According to a centuries old Icelandic manuscript by the sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist, Arne Saknussemm--Professor Hardwigg accidentally discovers the manuscript--at exactly twelve noon the early summer light of June would reveal the correct path to take in the volcano. And so, after a few overcast days, when it appears that the mission will have to wait another year, the explorers see their last glimpse of the noonday sun for two months.Verne is brilliant at blending science, history, and art to make his fiction seem realistic. The effect is that a has both a renewed interest in science and history while experiencing a memorable imaginative journey. As the explorers follow false leads, despair of ever finding water and food, become lost and then found, and face unexpected, unreal dangers, Verne captures the sense of confinement of being underground. For much of the early part of the book, the descriptions lack color and the reader almost must adjust his eyes to the light of the men's torches. The center of the book, in contrast, like the near center of the earth, is beautiful, literally creating a new world within a world.In terms of characterization, Harry expresses the explorer's angst while his uncle gives voice to the explorer's elation. Upon seeing the extinct Mount Sneffels for the first time, Harry thinks, \\"To descend into the interior of a cannon when perhaps it is loaded, and will go off at the least shock, is the act of a madman.\\" (Harry's words will later ring true). According to Harry, his uncle seeing the same sight \\"looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance.\\" Meanwhile Hans, the guide, is imperturbable, steady, and taciturn; he adds comic relief to the uncle's and nephew's extremes. As long as Hans receives his weekly wages, paid on Sunday, he is oblivious to all danger.Of the Verne novels that I have read, this is my second favorite novel, next to_ Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_. There are two harrowing middle chapters, \\"Alone\\" and \\"Lost\\"--the sentence for the review comes from these chapters--in _Journey to the Center of the Earth_ which are unforgettable, and the conclusion of the book is ingenious. The plot is unpredictable and clever. Verne conveys the triumph and fear of the explorer during the nineteenth-century, a period when science became ascendant.The book delighted French readers in the late 1800s--in fact, French children would eagerly look forward to Verne's latest before the Christmas holidays. Similarly delighted, I read much of the book on my commute to work on the subway, and looked forward to it in the morning and early evening."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's Journey to the Center was an excellent book because instead of the usual facts that are written down he tells us a story that has theories and facts of the earth included with in the storyline. Most of the book takes place in the earth itself, but in the beginning most of it takes place in Iceland. This book is about a professor and his nephew that make a discovery that there is a way down to the center of the earth if they ascend down a mountain in Iceland. On they're way they meet a guide that leads them to the mountain called Mt. Sneffels. After that they descend down in to the mountain. They keep going down toward the center. They face many dangers and difficulties, such as thirst, light, getting lost, some injuries and fatigue. Later in the book they make discoveries that other scientist would have thought that they never existed. Jules Verne went straight into the story after giving the characters an introduction. The story was really good because it kept you in to the book and it also was fun to read while you learn something's as well. Compared to other books like this one I find that Journey to the Center of the Earth was better than the others. That is just my opinion though. Jules Verne did an excellent job on writing this book. He includes facts like how the earth is made up. This book is very informative without you realizing that you can learn things. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and science related books because this book is packed with adventure and has a lot of facts related to science. When you finish this book you finish it with new knowledge."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"As an avid reader of Jules Verne, I enjoyed reading this book very much. I am not much for reading alot of books, but when I do read he is the authur that I choose. I thought that Journey to the Center of the Earth like all of his books was very well writen and very well developed.I especially like these types of books because, they seem that they could actualy be real and certain places mentioned could actually exist. The book starts off with a young boy telling the story. His name is Harry and he lives in Hanburg with his uncle. His uncle's name is Professor Hardwigg. He is a professor of many different sciences like philosophy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and many other sciences. In the beginning of the book the Professor makes a discovery. His discovery is a small piece of paper that is called a Runic manuscript. The hard part was trying to figure out what langauge the paper was writen in, but once it was deciphered it appeared to have directions that lead to the center of the earth. So professor Hardwigg being the adventurer that he was, was ready to set off for Ireland, which is were the paper said to go first. Harry being only 13 had no choice in the matter but to go. They took a ten day trip on a boat to Ireland and when they got there, they were supposed to go to base of a mountain where there was a cave that they would enter that would lead them to the center of the earth. The cave seemed to go down and down forever where it lead them to the very depths of the earth. When they reached the center of the earth they came across a blue sky and an ocean. They built a raft to go across it and in the middle of crossing they ecountered two prehistoric monsters fighting around them. In the story they also encounter living fire. In the center of the earth any wrong step of wrong turn could lead to most certainly death or being trapped down there forever. To find out more details and what happens in the rest of the book, you will just have to read it for yourself.Like I mentioned before the reading experience of this book was very good. The characters were very well developed, because of the information given about them and also how they were used throughout the story. Professor Hardwigg for example was a great character because he was a very smart man, but also a great adventurer. In the book as soon as the professor figured out what the paper ment he was ready to begin the journey. Harry was another great and well developed character, because of the information that was given in the beginning. Also, who would have thought that a 13 year old boy could have cracked the code before his smart uncle, so he plays a great role in this story.The plot was very well developed and very well laid out. The story went step by step not leaving out anything and everything was very well explained. In the story they talked about having to learn to repel and in the story it told exactly how and why they did this.I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and to people that think that this could actualy happen. Overall I enjoyed reading this book very much and I hope that this review will help anyone interested in reading it or people just reviewing it."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's classic novel Journey to the Center of the Earth is a must read for any science fiction book lovers. I rate this book four stars because this book has great imagery and is very believable considering the fact that this journey never took place.This book deserves four stars because Verne's imagination makes this book an easy read with his use of vivid descriptions of the journey. The journey starts off with a scientist who finds a map to the center of the earth. Himself, his nephew, and a guide journey down an old volcano towards the center of the earth. On their journey they find all kinds of, thought to be extinct, animals and cavemen.Although the three men find many exciting things they also encounter many hardships. The men are suffering from lack of food because they are miles from the surface of the earth, and they lack water because there are no water sources nearby. The men somehow find a river that is boiling hot due to the fact that they are inside a dormant volcano. When they find the underground world they also get food from the wild plants growing around them.In my opinion this book is one of the greatest science fiction books that I have read. Jules Verne is an excellent writer who wrote many great books. This book is about three men who go on an expedition to the center of the earth. The question that you have to ask yourself before you read this is will they make it out alive. Well you will have to find out yourself by reading this great novel."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Read this translation and not the British newspaper serial one. In some of the other Journey editions the names and nationalities of characters are changed and the first chapter reads differently. To check if you have an honest translation, see if the professor is named Lidenbrock (correct) or Hardwigg (fake).The characters on this mission boldly go where no man has gone before. They resemble some of the cast on American space voyage shows of the sixties. The Icelandic guide Hans is like Spock, stoic, unconcerned with ordinary problems and fearless.Prof. Lidenbrock is not really like Kirk, because he is not emotional. He is actually a lot like Spock also. In fact, Hans and Prof. Lidenbrock are both heroic figures.Axel the teenager(?) on the trip is more like Kirk. He feels emotions, often fear or regret. He also never wanted to go on the journey in the first place, and thus has some aspects in common with Dr. Smith of Lost in Space. However, morally Axel is as upright as the others.Verne took great care to place realistic details in his story. The early chapters where Lidenbrock and company visit 19th-century Iceland are not so much science fiction as they are travel literature, and Verne mastered that genre as well."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth is definitely a must read for science fiction aficionados and classic fiction lovers alike. Verne's sense of humor and incredible imagination make for a mostly credible, and quite enjoyable tale of a young man who accompanies his uncle on the journey of a lifetime.For the time in which it was written, it was groundbreaking in citing evolution. Darwin had only published his Origin of the Species 7 years prior to this novel's publication 1867. Verne embraces the theories presented in Origin of the Species, as well as drawing in other discoveries made in scientific circles of the time that support such theories. Verne also takes care to describe and explain many of the other scientific theories and ideas of the age presented in the book in such a way that he ensured Journey to the Center of the Earth will remain a classic for years to come. A wonderful work definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Yes there are different versions, The best one is the original in French. There are more than one translations into english, one with the Main character's name as Harry, the other as Axel.I read the 'Harry' version first, but only partway through as it was terrible! I thought Verne was a bad writter or something. But, when I was older, I found another copy (Puffin Classics btw), and I thought I'd give it another go. That was one of the best books I had ever read, it funny and imaginative. The characters even had character!Well, I looked into it, and compared my new version with the first book I had read and both of them with the original. Mine was pretty close. The names were kept the same, most of the sentences were similar in structure (so that someone like me who can't read french could tell that they were the same book).The 'Harry version' however, invented entire chapters out of thin air, discarded others and changed significant plot points. I hope this helps some of you decide which one to get, and that there is more than one translation.If the book starts with:\\"ON 24 May 1863, a Sunday, my uncle, Professor Lidenbrock, came rushing back towards his little house at No.19 Konigstrasse, one of the oldest streets...\\"You know you have the good version.Otherwise, I love this book and would recomend it to anyone, whether a science fiction fan or not."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This kindle edition is based on the 1871 translation which slightly abridged and altered Verne's original (for example, the Professor is here named Hardwigg, rather than the original's Lidenbrock, and his niece is here named Gretchen rather than Grauben). That's probably the most generally known English translation (it's the one I read obsessively as a child), and it's still a great read, but sticklers for textual accuracy might want to do a little more searching.As to the novel itself, while unquestionably one of Verne's masterpieces in terms of story, it's probably the one that's aged the hardest of all Verne's works, and almost all of the science in this text has been exploded, modified, or simply changed by the intervening hundred and fifty-odd years of scientific development. Because Verne was in part intending this book to be a source of scientific education, the characters spend a lot of time talking about geology, archaeology, etc., to each other, and since most of that's outdated now, modern readers may want to skip over the more scientific chunks of the book and simply read it as an exploration tale.From that perspective, the most interesting thing about this book might be that it's arguably the progenitor of the \\"Lost Prehistoric World\\" genre, and readers who want more in that vein might want to look up later books that focused more squarely on modern-explorers-in-dinosaur-country stories, such as Arthur Conan Doyle'sThe Lost World, or Edgar Rice Burrough's novel _The Land that Time Forgot_ or his _Pellucidar_ series (explicitly set in the hollow interior of the globe)."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is a classic novel by Jules Verne. In the story, Professor Hardwigg and his nephew Harry discover an ancient parchment by an alchemist named Arne Saknussemm. They travel to Iceland and climb an extinct volcano called Sneffels. With them is the Icelandic hunter Hans. They journey into the center of the earth, in which Harry gets lost. They come upon and ocean and cross it. While they are on the sea they witness a battle of ancient sea monsters. Eventually they are thrown out of a volcano on Stromboli, an island in Italy. This was a wonderful book, but sometimes it went into too much detail. Still, a classic five star book. I don't see why anyone would give it 4 1/2 stars. It is simply absurd. I recommened this book to anyone with a good imagination."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book proves Verne's greatness as a writer of fiction. The science in this science fiction flies largely in the face of modern science, yet the read is no less gripping today than it was in its infancy. The story is pretty simple. Professor Lidenbrock, a neurotically impatient scientist, discovers a cryptic manuscript written by a long-dead explorer; with the help of his nephew, he decodes the cryptogram to read an account of a journey to the center of the earth begun beneath a dormant volcano in Iceland. The nephew, Axel, a talented geologist and mineralogist himself, refuses to believe that the core of the earth is not exceedingly hot; additionally, he cares more about Grauben, the eccentric professor's ward, than risking his life on a scientific adventure. He proves unable to dissuade his uncle and thus joins with him on a journey to Iceland. There, they hire a stoic Icelander to lead them down into the earth. Most of the action takes place underground, with the adventurers suffering several trials, daring risks, and finally discovering a whole new world hidden miles below the earth's crust. The ultimate trial and danger they face consists of returning to the surface.Axel narrates the story, and the strength of the novel lies in his character. The professor and the Icelandic guide are unusual personalities, but Axel is very real and easy to relate to. He really does not want to go in the first place, and he is most liable to greet dangers and risks by bemoaning his fate and declaring his party done for in their foolish efforts. It is he who suffers the most privation when the men's water runs out, and it is he who finds himself lost in the utter blackness of the caverns for three days. When things are going well, though, Axel becomes wildly excited about the mission and temporarily forgets about his fears. This all goes to make him a very sympathetic character. Without him, the story would be a rather dispassionate account of an impossible journey by bland, unbelievable characters. You do have to shift your mind into low gear a few times when the characters begin speaking about the different types of minerals and rocks they are encountering, but overall the plot is rather thrilling, and you cannot help but begin early on trying to ascertain a way in which the intrepid explorers can return to share their discoveries with a skeptical scientific community. Verne knows how to tell a story, and you don't have to know a single thing about science to enjoy this novel immensely."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is a wonderful book by Jules Verne but this is just a terrible translation.

Seek out William Butcher's wonderful translation of this great story by Verne."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is an exiting book full of adventure. It is about three people named Hans, Professer Hardwigg and his nephew Harry. The story takes place when Professer Hardwigg discovers a piece of parchment with the name of a famous explorer that went to the center of the Earth. Professer Hardwigg wants to do the same. They climb in to Mt.Sneffles with a guide named Hans. They have lots of adventures with prehistoric animals and travel in places you wouldn't even expect. The ending is very exiting but you will have to read it to find out. I recomend this book to people who like adventure stories. I think it is a great book ."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"THIS NOTE PERTAINS TO THIS AND ALL OTHER EDITIONS OF THIS TITLE. To clarify the isue of \\"two versions\\" and the confusion this creates, any version of this great novel mentioning Professor \\"Hardwigg\\" is a literary fraud, a complete re-write, and not a translation of Verne at all. The would-be Verne-improver changed characters' names and many plot details.The shame is that this old bogus version is still not recognized as such and is still being sold as if it were truly Verne. Sadly, this is the one many of us grew up reading. Any true translation (such as in this Puffin Classic) identifies the professor as \\"Li(e)denbrock\\" (and that is how you can easily distinguish the real vs. the sham). There are old translations that get it right, but in modern times two translations stand out: one by Robert Baldick (this one) and one by William Butcher. They are both good, the difference mainly being a matter of style. Some prefer Butcher; I happen to prefer Baldick. Don't let the fact that Baldick's may appear in a children's imprint deter you from considering it. It appeared first in 1965 as an adult Penguin book, and twenty years later (unchanged) as a Puffin. Butcher's is more recent and, as he is a noted Verne scholar, his credentials certainly carry weight. But that doesn't make him a better wordsmith. We read Verne primarily for fun and for the thrill of adventure. Baldick's translation enables us to do just that. I highly recommend his translation in this Puffin edition to anyone, child or adult. But whichever edition of this wonderful novel you may be considering for purchase, and no matter who translates it, give it the Lidenbrock (READ) vs. Hardwigg (AVOID) test to be certain you are reading the actual story Verne intended."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is some sort of re-write, perhaps for American audiences? It's not nearly as good writing as the original. Get the original for free at [...]. The version I am reading was published in 1906."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Everyone should read some Jules Vernes. A late 19th century French writer, he influenced many people with his enthusiasm for things scientific. In Voyage, the protagonists are a scientist (who discovers a message indicating a journey to the center of the earth is possible), his reluctant nephew, and the quiet-man native guide. An expedition is organized immediately, and the adventure begins. Once you get past the writing style which may be strange to the modern reader, and you suspend your disbelief on certain things (like just how many supplies they were capable of carrying), the tale can captivate. Here is a writer who relishes the scientific advances and discoveries of his age, and is writing about them. The reader can absorb the geologic understandings of the period, as well as the way in which the scientific community operated. It is the age of the gentleman scientist, the ancestor to Indiana Jones. And Verne's delight is infectious. By modern standards it's less exciting than, say, a Jurassic Park. But there's underground seas, strange animals and plants, delirious visions, and hardships of thirst and being lost in the dark to entertain you. Be aware of different translations: our book group had much hilarity discovering the differences in our editions: some seemed edited and condensed compared to the others (and as it's not copyright protected, some of our tattered paperbacks didn't even give the original date or the translator's name), some had wonderful illustrations, some had illustrations that apparently were for a different book, and some had none. Some editions had footnotes, which were interesting in their own way, apparently dating from the original French. There are even different names for the uncle and nephew. Judging from my translation (one of the uncredited ones), it's no great literary effort. But it's entertaining enough to keep one reading, and to amazed at this seminal storyteller and his influences on many who followed him."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I've just recently found out about the different translations of this book.

It extensively concentrated on rock formations, climates, geology, Paleontology, etc. A science fiction should have some science in it, of course, but there was a lot in Journey to the Center of the Earth.Now, this book was written at a time when people didn't have television, internet and color photography was still young I think. Nothing could paint that picture of the mysterious behaviors of the prehistoric animal or the awe of an underground cavern for you. You had to rely on a really good imagination.

I give it a five-star rating."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A novel that takes its reader on a grand adventure from page one is sure to be a good one. Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne is just one example of such a novel. The story grabs you right from the beginning. Narrated by the main character's nephew, we are taken on a journey from beginning to end that is as exhilarating as any ride at Disneyland. Having dreamed of being an adventurer since he was a child, Mr. Verne managed to channel some of that energy into his writing, while at the same time pleasing his father and becoming a lawyer.The story opens with Professor Lidenbrock finding a book written in Icelandic. The book is not as important as what is found inside the book, however. A piece of parchment with a series of letters written in a Runic language is found tucked among the pages, setting off a frenzy for the professor (and by association, his nephew, Axel) to find out what the parchment says. Once Professor Lidenbrock and Axel translate what is written we get into the meat of the story - the journey to the center of the Earth.Their journey begins with Axel and Professor Lidenbrock going to Iceland, where they spend time trying to learn more about the person who wrote the note on the parchment. While there, they also acquire a guide who will go with them on their visit to Snafell and into the center of the Earth. He proves an excellent guide and his efforts are appreciated by the professor and his nephew.Throughout the book, the professor never gives up on getting to the center of the earth. He is bound and determined not to let anything stop him, despite the many protestations of Axel, who is ready to turn back at the first sign of trouble. I wouldn't label Axel a skeptic, but he is definitely more cautious than his uncle and tends to think something is going to go wrong. I know that those things would make the reader immediately label Axel a skeptic, but in the end he does come around to the adventure and is willing to see it through to the end. Throughout the story, the trio is faced with a variety of obstacles but they overcome all of them with grace and come out for the better on the other side.It's hard to review this book without giving anything anyway. However, I will say this (without spoilers): I wish there were a sequel and this is one of the most well-written books I've read in a long time. Mr. Verne certainly did his research (and copious amounts of it) for this novel. He crams a lot into a little space (the book, not including notes, checks in at 288 pages), but the detail is impressive. He also provides 30-plus pages of notes at the end, to explain all the people, places, and objects he refers to throughout the novel.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love a story that grabs me right from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end. I give it five out of five stars and would suggest it to anyone who likes a good adventure story."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"As all other novels by Jules Verne it will keep you glued to it 'til the end."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Axel's eccentric uncle, professor Otto Lidenbrock, finds a parchment in a very old book.

My class made the book look ridiculous because we all know nothing can live in the center of the earth. I was very pleased with how well the book takes off in the beginning.

His basic MO was to come up with some kind of spectacular but as yet (circa late 1800's) unperformed human achievement, whether it be traveling into outer space, going around the world in 80 days, moving 20 thousand leagues under the sea or in this case journeying to the center of the Earth. He then applies the science of his era to figure out how it can be done. Verne enjoyed relaying his own scientific knowledge for instance treating the reader to a scientific explanation as to how Iceland's land mass formed. I was however a little surprised that Verne seemed completely ignorant to the effects of high altitude climbing since obviously this was known about in his time. The story centers around Professor Von Hardwigg and his nephew Harry who discover a long lost manuscript written by Icelandic explorer Arne Saknussemm. In the manuscript Saknussemm claims to have traveled to the center of the Earth, some three hundred years ago, entering through the dormant volcano Mt. Sneffels in Iceland so Von Hardwigg, Harry and their superhuman Icelandic guide Hans attempt to duplicate the journey.The main issue I had with Journey to the Center of the Earth is that Verne can't seem to decide what literary genre he's writing. He seems to be attempting science fiction but the story is so absurd that it feels more like pure fantasy and concludes like a Loony Tunes cartoon. Verne knew that as you descend into the Earth the heat, pressure and lack of breathable air would build to the point where no human can survive but unless he chose to write a book called Journey a Short Distance towards the Center of the Earth he simply had to wave these problems away as if the characters had found a magical path. If Verne had simply gone all out and wrote a fantasy book it would have been better than try to include scientific explanations for all these absurdities.Let me describe just how ridiculous the book gets. About 120 miles under the Earth the adventurers arrive at a vast saltwater sea. Hans inexplicably manages to build a seaworthy craft in a matter of hours from wood he gathers from an underground forest. Here is where it gets really silly. They travel in the raft an unbelievable 300 miles with no mention of lack of food or water. They come to a tiny and fairly useless island and then set off again for another 600 more miles through a violent storm that lasts three days. So violent in fact that their ears literally bleed and yet still no worries of hunger or a collapse of the raft. A globe of ball lightning menaces the group and even manages to be consumed by Hans causing him to spit fire. The ball lightning magnetizes all the metal on the raft including the rafts nails. Where in the world did Hans get these nails from? Did he carry them all the way on the off chance that he may need to build something and where did the sail come from? After surviving this multi day storm the raft crashes on shore leaving them with almost all their supplies and four months of food. FOUR MONTHS!?!?! Since they've been traveling for at least several months that means they started the trip with over a half a year of food along with huge amounts of rope, pickaxes and ladders. Near the end of the book their passage is blocked by a large boulder and they use 50 pounds of gunpowder to blow it up. Among all the staggering amounts of provisions they had 50 pounds of gunpowder just in case. Had Jules Verne ever gone on a hiking trip in his life? 50 pounds is an enormous amount of weight to lug around particularly 120 miles down into the Earth.Compared to the above events the appearance of dinosaurs seems downright pedestrian. There never seemed to be any restriction on the amount of supplies they carried they could only proceed thanks to a magical path that supplied light, low pressure and coolness and the book ended with the group riding up the eruption of a volcano blowing out the top and surviving with nary a scratch. Perhaps my greatest disappointment was that they didn't even get close to the Earths core. They descended about 120 miles before shooting up through the volcanic shaft. The books concept is fantastic and it's been made into a least a half dozen movies but the execution here leaves something to be desired."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This fantastical story will have your mind swimming. It is a great read for the learned."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book starts off strong with the Verne's classic style and wit. The initial pages are entertaining, fast-paced and set the stage for a potentially wonderful novel. However, the story quickly slows down as preparations for the trip take entirely too long. In the version I read, the actual journey doesn't begin until page 90. Then, once the journey begins, it is rather uneventful. Verne also puts in too much geological information for the average reader to appreciate. It becomes quite tedious reading the detailed content of various mineral deposits, composition of the substrata of the earth, etc. While some such material is interesting, Verne innundates the reader. While there were some exciting moments, this novel failed to win me over."},{"Title":"Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A Journy to the Center of the Earth it is a good book.

However, it missed it's mark by the very smallest degree.The novel examines the love and bonds that hold families together despite the pain and circumstances that pull them apart. Laura, in love with her husband Zach since she was 14 years old, meets David while walking her daughter to school. David, dying of terminal cancer, sits under the awning of his apartment complex in New York City every day for his exercise. He is drawn to Laura because she smiles at him each time she passes. He speaks to her and the course is set for an affair. David's wife, who we are led to believe loves him and has had a happy marriage, no longer will make love with him and spends her evenings going to see movies that she's already seen several times. She begins an affair with an aging hippy she meets in a movie theater.Interspersed in this novel is Laura's 85 year old grandmother, Sofie, her young Puerto Rican friend, Aida, and Sofie's new husband, Monroe. Sofie is the most real character. We understand where she's been, the pain of her loneliness and her fear of bonding and losing her sense of self. One never gets a real sense of Laura or Zach, or for that matter David or his wife Barbara. The bittersweet affair between Sofie and David attempts to juxtapose the two lives and families but falls short because we don't really get to know the people as fully as we'd like to.Despite the novel's shortcomings, it is still well worth reading."},{"Title":"Philip L.

Truly informative and fascinating, yet a great \\"coffee table\\" book as well."},{"Title":"Seasons of the Spirit","review":"The world is full of information, and we can find most anything we're looking for, but we need to know what questions to ask. Seasons of the Spirit has answered so many of my questions, and does so in a short, and concise way using only 100 pages of print. The answers to The Flood, the Atlantean experience, Tiahuanaco, and early Greece, while talking about Karma, rebirth, astrology, and body symbolism are all found in easy to understand concepts and language, written by Toronto psychic, Maurice B. Cooke, as channeled by the Master Hilarion.Reading anything, we have to bring in our critical thinking mind, and all the experiences we've had so far in life, in able to feel if the material has the 'ring' of truth. If it makes you smile and say, 'oh, yeah', as if we're remembering, not learning than it's a good bet that you're reading the truth. It's literally as if a light goes on in our head and the answer sits comfortably in our mind as if it were there all along, as opposed to an idea we have to beat into submission because it doesn't 'feel' right.All that said, Hilarion's works may have been 'channeled' which is suspect to begin with, but it has the 'chill' of truth for me. I've read all of Cooke's books over and over again as I gain new knowledge. In the twenty years I've had these books, and my continuing search for truth, I've yet to find anything that has been disproved. So, what's inside this particular book?Karma: \\"The most important fact to underlie in regard to Karma is its automatic nature. No entity, not even God Himself, needs to decide whether or not a particular act 'deserves' to have some Karma attached to it. For it is a natural functioning of the created worlds that every act in time remains ever with the soul or being who performed the act, as if the action were frozen or stuck to that being. If the nature of the adhering past actions is primarily that of pain or torment caused to other creatures, then the load upon one's shoulders is heavy, dark and hindering in terms of soul-advancement. If the adhering Karma arises mainly from beneficial actions motivated by love or kindness, then the 'load' is really not a load at all, but rather a beautiful halo of light and love whose buoyancy in spiritual terms acts like a light-than-air balloon which lifts the soul ever higher toward the source of all light. . . with only minor exceptions, the sole manner of discharging these batteries (neg. Karma) is to take the electrical energy directly through oneself, I.e. to short-circuit the batteries through ones own body. . . . \\"page 3-5 \\"\\"There was another instance in which a large segment of the racial(mankind) Karma was discharged by an advanced entity, but in this case the entity was fully human as the rest of mankind. We speak of the Master from Galilee, Whose death upon the Cross lifted from each and every human soul a portion of the negative Karma which that soul was then carrying. There is thus real truth behind the Biblical concept that Christ 'died for our sins'. . . the Christ Spirit or Divine Logos (who created Earth, in the beginning was the Word or Divine Logos) would be in the body along with the spirit of the man Jesus. Thus, the Christ Spirit itself was also responsible for relieving man of some of his Karmic burden.\\" page 9 That passage is so much more powerful than what we're currently taught. That the creature of our Earth himself came down to suffering in a human body to relieve us of some of our sin.In other words, take on the own pain that you've inflicted on someone else to relieve the burden of Karma and to lighten your soul.Body Symbolism: our finger prints tell us who we are and what we've accomplished soul-wise so far. A round circle of whirls means we've mastered the lessons which that particular finger represents. Intermediate levels are show by different loop patterns, the greater the achievement, the higher the loops reaches up the finger. Wouldn't it be interesting to study the fingerprints of criminals? Geniuses? Saints?This book, like all of the Hilarion books is just amazing. It's like getting a chance to look behind the curtain to see what's really going in the world, both ours and the spirit world.When I Dream"},{"Title":"Prayer that moves mountains","review":"Hello, you may not like what i wants to say but, it is through, this book techings one to pray and prayer is the key to life.So my friend learn to pray."},{"Title":"Jacob Van Ruisdael: Master of Landscape","review":"There is really only one word that describes this historically significant painter AND this extensive volume about his contribution to landscape painting and that word is 'Stunning'. For those who do not readily recognize the name of van Ruisdael, that fact may be due to the media's attention to only certain controversial painters. Jacob van Ruisdael lived from 1628 to 1682 and both in his time and in the years subsequent his mastery of the fine art of landscape painting is considered by many art historians to be without rival.The Dutch painter van Ruisdael not only painted vistas of landscapes in the raw, he also found majesty in villages, cities and rural scenes, seascapes, beaches, and the many rivers and bridges that seduced his sensitive eye: his numerous paintings reveal a wealth of closely observed naturalistic detail. Author Seymour Slive was Professor of Fine Arts and director of the Harvard University art museums and his depth of knowledge of not only van Ruisdael but also of the other Dutch painters of this time gives him a depth of knowledge and grace of writing that makes this truly a book to not only enjoy visually but to read as well.This book coupled with Slive's other volume 'Jacob Van Ruisdael: A Complete Catalogue of His Paintings, Drawings, and Etchings' are the definitive tomes about Dutch landscape painting. Though this book was intended as a catalogue to the traveling exhibition of van Ruisdael's paintings and drawings, it is truly the preeminent text for the libraries of all art lovers. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, October 05"},{"Title":"Jacob Van Ruisdael: Master of Landscape","review":"Jacob Van Ruisdael painted when nature still ruled the world and men crept about in awe of omnipresent forces. How did Van Ruisdael convey such vast depths and the power of earth and trees and rocks and sky within the limits of a two-dimensional canvas?When we consider the limitations of the palette available before the end of the nineteenth century, it is astounding what magic the earlier painters achieved. Earth colors were the basis of all paintings and there were no stable strong greens at all, and only one pure blue derived from lapis, (smalt was a tricky pigment to use and varied much from source to source, many degrading with time). Yet, with this close palette Ruisdael created images full of transient light and worlds within the the deepest shadows; shadows in which we know the pungent life of the earth exists. Inside Jacob Van Ruisdael's paintings there is all Time and its perpetual unrecorded passage.While no reproduction can convey the real eloquence of Ruisdale's work, it is a boon to have an extensive overview of his work accompanied by a text which places his work within the context of his contemporaries and historical period. While the text by Seymour Slive is in most respects good, he observes that Ruisdale did not \\"slavishly\\" imitate nature as many other artists of the period. Slive can have little understanding of what drawing and painting from nature consisted of before the advent of photography and especially, color photography. Any artist in pre-photography days had to contend with ever shifting light and clouds, the restless form and contours of vegetation (watch a flower in sunlight and, in minutes, it will have altered it position and form as it follows the sun) birds and animals come and go, moving water flows, puddles evaporate. And the living scene is three-dimensional; the eye focuses near and far, exercising a constant discriminating selection from a potential chaos. Early painters had to understand and interpret with each stroke of the brush. It is today's painters who slavishly imitate, not nature, but photography, rigidly adhering to a far less resonant, mutable, or worthy master.Many years ago I saw Jacob Van Ruisdael's The Jewish Cemetery in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Art (my first exposure to the artist's work) and for me it has remained as one of the best demonstrations of what is the function and great role of art in divining the mystery of existence."},{"Title":"Business Leadership: A Jossey-Bass Reader","review":"I bought this book as the text for a business leadership class I'm taking in college, and it has proven quite useful in only the first month of class.

Anderson and Hopkins' work is thought-provoking and beautifully executed - very readable - yet causes us to slow down and think and ponder.In \\"Unveiling,\\" I quote from \\"The Feminine Face of God,\\" in a story that a young rabbi told them: \\"'Throughout Jewish history there have been sacred places for men to study, called 'yeshivot' from the words 'to sit.' But we women don't need a place to sit, like dead weights! We need a 'rikudya,' a place to dance the energy of the holiness in ourselves and to bring through our bodies the sacred feminine Torah.'\\"This was one of my starting points. I had transitioned from martial arts (beautiful, but definately a masculine art, as Mars is the \\"god of war\\") into dance (a much more \\"Venusian\\" art form). However, I was just learning that the physical and the spiritual could be connected - and that dance could possibly be part of this connection pathway. \\"The Feminine Face of God\\" helped me to find my personal path.\\"The Feminine Face of God\\" is beautiful, loving, compassionate, wise, and very wonderful.

This theory is substantiated by most theories of gender dynamics (created mostly by men) to form a view that while women are disappointed to recognize they are second class citizens in a world bound by traditional religions, their unique qualities have never been given &quot;equal time&quot; or encouragement to develop to apply to what is thought as traditional male pursuits, usually defined by the hierarchies of dominance in military formats. Altering the dynamics of that reality requires than women give significant thought to their own strengths and vulnerabilities in a &quot;larger&quot; context to define their own place in social,political space and economic space and stop trying to fit into that designed by men, for men. Redefining the interpretation of themselves within traditional religious context may well be a part of that requirement to release their innermost ability and capacity for expression and social impact, an historic recognized need but as yet unrealized by most, and unaddressed. Sharing God within the traditional biblical philosophies will not be easy given historic interpretations of their place in humanity but may well be worth the effort to study and examine. No doubt, finding God for women may well lie in the &quot;greater domain&quot; of integrating their capacity to give birth as well as to maintain it according to an experience that men are incapable of appreciating fully from that larger perspective. Ideal reading for all adults interested in Christian gender integration and power potential."},{"Title":"Feminine Face of God","review":"Just below Patricia's inane babble is the same old feminist insult to all historical women.

First published in 1991, this book is as germaine to women's spirituality today as it was then. Instead of being a book about Christian women only, Anderson and Hopkins have included a cross section of North American women in their study. Women of many different faiths candidly discuss their personal revelations regarding their spiritual growth and their relationships with the divine.Interspersed with the women's stories are the experiences of the two authors as they struggled to research and write this book. This sharing of the authors' experiences makes the book accessible to anyone, reminding us that we are all only human - subject to doubts and questions as easily as we are to revelations and joy. Instead of being a dry, preaching, self-help book, the combined experiences of Anderson and Hopkins and their subjects create a story full of laughter, joy, pain, sorrow and, most importantly, a sense that as women we must explore our own spiritual lives in our own ways in order to live at our fullest potential."},{"Title":"Feminine Face of God","review":"I just finished this book last week while on vacation. It made for easy, fascinating reading due to all the personal stories. No matter where you are in your life journey, you will be able to find a story in this book that speaks to you. The authors did an excellent job of interviewing a cross-section of women at various points in their life journeys. I especially appreciated hearing from women of different faith traditions. The book challenges women to seek a new language and experience to express their spiritual longings. Too often we have settled for the male models, and frankly, they don't work very well for us! It was refreshing to be given permission to pursue the tangents I know I have felt in my own spiritual journey, but have not always given credit to their validity. This book is an excellent gift and is appropriate for women in their mid-20s on. It also should appeal to the woman who has never set foot within a &quot;church&quot; setting, as well as one who has.

We may have different paths and destinations, but our internal struggles are similar. It's tough being the nurturing woman (wife, mother...) while retaining a sense of self. Some women need two lives to be complete; others work very hard to evolve their life with a balance.

By allowing the reader to hear the voices of so many women from various lifestyles, ages, occupations, experiences, religious backgrounds and in varying stages of their journey, this book serves as a guide to the woman who is just starting on the path into her spirituality as well as the woman who is well on her way but may have hit a road block. Because it offers no clear-cut method for discovering the divine, \\"Feminine Face\\" encourages each woman to trust her own spirit and be empowered by finding her own way.This book will continue to be a reference for me and I recommend it for anyone who wants to mature from being a \\"child of God\\" to an \\"adult of God\\"."},{"Title":"Feminine Face of God","review":"The first time I read THE FEMININE FACE OF GOD (a gift from a friend) I browsed around a bit, and saw a reference to the consequences of locking away the fearful experiences of our lives, and the idea that they will come pouring out, like the Furies from Pandora's box - dangerous not because they were freed, but because they had been locked up in the first place.When I read that, I knew that this was a book that could help shine some light in my life.

I particularly liked the reference to the Shekinah, and looked forward to reading more about this aspect of God. After a lifetime (75 years) of hearing and reading so much of the male perspective of God (which I accept as part of the Taoist yin/yang concept) I wanted to learn ways to think of God in my own, feminine terms. After all, do we really want to speak to a Sacred Masculine Essence about PMT and other female issues? Traditionally men have had male metaphors to empower them in their sacred work, but women have not had any feminine metaphors. An early Bishop insisted that women do not even have souls! Women need collective healing from that. Clarissa Estes gets close to the mark when she refers to La Que Sabe, 'The One Who Knows,' as representing the Sacred Feminine Essence. But will there ever be an inclusive title? I expected to read about the early representations of the Mother/Father God and how we could use that in contemporary ways, but this concept is not included.The book concentrates on the second part of the title: The Unfolding of the Sacred in Women. It focuses largely on individual women's struggles to find their spiritual path and says very little on what they discovered about the feminine nature of God. I was disappointed because of this. However I do not think the one star review is at all fair, and certainly not how I consider a feminine voice should be expressed with regards to the sacred. Surely the feminine face of God represents compassion and mutual respect, no matter how opposite our views.If you want to compare other women's stories with your own, the book is greatly encouraging. But if you want to change from addressing God as Father and learn how to approach Her as the Divine Mother without getting into the all-out goddess cultures, then, like me, you will be looking for a different book."},{"Title":"Feminine Face of God","review":"This is a great book---very inspiring, uplifting and affirming. The authors get it right.My only question is: where is the balance? We need feminine and masculine energies to balance us, especially since we contain both qualities.

Burgess's passion was to teach children about nature and was involved in conservation projects throughout his lifetime. He wrote over 170 books and 15,000 stories for children and the creator of the character Peter Rabbit. The book is a collection of 16 short stories, all of which have a different character as the focal point and a general lesson about practicing good values. Grandfather Frog, an old wise character that seems to know everything, tells all but one of the stories. Peter Rabbit is the seeker of stories in each chapter. He is continuously asking Grandfather Frog to tell him things about his neighbors. Why Reddy Fox wears red or Why Jimmy Skunk never hurries for example. After reading Mother West Wind Why Stories, I believe this is a wonderful book to help young children (ages 2-7) understand basic morals and the beauty of nature. There are many lessons in the stories but two stand out the most and are repeated throughout the book. The first one is to be happy with what Mother Nature has given you and take good care of it. The second is to be responsible for solving your own problems. Which I believe is a good way to show children the importance of independence.The story of Why Buster Bear appears to have no tail is a prime example of the lesson to be happy with what Mother Nature has given you. It starts with mentioning that Peter Rabbit is ashamed of his own tail and that he admires others. One day he notices that Buster Bear appears to have no tail. Grandfather frog tells Peter the story of how Mother Nature made him that way. Buster Bear's very far removed Great Grandfather was the king, and believes he should have a fine tail like some of the others, even though he has no need for it. Mother Nature gave him a tail to make him happy, even though his unhappiness was from envy. He soon found out that the other animals were making fun of him behind his back and asks Mother Nature to take it off. She decides to leave a barely noticeable tail on him as a reminder. The lesson is made clear at the end when Peter says \\"Thank you, Grandfather Frog. I think that hereafter I will be quite content with what I've got and never want things it is not meant that I should have.\\" (Thornton 185) I think the simple ending helps young children comprehend the lesson, making it easier for it to stick in their minds. The lesson of taking care of what Mother Nature gives you comes from the story Why Peter Rabbit cannot fold his hands. The story is about Peter Rabbits far removed Great Grandfather being lazy and not keeping himself and his house clean for when Mother Nature came to visit. How he sat with his hands folded and watched his neighbors work their tails off. When Mother Nature's arrival was drawing closer old Mr. Rabbit got all of his nice neighbors to help him with his work and still didn't do anything but fall asleep. Mother Nature was so angry to see him sleeping and his house a mess she woke him up and said \`In every single blessed day there's time for work and time for play. Who folds his arms with work undone doth cheat himself and spoil his fun' \\"Hereafter, Mr. Rabbit, you and your children and your children's children will never again be able to sit with folded arms until you or they have learned to work.\\" (Thornton 25) This story teaches children to take care of their own messes and that you cannot expect others to take care of it for you. A subtle hint of the importance at an early age to keep their rooms clean and put their toys away. Which is not always an easy lesson to teach children.The lesson of solving your own problems is best represented by the story Why Spotty the Turtle carries his house with him. This is another lesson that is a pattern throughout the book. It is made clear that Mother Nature wants the animals to try and solve their problems before they come ask for her help. She wants them to be independent. Old Mr. Turtle did not have a shell at first and was very easy prey as food became harder to find during this certain drought back then. Out of being scared for his safety and life one day he hid under a piece of bark to avoid being seen. He went to shake the bark off his back it would not come off, this paid off in the end when a hungry animal comes along and mistakes him for a piece of bark instead of a tasty meal. He found that the bark made the perfect cover and he could carry it with him. Mother Nature saw that he was cleaver and his willingness to solve his own problems and rewarded him with a permanent shell to carry with him as his home, to protect him whenever he goes. I think the message in this story of responsibility and independence is important to teach young children. That they can always get help along the way but that they should try first because it might surprise them how much they can succeed.This is a wonderful children's book for parents who want to teach their children about not only nature and animals but about basic moral values. To be good to your neighbors and friends, to take care of what you're given in life, to be responsible and independent, and to be humble. I would recommend this book to every parent of young children."},{"Title":"Mother West Wind \\"why\\" stories","review":"This product looks like a cheap rendering of the original work.

On the other hand, it was published by the Smithsonian, so what can you expect. It is suppose to be scientific.It really doesn't have a lot analysis about the actual incident. Instead, The first chapter has lots of analysis about why people want to believe it, and why it persists, etc. I think that it is quite boring. I want to read why they think that it did not happen. I do not need to read the analysis of about this almost religious like phenomena.The second chapter talked about the weather balloon, etc. I think that it is totally irrelevant. I think that the government has explained twice. The first time, it was the weather balloon. The second time, it was something else, which at that time was classified military secret. So if the last time, the government already said that it is not a weather balloon, what is the purpose to tell the readers about the weather balloon experiments at that time.Also this book failed to explain all those rumors about this incident. It tried to discredit all those reports. On the other hand, the other side have listed many credible people's reports. This book did not explain how those people's descriptions can not be ture.At last, it insisted that the government has given the public all the possible documents about this incident. Then how come so many documents that are released to the public have pages after pages of blacked areas. What kind of government secrets that still can't be declassified after almost 50 years?I am neither a believer or non-believer, however, this book did not convince me that Roswell incident did not happen."},{"Title":"Remembering Lives: Conversations With the Dying and the Bereaved (Death, Value and Meaning)","review":"Narrative therapy is an approach which social service professionals in a counseling capacity can use to help their clients discover other aspects of ther own story than that which they perceive as problematic. Lorraine Hedtke's book applies this approach to counseling the bereaved who have lost an important person in their lives, by helping them to realize that the relationship formed with that deceased person does not die with physical death, but remains a formative factor in the bereaved's sense of self and life going forward. She encourages the bereaved to think of their circle of friends and family as a \\"club\\" of which they are all \\"members\\", and to consider the deceased as an ongoing \\"member\\" of the club, albeit in a different way than prior to the death. It's an approach that boosts the importance of relationships, plays down the need to \\"say goodbye\\" to the deceased, along with all of the \\"tasks\\" that have become part of the grief counselor's bag of techniques. It's a helpful read, and narrative therapy can become a valuable tool when used in a balanced way. We are all people of story, and the tenor of the story which dominates our perception of self and others can change how we think and feel.Ann P.

He wrote in a time after the invention of the printing press, but before the invention of newspapers and magazines, so the sort of journalism which we rely on today to tell us more than we want to know about the inner lives of show-business figures did not exist during his lifetime.Anyone who wants to write a full-length biography of this man, one of the greatest writers of our planet, has two choices. She can either make up stuff along the way, as countless Shakespeare biographers have done since the 1600s, or she can stick to the fragmentary facts and fit them into a picture of the social structure and life that Shakespeare lived in. This is what Chute does in her now out-of-print classic, and as readers of this review can see, I think she did a superb job.Chute's book is superb not only because she is a vivid writer, not only because she tells us why certain things were the way they were, but because she respects the people she is writing about. When she tells us why Elizabethan &quot;players&quot; and their property managers liked tawny-orange dye for their costumes, she not only tells us why they liked it (it was a &quot;color-fast&quot; dye which would not fade) but conveys to us some of the combination of freedom and limits which made up Elizabethan society. The men and women of London were people who, on the one hand, could not buy the color-stable, wash-and-wear clothes we wear without a thought today, but on the other hand, if they could find a good dye or could afford to wear a bright color, they could gaudy themselves up in a way which grownups are too shy to do nowadays. As always, something has been lost and something has been gained, and Chute knows this and doesn't write history on the basis of &quot;look at how many mistakes those poor little people made&quot; or &quot;look at all those great heroes of the past.&quot; They are men and women and children who could have learned from us, and we can learn from them. All of them, Shakespeare first among them but not the only one."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"For some reason I have been obtaining and reading biographies of William Shakespeare lately. This book, and the recent biography by Peter Levi, are the ones I have been most satisfied with.The real strength of Professor Chute's book is her insistence on placing Shakespeare accurately as one of the most famous ACTORS of his day. On lists of the companies of players he often appears first or second. Now, as Prof. Chute makes clearer than anyone else, this tells us a lot about the man. Prominent actors not only had to be healthy and athletic, they had to be great fencers... the audience expected to see incredible swordplay, not fakery... wonderful dancers... the performance always ended with the cast doing elaborate ensemble dances as well as individual specialties... and expert instrumentalists or singers... the play began with a concert lasting about half an hour. All this in addition to being able to play well a variety of parts (including several parts in the same performance) on very short notice and with very short preparation.Prof. Chute is sound and grounded about many aspects of Shakespeare's life that lead other biographers to wild surmises. I suspect she is about the only biographer to understand how Shakespeare's marriage worked. No matter how much you have read about Shakespeare, you will find many new insights and perspectives in this book."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"Chute has written a terrific account of a difficult life. Biographies of Shakespeare are difficult in that there is so little known of his life. This is unusual -- and somewhat ironic, given the subject matter -- when one takes into account the Elizabethan's propensity for journaling. But Chute is able to place Shakespeare firmly within his time, making few assumptions, but presenting the known facts of Shakespeare's life in a lively and fascinating manner. She strongly establishes the assumption that Shakespeare was considered one of London's finest actors and also places context around the performance of the plays. What is most fascinating is how Chute gives a glimpse into the contemporary response to Shakespeare's writings. While Shakespeare's \\"competitors\\" -- that is, his contemporary playwrights -- may have appreciated the breadth and scale of his writing, to a certain extent, they looked down upon the popularity of his plays. Just like today, the so-called elite of our society tend to overlook those writings or performances that are appreciated by a mass audience.Where Chute falls down somewhat is that, like so many biographers, she over-apologizes for her subject. In Chute's vivid description, Shakespeare, seemingly, could do no wrong. Time and again, Chute refutes the contemporary criticisms that were made of Shakespeare's writings. Fault can be found in geniuses, as well as hacks.Her book ends perhaps one chapter too late. After Shakespeare was finished professionally, he retired to a quiet life in Stratford. The only extant writing that refers to Shakespeare's final years are lawsuits that appear with his name. While it does give a minimal sense of Shakespeare's activities, it does not make for very interesting reading and, in fact, places an overemphasis on perhaps meaningless records. But this minimal criticism aside, Chute's book overall gives a wonderful sense of a fascinating person living in a fascinating time."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"I thought Shakespeare of London by Marchette Chute was an excellent biography for several reasons. She wrote in a very readable, engaging style which was easy to follow and understand. Prior to reading this book, I had read a lot of information about Shakespeare. Initially, when I started reading this book I was a little put off by the \\"just-the-facts-mam\\" style, but the more I read the more I appreciated the biographer telling the facts she knew without overindulging in assumptions based on these facts, as other more recent biographers have done. I also really appreciated how she fully grounded Shakespeare in his time and place and vocation. As a lit student in college, all I ever heard about was Shakespeare's literary genius as a playwright; the fact that he remained a prominant actor in his company during the entire time he was writing plays was completely glossed over. This book, which never disregards Shakespeare as an actor, was something of a revelation to me. At times I felt her potrayal of Shakespeare as a person may have been a bit naive because she never attributed any remotely bad characteristic to him, but overall, I thought the biography was exceptionally well done. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants solid, unbiased information about the Shakespeare of London."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"Note: date of this review should read \\"15 December 2012\\".It has been suggested (I forget who said it) that Chute should have titled the book, \\"The London of Shakespeare\\". That sums it up. I've read practically every book-length bio (nearly 50) of William Shaksper of Stratford and Chute's is one of the emptiest biographically speaking, though that means (to here credit) she added less than the usual amount of speculation. Frankly, I find it among the most boring of the genre. As a description of London and the theater at the time it may not be bad, but it is certainly not the best book on that subject either."},{"Title":"Shakespeare of London","review":"We English-speakers are so pelted with the name Shakespeare from earliest recollections, and so over-exposed to scenes and lines from his plays, that many of us (including me, who took a course titled Shakespeare in college) become after a time benumbed and uninterested in anything bearing the too, too familiar appellation. Neverthess, I was curious to see what a non-literary bio of the man might reveal, and was pleased to find much in this book of fresh interest about him and his times. You might be surprised, as I was, for example, to learn how common it was in Elizabethan England for the ordinary man to be involved in lawsuits, or that London sported a two-storey shopping mall. But the choisest plum -- by my peculiar lights -- is a subjunctive-mood classic angrily uttered by the Bard's aged partner at the New Globe Theatre, on the occasion of his being disburdened of the day's ticket receipts by thugs in the employ of creditors: \\"If my son come, he will thump you hence!\\""},{"Title":"The lost pathfinder, Zebulon Montgomery Pike (The American exploration and travel series)","review":"Though mostly know to people as the namesake of \\"Pike's Peak\\" he was also a soldier in the US Army for over twenty years (becoming a Brigadier General), dieing at the \\"Battle of York\\" during the 'War of 1812'.During his life he had three great accomplishments:1.

The Great War has not received as much attention as WWII, especially the war at sea, and Fullerton's \\"Nicholas Everard\\" series does much to redress the balance. For my money he is up there with Douglas Reeman and John Winton. His writing is as good as C.S.

Alfred Bierstadt's &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; is included *twice*, while Frederic Edwin Church's depiction of the Falls is much better known and is even mentioned in his bio, but there's no visual. The lack of an index also makes it tricky to match the artists with their work.If you like the Hudson River School style and want just a brief sampling for your reference library, you'll find this volume to be a reasonably-priced option.

As such, his biography of Wolsey concentrates on Wolsey's primary area of expertise: governing. Though a touch idealistic, his relatively short work (one instalment of the 12 English Statesman series) is of use for potential students and general readers aiming to acquire a basic knowledge of his life. Far less detailed than his replacement, A.F Pollard, whose work is probably of more value for historians intending to thoroughly research particular aspects of the period, Creighton provides a thorougly accessible presentation of the man. His work provides a surprisingly similar interpretation to the fundamental revisionism provided by Gwyn in his much larger work. This is a thoroughly Victorian book from a leading Victorian bishop-historian, but deserves to be consulted."},{"Title":"Stephanie Hoppen's Decorating with Style: Elegant Details and Creative Solutions for Transforming Your Home","review":"The book had beautiful photography, but it was low on actual ideas or suggestions.

They show dogs of all ages in various positions. The orientation on some pages is upright, on others, it's sideways, so you turn the book to look at the picture straight on. It's a wonderful book to use to break the ice, or just to keep the conversation going. The use of black-and white photos was genius - I found myself relating to the dogs as personalities. Color photos tend to make me think of the background more than the dogs."},{"Title":"Woof","review":"Some of the photos are good but they put the majority of them on 2 pages which is difficult to look at."},{"Title":"Woof","review":"First of all the sender was wonderful with the time it took to get the book.

Perhaps that's because, when taken in the context of his 50+ plays, the 21 stories here feel awfully slight. This is especially the case with the 13 or so microstories of one to five pages each, which are more impressionistic outbursts than anything else. But even the more traditional stories, such as the titular one, or \\"Support Your Local Police,\\" feel rather faded and of their time (ie. the mid to late 1960s), when they appeared in small reviews such as Black Diamond, Black World, Citadel, Dust, Illuminations, Liberator, Manhattan Review, Nexus, and Wild Dog. Easily the most engaging piece in the book is the 45-page \\"Dandy, or Astride the Funky Finger of Lust,\\" which follows the fish-out-of-water sexual shenanigans a Philadelphia teenager sent to a farm on Maryland's Eastern Shore for the summer. However, in the end, you have to be pretty interested in black studies or countercultural fiction of the '60s to get much out of this reprint."},{"Title":"Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays: Fundamentals and Applications","review":"\\"Fundamentals\\" is right in the title.

It provides a step-by-step introduction into device physics, technology, and manufacturing of active matrix liquid crystal displays - in an easy and reader-friendly manner. The author explains the basic device physics of LCDs, gives a historical perspective, provides typical geometrical and physical parameters values - so that the reader can get a \\"feel\\" of the problem (the order of magnitude of the parameters and quantities involved, why things are done in this or that way - both from scientific/physics perspective, and from the manufacturing and technological constraints viewpoint). There is a very good balance between rigorous scientific material, and empirical knowledge in this book. As a novice in LCD area (but having a strong device physics background) I had many specific questions on the structure, operation principle,and issues in LCDs - with most of these questions answered in the book. I can only wish that all the books on semiconductor device physics and technology would be that well written.Congratulations, Dr. den Boer!"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Building a Bamboo Fly-rod","review":"First of all, I'm not a carpenter and I've never used carpenter tools before.

The chapters are well structured in a logical order, and provides guidance to purchase the right tools, or to improvise your own when possible.

The Road to Many a Wonder has been called \\"one of the funniest books in English,\\" and \\"an irresistible comic romance,\\" but these accolades don't do the book justice. The story of 20-year-old Ike Bender's trek to the Denver area during the 1859 Pike's Peak Gold Rush is more a story of the triumph of optimism and faith over overwhelming odds. It's only incidental that the author uses witty, appealingly humorous Western-style backwoods-sounding dialogue and verbal sketches to paint an accurate picture of Ike, his 16-year-old bride Millie, their adopted mule Mr. Blue and the characters they meet up with on their journey.Through 500 miles of wild and perilous country, past fierce Indians and belligerent villains, Ike and Millie never stray from their upbeat, joyous goal: to be together, happy and prosperous-with gold or without it. With every step, the two young travelers face down the weary and spent faithless who are struggling to retreat.Ike sums it up best as he describes his confrontation with an unfortunate fellow on the trail: \\"I didn't have no cause to fight and no time to spare for it, so I just left him behind, wasting his breath and not enjoying hisself or his surroundings, probably not even seeing the way the sun come wavering off and on across the sand and getting hisself all worked up worrying about somebody else getting the best of him. I vowed then and there I wasn't going to do nothing like that, but do my work and take my turn and prepare for the worst and hope for the best and manage with what come along.\\"This is a message young adults today should hear and ponder. In today's tough world where money means everything and the race is on for who can sprint up the ladder fastest and farthest, students need to be reminded that the joy is in the living, not in the getting.David Wagoner's heart-warming, upbeat tale of strong faith and love in the face of despair is a top-notch teaching tool. The key to reaching kids today is to make them think they discovered a fabulous new road to take on their own. An invisible push from you and David Wagoner will surely help."},{"Title":"The Road to Many a Wonder","review":"In his seventh novel, David Wagoner strikes gold in more ways than one.

I have read it so many times I can recite parts of it. I often choose passages from it for reading aloud to groups. Sure, it's hilarious and has the most endearing young couple you'll find in literature, but it's the first-person, late-Victorian vernacular that makes it stand out from even the best coming-of-age books. When it was first published, many reviewers compared it to Huckleberry Finn, but I find it much more entertaining than that. Mark Twain would have pounded Wagoner on the back and rolled on the floor laughing over it. After search engines made it possible to locate people, I found David Wagoner. It took me a year of staring at his email address to summon the nerve to tell him how much this book and another of his novels, Tracker, meant to me. He wrote a gracious reply thanking me but adding that he is primarily a poet and doesn't even recall why he wrote those two novels so long ago. That astounded me. He went on to say that, coincidentally, Roy Blount, Jr. had recently expressed the same things that I admired about those two books. When life is not going well, or if you just need a lift, join Ike and Millie and the donkey Mr. Blue for a great adventure.

The rest of the book separates naturally into two parts. The first part deals with the calculus of functions of several variables, and the second part deals with linear algebra. These are essentially independent, and the short Chapter XIII can be omitted entirely, without prejudice to the understanding of the rest of the book. However, it affords a beautiful crossing point of the algebra and analysis.\\"Thus, after covering Chapter I, there are two possibilities for the order in which one can read the rest of the book. One may cover immediately Chapters II through VIII, which essentially do for functions of several variables what the First Course did for functions of one variable. Or, one can cover Chapters IX, X, XI, XII, XIV, XV to get an introductory course in linear algebra.[...]\\"The chapter on complex numbers can be read immediately after Chapter I, and one could discuss vectors with complex coordinates. The last three chapters (applications to functions of several variables, determinants, and complex numbers) are logically independent, and the order in which they are treated permits some variation of emphasis for the course.[...]\\"I have made great effort to make the style of presentation as naive and unpretentious as possible, deliberately avoiding introducing more vocabulary than is necessary to understand the concepts with which we deal. In linear algebra, certain abstractions are both unavoidable and desirable. I hope the reader will find neither too much nor too little.\\"Serge LangNew York, 1964\\"CONTENTSChapter I : Vectors1.

Sub-titled, \\"Turn And Learn\\" Grosset and Dunlap, 2000.Each page has a number wheel that turns. If you line up the correct number in the slot, something special appears. For example on the very first page, devoted to the number one, if you turn the wheel so that \\"1\\" appears, a bight golden angel is placed on top of the Christmas tree. The numbers run from 1 to 10. On the page for the number eight, as you turn the wheel to \\"8\\", cute brown reindeer come into view.All eight reindeer. Pulling Santa's sleigh! Then, I would ask my grandchildren to name the reindeer: \\"Dasher and Dancer\\" and so on.So, this book is a multi-faceted clever learning opportunity, as the children see both the written number and the letters which name the number. If you line up the wheel correctly on a page, the wheel is not aligned correctly on the back page. Thus, page 1 shows you the angel on the top of the tree, but its flip side, page two, is not aligned to place the orange carrot noses on the two (2) snowmen.

The former two have looked to \\"Les Fleurs du Mal\\" as a model and a source of inspiration -- the poetry is extraordinarily good, in places even profound, and overall highly musical -- while the latter, well, that's where the phrase \\"cottage industry\\" comes in. This collection, while it contains some interesting pieces, mostly shows how easy it is to get mired in navel gazing and useless speculation and go over the deep end.It may not be a logical fallacy to try to figure out the message by looking inside the head of the messenger, but it's close enough to make one wish people would stay away from this approach. Psychobabble is what we get from Miner's article -- but then, Sartre's book on Baudelaire started it all and I wish he hadn't. Baudelaire was a genius of the first caliber; he was born that way; putting him on the couch will only tell you something about ... the shrink and the couch.Franke (and others writing about symbols) could have used an elementary course in logic so he would not write stuff like \\"symbolization begins when one thing is used to stand for something else\\" and later, self-contradictorily, that \\"Baudelaire identifies everything with everything else.\\" Of course, Baudelaire does no such thing and it's language that (in a way that is technically quite complicated and addressed in model theory) can be said first and foremost to be a symbol -- which itself is ambiguous between symbol-type and symbol-token (look it up).Brix insists that Baudelaire is not a Platonist but presents evidence in rather selective fashion, leaving out many, many passages that suggest the contrary. Nor is it clear that he (Brix) has a clear understanding of Platonism in the philosophically correct sense of the term as opposed to the usual vague descriptions. This is too bad because the assumption of Platonism shows what a deep book \\"Les Fleurs du Mal\\" really is. This should come as good news, because connecting anything to a large philosophical theory is bound to shed light on what's going on.You know you're down in the weeds where experts are just whispering to each other when an article comments on the views of a major critic who spilled a lot of (in this case Marxist) ink on Baudelaire. That's what you get in Newmark's piece on the (long dead) German critic Walter Benjamin. Have a look if you don't believe me.I'm a big fan of the Australian scholar Rosemary Lloyd and her wonderful book on Baudelaire; her article is the best of the bunch by far in this collection. She writes clearly (no blue prose), her translations are excellent, and makes many insightful points, jus as she did in her book.So, get this book if you're working on a Ph.D. in comparative literature or Baudelaire or something like that.

Although not very suitable for a complete course on dialectology, it is nice to grasp the general idea of English variations on the British Isles. The CD is a must. The set will be valuable for students of English as a foreign language to prevent the shock of facing authentic casual speech, which may seem unintelligible to unprepared non-native speakers. Although it is not rich in theoretical issues, the book presents good material organization and easy to read text. The material presented in non-technical manner, lacks nuances, and mainly focuses on sound distinctions, mentioning intonation, stylistic appropriateness, cultural and historical grounds aside. On the other hand, it is one of the best introductory books for enthusiasts and non-linguists to get acquainted with language variations on the British Isles."},{"Title":"Bargains to Bucks: A Simple Guide for Stay-at-Home Moms & Dads, Part-time Workers, Bored Retirees or Anyone with a Desire to Make Some Extra Money, Just by Shopping!","review":"She has a lot of good ideas but I was very disappointed in the size of the book for the price.

Tom welcomes visitors to come walk the wall anytime. They do have ocassional ceremonies but I do not know when they are or if visitors are allowed while they are going on.

In fact, they are so well written, his stories remind me of 3-D. When 3-D movies first came out people in the theaters screamed and ducked for cover as the characters on the big screen seemed to leap right out into the audience. They were that real. Well, that's the best way I can describe Wallace Stegner's writing. It's as real as it gets considering it's just words on a piece of paper. But those beautiful words leap right off the page.There are thirty-one stories in this book of which the author says came from his life. However, it's not an autobiography. He says he can't be trusted to write his biography. To quote, \\"I can't control my impulse to rearrange, suppress, add, heighten, invent, and improve.\\" The result of all that creativity is some of the finest writing you'll ever come across. And that's not just my opinion. It's the opinion of those nice folks who gave him the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.Of course, I always have to give a plug for Penguin Classic books. Love their style.This book is what Literature is all about. I give it five stars."},{"Title":"The Collected Stories of Wallace Stegner","review":"There are 31 stories in this collection, written over a period of about 50 years. Naturally, the subject matter and quality varies. Stegner himself chose the stories for inclusion, as well as their arrangement in the collection. He clearly knew his best writing, because the better stories are in the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the book.In the Foreword, Stegner says about the stories:\\"I lived them, either as a participant or spectator or auditor, before I made fictions of them...and because the world and I were changing at an ever accelerating rate, some stories reflect events, social attitudes, and even diction that now seem dated.\\"This is what makes the collection worth reading. It covers so many time periods and lifestyles that are forever gone, preserved in literary amber by one who actually lived through those bygone eras.The stories cover a variety of historical topics: the 1918 influenza epidemic, WWII wives waiting for letters from their soldier husbands, ranching life on the plains of Saskatchewan, and Prohibition days in Salt Lake City. All from someone who was there.I think the most perfect story in the collection is \\"Double Corner.\\" It showcases Stegner's talent for creating a powerful sense of place, as well as his ability to express the beautiful and heartbreaking impulses that make us human. If you read no other stories in this book, at least read this one.\\"Double Corner\\" is about a little family of California fruit growers who try to take on the task of caring for the husband's mother rather than placing her in an old folks' home. But the mother has dementia, and all their love and good intentions may not be enough to keep her safe and keep themselves from falling apart. Stegner lets us see how difficult it is for everyone when a loved one is losing mental faculties, and how frightening life becomes for the one with dementia."},{"Title":"The Collected Stories of Wallace Stegner","review":"Simply put, one of my favorite books. A true master of the word and especially the short story. His style is so compelling and easy to read, and his depiction of the country and its inhabitants is haunting.

Thus the results are skewed. In business or science this would make the book untouchable by any serious reader. Indeed, it a perfect world it could cost the writer her chairs on various academic boards.This Amazon.com reviewer was a teacher in the Columbus, Ohio intercity school system. Now, America's intercity schools are some of the poorer schools in Western civilization. However, because of the vast pro-girl and pro-women infrastructure these schools at least gave women of color a fighting chance of getting a good education and going to college. The fact of life is African-American males do considerably poorer in academics than African-American women. African-American women do a better job of sticking together as a cohesive group than a similar group of males. These girls and future women can band together to meet future challenges. Think of it. Because of feminist writers, like Carol Gilligan, the number of women attending college is now over sixty percent at many colleges. However, you don't see Ms. Gilligan write about the vastly successful pro-girl education system in America. Why? She makes money saying things for girls are bad.Historically, I must give Author Carol Gilligan her due. Her writings are treated as gospel by the academic and media communities.

Madselin is a young bride married to an elderly English lord, whom she views with contempt always having loved another man who she could not have. Suddently her dull, yet safe world is turned upside down by the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Most of them men and boys are dead. The majority of the population is killed or enslaved or in temporary hiding. Madeslin is given an opportunity for survival and to, perhaps, aid in the survival of some of her countrymen. She weds Rolf, the man who has been granted her dead husband's former holdings. This is where her adventure truly begins. She has led a life of ease and now must become vividly aware of the suffering of others, recognize some goodness within her \\"enemies\\", come to grips with the past, and move ahead to the future.The author does a good job dealing with the changes to social structure and seems to understand rural life of the time. She de-romanticises the notion of lords and ladies, knights and their steeds by telling of the finanical burden they bring with them. She also tells a good tale about the idea of political marriage or marriage of convenience without illusions of a reluctant bride being swept away into a life of dazzling romance. This is NOT a thrilling accounto of the Battle of Hastings. For that try \\"Housecarl\\" by Laurence J. Brown. This is NOT an exciting tale of English resistance. For that try \\"Cold Heart, Cruel Hand\\" by Brown again. This IS a nice story about dealing with what cannot be changed in the past, and the present and learning to help shape your own future."},{"Title":"madselin","review":"This review is written from the perspective of a romance reader (and an occasional dabbler into historical fiction of an earlier or later period). MADSELIN is a short but detail-packed book about a rather spoiled young woman who finds herself widowed, homeless and of no account when the Normans come to take possession of her rather isolated part of England. She grows from a sheltered and rather spoiled young woman into a woman who cares for her new husband's serfs and attempts to rescue a childhood friend and lover.Madselin is not perfect. She remains inactive at many crucial moments, failing to warn her new husband of problems that are developing in the estate (although she does act from time to time). Here is no super-heroine on the model so often seen in medieval romances, with modern attitudes. Madselin's thoughts and concerns are are mostly about herself, and not those who have been killed nor those who remain. But she is not an unkind woman, just one who is slow to mature.Part of her problem is that she is distrusted both by her husband's followers (as a Saxon) and by her first husband's people (as someone who has married a Norman willingly). This theme of falling between two worlds is rather interesting. How much does one adjust, and in what ways does Madselin gain and yet lose?The real interest in this story lies not in the romance between Madselin and her second husband (of which there is precious little, although there is growing trust and support on his part), but in the details of how the Saxons take or do not take to Norman conquest. Through the changes on this rather impoverished estate, we also see some of the problems faced by the more humane Norman lords who are not only imposing a foreign rule but also moving from the freer Anglo-Saxon society to rigid feudalism. Rolf is torn between the requirements of the King (that he build a castle) and the fact that all the estate resources are being poured into this same castle with all the problems that this entails for the future.Unfortunately, not all the characters are fleshed out in detail. We learn very little about Madselin's family (apart from her royally descended mother and her late elder sister) and we do not learn how she fitted into Saxon society. We learn even less about Rolf, except that he had a brutish father and he was not a knight. Rolf is however the King's Armourer and as such, has special privileges. Some of the secondary characters - the fearful and aged priest Alfled, the sullen waiting woman Hild, and a few of the peasants (now serfs) - are well fleshed-out. The others are less so - including Britt Four Ox, whose fortunes decline steadily through the novel.All in all, this is a well-written look at England in the time of the Conquest, and how one small isolated estate adjusts to the Normans. The first half was much stronger than the second half, but the plot held together reasonably well and there was sufficient depth in characterization to make the story readable if not memorable.Graded = B- (3.8)Breakdown = historical element graded at 4.5 (A-, 20%); romance element graded at 2.6 (D; 20%), writing at 4.0 (B+; 20%), characterization (of protagonists and secondary characters) at 3.5 (B-; 20%), plot development at 4.2 (B+; 20%).[Written September 30, 2002]"},{"Title":"madselin","review":"This is the dilemma facing Madselin. Luckily for her, she is a survivor, not a sentimentalist. She is left a widow during the Norman conquest which means she has lost everything. The Normans have taken her husband's manor home and all she ever possessed. Her mother was also killed defending her home. Madselin now has nowhere to go. She stays a few days at a convent and soon comes to the conclusion that the religious life is not for her. She decides to get to know her enemy a little bit better, approaches her old manor home accompanied by her maid-servant and asks the new lord of the manor for the body of her deceased husband. The Norman lord realizes that due to the difference in languages between the two peoples and the complete change of local government, a go-between would be useful. Since he is a single man and Madselin in a comely widow, a marriage between them would seem to be a reasonable move to make. Thus the story begins.I recommend this book because it sets the tone of life during the conquest, comparing the old Anglo-Saxon customs to the new Norman way of life which introduces feudalism to England. I enjoyed reading about how day to day life was conducted in the 11th century and how a castle is built. I also enjoyed the human interest stories which show not all the Saxons were good and all the Normans were bad. Life is never that simple. Good and bad exist everywhere and often times depends on your point of view. This was well expressed in the story.If stories of this type appeal to you, I would recommend Dorothy Clark Wilson's &quot;Lincoln's Mothers&quot; (about Abraham Lincoln's mother and step-mother), &quot;Queen Dolley&quot; (about Dolly Madison)and &quot;Lady Washington&quot; (about Martha Washington). Life on the frontier, life as a Quaker and how a plantation functions are all explained well in these stories.I enjoy real historical fiction and Madselin is precisely that. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"madselin","review":"Norah Lofts was a wonderful storyteller. She made a good story out of the most unlikely subjects. Madselin is a minor story but well worth reading. It begins with Madselin in an impossibly difficult situation. The time is two days after the Norman Conquest of England has reached her backwoods area. Her husband has just been killed and she is hiding in a convent. At this point, she doesn't have a future and certainly no possibility of happiness. She'll be lucky to stay alive. The novel is how this rather spoiled and sheltered 17 year old girl creates a good future for herself and those around her. Norah Lofts takes many of the conventions of the average romance novel and then turns them around by looking deeply at her characters. Madselin is forced to marry a conquering Norman noble, only he's not a noble but a decent rather bewildered young man not quite sure how to be a conqueror. The growth of their relationship forms the meat of the novel. There's an underlying grim realism that keeps the story based in reality. This is a world of poverty and brutality. Madselin had disliked her elderly husband. In a nice touch, she only came to love and admire him the day he went out to fight the Normans and is killed. She, all along had been in love with a young warrior whom she suspects is now a mistreated prisoner. She has to work out how to help him and how that will affect her marriage. While this is not a great book, it's well-worth reading and it sheds light on a very obscure period of history in an interesting way."},{"Title":"madselin","review":"I have read thos book over and over.

I found it entertaining and it held my interest though it was quite different from the other medieval romances I have read (see my Best Medieval Romances list). On the positive side, her attention to historic detail is quite amazing (architecture, food, dress, customs, etc.), and well integrated into the story. Her dialog is snappy and will keep you turning pages. On the negative side, we have primarily Madselin's perspective and that is often disjointed with her past memories intruding rather rudely into current happenings. Then, too, the hero, Rolf, is a remote figure who is too often not in the scene at all. For the time in which she wrote (her novels were written between 1940-1981, Madselin in 1969), her love scenes might be the norm but they are woefully lacking by today's standard (definitely G rated).The story is a good one. Although no year is given, presumably it occurs after the Conquest in late 1067 or 1068. Madselin is the youngest daughter of a widow who is rather mean to her daughter, but then Madeselin, a pretty girl, is head strong and given to self interests. At 16 she gives her heart to Stigand, a handsome rogue who saves her from a wolf. He seems to love her back though we don't get much of that story. Breaking her heart but not her will to survive, her mother weds her sister to Stigand and gives Madselin to an old, but nice lord of the manor for whom Madselin has only disdain and who is killed when the Normans come. William, now King of England, gives Madselin's home, Bradwald, the chief of three manors, to his armorer Rolf who is suffering from poor eyesight and wounds from the battle. We are never told if he is handsome though he is tall and well muscled. When Madselin comes to claim her husband's body, Rolf sees her value in that she speaks both English and French and she has great courage. He suggests rather casually she can remain at the manor as his wife, and with few options, she consents. So begins a difficult life for her as her people now see her as \\"one of them.\\" I have to say that this story did portray, probably rather accurately, how dismal life was for the conquered Saxons and with a poor Norman lord, their miserable lives. Only at the end do we see the lessons Madselin has learned that give her hope for the future. I liked the ending.By today's standards this is likely a 3 and 1/2 star novel. By the old standards, it may have been 5 star. I'm giving it 4 stars as a compromise. I can recommend it for lovers of the Norman conquest period in England's history but don't expect it to be like others you may have enjoyed."},{"Title":"Plow a New Furrow: The Story of Peter and Freda Hedman","review":"The book was for my husband because it is about his family, the Fields.

Great story line and as always the author doesn't let you down; there is plenty of suspence along with twists and turns."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"When the Reverend Thomas Marshall is busted for philandering with more than one of his buxom parishoners, he's dispatched by his bishop to a desert sanitorium for forty days of reflection, recuperation and golf. His carer, Ms Prynne, suggests he write as a form of therapy and this novel consists of Marshall's morning writing exercises and four sermons which he writes on Sundays. He recounts his recent past, the infidelities which led him here, reflecting on the joys of the flesh and the agonies of the spirit. In so doing, he also embarks on a cunning seduction of Ms Prynne... This is a wonderfully clever comic novel. It's rich with layers of symbolism and Biblical references - the Omega-shaped sanitorium, the forty days and nights in the desert - and bubbles along with puns, comic typographical errors, plus arch footnotes and endless wisecracks. It's beautifully plotted, impeccably structured, and like most of Updike's work, it's laugh-out-loud funny but utterly serious in its intent. It's an exploration of the nature and challenges of religious faith in contemporary America. The \\"sermons\\" are spectacular examples of the way we can reason the Bible into meaning anything - we can even turn adultery into the purpose of marriage and the key to fulfilling one's human destiny. Updike's control of language is astonishing - some reviewers find it confounding but they lack the patience to read this book slowly, to savour it like a seduction, to enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed. When you look back, you realize how meticulously crafted it's all been, and you're dazzled not only by that craftsmanship but also by how lightly it wears the weight. Updike's touch is deft, subtle and most of all incredibly funny."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"I found this book absolutely amazing. Though the Rev. Tom Marshfield is utterly despisable, he is also completely endearing. The prose is masterfully written. I only found it difficult during the first 3 pages. Updikes knowledge of theology impressed me, as well as his indepth treatment of the subject. Updikes juxtapositioning of sex (seen usually as profane) and theology gives this novel its unique edge. Highly recommended reading for anyone who has dared to ask the hard questions of religion and to search them out, and has suffered morally and spiritually as a result."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"For those of you who have come to admire Updike's work, especially from the Rabbit Series, this novel will come as a disappointment. The story of Reverend Tom Marshfield whose sexual escapades with his parishioners causes many problems and eventully lands him in a place to be rehabilitated so that he can return to his church revitalized and purged of his wanton desires leaves much to be desired.I had many problems getting into the novel - Updike seems to preoccupied with trying to establish Tom as a very astute and observant character with many insights into religion and life. Like with many novels that try to create unique and interesting perspectives, I found the text a little dull with nothing to entertain. If I wanted a diatribe on different subjects, I would buy a collection of essays. I found that Updike fails to have us really care or empathize with Tom's perspective (something Coetzee does marvelously in a similar novel Elizabeth Costello) so any rant he goes on comes off as unwanted. The middle of the text is where things pick up, when we finally find out what series of events leads to Tom being in the position he is in. For awhile, I couldn't put the book down as I raced through scenes of Tom coming to grips with his desires and needs, only to find the end of the novel return to the plodding pace that made the beginning so dull.Stylistically , Updike is a writing master, as his prose is clear and succinct. It's a pleasure to read the way he constructs sentences. It's a shame that it's wasted on this somewhat problematic story."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"I have decided that I just don't like the works of John Updike. Though he's a whiz with language and knows a lot about theology and philosophy, his ideas about masculinity, sex, love and need are abhorrent to me. He places women in a role where their only option is to 'ascend' to man's carnal desire, to become victims of the human plight which we are all heir to.This story is set in a parish and deals with a minister who becomes defrocked because of promiscuous behavior with his parishioners. Updike appears to idolize adultery and the need for sexual exploration/exploitation at the expense of sensitivity growth and responsibility."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"Updike is not usually this difficult to read. In terms of its prose, this is one of his more spectacular, elusive and confusing books. A lot of the time, this book reminded me more of Anthony Burgess than John Updike. What is distinctively Updikian about it is its engagement with certain problems in the Christian faith. Among the questions the book seems to ask are: Is God detectable or undetectable in the fabric of our lives? Why does God apparently allow suffering (that old chestnut)? Above all: what exactly is the relationship between Christianity and sexuality? Is sex sacred or prophane? The book answers and fails to answer all these questions and more in its complex, uncertain unravelling. I myself did not really feel adequate to its challenge and I did find the language pitched too high for me. But it's a fascinating book all the same."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"As with all, or most, Updike books, overwritten ad nauseum. Updike, for all his critical acclaim, always seems to be writng to impress someone. The reader? Unfortunately not. Most likely, Updike himselfIt is obvious from reading Updike that his life was consumed by two things-sex and golf--and he overwrites both.This book is about a 41-year old oversexed preacher who is questioning his faith and is ultimately defrocked after numerous relationships with women of the church. And as you might imagine, golf is part of his therapy.Even though the book is overwritten, there are some great lines, as Updike always seems to produce, and these make the book worth reading. A few examples:--\\"We can't be saints all the time. The Lord would get bored...\\"--When does an empire begin to die? When its privileged citizens begin to disdain war...\\"--\\"I missed three consecutive putts of less than three feet, indicating either emergent astigmatism or a severe character defect...\\"If it's Updike and a minister-in-crisis you want, read the book. You may like it.But if its sex you want, try Brewster Milton Robertson's \\"A Posteruing of Fools.\\" The sex is better and the golf is, too!!!"},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"This is a fabulous book. It marries esoteric philosophy and ultimate, base humanity better than any book I've ever read. This combination gives it the ammunition to truly shoot to the core of a reader. And I found it quite easy to read."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"John Updike pours words out like poetry as he portrays the life of a pastor who found love outside of wedlock. In its time, I think this book would be viewed as vulgar and even heretical, but now, it's a fun adventure full of hilarity and wit... just be sure to have a dictionary next to you--his sesquipedalism is quite hard to follow at times."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"As usual, John Updike does not disappoint. This book will slowly draw you in and at times you wonder if you are disgusted with the protagonist or do you feel sorry for him (much like Humbert in Lolita). Then there are times that you feel you are being gas-lighted and seduced. The book touches deeply on human nature and the addiction to the sexual drive. I would recommend it as an easy read, especially for John Updike aficionados."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"\\"A Month of Sundays\\" gives a first-glance impression of being a tossed-off trifle, as if a bit of Updike's light verse had grown fat and sassy, full-bellied, and was given room to stretch like a self-satisfied cat on a windowsill. After reaching the pinnacle of bookish prestige (which included a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959 and a National Book Award for \\"The Centaur\\"), Updike opted to indulge his less sober-minded self with this arch and witty first-person narrative from the perspective of a man who shares Humbert-Humbert's literary, if not sexual, tendencies. Indeed, \\"A Month of Sundays\\" nods to Nabokov in its delight in puns, wordplay, mental calisthenics, and self-confessional musings, while still featuring the dominant themes and characteristics of Updike's prose.The author's mouthpiece is one Revered Tom Marshfield, the minister of a New England parish who exhibits an Updikean capacity for close observation, philosophical speculation, psychological penetration, and penetration of another kind all together. We find him on the first page settling down with a sheaf of blank sheets of paper--a month's worth. \\"Sullying them is to be my sole therapy,\\" Marshfield writes, already indicating the thematic and aesthetic direction the novel will take with the sole/soul pun, not to mention the verb \\"to sully,\\" foreshadowing Marshfield's association of writing with sex and seduction.Here's the format, then, neatly laid out: thirty-one chapters, one for each day of a month, with each chapter comprising a morning's worth of Tom Marshfield's musings on the subjects of life, death, sex, God, husbands and wives, adultery, Karl Barth, fathers and sons, faith, skepticism, Christianity, and how a man may be defined by his golf swing. Yes, we are in Updike territory.The right Rev. Marshield spirals inwards towards the center of his marshy confusion, arriving at the edge of self-understanding but never quite there. In a Graham Greene-like formulation, Updike equates faith to being hunted by God, \\"a feeling of being closely, urgently cherished by a Predator, whose success will have something rapturous about it, even for me.\\"\\"A Month of Sundays\\" is a heavy meal served in dainty dishes on fine China. The prose sparkles, even if the Nabokovian wordplay is occasionally strained. Updike sounds every note in his repertoire, and the result is a Bach-like sonata--breezy, unassuming, consummately professional, but also witty, intellectual, and profound in passages. And for the discerning reader, \\"A Month of Sundays\\" serves as a kind of Rosetta Stone for Updike's fiction, an index pointing to all his chief concerns, themes, and character types.Here are a few nuggets of the Wit and Wisdom of John Updike on display:On parenthood: \\"Society in its conventional wisdom sets a term to childhood; of parenthood there is no riddance. Though the child be a sleek Senator of seventy, and the parent a twisted husk mounted in a wheelchair, the wreck must still grapple with the ponderous scepter of parenthood.\\"On American religiosity: \\"From the first Thanksgiving, ours is the piety of the full belly; we pray with our stomachs, while our hands do mischief, and our heads indict the universe.\\"On Love: \\"Let us think of it as the spiritual twin of gravity--no crude force, \\"exerted\\" by the planets in their orbits, but somehow simply, Einsteinly there, a mathematical property of space itself. Some people and places just make us feel heavier than others, is all.\\""},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"updike's dark novel of a priest's innermost revelations through his life's journey. not an upbeat read by any means"},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"I found this perhaps Updike's worst novel, because here, rather than writing as John Updike, he makes an ill-advised attempt to become Vladimir Nabokov. This novel reads like what a college English major might produce just after they had read LOLITA for the first time. Updike's Marshfield is a pallid Humbert. The effort, to reach for what Nabokov did with LOLITA, is transparent. Updike's attempt to be arch, witty, and erotic, like the earlier book, is clumsy. This novel is embarassingly derivative. If you want real Updike, try THE CENTAUR, or the Rabbit series."},{"Title":"A MONTH OF SUNDAYS","review":"He is a hard writer to read. His prose is thick and dense, and it doesn't flow all that well. I found myself re-reading paragraphs again and again. The subject matter is interesting; the reverend has lost his faith (did he ever had faith?), and has also lost his morals. He tries to justify his actions in 200-odd pages in a brillian way. Although i felt disgusted by this character (he's a swine), i admire the author.This was not an enjoyable read. It demanded too much attention from my brain. But i am glad i read something by Updike, and i'll be ready for more in maybe 10 years (long recovery period)."},{"Title":"Control through Communication: The Rise of System in American Management (Studies in Industry and Society)","review":"The nature of business and organizations has changed radically in the last 150 years.

Broken into six regions: Orlando, Tampa Bay, Daytona, Sarasota, St. Petersburg and Naples, this Zagat Survey will save you time (and disappointment) by helping you select the best place to feast.I have used other Zagat Surveys for years and have found them to be up-to-date and reliable in their critical evaluation of a restaurant's food, ambiance and service. Scoring 1-30 in each category (food, decor, service) a restaurant's top score in each category can be 30. The La Coquina scored 29, 28, 27 . . . the highest score in Orlando (and maybe all of Florida). The remaining restaurants in Orlando have a flagship to follow.One of the most useful features is the guide's &quot;Top Rating&quot; sections: Top Food by Cuisine, Best Buys, Most Popular, Top Outdoor, Top Romantic, Top Views, etc.This is a very good pocket guide, BUT, there is a sad downside --- the lack of maps.Of the six areas only Orlando gets two small maps, showing on the map the 40 most popular restaurants in the area. Another area that may disappoint some, is the terse 50 word description for each restaurant, a brief narrative that scarcely mentions outstanding restaurant dishes.If you are looking for a fuller restaurant description, for a few select South Florida restaurants I commend to you \\"Frommer's Florida\\" travel guide. This guide is best for those that live in the areas mentioned above. That said, Zagat has been, and is, the best overall dining guide for Orlando and Central Florida."},{"Title":"Rattiner's Financial Planner's Bible: The Advisor's Advisor","review":"This is an excellent successor to Jeff's earlier book on getting started in financial planning.

To whom does the author 'aim' the book? What isthe purpose, why expend the effort? To make a political, a religious, orsome other statement, or just to sell something, a product, to whomever iswilling to buy it?Having reviewed numerous books written by friends, commentaries on the Artof Leadership, Professional works, from Classmates, others, the reviewer hasseen a LOT of emotions expressed, running the gamut from humor,frustration - from within NYPD, to outright pain and suffering, baring ofthe soul, from Classmates, other friends, which leads to the initialquestions expressed in the preceding paragraph.WHY DID THE AUTHOR DO THIS?This is the second book published by Andy O'Meara, Jr. reflecting on hisArmy career; this one details his Vietnam experiences. In his prior work -\\"ACCIDENTAL WARRIOR\\", Andy basically delivers his autobiography, touchingbriefly on some of the battles in Vietnam, and his bout with PTSD.In this work, \\"ONLY THE DEAD . . .\\" , he describes in greater detail, andgoes into much greater depth, his experiences with PTSD and the treatment,the pain, the soul searching, involved in coming to grips with this malady.The title is a bit of an enigma, until one realizes that the servicemen whoreturned alive to this country came home to an entirely different nationthan the one they had left, a nation polarized by lying, schemingpoliticians, and a media that was anti-military to begin with, and furiouswith the Johnson Administration for lying to them, so that truly, the onlyservice personnel who returned to the 'home' they had left, were the 'Dead'.As the author phrases it, 'only the dead', who returned in caskets, were notpersecuted and/or demonized by the zealots of the anti-war movement, or atleast they never knew that they were being denounced and abandoned by thosethey sacrificed for; served to protect from communism.Thus, those who returned in coffins were 'home' in the sense that they werebeyond the pain and emotional suffering of their comrades who survived thebattles only to discover that they were hated and vilified by the enemies ofAmerica, those enemies resident within her borders!Many times the author contemplated taking his own life in a futile attemptto end the vilification and persecution, but ultimately, in the end, refusedto carry out the sentence imposed by the New Left, on those who werefaithful to their country.In the book he tells the story of soldiers who shared hospital wards withhim while he was recovering from wounds that almost cost him his leg,soldiers who would call home seeking a modicum of emotional support, andinstead be berated by a loved one for fighting in the war, or for notdeserting while they had a chance; or situations where wounded veterans weredebarking from aircraft, some ambulatory, some on litters, who were spitupon, reviled by the 'flower children', because they were 'baby killers'.Although the author is still alive and well, still here, as with all theother Vietnam Veterans, he feels that he has been changed forever. He writesthat it was a tough time to be a soldier, and they who served did not returnto the same land they left behind.\\"Our comrades, our youth, our health, our sanity, our county vanished in theyears we lost at war.\\"In his two works to date, Andy O'Meara has come forth as an apologist forthe men and women in uniform who serve their nation, unheralded, oftenreviled, and maltreated by politicians who failed to accept theirresponsibility for the combat readiness of personnel and units, which wereallowed to atrophy, wither through neglect, through lack of funding, lack ofresources from DoD. What is particularly irksome to the reviewer are thosewho opine from on high that military personnel are paid too much.He writes to help Americans understand what happened back then - which seemsto be happening now, albeit to a lesser degree - where a certain segment ofsociety systematically attempts to make service personnel scapegoats fordoing what they do.His is an attempt in book form to help the Vietnam veterans, indeed allveterans, understand that what they did was honorable, despite charges bythe Left, by various and sundry 'celebrities', a select portion of the'intelligentsia' that theirs was not an honorable cause.It is a moving read; a needed first step toward restoring the dignity of themen and women denied justice by the anti-war movement in America."},{"Title":"Only The Dead Came Home: Vietnam's Hidden Casualties","review":"This book is an essential companion to the author's first book, \\"Accidental Warrior\\". It addresses Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), one of the least understood psychological \\"illnesses\\" and legacies of the Vietnam War. In this book Andy O'Meara tells of his encounters with this disease and reconstructs the manner in which it took over his life. He weaves a gripping story consisting of remembrances of battlefield experiences, the shattering of illusions, betrayal of trust, homefront harassment, family dissolution, and finding therapy and recovery. This book helps strip away the psycho-babble, demeaning skepticism, and bureaucratic insenstivity normally associated with descriptions of PTSD. It also caused me to reread Accidental Warrior with new appreciation."},{"Title":"Margaret Ogilvy","review":"JM Barrie wrote this curious memoir of his mother after her death.

Just when it seems things couldn't get worse, her former fianc&eacute; Dillon Upshur, a.k.a. Duck, is missing.

These characters would be great in a series, but Chassie West keeps her mystery junkies waiting entirely too long between book fixes. So begging and pleading for a series is probably an exercise in futility. I just hope that we get another dose of this excellent writer sometime in the foreseeable future!"},{"Title":"Killing Kin","review":"Out on disability with an injured knee, former police officer Leigh Ann Warren is at a cross point in her life. She reluctantly gave up the job she loved, as she can't pass the physical to return to active duty, and her knee seizes up if she sits at a desk too long. Prior to her injury, she had broken up with her police officer fiance, Duck, and so both her professional and personal lives are in turmoil.Returning home after a short vacation, Leigh discovers a dead man in her kitchen. Leigh hadn't known the deceased in life, but it soon becomes apparent that Duck did. What's more, everyone from the police to drug dealers are looking for Duck, who has disappeared without a trace. Leigh sets out to find her man and finds danger along the way.Chassie West has created some terrific characters in KILLING KIN. Tank and Tina are especially funny yet realistic. There's lots of suspense, too, which kept me glued to the book. I hope that Leigh and Duck will return in future adventures."},{"Title":"Faberge: Lost and Found : The Recently Discovered Jewelry Designs from the St. Petersburg Archives","review":"This book reproduces 2 original faberge design books found in St Petersburg. They cover the years 1909 to 1915. Before Faberge sold an item they drew it in these ledgers in watercolour and noted all the details of the stones and materials it was made of.Many of the designs are for tiaras, fans, broaches etc. In some cases they have been matched up with the original pieces so you get to see both the drawing and what was actually made.This book is interesting for the different view it gives you of faberge objects. It is also a new source of information. It is not heavy on text and instead concentrates on reproducing the ledgers in colour."},{"Title":"Bad Names for Women (Word Works capital collection)","review":"Bad Names for Women -- The title brings to mind the derogatory terms we hear frequently. However, Hilary Tham's poetry goes far deeper -- to the roots of cultural stereotypes about women. Tham is Malaysian and Chinese, her husband, Jewish; this background provides much of the inspiration for her poems.Bad Names for Women is divided into three sections. The first, \\"Chinese Mother\\", draws upon Tham's heritage. Many of the poems revolve around the central figure of Mrs. Wei, through whom we get to see cultures clashing, as in \\"Mrs. Wei is Unhappy With the Sexual Revolution\\":From the beginning, women have made menpay for sex -- a leg of wild boar, goldchains, marriage. Now, their daughters giveit away, call it freedom!The second section, \\"Jewish Mother\\", looks at the heritage of Jewish women (with the obligatory mention of Lilith) and the difficulties of such a male-oriented religion, as in \\"Dancing the HaKafot\\":This year, our synagogue allowed womento dance the HaKafot. Hair streaming from headscarves,we panted out songs and twirled with the men . . .In a corner, the retired rabbi reproveshis wife with harsh words. Infectedwith the momentum of the young, she has brokena lifelong taboo. She has carried the Torahwith bare, female hands . . .The third section, \\"Woman, by Any Name\\", is more feminist in sensibility and is wildly provacative. With titles like \\"A Liberated Woman\\", \\"The First Time is Always a Disappointment\\", and \\"Odalisques Were Invented by Men\\", it's hard to pick only one as an example. You will just have to go pick up a copy of the book and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Bad Names for Women (Word Works capital collection)","review":"I recommend this and ALL Hilary Tham's books. She writes clearly and often humorously and isn't afraid to take a stab at wisdom -- and often hits it. I find her poems bracing and lively, both tough and warm. If you read her poems, you feel you've found a friend."},{"Title":"Historical Dictionary of Indonesia","review":"First of all, many thanks to Scarecrow Press for its Asian Historical Dictionary series. These are fantastic references.This volume is now eclipsed by the new edition. Haven't yet seen the new edition, but I anticpate many updated and new entries since the 1990-92 work done on this still-useful resource.This is not to say this book is perfect. For a country as abbrevation- and acronym-dependent as Indonesia is, this abbreviation/acronym list is woefully inadequate. This being said, a comprehensive abbreviation/acronym listing is not practicable as acronym dictionaries available in Indonesia are themselves hundreds of pages long. What is needed is a much more in depth compilation, edited for use primarily by foreign students and scholars.The map section is also disappointing. For a reference costing as much as this does, the maps should be full-color glossies, better annotated, and more detailed. The best solution would be fold-out maps to best show the detail that is needed to complement such a fine reference.The dictionary portion is excellent, very well cross-referenced, with thorough entries for each item. The numerous appendices are also superb, with leadership and governmental ministers listings for the colonial period as well as the post-revolution period.The true gem of this dictionary is the 118-page bibliography, listing other references and bibliographies, works sorted by discipline and subject, as well as important periodicals and journals.This has been and will continue to be an indispensable part of my Southeast Asia/Indonesia collection. Although overtaken by the new edition, this is an unparalleled reference, an essential tool for the Indonesia student and scholar."},{"Title":"Historical Dictionary of Indonesia","review":"Drawing upon their rather impressive expertise, Robert Cribb (Senior Fellow, Australian National University, Canberra) and Audrey Kahin (Managing Editor of Southeast Asia publications at Cornell and editor of the journal \\"Indonesia\\" from 1978 to 1995), provide students and non-specialist general readers alike with a comprehensive compilation of people, places and events in the social, political, religious, and economic history of the tropical archipelago that is Indonesia (Asia's third largest country in both population and geography). Now in an updated second edition, Historical Dictionary Of Indonesia pre-sents its wealth of in-depth researched information in easy-to-look-up alphabetical entries, from \\"adat\\" (indigenous customary laws) to \\"Zeven Provincien, mutiny of the\\" referring to the ill-fated 1933 protest aboard the Dutch naval vessel De Zeven Provincien. Supplements include several maps, lists of common acronyms for easy reference, appendices that list governors and rulers, electoral performance of the parties from 1945 to 1999, and much more. An all-around excellent, easy to use general reference."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"An essential book for all photography fans!In 1983, Ansel Adams picked 40 of his most memorable and diverse black and white photographs as examples of his work. For each one he wrote a brief essay that described the circumstances of deciding to photograph the subject, how he came to prepare for the photography, his companions, special challenges that occurred along the way, how he selected the composition, tricky light and shadow conditions encountered, technical details of how the image was captured (equipment, film speeds, settings, filters, lenses, etc.), technical details of printing the image, and the surprises he experienced.In the midst of all this, he shares his philosophy of life, nature, and the art of photography. It's like attending a master class with a genius. Even if you know nothing about photography, this book will open your eyes to new ways of seeing and experiencing the world around you.For those who love these images, the stories that accompany them will broaden and deepen your appreciation of what Mr. Adams accomplished. If you are not a technically-oriented photographer or fan, realize that only about 20 percent of the material is primarily technical. The technical parts are very interesting, but the rest of the material is even better.Mr. Adams did draw the line at one point though. &quot;Absent from these pages [is] a statement of what the photograph 'means.'&quot; His reason: &quot;Only the print contains the artist's meaning and message.&quot; In other words, the work should speak to you for itself.He does point out some limits to his essays that you should keep in mind. He often doesn't remember when he made a particular photograph. Friends would remind him that a certain print was published in a certain publication in 1934 and he had dated it as 1936 elsewhere. He also did not keep notes of how he made the image after the negative was developed. So all of the technical notes and dates are probably off a little. That's all right in many cases. You are not a historian, and you are probably not going to use glass plates. Modern equipment is much different from what Adams used, so you will be making major adjustments anyway.His style of photography was one adventure after another. You'll be climbing with him through snow-clad forests in freezing weather, and suddenly he's down to his last exposure. Which filter should he use?In fact, in many cases, Adams was gambling on how the image would turn out because he would not get a second chance. It's like reading a detective story, in which the story begins with a flashback sequence of how the mystery ends, like Sunset Boulevard, because the finished image is there is its duotone beauty.In other cases, the experiences of Edward Weston helped him avoid mistakes. As a result, you get to see his delightful, dramatic images of dunes in Death Valley.As usual, the Little, Brown pages are often too small for the images. Despite my annoyance at this limitation, I did not grade the book down since the essays are so wonderful (of more than five-star interest) and are the real reason for reading and examining this book.I would suggest that you read The American Wilderness before reading this book. That will give you a context for understanding what Mr. Adams is talking about in these essays. The essays assume a certain level of familiarity with the people, philosophies, and locations involved. The American Wilderness can provide that background for you.After you have swum in these wonderful stories, I suggest that you write an essay about something you have done that contains high drama and meaning. Then share that essay with someone who would appreciate know the whole story. How can others learn as rapidly and as well as possible if your experiences (successful and unsuccessful) are lost?Keep your mind open for opportunity! It's all around you!"},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"Forget &quot;...every photographers library...&quot; This should be in every library. It's one of the ten best books I've ever read. Yes, I'm an amateur photographer but this book is way deeper and of so much more value than just knowing which f-stop he used.This is a beautifully illustrated book of short stories chronicling the adventures of a master as he passionately pursues his craft. It's a love story with nature. If this book doesn't inspire you to climb a mountain or to sit beside a stream for a few hours, I don't know what will. If it also inspires you to photograph your little corner of creation, there's plenty of insight in these pages as well."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"If you want to learn photography and you would prefer to learn (or supplement your learning) by intensive case study, this is the book for you. Ansel Adams is a master at controlling composition, light and perspective, and he conveys his unique methodology admirably in this book. This book covers much more than his epic landscapes -- there are a lot of still life, portrait and architectural case studies. And he's not just discussing the zone system, but also everything else involved, including packing the right equipment, leaving at the right time, and hunting down the right subject. And above all, patience and persistence. The photos themselves are reproduced with admirable tone, sharpness, and contrast, as they are in all the books in this series. And although there are only forty of them, each case study runs two or three pages in addition to a full page photo. And if you like this, check out Ansel Adams' classic three part intensive introduction to photography, in the same series as this book: The Camera, The Print, and The Negative."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"&quot;Examples: The Making of Forty Photographs&quot; takes you on ajourney of vision and creativity of one of the influentialphotographers of the late twentieth century.

Thisbook is a must for any photographers library."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"This book is an inspiration for all of us whose photos don't look like they were taken by Ansel Adams. It shows the painstaking effort that went into some of his great photographs, and the sheer luck that captured others.The technical descriptions are very interesting and helpful for anyone who wonders how such great prints were made. The more personal stories behind finding the images really give you a sense of what it means to make great photographs. Add in Ansel Adams' personal feelings about the art of photography and you've got a book every photographer should read."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"Heralded as perhaps one of the most influential conservation photographers of all time, Ansel Adams for many has existed only as a name attached to brilliant, vibrant and expressive landscape photography. Perhaps if you have read his three-party series, \\"The Camera,\\" \\"The Negative,\\" and \\"The Print,\\" you are familiar with Adams's technical thought processes. With \\"The Making of 40 Photographs,\\" we gain insight into Adams' creative process. And for many of us who aspire to create brilliant nature photography, it is this insight that is most valuable.\\"The Making of 40 Photographs\\" seeks to answer that question we all ask when we see a tremendous photographic print: How did the photographer take that photograph? But, \\"The Making\\" does far more than that. It seeks to explore not only the individual creative process, but the growth of the art form and the important historical transition of its wide acceptance as true art in his discussions of the f/64 Group.As far back as 1980, Adams even goes so far as to predict digital photography as the next big step, referencing what he calls the \\"electronic image.\\" This is a valuable insight, as many today challenge digital photography and question its detrimental impact on the photographic arts.Any photographer who wishes to learn more about this master and explore his or her own potential to create brilliant images must read this book."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"There are many great books about photography, of which this is just one, but there are relatively few books about how to be a great photographer. On the latter topic this book is exceptional.Ansel Adams was clearly both a gentleman and a gentle man, who lived to create great images for the pleasure and education of others. We are exceptionally lucky that he left us both his wonderful pictures, but also a few books which explain not only how, but also why some of them were created.This book covers a photography career of over 60 years, taking 40 of his greatest pictures, and describing how they were made. Although much of the technical advice is still valid today, a lot of it requires on the fly translation from the language of large format cameras and glass plates to the world of digital SLRs, with tiny sensors and vast memory cards. That exercise might put some people off, but it makes you think harder about his advice, and that's a good thing.However, where this book really scores is with the human stories of how and why Adams made certain pictures. Two examples stick in my mind.Firstly, how one of his iconic views of Yosemite was made after a day's hard hiking with a full size view camera, large wooden tripod, and just twelve glass plates. He suspected that he had wasted the first eleven, and had just one left for a favourite view of Half Dome. He took extra care with that one, and the results are still thrilling 80 years on.Then there's his tale of photographing 50s Californian farming families. This is a charming insight into how a great photographer of people develops both trust and ideas, lubricating both with an appropriate supply of beer. You suspect these days were not so hard for Adams as the great Yosemite hikes.\\"Examples\\" also contains some remarkable philosophical insights into the process and role of photography. The one which now sticks foremost in my mind is that enthusiasm for a subject will not create great photographs - you have to visualise the image and its impact mentally, then make it. This is perhaps the single most powerful piece of advice in the book.In 1935 Adams was concerned that the advent of 35mm would result in a vast number of bad photographs. Yet he was keen on the new medium, because he could also see its benefits. The same page could be written ten times over about digital photography, but you know that had Adams lived a little longer he would have been a keen PhotoShop-er.This is a good book on photographic technique, but there are others. But there are few books which give such an insight into the soul of a great photographer."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"As far as I'm concerned, this is a must have 4th book to the Ansel Adams series of The Camera, The Negative and The Print. It is very informative to read about not only the circumstances in which Adams made these black and white photographs, but also some of the technical and even emotional factors.Great reading for anyone interested in photography (mostly landscapes and medium and large format).The book and photographs are well printed and seems sturdy."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"This is truly a fantastic resource for those who want to \\"step into\\" the mind of a master photographer. On a different note, it is also an interesting historical perspective from somebody who has lived through the technological changes in photography and several different \\"movements\\" in art. Beyond just providing you with basic \\"EXIF\\" or exposure information on his shots, Adams has provided insight into, among other things, what lead up to \\"seeing\\" the shot, how he considered technical aspects (especially as it related to his Zone System), how he felt about the scene and his surroundings, and what he did in the darkroom in order to bring out the best in the shot. You also get a very good sense of Adams' philosophy on photography and just life in general.I learned several interesting things about Adams from this book that I did not know previously - he bracketed shots quite a bit (which made me feel better about not getting the shot perfect the first time, every time), he spent as much time in \\"post processing\\" as he did shooting (which made me reconsider how I use modern equivalents like Photoshop and Aperture), even though he bracketed quite often, he really felt you got your best \\"base\\" for the shot from the negative, and thus he was a proponent of pre-visualizing shots.This book is very easy to read and the photographs are nicely reproduced so you can get a sense of what Adams is talking about. It is also subtly dense. While you can read it in a very leisurely manner, picking up points here and there, it is also worthy of serious study. As I have reread favorite sections for a second and third time, I have picked up on nuances in his words that have help me understand the photo better and how I may apply his wisdom to my own photography.Finally, this book has prompted me to do my own \\"Making of...\\" series for 40 of my photographs and write about it on my blog. In that sense, this book has really spurred me to be detail-oriented with my shooting and helped me creatively. It is worth the modest price and has provided me with at least ten-fold in satisfaction."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"Inspiring, fascinating, revealing.

I must say I was fairly disappointed. It's not the book's fault, so it almost seems unfair to give it a low rating. But such is life.The major problem is that the book describes a process which is film-based rather than digital. Now I knew that going in, but I also figured that digital photography is very analogous to film-based photography, so there was still a lot I could learn. I was wrong. Adams spends a great deal of time discussing the camera he used (almost always large format), the lenses, the filters, the type of film, and the chemicals used in development. Almost all of this is entirely meaningless in a world of 35mm digital cameras. Only the filters have ANY relevance, and even that is extremely limited in a world of post-processing. So all of \\"the making\\" included in this book was entirely useless for me, and probably for most of you.Still, there was value in his discussion of the situation leading up to the photography. Ironically, there was probably more of this than there should have been for a \\"making of\\" book! But thank goodness, because it was the only part of the book that was even meaningful to me. And it was not really enough. I struggled to finish the book in the hope that it would prove worthwhile, but I am not convinced that it did. I would not recommend this book.On the other hand, if you are doing film photography, it may be exactly what you were looking for."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"Beautiful.

Adams is a teacher, and his love of sharing his acquired knowledge with the reader comes through in this very enjoyable resource."},{"Title":"Examples : The Making of 40 Photographs","review":"Don't mistake this for some coffee table book.

The accounts of each photograph include anecdotes about how the photograph came to be made and technical information about the film, exposure, f-stop, development and printing processes, and a little about composition. Adams does not attempt to explain the meaning of any of the images: as he says, \\"only the print contains the artist's meaning and message\\". If you are looking for a \\"cookbook\\" of bullet points that will improve your photography, then you will probably be disappointed, especially since many of the technique issues are specific to black and white medium-format film photography.

A variety of races are available for play (including two of the Draconian types, Minotaurs, Gnomes, Kender, two Sea Elven races, etc...) along with good descriptions of each.Although the book covers everything up to just after the end of the War of Souls novels, enough is here to let you run at any time in Krynn's history. Much more specific details for each era will be coming out in the upcoming years. I already have the 5th Age book, and it gives what I think of as additional 'required' information in order to play in those times. But the DLCS is what is needed to get the broad general overview which anyone (especially a newbie to the world) should become familiar with before diving into the details. But if you don't wish to get the additional books, don't worry. There is enough in here to get you going in order to develop your own Krynnish campaign.In short, the book is well put together. The coverage of the pantheon is clear. The timeline explains clearly how things came about. The new classes I look forward to using. The prestige classes I'm already having fun with. And I'll stop there because I said 'in short'."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"Finally! An updated campaign setting for the Dragonlance world. While this book does live up to expectations, it's not quite perfect. The organization of the book comes across as somewhat sporadic, and the information within isn't as detailed as, say, the Forgottem Realms campaign setting book.With several source books already planned for release soon, I believe the Dragonlance setting will become even more popular. If you're a fan of Dragonlance, and not necessarily a gamer, I highly suggest picking up this book."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"This is a pretty good campaign setting.Though not without a few errors here and there, it is better produced and edited than the &quot;World Book of Ansalon&quot; that came with the AD&D; 2nd ed. &quot;Tales of the Lance&quot; set. The main things it seems to be missing are details of non-standard weapons and equipment (kender in particular), information on famous heroes and NPCs from before the Age of Mortals (no Heroes of the Lance or Dragon Highlords), details of many famous locations (Foghaven Vale, High Clerists Tower, Istar) and almost anything regarding the Dragon Orbs, the Device of Time Travelling, the Portals to the Abyss and several other key artifacts from the Age of Despair.What it does have is enough to run fairly detailed adventures in the post War of Souls period and somewhat generalized campaigns in all the major time periods since the Cataclysm (or First Cataclysm for Age of Mortals folks). It is effective for updating older Dragonlance settings, modules and characters to 3rd edition or 3.5. What it lacks in detail of maps and NPCs it makes up for with sections allowing for PC Draconians and Knights of Neraka (or Takhisis) among others, as well as very detailed chronologies and geographical information.I am running a game using both the old, out of print Dragonlance Classics reprints of the original DL module series AND this new campaign setting. I am finding this combination very effective for running the original campaign using v.3.5 rules. The Classics series and the original DL modules are all available from retailers such as NobleKnight.com and TitanGames.com. If you like modules the old ones definitely still stand up, but 3rd ed. has many significant changes. If you want to make your own campaign in the old period I recommend the Sovereign Press book coming out later this year (see next paragraph).So once again I emphasize that this product is designed mainly for playing in or after the War of Souls period. It is also (currently; see below) the only good way to play in the Dragonlance setting using D&D; 3 or 3.5. Hopefully the &quot;War of the Lance&quot; expansion (published by Sovereign Press, due out later this year) will solve many of the problems I have mentioned here. Ideally, it will give enough information to allow play in that period without purchasing this WotC Dragonlance campaign setting, but I wouldn't bet on it."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"Ok - to sum this up briefly, if you want to play Dragonlance in 3rd edition rules, buy this book.Doesn't matter if you didn't like the Fifth Age or the War of Souls. If you did, fantastic.What this book provides is a comprehensive translation of all outdated material from the previous editions into a newer supplement. It explains the history of the setting from the creation of the world to the end of the War of Souls.There are new races, new prestige classes and base classes. New magic items and artifacts. Now so, more than ever, DL3E is richer and more vibrant than ever before.My pet gripes which prevents this from being five stars:- The history had several spoilers, which, I think the book should have done a better job at warning the reader against.- I found slabs of text which where copied and pasted from previous editions of Dragonlance campaign setting(sections on the Wizards of High Sorcery being a good example, ripped from the Tales of the Lance boxed set, and from the AD&amp;D 1st Ed campaign setting as well IIRC).- The art could have been greatly improved (the art in the Age of Mortals however, is the best I've seen in any recent d30 DnD 3e book, so that made up for it really).The book lives up to reputation however, the material is substantial, well written (albeit poorly illustrated) and I thoroughly recommend it. I recommend you purchase Age of Mortals with it, as you'll wind up with a lot of questions which are answered in that book anyway."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"First off, yes, I'm a little bit biased. I've loved Dragon lance for a long time, but this book seems to be getting a lot of bad reviews that aren't all that justified.Yes, there is an inch and a half margin which really shouldn't be that large. They should have at least added the chapter titles into the margin if they were going to make it that big.The art isn't all that great. In fact there isn't a lot of art at all. Which means that the inch and a half margins don't sacrifice text, but rather pictures.The other peeve I have about this book is that there is a lot of repeated information. The whole Chapter on other eras of play really isn't necessary, and everything that is in that chapter should have appeared somewhere else in the book.The good thing is there are two new character classes, several prestige classes, and a lot of history for those people who don't feel like reading ALL of the Dragon lance books. But once again there is a lot of repetition of the history. There are also stats for some of the magic items used by the characters in the novels, and 2 mini adventures.I want to comment on one prestige class. The dragon rider. Even if the dragon rider isn't used in your dragon lance campaign it can be easily changed to a different animal. I think I'm going to convert it to Star Wars and use it for the Rancor Riders."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"I still remember the day I first saw the ad for Dragons of Despair in Dragon Magazine. I still remember playing that adventure for the first time. I still remember when Dragons of Autumn twilight became the first fantasy novel to hit the New York Times best seller list. These are some of the defining moments in my gaming career.So it only stands to reason that I'd be excited to see this revisiting of one of my favorite settings. There was a certain feeling of trepidation as well. I thought that Dragonlance Adventures had lots of problems. I never cared for the Saga System at all. Still, I sucked it up, forced my expectations low and opened the book.I have to admit, I liked it. It brings the Dragonlance rules nicely into the 3.5 game system. Prestige classes alone were something that the Dragonlance setting desperately needed. This book is a must-have for anyone who loves Dragonlance.The book starts with the obligatory race chapter. There are some surprises, though. Fatherless dwarves (dwarves without a home), thinker gnomes (the \\"insane\\" opposite of tinker gnomes) and afflicted kender (kender who have had the spunk scared out of them) leap out immediately. Then there are the draconians. (When I was a kid we didn't have player character draconians. Draconians were the enemy and we liked it that way!) The irda have entered the player character arena, crushing the hopes of all the munchkins out there by presenting an official (and balanced) treatment of the race. On the strength of this chapter alone, I decided the book was worth it.Then we enter class-land. The mystic (a divine version of the sorcerer) and the noble base class are two pleasant surprises. There's a nice little boxed text explaining why certain classes (like the paladin) aren't appropriate in Krynn. Then we move onto prestige classes, with a more reasonable treatment of the Knight of Solamnia than in Dragonlance Adventures (no week long spell prep times, for instance). Then we move onto the evil knights and the Wizards of High Sorcery (which are one class with plug and play powers). There are several other classes, the most notable being the dragon rider. The chapter rounds out with a nice selection of world-specific feats.From there we move on to the chapter on magic. If you've seen the former Dragonlance treatments and know 3.0 or 3.5, there aren't really any surprises here. This section even has its own domains, ala Forgotten Realms. While it might not be anything too surprising, it's well done. After that is the deity chapter, which is more of the same.The book then moves onto Geography and then Creatures. There isn't much to say about these, except that they bring some of out favorite old creatures into 3.5 (spectral minions, anyone?). Then we have a chapter on Dragons and ariel combat (very important), and a final chapter on Eras of Play.This book is very satisfying and I look forward to future supplements (which I hear are being done by Sovereign Stone). It is on sale this year at GenCon, but goes onto the market en masse on August 22. Look for this book and enjoy.P.S. Yes, they did reduce the power of the Dragonlance to the level of an item you can actually give your players. Now the dragons are waiting in the sidelines, itching for a rematch with your players."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"This book is an excellent resource for the running of a Dragonlance campaign. The choices and handling of the races, character classes, and prestige classes is fantastic. There is a good rundown of the deities,magic, history and geography of the Dragonlance world.My complaints are that the book is mainly set in the \\"current\\" timeline of the books, where as I am mainly interested in the War of the Lance era. I think a whole War of the Lance supplement should be created seperately. There are too few character profiles in the book, and the bestiary is rather small. An example Death Knight is given-why not just give us the stats for Lord Soth? That's what everyone wants! Also, I couldn't find the 3.5 edition stats for the hoopak stick! What gives? If it were not form these mostly minor omissions, I would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"Ok, no index, but that is ok, i can deal with that.

Well worth the investment."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"Well, I waited and waited for this book to come out. When I first bought it, I was quite disappointed in the material presented within. Where were all the cool spells that aren't in FR or D&amp;D 3.5? What about the other races, better statistics on the gods?So I took my time to read and re-read the book. Well, I've gotten used to it and have found a lot of useful info for running a campaign. Kind of like that cd you buy where it takes listening to it a few times to like it.I would still recommend going to the unoffical Dragonlance website because it has a lot more useful info than this book. But I still give this one my recommendation.Oh yeah, the biggest disappointment: No Fold-Out Map! It has been put on the WOTC website for download, but it doesn't make up for this book lacking one. They should have released a map with the Dragon magazine to make up for this."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"Perhaps I am bias because when I was young I read the original three Dragonlance novels, but I find this edition of the Dragonlance campaign setting to be very disappointing. I have seen the AD&amp;D 2e boxed set of Dragonlance, and it was very fascinating.However, I think that the main reason for my disappointment is that the authors felt it necessary to include the novels written in the Dragonlance world that occurred after the 2nd Edition boxed set, which gives the world of Krynn a very different flavor from its previous incarnation. I suppose I feel alienated because of this, but there are other reasons.The basic classes are redefined, edited, or left out in this book, which is both good and bad. Some new basic classes are added for flavor, some of which seem redundant since other basic classes essentially do the same thing. There are prestige classes that could have been modeled better in terms of mechanical progression (3 progressive classes for an Order of Knights seems silly). The writing style failed to make the material interesting, as well as trying too hard to cover many novels in a short space of text.For these reasons, I cannot possibly recommend the purchase of this book unless you're a D&amp;D collector or a diehard Dragonlance fan."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"I love Dragonlance...let me say that first and formost. However, I think they forgot a few things in this book. Some of the dwarven and elven histories are changed and you aren't really given enough info on alot of other races and classes of Krynn. Minotaurs are included under the ogre heading and thier history is very limited. I think Margaret could have done a much better job if she had broke the book down in order to actually give the players more information. If you already have D &amp; D Monsters Manual and the Players Handbook, this book isn't even needed to play in Dragonlance.I caried my book back for a refund.."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"This book is great, it provides all sorts of cool stuff about the dragonlance campaign. New monsters, new races, new classes, new prestige classes, new spells, everything. However, its art is mostly terrible, theres only about 3 good pictures in the book. But if you are looking for a campaign setting, this one is very good."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"Let me first just say that I was very excited to receive this book. I have always loved dragonlance especially the art by Larry Elmore (www.larryelmore.com) which really does the setting justice. However this book was biggest letdown of all the D&amp;D and d20 books I have purchased.I don't know who the art director on this book was but all I can say is it looks like a bunch of high school students without any experience in life drawing were hired to illustrate this book. Half the characters and people illustrated in this book are out of proportion. I was really excited to see the illustrations on Draconians, but was sorely disappointed by the almost juvenile poses and horrible painting techniques. And I thought the Monster Manual 2 was ugly!Compare this to the art by Larry Elmore, and you will see what I am talking about. I personally have taken some life drawing classes in college... and it looks like something I WOULD DRAW! (And this is not a compliment) Some Illustrators know how to draw the human form. Some need more practice. There were very few illustrations in this book that I found marginally acceptable.Its sad the art director (or whoever was in charge of this book) decided to skimp on the art, and it shows. I am tempted to send the book back because I find the illustrations revolting.Secondly, the graphic design is just stinky! Every single page has a Carved relief motif taking up nearly 2 inches of the left and right hand margins. I was okay with this for the opening of chapter... but it is HUGE and on every single page! Not to mention the font selection and sizes are less than desirable. The whole execution of the book looks clunky and unrefined... I would have expected some refinement for such a wonderful campaign setting.And the organization of the book is horrible. Enough said... I think this is a disservice to the dragonlance setting.Bottom line... don't buy this book if you are interested in some cool illustrations of dragons and other dragonlance characters. If you want to use the dragonlance setting in a game then perhaps you can ignore the horrid pictures, although the text and graphic design make the whole book an utter disappointment."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"For a manual of game rules and guidelines, this was actually fairly entertaining. Once I catch up on my DragonLance reading (and re-reading) and get the source material more firmly set in my head, I might consider running an online campaign using this book. Even though I am not currently gaming, the book was interesting and filled in some gaps in the DragonLance world that I was missing.Fair warning, if you intend on reading a lot in this series, this manual contains quite a few spoilers, so you may want to wait to take a look at this until you've at least read the main cannon of the DragonLance time-line."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"This book was absolutely brilliant. The races filled out nicely all of the racial attributes described in the books, the classes were well adapted, the spells very campaign specific, and the monsters, like the races, filled out nicely all of the racial attributes described in the books. The only downside is that if you haven't read the books, it will take a long while of pouring through the timeline and reading fluff to be able to actually set a campaign in Krynn. If you haven't read the books, it's still a great supplement. The idea of draconians is easy to adapt (change their origin), the races are all interesting and can be switched for any setting (the irda could be made into an elven offshoot race, and the gulley dwarves children of gnomes and dwarves [this was their origin in Krynn as well]), the death knight presented here is much better then that in the MM II, and so on.The new classes were the only part that disappointed me. The noble was just a mixture of a bard with some special powers and decent combat abilities, and the mystic a perfect cleric parallel (except worse)."},{"Title":"Dragonlance Campaign Setting (Dungeon & Dragons Roleplaying Game: Campaigns)","review":"This book covers the DL setting in a way that shows the writters passion for the world and actually tells you both the rules and great ideas for future stories. I have rarely held a setting book that you can just flip through so easily in terms of flow, in a way it is like reading parts of a novel.The PrC's in it are good and the standards for the DL world, the races are there and even information on the different geographical locations. It has everything you need. It is set primarily after the War of Souls, which is the current time in the DL setting. That said it gives a great deal of detail to allow play in other time periods. And there is another excellent WotL supplement if you want to play in the fourth age more anyway.I give this the lowest rating I would give any of the newer DL gaming material for the fact that after reading everything else it is the worst. That speaks more for the quality of the later supplements. Some of the PrC's are presented here but flushed out much better later. This is a great intro and starting book, but there are much better books in this line. From the WotL, Legends, Age of Mortals, Wizards of High Sorcery, Holy Order of the Stars, Knights of Ansalon, Dragons of Krynn are all very very good supplements. Probably the best I have read.

Well, anyone who dislikes fighting dragons while on dragonback, anyone who thinks that mages all draw thier power from the same source (these people would want to play in the Post-Chaos era), and well basicly anyone who doesn't like Dungeons and Dragons.It's co-written by Margrt Weis, one of the original authors and the creators of Krynn (the Dragonlance world) so you know all the information is correct.

The stories in Brother are more fantastic (one story could almost be considered a &quot;ghost story&quot;, and another is loosely based on a Japanese fable) and feel less &quot;real&quot; than the earlier Hobbema reserve stories. And where the earlier stories often had a surprising twist and showed some surprising sides of the protagonists, these stories are more predictable. Conflicting Statements, especially, reads almost like a college student's writing experiment. (Mind, I would still have given it an &quot;A&quot;.) It's almost as if Silas Ermineskin himself has matured as a writer, but at the cost of his originality.

In this book the artist (Stephen Mosher) has captured so many of my personal favourite actors and personalities in a light in which we, their audience, seldom see them. That is the state of being honest and themselves. More often than not, show folk are always performing or clowning for photo shoots and we rarely see any glimpse of the real person. Not so with The Sweater Book. By disarming his subjects with his common thread (a simple sweater) Mosher has given us a journey of artistry and a look into the hearts of his subjects. Bravo Stephen Mosher. You are the Herb Ritz of the 21st Century!"},{"Title":"The Sweater Book: Hundreds of People...One Common Thread","review":"Photographer Stephen Mosher may have started out his sweater photographs as a lark that turned into a project to raise money for AIDS, but the ultimate product is a beautiful collection of photographs that everyone should have on their coffee table. Mosher has a great eye for setting a photograph and he also captures the essence of each celebrity, whether madcap, dramatic, or touching. And it is certainly not your typical Celebrity photo! Mosher's anecdotes and commentary that are inserted throughout the book are also charming and eloquently written. I was swept away by the photographs in this book and everyone I have shown my copy to has wanted to buy it - what better recommendation can you ask! A great gift book, especially for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Sweater Book: Hundreds of People...One Common Thread","review":"I love this book. Stephen Mosher is a truly gifted artist and this book is just beautiful. Having each celebrity wear the same sweater for the photographs is so clever and it's fun seeing how everyone chose to present themselves and the sweater. The fact that it benefits AIDS research is an added bonus. I'd highly recommend this beautiful book."},{"Title":"The Sweater Book: Hundreds of People...One Common Thread","review":"Mosher's book is done a disservice by the Dark Reprint on the cover of his exquisite picture of Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker. If you look inside and find the pic, as it should be seen - in the book, you can see the play of light on her hair and the expressions of love they have for each other. The book is a truly wonderful collection. Never boring and never over done. Just pictures of almost ALL of our favourite performers being themselves!! How often does that happen? There are touches of glamour and humor and in the instances where Mosher has judiciously chosen to tell a story behind the picture his words are well chosen and fascinating. I say Buy it and cherish for many years to come. You help a worthy cause with your purchase and you get a treasure trove of wonderful true to life photos of people who are usually &quot;acting&quot; for the cameras."},{"Title":"The Sweater Book: Hundreds of People...One Common Thread","review":"I purchased a book called \\"The Sweater Project: Hundreds of pictures One common Thread\\"I had heard an interview with the photographer / creator of this book and it peeked my interest.It's a neat look at how different people can tell a story without words using the same prop.The pictures are beautiful and the story behind in great.I'm proud to have this book on my coffee table.I've told everyone I know about and the money goest to HIV/ Aids research.Well done!"},{"Title":"The Sweater Book: Hundreds of People...One Common Thread","review":"When you buy a product and you know the proceeds are going to a charity, you always feel good about yourself. But good about the purchase itself? Not often. It's usually some lame overpriced promotional item that seems to reinforce the feeling that you did a good thing. NOT here baby!!! Although sales of this book benefit Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, that's only one of the myriad of reasons to buy this touching, poignant and funny book. Yes, funny! A plethora of famous figures (and some not so famous, but all fabulous) pose with a sweater. The photographer did not tell them what to do -- they had to figure it out themselves. And their personalities are revealed by what they did with the pullover. For geeks, there's an amazing Star Trek section (TNG not TOS) and for theater queens there are multiple Broadway stars. I don't want to tell you who is in the book, because each time you turn the page, you should be surprised. If you love celebrities and you love photography, it's imperative that you own this teasure."},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Northern Magic: A Family Odyssey","review":"When we read this book we were carried away to the ends of the earth.

A lit bit of cruising, a lit more about traveling and experiences and even more about a family living an extreme experience together for three years."},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Northern Magic: A Family Odyssey","review":"This is one of the best travel and adventure books I have ever read.The author has such a superb command of the English language that she literally brings this exciting voyage alive in the reader's mind. While the author's vivid description of the various countries she and her family visited, and the people and friends they met, was most interesting and highly educational, I personally was particularly fascinated with the episodes at sea both on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The description of every aspect of their long voyage had such an impact on my mind that I actually found myself experiencing everything the family was being subjected to on the high seas; the gigantic waves crashing into the side of the boat and attemtpting to push the Northern Magic off its established course, the cold and huge waves splashing over Diane and her husband Herbert as they attempted to keep their boat on course;their constant struggle to survive in spite of periods of sea-sickness, long periods in the cockpit without eating a proper meal, their very real concern for the safety of their boys and the boat, which often required immediate attention by Herbert to fix the engine, the sails, the mast, untangle the propellor and so forth, really increased the flow of adrenelin in my body.I highly recommend this book to all those who enjoy the spirit of adventure and wish to have a realistic experience of such a fantastic voyage. The information covering the visits to the various countries is highly educational and most enjoyable. The Stuemer family left the Ottawa area as novices and returned as seasoned sailors."},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Northern Magic: A Family Odyssey","review":"I loved reading \\"The Voyage of the Northern Magic\\" not just for its quality as a wonderful sailing tale, but also for the inspiration it lends readers. The author and her husband both had life-altering experiences which convinced them to realize their dream of sailing around the world rather than continue in an average suburban life. Their tale of sailing with their three boys around the world is inspiring, both for the get-up-and-go message as well as their involvement with local projects. It is also a thought-provoking book in that you as the reader turn the pages knowing that the author succumbed to cancer shortly after writing her book; for me, this was not just a sad truth but a nudge for me to consider how I choose to spend my own time. I have only one criticism of the tale which was the family's forays into truly dangerous situations and places, such as their Yemen episode and their method of dealing with the threat of pirates. Still, this does not take away from a fantastic read, and the author is honest and straight-forward in reflecting on her choices as a parent. As a sailor, mother, and author myself, I highly recommend this book.By Nadine Slavinski, author of \\"Lesson Plans Ahoy!

This book is inspiring to anyone who has a dream. Read it not only for the sailing circumnavagation but also for the human family experience. Diane writes of her family's struggles, challenges, joys, and love as they follow a dream.

I have collected many old issues of Popular Mechanix/Science from the 40's and 50's, because back then they showed you exactly how to do things yourself - to be self sufficient.One Popular Mechanix issue I have shows how to build your own clothes washing machine - another shows how to create your own garden tractor, and a third describes how to turn your basement into a workshop from junk parts. You won't find that in any magazine from today!Unfortunately, each of these magazines take up space. I wished for a long while that there was one source of information I could go to to find things like this. I haven't found The Grand Encyclopaedia yet, but I have come close with the Survivor series.Many of the little anecdotal sidebars that Kurt Saxon writes might make one think that he is racist - but after I read many of them (not just one, but almost all!), I have come to realize that the only thing Saxon is against is anybody too lazy to do things himself. I don't think he picks the right words sometimes to express himself, but he does get his point across.This is one excellent book - as well as an excellent series. Any do-it-yourselfer would be crazy not to own this book. No home should be without it."},{"Title":"The Survivor Volume 1","review":"there was a lot of things in this world i didn't know how to do until i read this book. it opened up my imagination i never knew i had. i now do do-it-myself. thanks for all thew know how!!"},{"Title":"The Nostradamus Cabala Code","review":"John Pocock's &quot;The Nostradamus Cabala Code&quot; is two books in one. The first book tells us a little of what Cabala (or Kabbalah, a mystical movement in Judaism) is all about; &quot; a kind of metaphysical Chaos Theory for the soul and mind&quot;, as Pocock sees it.The second book is an entertaining, albeit truncated and not very serious, history of the Philippines, right up to the present day, as &quot;explained&quot; by some of the predictions of &quot;Nostradamus&quot; (Michel de Notredame, a 16th Century French astrologer and doctor) and Pocock's Cabalistic interpretations of the lives and deeds of some of the Philippines' leading figures. Prominent among these is Jose Rizal, a 19th Century doctor and novelist who became the national hero of the Philippines.Some Cabalists use certain divine words as magic to heal the sick and perform miracles. They find hidden meanings in the Bible on which to base these deeds. Pocock, somewhat ingeniously, uses such Cabalistic techniques to reach his own findings about Philippine history and current affairs. Much of what he has to say about the contemporary scene is extremely tongue-in-cheek and even rather bizarre. For instance, he even goes so far as to give a Cabalistic interpretation of a Philippine commercial for vitamin pills in early 2001!"},{"Title":"The Nostradamus Cabala Code","review":"The problem with so many metaphysical books is that the take themselves so seriously that they are totally devoid of humor. While John Pocock certainly takes his subject seriously, his is not entirely a somber perspective. The Cabal is a way of deciphering life, after all, and life is sometimes too absurd to take too seriously. Although the book is targeted to explaining current events in The Philippines, the knowledge and insights let you do your own interpretations for wherever you live. A worthy thing to have around."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","review":"R.K. Harrison's monumental single-volume &quot;Introduction to the Old Testament&quot; packs in everything you need to get started with a serious study of the Hebrew Scriptures. You will be acquainted especially with the history of scholarly criticisms (e.g. the Graf-Wellhausen JEPD stuff), archaeology, Ancient Near Eastern cultures and languages, book-by-book criticisms, development of theology in the OT era, etc. etc.Over my years of studying the OT, I have noticed the ever-widening gap between the pew and the academia. The average Church-goer is woefully uninformed regarding issues of OT interpretation. Zealous readers who desire to get more out of their Bible-reading will probably be boggled by the amount of information and views/counter-views of any Critical Commentaries. Most of the time, they have to struggle to understand what was the &quot;big deal&quot; in all the endless arguments of scholars in the said commentaries (I know I did!). Harrison puts all the necessary views/counter-views in one convenient package to acquaint the serious reader with the &quot;esoterica&quot; of the academia.Harrison hails from the traditional-conservative position. However, he gives ample ground for the presentation and careful consideration of the views of &quot;higher critics&quot; and liberal scholars... all with an objectivity that is laudable in this age of strawberry-flavoured &quot;devotionals&quot;. He speaks his mind in many instances - but more with the aim of stimulating his reader to think rather than to convince you of the &quot;infallibility&quot; of traditional-conservative views. All the above reasons make this the BEST single-volume introduction to a lifelong serious study of the Hebrew Scriptures."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","review":"If you want a quick and easy intro to the Old Testament, do not buy this book, as it is long and detailed. If you are a serious student of the scriptures who wants as good of an intro as possible to aid your understanding of the Old Testament, then this is the book for you. This is one of the few academic works about which I can actually say that it made a true difference in my confidence about the truth of Christianity. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","review":"A handful of years ago Thomas Thompson (of the Copenhagen School) wrote a message on an Internet listserv that he did not consider Roland K. Harrison to be a historian. However that was about 1995 and Harrison's book is from 1969 when the issues of historicity were not the same.Harrison begins his &quot;introduction&quot; (the book runs over 1300 pages) with a review of the development of Old Testament study. A special chapter is dedicated to the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis and another chapter to reactions to the same. This section is followed by ones on archaeology, chronology, and the text and canon of the Old Testament. Following sections deal with Old Testament history, religion, andtheology.After almost 500 pages, Harrison begins to deal with the books of the Old Testament beginning with the Pentateuch. This is followed by sections of the prophets and the writings, the other two sections of the Tanakh. Finally comes a section on the Apocrypha.Needless to say Harrison's Introduction is thorough. His includes some 400 pages more than that of Robert Pfeiffer and 850 pages more than Osterley and Robinson. THIS book is the place to start for anyone interested in what we call Old Testament studies."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","review":"Just to inform everyone, the Vol. 1 [paperback] edition, ends with PART EIGHT: THE PENTATEUCH, and is 662 pages. I searched for Vol. 2 but it seems as if it is not available. These are reprints by Wm B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (First printing, September 1969; Reprinted, June 1979).Hendrickson Publishers, Inc., publishes the hardcover edition in arrangement with Eerdmans. It contains both volumes, topping out at 1335 pages.I own both of the books listed above - the format is identical, the font is a nice readable size, and the paper quality is good.The paperback edition just edges out over the hardcover because the printing stock is an eggshell color whereas the other is white. A very minor detail for sure, but when reading for an extended period, the off-whites are easier on the eyes.Finally, might I humbly suggest two sources for a solid start on understanding the OT are the volume listed above and \\"Kingdom Prologue, by Meredith G. Kline\\"."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","review":"The author seeks to correct many of the errors of mainly 19th century theological liberalism in regard to the old testament. This is not to say that Harrison takes a conservative approach, he is very much still under the modernist mindset. An example: he feels a need to explain that Elijah was probably taken up by means of a tornado (page 727). However, he does a fair job at exposing the way many liberal theories have been made to look silly by archaeological finds in the 19th and 20th centuries. He takes a big part of the book on this and on things like sources. For example, of 37 pages for the book of Isaiah, 31 are on authorship, 1 on structure, 2 on textual criticism, virtual nothing on the message of the book. However, he does not deal with all books in a fixed pattern. Others fare better.I guess this book is ok for those who are aware of liberal attacks and need some assurance of the Bible as historical truth. For anyone looking for theological insights and understanding of what the old testament books are really about, this book is not it. Despite some justified criticism of von Rad, his two volumes on old testament theology do a far better job at that: seeOld Testament Theology (2 Volume Set).If the title or blurb better explained what this book is about I would have given another star or two."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","review":"If you are after a comprehensive study of thought of the Old Testament, then this is the perfect book. Though this book is 40 years old, it still remains highly recommended as one of the best sources for study.Harrison endeavours to evaluate all views of thought and weighs them by their merits. Harrison is honest and does not let his own view point skew the evidence, no matter where the evidence leads. This isn't to say that he doesn't put forth his views, but when he does it is merely supplementary.Harrison is faithful to a conservative view of the Old Testament, taking it at face value and justifying his position authoritatively and empirically. Though there have been many attempts at denigrating the historicity of the Old Testament, Harrison is convincing in its defence.If you want a comprehensive study of thought of the Old Testament, then there is none better."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","review":"This is an excellent, scholarly and comprehensive treatment of the OT. RK Harrison, the author, is apparently recognized by conservative and liberal thelolgians (possibly begrudgingly by the latter) for his precision and objectivity as a scholar.

This book is the best of its kind and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT","review":"R.K. Harrison was professor of Old Testament at Wycliffe College in Toronto when he wrote this volume in 1969. (There is a one-volume edition of 1325 pages; the page numbers below refer to the one-volume edition.)Harrison states in the Preface, \\"The present work is an attempt to evaluate the contents of the Old Testament and Apocrypha against the vast background of knowledge that is now available ... Considerable emphasis has been placed upon methodology in an endeavor to permit the Hebrew Scriptures to speak for themselves ... Much of what has passed for critical study in this field has in fact consisted largely of this application of a priori literary-critical theories, often in apparent isolation from methodological approaches involving archaeology, comparative religion ... All of these have a part to play in the proper understanding of the Scriptural record, and must now take their place beside literary and textual criticism as valid means to this end.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"What is immediately clear is that it is far from easy to associate any one of these deposits at all closely with the flood described in Genesis. Yet it is still a fact that Mesopotamia suffered from cataclysmic inundations at different periods in antiquity.\\" (Pg. 99)\\"The biblical narratives of the creation and fall of man are particularly good examples of material that partakes of the basic character of ancient Mesopotamian myth. In an even wider sense they reflect the concern of the oriental mind ... to safeguard by every possible means that which is most precious, and protect it from the profane by cloaking it in story form.\\" (Pg. 456)\\"(M)any of the supposed anachronisms of the Pentateuch can be explained on the basis of successive scribal revisions that had the effect of bringing the text up to date in certain areas.\\" (Pg. 524)\\"Even when a particular book was in substantially its final form long after the time of Moses, there would still be occasion for alterations or additions. This again is in full accord with the general literary traditions of the ancient Near East...\\" (Pg. 540)\\"the translation of Elijah ... was most probably accomplished by means of a tornado.\\" (Pg. 727)"},{"Title":"The Art and Science of Psychological Operations: Case Studies of Military Application (2 Vol. Set)","review":"These two volumes, compiled by the American Institute for Research, captured the development of military thinking on psychological operations up to the early 1970s. They supplemented and updated \\"A Psychological Warfare Casebook\\" edited by Morris Janowitz and William Daugherty in 1956.National security thinkers now use D-I-M-E as one of the shorthands for elements of national power (diplomatic, information, military, economic). \\"Psyops\\" by military commands is now integrated into the doctrines that relate to the \\"I\\" element, under the subset of information operations.These earlier volumes can help trace the intellectual lineage of these concepts. They include more than 200 articles and studies drawn from mass communications, anthropology, psychology, political science, social science, development, polling and surveys, history, and military affairs. Balancing theory and application, they also include translations and studies from China, the two Vietnams, North Korea, South Africa, and eastern Europe.Readers can make an excursion through some fascinating case studies from the past -- the \\"Chieu Hoi\\" program in Vietnam, the JUSPAO (Joint United States Public Affairs Office) in Saigon, leaflets and magazines, newsreels and films, defectors, and responses to the Communist \\"wars of national liberation,\\" for instance.The authors include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Edward G. Lansdale, Charles Moskos, Douglas Pike, I. William Zartman, Monte Bullard, Carl Berger, Martin F. Herz, Barry Fulton, and Barry Zorthian.Looking back to 1976, the \\"lanes\\" between psyops and civil affairs, civic action, community relations, public affairs, public information, public diplomacy, and other elements of soft power (a term not yet coined at the time) were not yet firmly drawn. The work of the old U.S. Information Agency, for instance, is frequently mentioned. So too are the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty. The employees of USIA and the radios would have disputed that they were part of \\"psyops.\\"Edited in the closing years of the Vietnam war, a certain malaise can be detected in the volumes. Many of the writers noted the reluctance of the United States to develop the information instruments of policy or to give meaningful priorities to such \\"cloud nine\\" stuff. Robert Delaney of the Naval War College, in the opening essay, traced this to America's \\"innocence,\\" idealism, and technological orientation. This reluctance has not gone away in the post-9/11 period, and echoes can be heard in our contemporary discussion of public diplomacy and the war of ideas.-30-"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"We love this book, and the edition with the extra cover will help to keep it around for many years to come.

Ferdinand the bull just isn't like the other bulls. He doesn't care to fight, and instead prefers to smell the flowers. The author makes Ferdinand a very sympathetic character, and we worry for him as he is dragged to the bullfights, and are relieved when all ends happily. My kids loved this story but you might have to think about whether you are ready to introduce the idea of bull fighting to your children."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I loved this book as a child, and the 7 year old i just read it to loved it too. It is funny and cute, even as it deftly explores the complex issue of being who you want to be, and not what others expect you to be in a way that connects with children. Beautiful artwork."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is a book I remember from my childhood and I think my granddaughter will enjoy reading it along with the audio CD. What a great adjunct to the book! I believe that there is too much \\"scheduled\\" time in a child's life these days, and Ferdinand tells us how we can also be happy just taking time to relax and smell the flowers. I like the part about the understanding mother too."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"A wonderful book about a bull who doesn't enjoy fighting or aspire to go to the bullfights in Madrid. Instead he is at peace with sitting in peace and sniffing the flowers. Without giving too much away, this essentially saves his life after a series of misunderstandings occur.Its a wonderful lesson for children to stay true to themselves, with a comforting addition that their mother (or parent) will always love them."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I have this story as part of a compilation of children's stories. There is a reason this is a classic- it's sweet. It encourages children to be who they truly are. If you have a quiet, shy child this is a perfect book."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This morning I had the privilege of reading aloud THE STORY OF FERDINAND by Munro Leaf to 320 of my elementary students. Although this book was written 63 years ago, its messages are timeless. In fact, I would argue Leaf's messages of non-violence, stillness, and contentment are even more important today. During a time of incredible busyness, turmoil, and worry, we can all take a page out of Ferdinand's story and just sit, be present, and observe the beauty that surrounds us all. I certainly appreciated this childhood favorite of mine on a whole new level after reading Eckart Tolle's books: A NEW EARTH andA New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual EnlightenmentGateways to Now (Inner Life Series)Dust off this classic, read it, be still, and be happy...like Ferdinand."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"One of my favorite books as a child, my children enjoyed it just as much."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Great story about a peaceful bull.

Still a great story for kids to enjoy -- and especially with their grandparents who knew it when."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"A classic story, but one that needs some explaining. After all, bullfights aren't really PC these days. If you try not to get too deep, it's still a nice story."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Although I find the character of Ferdinand endearing and worth emulating, I have mixed feelings about this story because it glosses over the otherwise horrific, inhumane sport of bullfighting. It bothers me while reading this to a child because, as an adult, I am well aware that the usual outcome of bull fights or even the display of passive, noncooperation posed by Ferdinand is not at all pleasant. In other words, in real life poor Ferdinand would never have made it back home alive!It is also contradictory for readers to express so much sentiment for a bull when in real life, bulls and cows are tortured in factory farms and brutally killed on a daily basis; they are treated just like objects instead of anything worth loving. On the other hand, connecting with Ferdinand may somehow or other raise sensitivity and affection toward them."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I ordered this for my kids some years ago. I was disappointed because I thought it would be a book version of Disney's Ferdinand the Bull in full color. I had such a book as a kid, and never forgot the pictures. I have since been able to resurrect the original cartoon on tape."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Upon reading this book, I found it to be very shocking and inappropriate for young children. My students thought it to be a \\"bad story.\\" They \\"did not like it because the men wanted to hurt Ferdinand. They wanted to keep sticking him with spears and a sword.\\" My students asked me to stop reading the story because they felt very sad."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I like this book, because it reminds me of myself. Just like Ferdinand, I'm more content to just stop and smell the flowers. A lot of kids are like Ferdinand too, and this is a good book for them to relate to."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Of course you may be familiar with the Disney cartoon, but the real story is definetely worth reading to your child. A young, gentle bull who loves the simple things is mistaken for a terrifying, awesome, crowd pleasing bull. He is brought to Madrid to fight the Matador. Read and see what happens! I love this sweet simple little tale. This story was written so long ago, but it still is appealing to children today. Next time you go for a drive &quot;in the country,&quot; look for Ferdinand with your children!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I recently became an elementary school teacher. I am often amazed that The Story of Ferdinand still delights and engages children's imaginations. Many of the children I have read this to were hearing the story for the first time and they seemed to love this book as much as I did when I was a youngster. Wish there were more very memorable books around.I would rate this book one of the very best children's books of all time."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"A lasting story.

All these years later, I bought it to share with my children, and they all in turn love it as well. It's a great book with many life lessons."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is a really good childrens book. I still remember it being read to me as a child years ago. This particular version is not color illustrated which many children may prefer, but the illustrations are very good. The story, for those not familar with Ferdinand, is about a big bull that is mistakenly considered wild and fierce but is really tame and gentle. Age's that will enjoy story the most will most likely be from 5 to 9."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I am 7 years old. I love this book because my dad jumps up off my bed when Ferdinand sits on the flower with the bee that stings him on the bottom. Another part I like is when Ferdinand sits in the middle of the stadium smelling the flowers in the ladies' hair. You should read this book if you like adventure. Everybody in my family liked this book. I think you will too."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I received this book from my Grandfather when I was little. It was his favorite story and he read it when he was a child, if that tells you how long it's been around. (At least since the 20s.) The concept that you must be who you are no matter what the circumstances coupled with the concept that appearances can be deceiving is something that every child should consider. I bought the books for my two sons and at the ages of 13 and 11, they still love the story."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is about Ferdinand who was a bull but didn't act very much like a mean, rough bull. The illustrations are in black and white, but they are quite funny (especially the men in the three funny hats). This is a classic story that I read growing up in the early sixties. It is still a good story despite it's age. Parents should read the classics in children's literature to their children. A must read ages 4-8."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I'd give this book 6 stars if I could. Ferdinand is such an adorable bull, you can't help but fall in love with him. The expression on his face when he gets stung by a bee is priceless. Written in the 1930s, this classic book is simply but beautifully illustrated with black line drawings. You would be really hard-pressed to come up with something negative about this book, other than it's possible some parents may object to the bull-fighting (although there is no violence actually depicted and no bullfight ever gets underway - Ferdinand just sits down in the middle of the bullring and refuses to co-operate - mesmerised instead by the ladies in the audience and the flowers in their hats! A wonderful addition to our childrens' book collection."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"A story my mother told me as a child and one all children should have read to them or read themselves...It teaches nonviolence"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"My aunt gave me this book for my first birthday. I probably started getting interested in it around 3 years old. I remember that I adored the gentleness of Ferdinand. He just liked to live quietly and peacefully.

It, too, will be read often and with great enthusiasm."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Ferdinand, a nice bull, has a run in with a bee. A tiny little bee... with a BIG sting! When Ferdinand gets stung, he acts the way we all envision bulls acting. Everyone thinks he could fight in the ring, but he is happiest smelling flowers.As a person who hates bees, and certainly did as a young boy, I can understand the reaction Ferdinand has. Youch!As much as I love the book, it does leave off the horrid reality about bullfighting, how bulls are tortured and killed. As a kids' book, maybe it shouldn't, but hopefully, children get fooled into thinking bullfighting is just a game. Hence, my rating is only four stars.Read it to your child, and explain what bullfighting it. At the very least, Ferdinand makes it clear he'd rather play in a meadow."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I ordered this book when I purchased &quot;Ping&quot; because it was rated 0 to 4 year olds. Stupid of me but I just read it to my two year old without first reviewing it. The description of bull fighting shocked me. I questions whether this book should be rated for 2 year olds.

It arrived and I read it to my daughter and realized I didn't remember it being so boring. The drawings are poor in the book. The story line talks about how the bulls are harmed.

Well, this book was only one of his many problems from childhood. First of all, it speaks of the violence brought on a bull in a bull-fight (not appropriate for young kids in my opinion). The worst part, however, is the ineptitude of Ferdinand. He is a big, strong bull not at all interested in being what he is. He is lazy and just wants to look at flowers. He is a waste.

I'm now buying it for presents for all two year olds I meet!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is the story of a little bull named Ferdinand who did not cavort and butt heads and bellow like the other little bulls but sat under his favorite cork tree. When the men came to select bulls for the honor of appearing in the great ring, he would have been passed over, had he not accidentally sat on a bee, after which he bellowed and charged and ran as no bull had before. And so off he went in a cart to Seville----and what happened next has engaged children for over 70 years.\\"Ferdinand the Bull\\" is thus old but in no way dated. It is a forever story for at least three reasons:--the story reads aloud beautifully--the illsutrations are vivid with personality and expression and detail including the marvelous individuation of the picadors marching into the ring--the tale itself has drama, excitement, and makes even more excitable little ones think about smelling the flowersA perfect gift for any child---actually for every child---and this edition is a splendid value, an almost exact reproduction even to the colors of the original. Worth every penny!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Like all great pieces of classical children's literature; and make no mistake, \`Ferdinand' is a classic by any definition of the term, ten people can simultaneously read the work and the same ten people, when finished, will come away with ten different lessons, and glean ten different bits of wisdom...all from the same story! There are so very many levels and angles this little story can be viewed from.....It should be remembered that this book was published at the eve of the horrible Spanish Civil War. It should also be remembered that it was published at the same time Earnest Hemingway was publishing his work addressing bullfighting and the ultra macho culture he expounded. Hemingway, in his own way was defining the qualities expected in all males and was actually quite successful at it as his writing influenced an entire generation in one way or another. As you read the story of Ferdinand you cannot help but wonder if the author, Munro Leaf and the illustrator, Robert Lawson had an agenda of their own. I personally feel they did - taking a shot at Hemingway not being the least. But of course that is pure speculation on my part and as I indicated above; others will come up with a different take after reading the book. This is good.The story of Ferdinand is pretty well known by this time. It is the tale of a bull that did not want to behave stereotypically as bulls are suppose to behave. He simply did not want to fight. As one reviewer in this forum has so well said, \\"Ferdinand is the kind of character that if they gave a war, he simply would not show up.\\" I liked that. And the key here is that despite of everything, Ferdinand stuck to his guns - his principles. Ferdinand was a pacifist to say the least. He followed his own drummer and did his own thing despite the pressures placed upon him to do other wise. Now I am not what you would call a pacifist by any means, but I most certainly respect those who are; those that don't just talk the talk, but walk the walk.No, this supposedly ferocious bull much preferred smelling flowers under a tree and thinking thoughts that peaceful bulls think.The illustrations in this book are sort of a work of genius. We have a case here were the author made the illustrator and the illustrator made the author...there is simply no other way to put it. The illustrations are in black and white - we are talking the book here, not the Disney film, and are quite clever. The picture of the cork tree with corks hanging on it is often used to illustrate the sneaky quirkiness of the artist, and rightfully so, but I find the presentation of the portrayal of the matadors hilarious preening and the wretched condition of the Banderilleros as the enter the ring on their exhausted horses speaking volumes as well as the portrayal of the proud Picadores that have broken lances (Adults will delight in the imagery here - the symbolism), and again, exhausted horses. (You must remember that on a personal basis, I am extremely anti bull fighting and supposedly cultural icon or not, a barbaric practice that should never have survived into the 19th century...but hey, that is just me).We of course, if you think about it, find that this work examines the way humans use animals and the way men, boy and indeed bulls are suppose to act. Is suppose, for me, the overriding message in this little work is that a person should \\"do their own thing\\" and not worry all that much over the expectations of others - i.e. our society; being an individual can often times be the right thing to do.There are good reasons why this book has stayed in continuous print since 1936 and is still a favorite among children and indeed, adults.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I purchased this book as a Valentine's Day gift for my 6 year old daughter. She instantly fell in love with the story and it's character. We have read it everynight since then. I remember my mother reading this story to me as a child and hope that this hard back book will be passed on to her childern. The hard back cover and sleeve that it came in for the 75th year anniversary were absolutely lovely. Thank you for bring back such a wonder children's classic."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is a beautiful edition of a book that my younger daughter loved when she was a child. Although she is now 25, she still loves it. A wonderful tale of a bull that doesn't want to follow in the footsteps of his bullfighting elders and friends, even though he is the biggest bull around. Ferdinand follows his heart, and follows it to a peaceful place that is very appealing in a society that often pushes younger children to follow the crowd. A timeless tale!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This book is more than sixty years old. I remember hearing it as a small child in the early sixties, and even then it sounded strangely old-fashioned to me, as if it came from some sweet, gentle world that had not existed for a long time. But as a child I passionately loved that world, and this book that evoked its gentleness, and years later, when I found out I was pregnant, the first thing I bought for my son was not a blanket or a crib or a stuffed animal, but a copy of Ferdinand. It was the thing I loved most from my own childhood. Seventeen years later, I still think my priorities were right. And that seventeen year old has a six year old sister, so the book is still in use.Ferdinand has been around so long, I assume everybody knows the story, but in case you don't, here goes: Ferdinand is a gentle little bull in Spain. The other little bulls love to fight and dream of being chosen for the bullfights in Madrid. But by mistake, Ferdinand is sent to fight. The only problem is, he will not fight.. They lead him into the bullring, but he just sits there, smelling the flowers in the women's hair, and in the end there is nothing the matadors can do but take him home.I suppose people have been reading this book to children for more than sixty years in part because of its pacifist message. In essence, Ferdinand is the one who would not come when they gave a war. But for me that is just a small part of its appeal. Robert Lawson's absolutely perfect illustrations show a world that is often mean and ugly (the stupid expressions on the faces of the men who come to choose the bulls are classics), or else petty and foolish (check out the fussy clothes and snooty expressions of the matadors), but Ferdinand, always true to himself, is oblivious to this world, and just goes on living his own life in his own way. In the end that quality is a force that nothing can alter.Reading Ferdinand always leaves me believing that goodness is a powerful, unshakeable force. That is a message I find very comforting lately."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"\\"Ferdinand\\" is one of the best-loved children's books of all time, and with good reason. This timeless tale of a little bull in Spain who doesn't mind being different from the rest of the herd strikes an instant chord in youngsters and oldsters alike. Ferdinand is a gentle creature who would rather sit around and smell the flowers than butt his way through life; but when he planks himself down one day on a bumblebee, he gets a jolt that propels him into the bullring in Madrid. The story is funny and endearing, and the illustrations are hilarious. Generations of preschoolers have loved this book, and it looks good for generations to come."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"My mother-in-law gave me her copy of this book (printed in 1938) when my oldest child was 4 or 5 years old and we just adored this story! In fact, she (my daughter) loved it so much she memorized it within months. I chose this book to read to her 2nd grade class and they, too, felt the magic of how the fierce bull loved to just sit and &quot;smell the flowers&quot;! I just sat down tonight to read it for the first time to my youngest child (5 years old) and he already knew how the story went. I asked him how he knew it and if his sister already read it to him, because I had not yet done so. He told me that nobody read it to him, that his sister (now 11 years old) already told him about it. He went on to explain every page to me before I even read it! Maybe it's because it's such a different subject for a children's book ( a bull, a tree, a bee and oh, those flowers!) or it could be because we don't have a great deal of access to bull fighting here in America...none the less, it's a story that stays with you, if only because of it's simplicity. Kind of refreshing."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I recently rediscovered this favorite book from my childhood (which was 40+ years ago now), and fell in love all over again. Now my 4 year old daughter and I both get to experience the exquisite pleasure of Ferdinand on a regular (i.e. nightly) basis. The gorgeous illustrations and simple, powerful story of the biggest bull on the farm who would rather \\"sit just quietly and smell the flowers\\", is as moving today as it was when it was written more than 50 years ago. And I cannot think of a more important lesson to teach our children today: that it is o.k. to be yourself, even when everyone else thinks you should be something else. This is a sweet, lovely story for children and adults alike, and is one of the few books I look forward to reading over and over again. Luckily, my daughter agrees."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I love Robert Lawson and I love Munroe Leaf, but ladies and gentlemen these two men are definitely less great unless paired together. In undoubtedly my favorite children's book from the 1930s (so sorry, \\"They Were Strong and Brave\\"), these two titans of the picture book world created the most adorable story to have ever involved cork trees, bulls, and sweet smelling flowers.Ferdinand is none too different from \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\". He may look fierce and strong, but underneath that hard exterior lies a bull that is perfectly content to just sit beneath his favorite cork tree and smell the flowers all day. Ferdinand was gentle even when young, and he has no desire to go needlessly ramming his head with the other bulls in the field. When some wonderfully illustrated men arrive to find a bull worthy of their bull-fighting arena, Ferdinand is accidentally selected as their choice. Once in the arena, however, Ferdinand proceeds to humiliate the matador and his cronies through simple peace-loving flower-smelling. In the end, Ferdinand is returned to his cork tree and the world is as it was.There's a definite pacifist feel behind the old Ferdinand tale. In what other story will you have a creature not fight back despite all provocations, only to win in the end? Moreover, a male character that prefers pretty sights and smells to violence and uber-masculinity. Lawson's pen and ink drawings expertly compliment Leaf's tale. Through them we see the high balconies of Spanish towns, and the serene fields where little bulls may play. I was especially amused by the cork tree, from which actual wine corks hang. I suspect many a child has subsequently believed for years that corks really do grow on the vine as Lawson displayed them. Lawson isn't above other humorous tweaking beyond that. On the front and end papers of the book is an image of children gawking at a ferocious picture of \\"angry\\" Ferdinand. The poster goes on to advertise treats at the bull fight including \\"hot dogos\\" and \\"chocolato\\". Apparently any word with an appropriate \\"o\\" tacked on the end is instantly Spanish.\\"Ferdinand\\" is the sweetest of the Leaf/Lawson tales. However you feel about the nature of violence (and about how it is almost required of the males of society) this is the quintessential story about being yourself. The angry over-masculine bulls may fight and brawl but peaceful Ferdinand is the one to outwit the men in the end."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This book has been one of my favorites, if not my favorite for years. I did not discover it until after I saw Disney's short of the story about 20 years ago. Disney's short was made in the 50s or 60s, I think. Ferdinand is the most endearing character and a great messege to tell children that they don't have to follow the crowd to be happy and we can break the mold and be peaceful and non-violent. This is only part of the greatness of this book...the illustration are the absolutely most wonderful illustrations. Robert Lawson is a genius of catching the most adorable expressions and humourus faces. My daughter (3yrs) LOVES this book too. WE HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This was one of my very favorite books as a child. Parents with young children would do well to read this book to them. It is the story of a young bull (Ferdinand) who learns to stay true to his own unique self. While all the other bulls all want to be mean and fierce, Ferdinand instead is a gentle and loving soul. Yet the situation comes where people try to force Ferdinand to comply. Ferdinand is taken to fight in the bull fights! Will he be faithful to himself, or will he go along with the crowds? Yes, there are deep morality questions and ethics here) Indeed, both parents and children will be touched by the timeless message of hope and strength that is Ferdinand. It truly is a book that children need to know and model."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Four words best discribe this wonderful book and they are peace, contentment, pacifist, and priorities. And in a day and age of school shootings I wonder what would happen if we made sure this book was read by all children and then discussed.It is a wonderful book for teaching that some creatures including some people are peaceful and do not need much less seek fights. That when we are &quot;stung&quot; we may get mad but that we do not need to take it to the next step where we hurt, harm or kill. That we all have tempers but that we also can learn to make wise choices and develop sound priorities.The book is interesting because it does teach something about the culture or history of bull fighting, as well as the fact that just because something has always been done doesn't mean it should or need continue.I would caution that this is a book that a parent/caregiver needs to not just read but also discuss. Children may have some serious questions about bull fighting and the whole kill and die aspect. Just because a book has a good ending etc doesn't mean that questions in the middle of the book are not still there, and need to be answered."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Originally published in 1936, this simple story of the pacifist bull still rings true for children and adults, as ferdinand refuses to fight even when he is chosen to face the matador in Madrid. Ferdinand would rather sit under a tree and smell the flowers, and his mom thinks that's just fine. this is a comforting story for kids who feel they don't fit in. the message is simple and direct, and makes for great discussions after reading. The original illustrations are quite charming as well."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Written in 1936 this beautiful story of Ferdinand, a gentle calf that grows into a very large but peace-loving bull has enchanted millions of people and continues to do so to this day.Robert Lawson of Rabbit Hill fame has done a great job with the black and white drawings of Ferdinand and his surroundings, filled with humorous details of the Spanish bull-fighting world.Monro Leaf's tale shows what happens when a bumble bee's sting brings Ferdinand, unexpectedly to the attention of the bull ring scouts.This book is always one of the first ones I buy for new babies among our family and friends. It's a true classic. Enjoy this sweet message about being yourself and make Ferdinand a friend for life."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I encountered \\"Ferdinand\\" as a child. I was fascinated by the illustrations, which took me to a far-away place and stimulated my imagination. But I was most impressed by the message of the story -- an encouragement to remain true to my own nature. That's a great lesson for kids, who are so vulnerable to pressure from peers and our culture. I am thankful that my parents provided this book. I have read and given copies of it to my kids and grandkids, and read the story in school to my grand-daughter's class.The Story of Ferdinand (Puffin Storytime)"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I am 44 years old and yesterday, at our Thanksgiving celebration at a relative's home, I came to read this wonderful book for the first time.

I will be reading this book to my 71 children, at the public school where I run an After School Program. This is a marvelous book and I recommed it to parents, teachers, educators and anyone else interested in planting seeds of peace into the hearts of others, specially children.

I received it within a few days of ordering it, and the book itself is of nice quality and should withstand the test of time! My daughter loves the book, and it does create a very definite sense of happiness and teaches a good lesson. It's about a bull named Ferdinand living in Spain who doesn't want to act like the other bulls by running around and butting heads. Ferdinand likes to sit under a cork tree and smell the flowers. By a funny accident, he is chosen to be a bull featured at the bull fights in Madrid, but he doesn't act the way they expect him to, and there is a nice ending. My only complaint (and the only reason I didn't give it five stars) are because of several lines in the book talking about sticking the bull with sharp objects to make him mad (\\"Picadores carrying long spikes to stick in the bull and make him madder\\"), and another line talking about how the Matador carries a sword to stick the bull last of all. My daughter has not asked questions about it yet, but it might upset some kids who understand what it is talking about. What I view as the violence and cruelty of bullfights is kept out of the book, and it has a happy ending and teaches a good lesson, so I would recommend it!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This was and still is my favourite children's book. I have read it to my children and have just ordered some new copies in preparation for my grandchildren as my old copy is looking very tattered by now. It is a heartwarming and inspiring story of the gentle little bull Ferdinand who loved to sit under the cork tree and smell the flowers more than anything else. The bull fight scenes are sensitively handled but if you are terribly politically correct it may be worth reading the book first before reading it to your children."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is a story that was new when Grandma and Grandpa were tykes. It is best read aloud with all of the fun that enunciation can bring to a story. I can still remember my mother reading it to me as a child.

I gave it to my daughter when she was about six and she remarked recently that out of all the many books she had as a child, that was the one she most remembered. She wanted a copy of it for her son, but had been unable to find it at local bookstores, so I ordered a copy from Amazon for her. The book was even more beautiful than we remembered. The prose is almost poetic and the black and white illustrations are entertaining. I've read that Munro Leaf was so inspired by the idea that he wrote the book in one sitting. The Story of Ferdinand is funny and contains a valuable lesson about the world trying to make you into something you aren't meant to be. Ferdinand the bull just loves to sit and smell the flowers, but is pressured to become a champion fighting bull. In the end, he remains true to himself. The closing lines of the book are so stunning you don't know whether to laugh or cry.

My 3 girls loved it, too. But then I was assigned to use Ferdinand as a literature book to teach English to Beginning Language Learners at a high school.

Recently I sent the book to my three year old grandson. For some reason, he was frightened by the innocuous picture on the cover, and his mother was unable to read it to him. She plans to try again later, but I'm not sure that this book is appropriate for the little guy. If the cover scares him, what will the pictures of bulls being tortured do to him!

This is the book Mrs. Tuohy (Bullock)reads to Mike. It describes Mike's character in comparison to Ferdinand's. I loved this book, because I have a daughter that reminds me of Ferdinand, also. Ferdinand is different from all the other bulls he grows up with. He is thoughtful and prone to sit quietly and smell the flowers under a cork tree. His mother is worried he doesn't get more involved with the other bulls in running, jumping and butting heads. But he is content to just sit in the shade and smell the flowers. Which is not a bad thing. In the end, when he is expected to fight in a bull fight, he decides it's not his thing and just sits and does nothing, but smell the flowers in the ladies' hair. He is taken back home to the country which makes him very happy. The audio recording on CD that came with this book is perfectly narrated. The narrator has an authentic Spanish accent and speaks with animation. The illustrations are black and white, but are very detailed and leaves much to the reader's imagination.

One day a group comes looking for the biggest toughest bull they can find. Ferdinand was going to do his usual thing of sitting under a tree and smelling flowers but he sits on a Bee. He gets stung and charges around like crazy and so they pick him.My girl doesn't like bees as she was stung by one. However, the look on Ferdinand's face made it funny for her.Ferdinand goes to the fights and simply sits in the middle of the ring and smells the scent from the flowers in women's hair. Nothing will make him fight and he angers, depresses and makes the matadors cry since they can't show off.He is returned to his field and quickly returns to sitting under his tree and smelling the flowers.It's a sweet story and I think I will be reading it for a long time."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Parents of young children are called upon to read a beloved book over, and over, and over again. Most children's books, if not dreary on the first read, certainly become dreary by the tenth or eleventh read. Not Ferdinand! Every time you read about Ferdinand's understanding mother (even though she was a cow)and every time you catch the expression on the bee's face just before Ferdinand chooses that fateful spot to sit...well, it's just magic.

The whole project was executed beautifully, from the story line to the artfully placed drawings that are detailed, evocative and humorous.

This book deserves more stars than just five."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I like this book a lot. It's the story of a bull who would rather stop and smell the flowers than do anything else, unlike the other bulls who spend their time snorting and jumping around. When he accidentally sits on a bumblebee he jumps around like crazy and is taken away to a bullfight where instead of fighting he sits down and admires the flowers worn in the hair of the pretty ladies in the crowd. This book does mention sticking swords into the bulls, so that may be a little disturbing for younger kids. I think that slightly older kids who are like Ferdinand will enjoy this classic story and will be able to relate to his laid back personality."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I had this book when I was little (now 43) and it is still wonderfull.

While I didn't like it all that much in first grade, I remembered it and read it to my daughter when she was in first grade. Ferdinand is a bull that is growing up in Spain, and his favorite thing to do is to sit around and smell the flowers. The other bulls are fierce and fight all the time, which prepares them for the bullfighting ring.Unfortunately, when the people arrive to select a bull for the next bullfighting exhibition, Ferdinand sits on a bee, which stings him and his gyrations appear to be anger and hostility. They select him, and transport him to the arena. When the moment of the fight comes, all of the men in the arena are afraid of Ferdinand, but he simply sits down and smells the flowers in the hats of the spectators. Nothing that they can do will get him angry, so they load him up and ship him back to the pasture where he came from.My daughter loved this book when I read it to her, asking me to read it several times. It is a nice story for children, although it does cover up the true brutality of bullfighting."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I was hesitant to buy this \\"75th Anniversary edition\\" because I was afraid it would have a yellow \\"75th\\" sticker on it.

This anniversary hardcover edition comes with a heavy duty sleeve, as thick as the book cover. The actual cover of the book (it has no jacket) looks just like the sleeve, minus the yellow \\"75th\\" sunburst.

Luckily, my parents kept us stocked not only in the current (late 70-80s) kids' books, but some of the older classics they read as kids themselves. Among my favorites were classics from the '30s, including Ferdinand. I love the way that Ferdinand knows what he wants - to not fight in the bullring like the other bulls, but to just sit peacefully and smell the flowers. He is not shaken by peer pressure or \\"authority figures\\" (the men who round him up to fight after they see him snort and stamp after being stung by a bee) to be other than who he is. And his mother - even though she is only a cow (so says the book!) - supports him in his gentle ways. I just love it! My son is only a toddler and he has his phases as far as what books he likes, but this one is one he comes back to every so often. And I love reading it to him. That is only enhanced by the fact that I studied in Spain one summer and have seen half-ruined towns in the Spanish countryside. I picture Ferdinand's pasture somewhere near one of those towns, long ago, when the towns were bustling. A wonderful book for the imagination - and possible theme discussions as a child gets older. Get this charming book!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I picked this up on a whim for my two daughters a week or so ago. We are going to Spain in July so I thought it might be nice to find a few Spanish-y stories to help set the scene and prep them for the upcoming experience. The only book that seemed to fit the bill on short notice was this one. My experience with this story is limited...I never read the book as a child but I did see the Disney short film and loved it.The hardback is lovely with a cloth binding that hearkens back to the children's books of my childhood (as opposed to the glossy, laminate books one frequently finds today). The story is sweet and perfectly paced -- great for preschoolers and early grades school kids. But the illustrations are what takes this book from good to great. They are detailed, nuanced, and accurate and they captivate my girls every time (that's pretty darned amazing considering they're in black and white). My oldest likes to lie in bed and pour over the pages, teasing out the details of the castles on the hills or the lace fans held by the Spanish ladies.All in all, this is a lovely book with a nice message and plenty to keep young boys and girls interested."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This book has been a favorite of mine when I was young and is now loved by my grandchildren. Great story and wonderful pictures."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"It is nice to read a book to my children that actually has a point to the story.

They all enjoy it, but I think it offers the most to the three-year-old with the particularly gentle nature. He doesn't say this directly, but I think it makes him feel that it's all right to be the one who prefers smelling the flowers to fighting the other bulls. A lovely, lovely book."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"We were watching the movie \\"The Blind Side\\" and Sandra Bullock mentioned reading this in the movie, and having a new Grandchild myself, I thought why not.

We sat down and read this together. I had to read it again after he was up and playing. This is a wonderful book with a very special message in it.

Wonderful addition to anyone's Library."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I had this book as a child and bought it for my grandaughter. She loved it also. Ferdinad is a differnt bull...likes flowers...walks to his own beat. The book was orginally published in 1936 but the illustrations are still entertaining, and the story makes a subtle statement of the importance of being true to yourself. Be your own bull!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is a very special book with a great story. I remember loving it as a child, and now my kids love it, too. It's about a sweet bull who doesn't have an interest in fighting, despite being named to one of the most prestigious bullfights in all of Spain. Fantastic."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I was glad to find this book. I had it when I was a little kid and now that my grandkids are learning to read, I want them to read this book too. It's just like the one I used to have."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Ferdinand is a mild-mannered Spanish bull who (unlike his peers) has no aspirations to be chosen for a big bullfight in Madrid. Instead, \\"he like[s] to sit just quietly and smell the flowers.\\" But one day, when five men come to his pasture to choose a bull for the bullfight, Ferdinand sits on a bee, provoking him to act so crazy that the men choose him for the next bullfight. When he arrives in the arena, he has to decide whether he will give in to the pressure to perform.The story is rendered in charming ink drawings and is exceptionally well written. The author makes gentle fun of the strutting bravado displayed by of the bullfight's participants, while Ferdinand's gentle response displays a unique kind of courage. Some parents will see this story as a treatise against the violence and cruelty of bullfights, while others will view it as an example of someone being true to himself. However you interpret it, this is an undeniably hilarious story that has been loved by children since its first publication in 1936.It is fairly accessible to older toddlers and will also be enjoyed by early readers. Since its original printing, a color version has become available, but some of the pictures are missing, and the blotchy quality obscures the detail in the ink drawings, so I prefer the black-and-white version."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"Bought the book for the head of our maintenance crew ... who's name is ... Ferdnand ... One of my favorites as a child and he had never heard of it or read it ... the book was in perfect condition and arrived promptly and well packaged.

Well, Ferdinad was that book for me. It was one of the first books I read by myself. I first fell in love with this book back in the 1970's. I was suprised to learn that it was written in 1936 but propbably should not have been. It is truely a classic in children's lit.I'm sure your children will love it."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I will remember this book because he didn't figth.Ferdinands trait is nice because he didn't hurt anyone."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"The Story of Ferdinand is a fun story about a bull who refuses to fight.

By the way I am a woman, so suitable for both sexes."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This was one of my most favorite books when I was a child. Munro Leaf is a superb artist with a humorous eye. His story carries a subtle message against violence.I bought \\"Ferdinand\\" so I could read it again (twice!) and sent it to one of my great nephews as a Christmas gift."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This is an enchanting and timeless tale, and is everything a children's book should be. The message is not simply one of peace and commitment to an ideal, but also one of basic karma, existentialist philosophy of choice and responsibility, and the need for all to follow the Golden Rule.The Story of Ferdinand lets children know it is okay to stay true to their characters, and will encourage them to think their way out of situations, rather than muscle their way out. Ferdinand's peaceful and contented nature is something all human beings should all aspire to.Having been stung by many bees in my youth, mainly while traipsing barefoot through clover and accidentally stepping on them, I have great sympathy for our hero and the situation he finds himself in. The realization that even small events and actions can have a tremendous impact on our lives, and everything else that surrounds us in this world, is beautifully presented in this story. How Ferdinand chooses to deal with his plight at being taken away to fight is, of course, the heart and significance of this tale. His choice of poetic action is a perfect lesson in morality and provides the lasting appeal for this book.I recommend this classic for all ages and peoples, especially in our troubled times. It has a wonderful philosophy of life message; and even if readers choose not to apply the lesson to real life, the charming tale of Ferdinand is worth reading simply for its power to delight and entertain.J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I gave 75th Anniversary edition of The Story of Ferdinand the Bull to my 80 year old mother as a Christmas gift.

Hurray for those of us who choose to be ourselves and live our authentic lives the way we wish not the way society wishes upon us. And even a bigger HURRAY for those who read this book to your children and instil in them the true meaning of this story - in two words \\"BE YOURSELF\\" This story is funny, poignant, and beautifully illustrated with real art not computer generated art like the majority of modern picture books.

Ferdinand you are the man, I mean you are the Bull! !"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"The Story of Ferdinand, by Munro LeafThis book was in my parents' house when I was growing up; it was also in my house as I raised my children and watched my grandchildren grow; I have recently purchased a copy from Amazon to have on hand for the great-grandchildren. Not only does the story relate Ferdinand's preference for a peaceful life in the country rather than the boisterous sport of bull-fighting... the story supports the need for each individual to find his or her own life style. Robert Lawson's drawings marvelously convey the sensibilities of all the characters."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I ordered this book for a friend and read it myself first. I had only seen the disney cartoon before. The story was the same, and even some of the drawings were similar to the cartoon.

After reading the book I think disney did a great job turning it into a cartoon that stays close to the book."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I adore this book, my Spanish teacher in Buenos Aires introduced me to this wonderful gentle tale, I used to read it to my son, and even now I prefer reading it in Spanish, to my ears it sounds better.

Then I spent six months in Andalucia, Spain and discovered this book is an accurate representation of it. The illustrations actually appear to be Spain from Madrid to Andalucia, especially the Frontera, including Ronda and Vejer de la Frontera or Arcos de la Frontera.On top of that, the story of Ferdinand is about being who you are, and being at peace with yourself - whether it conforms to society's expectations or not. Subtly, and well, done.Beautiful pictures, beautiful story, peaceful theme. What more can you ask, whether you are an innocent child or a world-weary adult?Worth buying and sharing with someone you love."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"A charming story with drawings of real artistry and taste. I had this book as a child and wanted it for my children.Plenty of other reviews rightly praise the book so I will simply say that, yes, of course, it's a five-star childrens' book.One further thing needs praising, however: the quality of the actual book. This does the contents honour: first class paper and a lovely binding make the book an even more worthwhile purchase. It's wonderful that one can still buy things of such quality."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I was given The Story of Ferdinand for Christmas in about 1950, when I was six. Over fifty years later, I still enjoy it more than any other children's book I know. I'm writing this after ordering a copy for my granddaughter. There is not a word out of place in the story. Each page makes you smile (and any child between the ages of five and a hundred) and each has a perfect pen drawing that adds to the fun. I also use the book with my young-teenager students in their second year of learning English. I find they understand it and enjoy it and even learn it by heart. Like many millions of his fans, I am sure that Ferdinand is \\"still sitting there under his favourite cork tree smelling the flowers.\\""},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"When I was a little girl, I would request this book constantly.

He is completely uninterested in fighting and when the local bullfighters come out the field to find fighting bulls, they ignore Ferdinand....until Ferdinand is stung by a bee and puts on a show that impresses the matadors. Ferdinand is taken to the arena for a bullfight; however, he refuses to fight and is returned to the field. The matadors have all the gory swords which are not used in the book. My 3 year old son wanted to know why there were swords which presented an interesting dilemma. In my opinion, this book is not for children who are younger than 3. As stated above, 3 year olds need a lot of careful explanation about the story. They do not need to know why and how the swords are used. The violence of the bullfight is not central to this story. Ferndinand's character and his refusal to fight is.

Ferdinand the Bull, the peaceful bovine, who's content with just smelling the flowers under Spain's cork trees (doing his &quot;own thing&quot;), in spite of the pressure of his peers to be a ferocious fighting bull......is an inspiring way to share with your children how great it is to be DIFFERENT. That you can be anything you want in life and not to let anyone tell you otherwise. This was my favorite book as a child, it inspired me creatively and I've lived by it's simple message: BE who you ARE."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child, and is now my two-year-old's favorite story. While bullfighting may seem to be an inappropriate topic for a toddler, the message of the story is that Ferdinand does not want to fight and that's just fine. The best aspect of the book, however, are the pictures and the wonderful expressions of all the characters, from the ladies with flowers in ther hair to poor Ferdinand after he is stung by the bee. This story is great for all ages."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I have my father's copy which is now over 65 years old...and to this day that picture of Ferninand getting stung by a bee on his bum never fails to make me guffaw. I ordered a copy for a friend with a little boy about 5 years old, and he absolutely loves it. The whole project was executed beautifully, from the story line to the artfully placed drawings that are detailed, evocative and humorous. Ferninand is from another time -- it's about self-discovery, the deception of appearances, acceptance, and sitting under that cork tree just smelling the flowers. This book deserves more stars than just five."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF FERDINAND","review":"I like this book a lot. It's the story of a bull who would rather stop and smell the flowers than do anything else, unlike the other bulls who spend their time snorting and jumping around. When he accidentally sits on a bumblebee he jumps around like crazy and is taken away to a bullfight where instead of fighting he sits down and admires the flowers worn in the hair of the pretty ladies in the crowd. This book does mention sticking swords into the bulls, so that may be a little disturbing for younger kids. I think that slightly older kids who are like Ferdinand will enjoy this classic story and will be able to relate to his laid back personality."},{"Title":"The Cars Henry Ford Built: A 75th Anniversary Tribute to America's Most Remembered Automobiles","review":"As a fan of Henry Ford I found this book to be well written with very good colour photos of all his cars."},{"Title":"All Wrapped Up!: Groovy Gift Wrap of the 1960s","review":"This book will bring back so many memories.

I have to say, as an artist, I ripped-off a couple of the cool ideas I found on the pages of this book! The Christmas section if wonderful and the animal section is ultra hip with a lot of retro creatures to conjur up a few smiles. Lots of beautiful patterns in the flower power section and the masculine section is a laugh out loud!

For those of us who truly relish images/graphics/design styles from our past -- feed your brain with THIS book and feel your dopamine and serotonin levels spill all over themselves as you take that trip down memory lane into Christmases, birthdays, and baby/bridal showers past!

Instead of focusing strictly on physical changes, it touches on issues that affect us, both men and women in midlife, in a larger sense: the search for wholeness, losses and death, continuing growth strategies, and relationships. It then goes on to give us techniques for enriching our lives that include dreamwork, creativity, and spirituality.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in making the second half of their life as rich as or richer than the first half. Too often the focus at this time of life is on our losses--physical changes, death of friends and family members, role changes, and career stagnation.

She speaks eloquently and articulates the personal/case exemplar histories with the theory and reality of the awakening that is potential at midlife. I have been so effected by her work that I have purchased 15 or 20 copies (I am losing track) and regularly give the book to persons in my life or whom I cross paths with. That action puts my money where my mouth is.This book speaks volumes and has truth for the taking. I am in the midst of my own awakening and this book is a marvelous travel guide.

Describing it as the emergence of our \`unlived selves', he suggests that it's built into the structure of the Self, and is a unique opportunity for growth. As carefully crafted public masks crumble as our \`shadow' - beliefs and behaviors repressed through social conditioning - seek release and authentic expression.The poet Robert Bly who wroteA Little Book on the Human Shadow, notes that we spend half our lives putting parts of ourselves into the shadow and the other half trying to take them out again. Its no surprise that lives built on false foundations can dramatically upset our balance!Midlife still catches most of people by surprise, and is often misdiagnosed and misjudged. Therapists who fail to recognize its complexity may treat it as depression with Prozac, without understanding it as a necessary part of the journey to individual growth. This book offers a holistic viewpoint of midlife as a search for wholeness, and includes exercises for ways to give unexpressed parts of yourself a voice.The good news is that midlife requires only three things of us: integrity, trust, and courage. A bite-sized prescription of how to navigate the passage smoothly might be summed up as: Act in alignment with your insights."},{"Title":"Awakening at Midlife","review":"A mixture of Jungian psychology, ancient wisdom and common sense, Awakening at Midlife is simply an incredible resource in a very difficult time.

MacDonald is also sometimes known as 'Hurricane'; this title although more bland, probably gives a better idea of what the book is about. The title 'Murder in the Wind' makes the novel sound like the story is a murder mystery, or a crime story, but really the novel is at heart a disaster story.Probably one of the earliest examples of the genre.MacDonald tells the story of a dozen people stuck in an abandoned house during a powerful hurricane. As with all classic disaster stories for the first part of the story we are given the background of the principal characters, there is a family, a newlywed couple, a pair of businessmen, a recent widow, a counterintellegence agent, and two escaped prisoners. Then the storm comes and the reader begins to wonder who will live and who will die."},{"Title":"Murder in the wind (Dell first edition)","review":"Murder in the Wind by John D. MacDonald is a well written story of survival.It's about a diverse group of people forced by circumstance to seek shelter in a rickety, abandoned house a couple miles from Florida's Rte. 19. A menacing hurricane has brought high winds and flooding that bring the very real and imminent threat of death to all those unfortunate enough to be trapped in its destructive path.MacDonald takes plenty of time and care in introducing the cast of characters. There's a married couple traveling with two small children, a young widow traveling alone, two businessmen on their way to Georgia to try to salvage a real estate deal gone bad and a number of others.Each and every one of these characters is developed to the fullest. They are all quite believable and many of them display surprising aspects to their personae as the crises at hand challenges them.Murder in the Wind should be required reading for aspiring writers who want to learn how to make their characters come alive.

The only reason I can figure for no sequel was the soundtrack that was apparently very heavily influenced by Jaws.The book is a great supernatural horror tale. There are some differences from the movie (most notably the ending in the book is very bleak) and the book is more definitive about the driver.Since it's unlikely this will ever make it to Kindle, you'll probably have to pick up a used copy at your favorite used book shop or from one of the sellers here.If you enjoy supernatural horror and can get a copy at a reasonable price, I'd recommend this one."},{"Title":"High on Rebellion: Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City","review":"Anyone interested in the NYC rock'n'roll scene of the 1960's-'70's should get this book. Warhol's Superstars, the Velvets, Nico, Patti Smith, and so many more all have their place in here! Mickey Ruskin, the owner of Max's, pretty much kept alive 99% of the cities \\"starving artists\\" during those times! A lot of popular musicians got their start at Max's, from Bruce Springsteen to Debbie Harry (a former Max's waitress!). If you want to learn more about the \\"back room\\" at Max's and all the characters who hung out there, get this book! Lots of entertaining anecdotes from so many different scenesters! Most of these people lived on the edge! Other books I would recommend are \\"Man Enough To Be a Woman\\" by Jayne County and \\"Rebel Heart\\" by Bebe Buell (they were regulars at Max's as well)!!!"},{"Title":"High on Rebellion: Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City","review":"Yvonne Sewall-Ruskin's &quot;High on Rebellion&quot; is a wonderful recreation of Max's era (1965 thru 1981). Filled with hundreds of photographs (by Leee Black Childers, Anton Perich, Billy Name and others) and hundreds of interview quotes, reading it is like a multimedia experience - as exciting as a night in Max's infamous backroom! For those of us lucky enough to have been there, it is a trip back to the center of the maelstrom... Max's was New York's high energy intersection of the art and music world, where up and coming young ones could brush elbows with Warhol, Patti Smith, Bowie, the NY Dolls, et al. Beautifully designed, this book will be enjoyed by anyone interested in the artists, musicians and popular culture of the late sixties and the 1970's. It really is shocking to realize how many young talents succumbed to the excesses of that time, still the book created in me a longing to go back there again! Thanks for a wonderful tribute, Yvonne!"},{"Title":"High on Rebellion: Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City","review":"People I haven't thought about in decades! This book documents a time before New York became a city of yuppies and bankers. The bohemian, the artistic, the experimental and the truly outrageous ruled the night and you could still find a cheap, downtown apartment to permit this kind of lifestyle. Mickey and his red socks (to match the tablecloths?) provided a venue for both the talented and the brain-damaged. A real &quot;coffee table&quot; book for those of us who survived. Thanks Yvonne!"},{"Title":"High on Rebellion: Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City","review":"This book was great, excellent pictures and a great tell all of the time. Nothing was held back from this oral history, very detailed and fun.

Even though I only came to New York about three years ago, I already knew the look of that building from photos. Patti Smith said that when she saw the deli that has taken over there, she cried. I found it sad myself and never even went to Max's. Thanks to this fascinating, touching, and sometimes terrifying book, I feel that I got a small taste of what it must have been like. I do realize, however, that &quot;you really had to be there&quot;. Of course, if I had been, I might not be here now. Max's was probably way too fast for a guy like me to handle. I might look back fondly like some of the people in this book or I might have jumped off a building like Andrea Feldman. Pick this book up for a heartfelt examination of what was truly a crossroads for pop culture--a place where the only poeple who felt like freaks were the ones who weren't."},{"Title":"High on Rebellion: Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City","review":"HIGH ON REBELLION is many things.We are at a seance of NYC, 1960s underground ground-zero - people, time, and place long gone.We gain a greater understanding of the minds of many of our era's great artists - performing, literary, and graphic. HIGH ON REBELLION seats us at a table with Andy Warhol, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Robert Rauschenberg, John Chamberlain, Warren Finnerty, Dennis Hopper, Andy Hoffman, Ed Koch, William Burroughs, Diane Arbus, Tom Baker, James Baldwin, Truman Capote, Jackie Curtis, Candy Darling, Divine, Eric Emerson, Brian Epstein, Andrea Feldman, Judy Garland, Cary Grant, Al Grossman, Jimi Hendrix, Freddy Herko, Eva Hesse, Peter HuJar, Jacob Javits, Brian Jones, Janis Joplin, Bill King, John Lennon, Charles Ludlam, Bob Marley, Jim Morrison, Tiger Morse, Barnett Newman, Nico, Lillion Roxon, Robert Scull, Edie Sedgwick, Robert Smithson, Tinkerbelle, Nell Williams, Tennessee Williams and on and on andon.Even if with nothing more than this, HIGH ON REBELLION stands as an important historical and literary work in the tradition of Hemingway's A MOVEABLE FEAST. Clearly Mickey Ruskin, the late proprietor of the Rock Club, MAX'S KANSAS CITY, was the Gertrude Stein of New York City.But we get a lot more. Here we've got the tale of those who sowed the wind - from which we are now reaping the whirlwind. Yvonne-Sewall Ruskin's HIGH ON REBELLION shows how MAX'S KANSAS CITY was the cauldron where the artists-witches called up today's society from the void.That you are reading this is the underline. Yes, with the Internet, we DO all have &quot;fifteen minutes of fame&quot; available.

If you try to improve piecemeal (as so many have), the results will be minor improvement. It is only when you get all five pillars in alignment that you start to get dramatically better results. Also, his specific advice makes so much sense: Organizations need to get a clearer picture of what constitutes quality in their product or service; they need to organize the work process with small teams as much as possible; they need to provide much more training, from the CEO on down; they need to provide clear feedback on how well the organization is doing (&quot;scoreboarding&quot;); etc. One other reviewer is right: Now that I have read this book, I find myself looking around for evidence of TQM practices by the employees every time I interact with an organization.

Not so much a book about TQM, but more about what separates great organisations from those which are simply &quot;OK&quot;. There are so many books at the moment seeking to answer this question - this one actually does (but may well be missed by those looking for it because of its title).Written by someone who has actually &quot;been there, done that&quot;. Unfortunately because Bill Creech was not an academic (only a former four star general!) he does spend more time than necessary establishing his credentials. It is also four years old and this shows in the examples it uses.Nevertheless, it is one of those books whose ideas will stay with you.

There are some spots where it becomes a bit wordy, but the nuggets of knowledge in between are worth every page."},{"Title":"The Five Pillars of TQM: How to Make Total Quality Management Work for You (Truman Talley)","review":"One of the unique qualities of this &quot;Five Pillars&quot; book is that it covers in detail the contributions of all the early &quot;quality pioneers&quot;--including Juran, Deming, Feigenbaum, and Crosby. It also covers the works of others who have contributed to our knowledge on &quot;management&quot; matters writ large--not just the far more narrowly focused &quot;quality control&quot; literature. For example, the works of Drucker, Iacocca, and the like are also covered and blended with those of the quality pioneers. The &quot;Five Pillars&quot; praises Deming for what he contributed to the quality movement, but also places his contributions in their needed perspective for those seeking real and not superficial results. Accordingly, it is not suprising that one Balaji S. Reddi from Pune, Maharashtra, India would not like the book. It will be noted that Balaji S. Reddie is an electrical engineer who specializes in teaching the &quot;Deming Way.&quot; In fact his e-mail address places him at &quot;DemingIndia.org.&quot; Within the pages of the &quot;Five Pillars of TQM&quot; the prediction is made that the book will draw flak from those who have turned Deming into &quot;The Man Who Discovered Quality&quot; and the &quot;patron saint&quot; of quality management. It took a long time for the flak to arrive, and then all the way from India! In fact, a deciple of Walter Shewhart of the Bell Laboratories along with Joseph Juran, W. Edwards Deming made contributions of the &quot;SPC&quot; and &quot;SQC&quot; variety of &quot;QM&quot; but provided false and irrelevant guidance on most of the broader management issues. &quot;TQM&quot;--a term invented by General Bill Creech--is likened as &quot;Total&quot; because its reach is far broader than a set of quality control tools--and the &quot;Five Pillars&quot; book says that in an unambiguous fashion. (&quot;Process&quot; being but one of the five pillars upon which success is built.) What is taught at the DemingIndia organization is unknown to this reviwer, but according to Balaji S. Reddie's reaction it is certainly not the broad based approach to &quot;quality management&quot; that the Bill Creech book is all about.

He did it through the application of the basic canons he developed and so eloquently describes in his book, The Five Pillars of TQM. His book is the textbook we use for our leadership and management course that I developed and teach for engineering seniors and graduate students at The University of Oklahoma. General Creech's approach to management has become the benchmark by which we measure every case we study. The student's analyses of problems in our case studies always ask, \\"What would General Creech do\\"? Two years ago when we brought in a new Dean of the College of Engineering, he launched a change program toward a new vision and new goals. General Creech's book, The Five Pillars of TQM became every Department Chair's guide for achieving the new vision and goals. Additionally, for the past two years, faculty and staff from colleges and staff agencies across the campus of the University of Oklahoma have been lining up for our series of leadership seminars using General Creech's Five Pillars as the text.The way General Creech got everybody involved and the way he created leaders at every level during his turnaround of Tactical Air Command allowed him to take full advantage of the vast human resources and ingenuity in his huge organization. His leadership of this monumental effort caught on like a religious revival. Everybody wanted to be a part of this winning organization-the largest in the Air Force. When the leaders of government and industry took notice, TAC became the standard of excellence for the entire Department of Defense. General Creech's principles work in every type and size of organization-military units; large corporations; small start-up businesses; universities; not-for-profit foundations; everything! If every organization adopted General Creech's people-centered, common sense, five-pillar approach to management, the results could be the most dramatic increase in productivity we have seen in modern time.When General Creech retired from the Air Force, he applied his Five Pillars approach to the corporate world where he is in great demand as a consultant. He is a regular guest lecturer at the University of Oklahoma where he draws large audiences of converts to his management principles. If you want your organization to succeed in the competitive world economy, The Five Pillars of TQM can show you the way to make it happen.Jerry D.

As to the negative reviews on this site, it seems that people have problems with organizations that did not implement the methods fully, or fell back into the management styles that Creech warned against.Bottom line, anyone interested in management would do well to learn from the book's philosophy of responsibility for the product at all levels."},{"Title":"The Five Pillars of TQM: How to Make Total Quality Management Work for You (Truman Talley)","review":"I have done a tremendous amount of reading on TQM and in my opinion this book covers it best.

Creech, a former Air Force four-star general and now valued industry consultant, has served on ten corporate boards of directors and worked with five national speaking bureaus. His management philosophy, while mindful that most organizations are not democracies, is essentially a variation on the golden rule embodying basic decency toward others as a core unifying theme. Best summarized as empowerment with accountability, it is rooted in a recognition that loyalty is a two-way street and that an organization can only be as successful as those at the bottom are willing to make it. Among the many insights to be gleaned from this informed and empathetic book are the virtues of managing by walking around rather than by hunkering down in a mahogany-row fortress, unburdening those who want to get things done by lifting the overlay of rules and kibitzers from their backs, and recognizing that what ultimately determines organizational success is what goes on at the front, not on mahogany row. These principles, which Creech first pioneered during his tenure as commander of the Air Force's Tactical Air Command from 1978 to 1984, are now being reapplied by the current Air Force chief, who recently included Five Pillars on his recommended reading list for all Air Force officers. Yet Creech's principles of TQM (for &quot;total quality management&quot;--a term and construct he invented) transcend service applicability and have been amply proven in the corporate world as well. His idea of how a top-flight organization should be run resonates implicitly with how any responsible and motivated worker would like to be treated by his superiors. Such notions as the indispensability of mutual trust and respect; the power of inclusion rather than exclusion; the vast difference in effectiveness between decreeing and persuading; and the central role of pride as a motivator are part and parcel of Creech's enlightened approach to effective leadership.

Anyone who reads this book should be able to identify themselves with at least one of the characters!"},{"Title":"A Measure of Madness: A Novel","review":"I've read all of Merrick's works and agree that he is the Harold Robbins of gay literature - that is, he's not going to enter the halls of the monuments of world literature, but they are fun and entertaining. This one has a bit more sex than his other works, but presents an interesting look at the life of a gay man and how he got to the point where he is. He has escaped to a Greek island only to fall in love again - he seems to have a way of doing that. If you enjoy a good story with a fair amount of sex thrown in, you will really like this one."},{"Title":"A Measure of Madness: A Novel","review":"I can't particularly say that I hate this book but neither will I say that I like it, to put it mildly. If ever, I like the characters in the book for their realism especially Manoli and Phil. Sadly, I do know a couple of Dons, Georges, Phils, and even Manolis.So why I don't especially like this book? Well, it's quite simple, everything about the book is true. There's no are no perfect gay relationships; gay guys are promiscuous; hustlers can do fall in love; straight guy can fall in love with another guy; gay guys are always into anything that's &quot;big&quot;; Falling in love in a foreign country; old gay guys are into hustlers..... I can go on and on about this but would rather not. What really bothered me was the fact that Phil left Manoli when Manoli needs him the most. I think it was an easy way out for Phil. Supposedly Phil was able to mature after his run-in with Manoli, living in Crete and meeting the various colorful people there, but in the long run, what did he actually learn? Nothing. Hell, he could have met more colorful people here in New York. For somebody who's living in New York, Phil's character sure is so not New York except the &quot;sluttiness&quot;.I purchased five more books by this author. I am now praying that these books are not like this one."},{"Title":"William: HRH Prince William of Wales","review":"The only redeeming quality about this book is that it's filled with pictures. However, they aren't necessarily GOOD pictures. Most of them you've probably seen a million times before. As evidenced on the front cover, a lot of the pictures are in black and white (or brown and white) and sometimes with added elements of color in themIf your looking for a sensational expose' about the prince's life then this book is NOT for you. Peter Archer pretty much plays it safe and sticks to verfiable facts. However, if you just want a straight biography about the prince without a lot of the fluff that other books often give then I suggest you buy this book at the cheapest price you can find."},{"Title":"William: HRH Prince William of Wales","review":"Don't get this book for the actual bio...there isn't anything in there you couldn't find (with a little patience) on the net. But the pictures are gorgeous; and William is really easy on the eyes lol..."},{"Title":"William: HRH Prince William of Wales","review":"I enjoy all things about the Royal Family however this book tends to delve more into what happened with Charles and Diana and not about William there are some wonderful pictures but i lost interest after the third chapter and gave it to my local library.William : HRH Prince William of Wales"},{"Title":"Self-Raised or From the Depths","review":"Mrs. E.D.E.N. Southworth is an author worth reading! I purchased first book in this series, Ishmael, as a hardcover and found that when I finished it that I had to have the sequel, Self-Raised! I found it on Kindle at a very affordable price--I think it was less than $2--and was able to read it immediately. It was as good as the first book; definitely a good series, even thought it was written in the 1800s. It is very easy to read and if you have a Kindle, you can look up any words that you don't understand, any terms used from that time. Some of the hardbacks have these words defined at the bottom of the page, esp. if they are published by Lamplight. Encouraging fiction!"},{"Title":"Self-Raised or From the Depths","review":"Received this book in great shape and well within the delivery date.
