It is, however, a more 'realistic' 'happily ever after', which suits the book well, and which I particularly liked.The only thing that annoyed me just a little was the position that Card seemed to take on religion (it doesn't matter) and the Orthodox Church (which he doesn't seem to think too highly of, although it plays quite a role in the book.) Coming from where I am, this should perhaps bug me more, but it wasn't too bad, and it's nice to read a 'fun' book from time to time."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This was a good variation on Sleeping Beauty and was an entertaining read, I had a hard time putting it down until I finished it, but at the end it kind of awkwardly jumped to a happily ever after ending."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This books asks you to believe that magic is real, that Baba Yaga was a part of Russian lore, and that Sleeping Beauty was really a Russian pricess named Katerina that waited 1000 years for a former Russian named Ivan to kiss, awaken and save by promising... But, that would give the start of the story away. If you can suspend your disbelief, you too will enjoy this tale. You will sympathize with Ivan, and find that you too believe."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Enchanted is the story of Ivan, a modern day language scholar and Katerina, a princess from a long forgotten kingdom in what is now present day Ukraine. Ivan finds the enchanted Katerina in ageless sleep being guarded by a giant Bear. Ivan wakens the princess with a kiss and then hastily promises to marry Katerina as the flee the angry bear. Ivan and Katerina cross a time bridge into Katerina's world and that's where any similarities with the classic fairy tale, Sleeping Beauty, end. Ivan is thrust into a world and culture that is unknown to him. Katerina is less than impressed with her rescuer and finds his strange ways unmanly. From this point on our couple engage in constant bickering that is neither entertaining or witty. Ivan comes off as whiny and Katerina as immature and mean spirited. What should be a time of growing for Ivan, as he learns the ways of Katerina's people, and Katerina,as she ponders the fact that he continues to try and win her affections, turns into a time of Ivan whining to get back home and Katerina avoiding Ivan or berating him. I found very little to like about either one of them.In order to escape the witch, Baba Yaga, Ivan and Katerina cross over the time bridge into modern day Ukraine and then the United States. Now it is Katerina's turn to play odd man out and the reader gets to witness her charmless cultural bumbles. Ultimately Ivan and Katerina's story never seems believable. I could not understand why Ivan fell in love with her despite her constant mean spited treatment of him. Like wise I never found the \\"magic moment\\" where Katerina found anything lovable about Ivan. In addition supporting characters fail to add depth to the story. Even the wicked witch Baba Yaga failed to impress. She reminded me of the witch in Hansel and Gretel running around and cackling in suburban America. Ivan's modern day fiance is so shallow and one dimensional she's just begging to be dumped for the super beautiful Katerina.Finally, Card's attempt to blend Ukrainian lore and history with a modern day fairy tale is disjointed and uneven. I often felt like one minute I was reading a book called \\"Enchanted\\" and then the next a book on obscure Slavic history and legend.In the end incomplete shallow characters make for a dull and irritating read."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"If I was looking for a book to read and I heard someone say, \\"Old Ideas\\", I would most likely not wish to read it. However, Orson Scot Card easily uses old ideas as if they never were, and in fact this book's premise is that those old ideas only exist because of this book's new ideas. Yes, this is the story of Sleeping Beauty, and of Baga Yaga and of so many more fairy tales. But, this is also a story you have never heard before, the true story of those fairy tales. It is this that makes Enchantment great; you think you know the characters, but you don't; you think you know the story, but you don't; however, do not fear this book will teach you them.If you are looking for a book to read this book has romance with conflict (not overwhelming grief), magic (not to little or too much), and it is great for younger readers (16-30 years of age), however, I feel some older readers might not identify.This book has a good ending, a comment I only make because I feel most books do not. It seems popular for storytellers to end with a bittersweet conclusion, not card he ends his books well. Enchantment ends with a touch of reality, but an overall good feeling in the readers gut and maybe even their eyes.If you are wondering if you should get it, do so, it is one of my favorite."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"The first OSC book I read was Treason. After falling head over hills in love with it (currently on my 10th copy of the book - they keep disappearing), I was pushed to move on to the Ender's Quartet. I loved his style and the stories he drew in my mind, and when I read the back cover of Enchantment, I admit I was sceptical. It did not seem to fall into the same \\"sci-fi\\" category as the following books, but I figured I would give it a try.I must say, after reading Enchantment, I was so excited that OSC was not only brilliant at \\"sci-fi\\", but equally brilliant with a more fantasy fiction medium as well. I actually went on to read the entire Alvin Maker series and am here today to order myself a copy of Enchantment (been borrowing from the library up until now) and Hart's Hope, which I am eagerly awaiting as a self-bought Christmas present.My sister will be recieving a copy of Enchantment from me for Christmas as well, after all she made me promise to read Jitterbug Purfume by Tom Robbins (the entire first chapter was about beets - YES ... BEETS!!!). The fantasy in Enchantment was just as, if not more so, spellbinding as that of Jitterbug Purfume (and no beet torture to get to the meat of the story) that I made her swear she would return the favor by reading Enchantment. I know she is going to love it, and I promise that any one who is a fantasy fiction, OSC, or literary fan in general will as well.This is deffinately a top notch book and I highly recommend clearing your schedule for a day or two ... as you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Orson Scott Card is most famous for his classic Science Fiction novel, Ender's Game. It is well worthy of the accolades given to it, but the less-recognized Enchantment is arguably an even better book.Here Card takes the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty and turns it into a touching and epic Fantasy tale, based firmly in Russian history.As a fairly traditional Fantasy story, this novel would have succeeded swimmingly. Card deftly unfolds a story of epic proportions without losing the focus on the individual characters caught up in it, and that story is concluded perfectly.But what takes Enchantment out of the category of &quot;light Fantasy fun&quot; and puts it into a higher level of literature is how expertly Card handles the love story between the two main characters of the novel. This is what the story is really about, despite being filled with enough traditional adventure to keep any &quot;ack! Romance!&quot; reader from shying away. The love story between Ivan and Katerina has a ring of truth to it seldom found in fiction of any genre (especially Romance), and readers will find that this is what really touches them as they read this story.So pick up this novel. There's something in it for everyone, and it's one of Orson Scott Card's finest novels."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Sixty nine reviews and four and a half stars definitely suggest that this may be worth reading. IT IS!!!I loved this book. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I found it practically flawless. As I read the last page, there was nothing I wanted to change or criticise or add. That's a first for me. It was just right. I was delighted, satisfied, and immediately wanted more by this same author. I want a book that I can't put down, and this was one of those.Orson Scott Card is a new find for me. I don't expect to love everything he writes, but so far I am greatly impressed. I really like his characters. They live for me. I find his writing intelligent, imaginative, unique. I am enchanted by the worlds he creates. His stories delight me. Even a &quot;rewrite&quot; of Sleeping Beauty (not my favourite) becomes a gem.And so if you haven't read this author, what a treat awaits you. And if you have, well, you know what pleasure lies in these pages waiting to be read. Buy this book and give yourself happy sleepless nights because you wont want to put it down until the last page is done."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This is the first Orson Scott Card book I've ever picked up. I was intrigued with the idea of an updated SLEEPING BEAUTY and was not dissapointed. Mr. Card is a master storyteller. I fell in love with the characters without being drug through chapter after chapter of back history. He's quick to the point and keeps the action and conflict going. Enchantment is a modern day fairly tale that will bring out the child in you. If you can't find your inner child once in a while, then skip it and grab a rope."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"One previous reviewer wrote that this book was so &quot;carnal&quot; that s/he didn't want to read it. For a book written in this decade there was hardly anything sexy. Frankly, I would've liked more! There are two kinds of everything: good and bad, and this book was simply great. The story was original, suspenseful, the characters well-developed and likeable, and every sentence phrased so beautifully that the content almost didn't matter."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Orson Scott Card's \\"Enchantment\\" is a truly wonderful book. From the very first line to the very ending, it's all-around excellent: excellent writing, excellent (and clever) story, excellent characters, and excellent character development. One of the nicest aspects of the book is that he folds the philosophical side of things right into the plot so that it's a natural thought process to go through it. Several of the books I've been reading recently just drop that kind of material in like a rock into a pond. Again, it's a wonderful book and I rate it an Excellent 5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book is creativity at its finest.

I have never read anything bad from him."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This was a fun read. I always have a soft spot for fairy tale twists, and this one didn't disappoint.What really happened when Prince Charming woke Sleeping Beauty from her slumber? How did BabaYaga get her house on chicken feet? This delightful tale fills in all of the gaps, and then some, of the old school fairy tale.These characters felt real, all of them. It was nice to have such consistency and understanding about them.

The only drawback to this book, is it suffered from a similar ailment as \\"The Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo\\"...a slow start. However, once the roller coaster starts, hold on and you'll be happy w/ the ride."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Just as in the fairy tales, Ivan has discovered his purpose in life. While in the Ukraine visiting his uncle and working on his graduate dissertation, he comes upon a sleeping princess, whom he kisses and awakes.That much of the story is familiar, but Orson Scott Card's take on the Sleeping Beauty tale is skewed into an enchanting tale that will leave the reader full of wonder and hope. There are witches, both good and evil. A talking bear. A princess who has no use for a modern man who doesn't even know how to handle a sword. Spells and charms abound, but are there enough spells in the world to make such dissimilar individuals fall in love and live happily ever afterwards?Orson Scott Card is well known for his science fiction. He has won both the Hugo and the Nebula Prizes in consecutive years for Ender's Game and Speaker For The Dead, the only author to receive this honor. Card has written multiple books, most of them best sellers. He lives in Greensboro, North Carolina."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I listened to Enchantment by Orson Scott Card (of Ender's Game fame - still one of my favourite books) on audiobook, because I had some long trips coming up. It wasn't a book I had been wanting to read (random pick from the library), but it filled the time quite easily, and I found out that I like to listen to audiobooks while running - yay for multitasking!Enchantment had a promising premise - a modern retelling of the Sleeping Beauty saga. However, it quickly becomes an ordinary but well researched, structured, and paced story about magic and witches in an otherwise muggle world.I will never forget the deep forest with its leaf-filled chasm in the Ukraine where our runner scholar hero, Ivan, finds his 9th century princess Katerina. For that gorgeous magical place alone, I'm grateful. Otherwise, the characters were flat and often stereotypical, and the story not as inventive as I had hoped."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Another strong effort from Mr. Card, he takes a fairy tale that we all thought we knew and tells an orginal, gripping story.Enchantment introduces the reader to Vanya at the age of 10. As the Story begins Vanya, Jewish name Itzak Shlomo, and his family are in the process of immigrating to America. Through the help of cousin Marek, they soon depart from the Carpathian mountains and make their way to America. But not before Vanya can wander into the forest near Mareks house. Vanya is about to be circumcized, as is practice for 10 year old Jews, and runs out into the woods. Upon wandering in these woods, Vanya finds a sleeping woman on a pedestal. Vanya is entranced and soon is driven out by his fear of a monster lurking under the leaves surrounding the pedestal, seemingly protecting the sleeping woman. Even as Vanya leaves the forest, he is beginning to tell himself that what he saw was not real.Vanya and his family leave Russia and get to America, with the help of Cousin Marek. Vanya's father is a well educated linguist, well versed in Old Church Slavonic, and gets a job teaching at an American university. Fast forward about 10 or 15 years and we are given highlights of Vanya's, now IVAN, youth: great track athlete, and follows in dad's linguistic footsteps. Occasional thoughts of the sleeping woman come to Ivan's mind, but he does not think much about it. Ivan also meets Ruthie and falls in love with her, all but proposing to her. Ivan's mother likes Ruthie well enough, but somehow knows that she is not the right person for Ivan and that her son truly does not love Ruthie, despite his pleading. This is all about in the first 50 pages.Ivan returns to Russia to get a more hands on feel for his linguistic studies and to complete his dissertation. Just before Ivan leaves to come back to America, he stops at Cousin Marek's house for a impulse visit. Ivan is drawn back into the woods and confronts the monster protecting the woman, outracing what turns out to be a Bear and striking him in the eye with a rock. Ivan leaps to the pedestal, and wakes the woman with a kiss. He cannot fully waken her until he agrees to marry her. Hey, anything to save a girl and himself from a hungry bear. Katerina is her name and she happens to speak Old Church Slavonic, a language Ivan happens to be studying. Ivan pieces together that she is sleeping beauty and has to help her save her kingdom from the curse of the evil witch Baba Yaga. Ivan must first face the difficulties of an extreme clash of cultures: Upon waking Katarena, Ivan was thrust into a world seperated from todays world by 1000 years. There are many barriers that Ivan must overcome and aspects of his character that clash with the world he is thrust into. Conflict is one of Card's best storytelling methods and the conflict here is no exception.After a stay for a few months in Tania, Katarena and Ivan return to Ivan's time to get some help in their struggle against Baba Yaga. After emerging from the woods behind cousin Marek's house Ivan learns only a couple of days have passed in our world. Marek arranges passage again, for the newlyweds to America. When Ivan and Katarena arrive in the airport in America, Ruthie is there to greet them and Ivan mst immediately deal with his former fiancee and his new wife. After some time in our world, where Ivan's parents completely allow Katarena into the family Katarena and Ivan return to Tania for their final confrontation with Baba Yaga.One of Card's strenghts is that he can really get you believe in his characters, you can be really annoyed by how stubborn they are. The argument dialogues are very engaging and I was able to really empathize with Ivan in his situation.A strong addition to Card's already substantial and diverse library of titles."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Orson Scott Card's unique voice stirs through the spec fiction world. Enchantment is a delightful view on the classic fairy tale sleeping beauty. We find a cast of intriquing characters. I find his use of Russian Folk Tales and insights into dark age Christianity and Judaism in comparison to our own times thought provoking. componed with a sprinking of pagan and neopaganism makes for an intriquing insight into how the world religions interact. But this book does have a few flaws. You find a dispassionate scholarly view of the world. Though it held my interest I didn't care about the characters very much. And in some ways the secondary characters start to blend. But I love cross over fantasies and Card is great at writing them."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I loved it!

It was a joy to read, and I particularly liked Card's modern basis for Baba Yaga's house on legs."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"I loved to watch the love evolve between Ivan and Katerina. I felt that throughout the book, Card knew exactly which parts I'd want to hear more of and less of - and he met my needs. I never got bored with this novel. It was my first Card novel and I will return to his writings again."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"Any one who is a fan of fantasy will love this book. By fantasy i mean the fairytales of childhood. After one reading I read it again just to see what i had missed, if anything, and to see the fairy tales in every line of the book. I will read this book agian and again because like the fairy tales it is based on it strikes a chord with the child in me wanting to believe."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"This book failed on quite a few levels. To anyone who has a background in Russian folklore (I don't have a degree, I just grew up there), the villain characters will seem artificial and unrealistic. Card barely taps the deep vein of traditional Russian folklore. He barely even evokes the magnificent spirit. Card also seems convinced that profanity somehow lends credence to his writing. A number of unnecessary tangents coming off his characteristic &quot;train of thought&quot; passages distracts the reader. His utter lack of imagery leads to disinterest despite the tighly-knit story with several good characters. On the other hand, some points in the story were not explained enough, especially some parts in the beginning, leading to confusion. While Card means well (or does he?), he still manages to write several questionable opinions of religion that I'm sure SOMEONE will find distasteful. Finally, all characters behave as if they were just out of US: I felt no feeling of &quot;immersion&quot; into a foreign culture.I'm not saying that it's a bad book. It's just the last book you want to open if you want to find out about Russian folklore."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"While Card does a marvelous job at making his characters lifelike and close to the reader, I found the storyline to be almost laughable if you have any knowledge of Slavic folklore. The character names are as generic as they can possibly be (Prince John saves Princess Mary). Likewise, the choice of villains is puzzling at best - why choose a classic witch that never did any major harm but steal a few children (Baba Yaga is moderately comparable to a forest hag) when the tales offer a much richer array with more ambitions with an epic scope- the undead lord Kashchei the Deathless, the Nightingale Marauder, and numerous others?From a plot side of the book I likewise consider this to be one of Card's lesser successes: some readers may be... turned away at his graphic portrayals (just like they were in Ender's Shadow, where Card used the intensity of bowel movements as his tool) of various aspects. If you want an excellent &quot;modern character in ancient setting&quot; book, try Donaldson's Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever sagas."},{"Title":"Enchantment","review":"It has been so long since I read this book, but I highly recommend it. In fact, instead of loaning it out to people like normal, I actually bought it for two of my friends that I knew would appreciate it as well. This is a modern day \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", but it is so well written. I was first introduced to Orson Scott Card in college with \\"Ender's Game\\", which was an excellent book and then read \\"Lost Boys\\", which I did not feel was as good, but still worth the read. This book and perhaps \\"Dogs of Babel\\" by Carolyn Parkhurst would definitely be two I would like to have on a deserted island."},{"Title":"Crime & Punishment in Canada (Oxford)","review":"Peacefull Canada. A very cold socialist semi-utopia that most see as crime free.While that narrow view may be true, this book reveals the seedy underbelly and noble brow of Candian justice.This book is a tome.

He states as many of his theorems as possible in a general sense, whereas many authors work in the easier cases of C*-algebras. Most interesting (at least to me) is the extremely algebraic approach the author takes. Besides examining topological algebras themselves, he also spends a considerable amount of time examining radicals, simplicity, modules over these algebras, and even delves into some homological methods for analysing these objects. As a newcomer to this field (I am still an undergraduate maths student) I found his explanations extremely clear. He gave numerous (non-trivial) examples, and provided a great deal of motivation for his results. He even manages to find some places for a bit of humour. The only real disadvantages of this book are its price, its relative rarity, and the typesetting, which is really not up to the standard set by LaTeX. His insistence on calling locally convex algebras &quot;polynormed&quot; algebras is also a trifle disturbing (although appropriate). Aside from these peccadillos, an excellent book."},{"Title":"The First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)","review":"Morris' exegetical work is phenomenal!

For teaching an adult Biblical studies class it was an invaluable tool."},{"Title":"The First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)","review":"First let me just say that as a pastor working on the Greek text for a sermon series through Thessalonians, I've found this commentary to be helpful in a few key areas.Primarily this author strikes me as one who has a seasoned grasp of the original Greek text, and yet also brings relevant import into the critical applications as they relate to the text. It is not what I would call a highly technical commentary. It does not deal with the views of Socio-Rhetoric, or spend a lot of time on theories that don't bear spiritual fruit for the reader. Instead this commentary tends to focus on application from other scriptures to the discussion of the text.Let me give you an example so you know what I mean.Let's take 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, a paragraph that focuses on the Coming of the Lord. For these six verses he gives us 13 pages of material. It is laid out well, with a verse marker for comments under each verse. He gives the text first, and then comments on each verse. He deals with Greek words if there is anything special about them. He gives the Greek fonts, and then discusses the relevant grammatical features and discusses the implications of those features. Instead of interlacing his comments with quotes from other commentators and interactions with their views, he footnotes all of those. I like this because I like to read an authors thoughts without all the back and forth interruptions those other citations can sometimes spawn.He typically cites just a handful of cross references to other passages and then discusses them more than other commentators. He likes to draw out the implications a bit more than most commentators. This really helps a pastor or bible teacher grasp his ideas for application more than most commentators. So I would suggest to you that this commentary is a Pastors friend. It will help you develop sermons.Exegesis: My experience with the exegesis in this volume is that he is fair, balanced, and avoids the temptation to jump to unwarranted conclusions. It's well done.Let me give you a little bit on 1 Thessalonians 4:13 so you see more clearly what I mean about this.From pg 136 \\"The Parousia is a difficult topic. Within the short space of the mission, it would have been impossible for the apostolic band to have given anything like complete instruction about it. Clearly they had spoken much of it, for the Thessalonian correspondence gives evidence of a lively interest in the whole subject. It is worth asking ourselves whether the comparative neglect of the doctrine in much modern Christianity has not resulted in great loss.\\" He then discusses other issues revolving the portions of vs. 13 for 3 more pages. He has a number of great points from other scriptures that tie directly into all of this. I found the commentary to be inspiring.So what is missing? Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphic Citations. It's as if there was nothing in common between this letter and the intertestamental literature. He could have hundreds of citations.That's my big beef with this otherwise excellent book."},{"Title":"The First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)","review":"Thankfully Eerdman's (the publisher) decided to keep this commentary on the market.

Morris&#8217; discussion of election is very Calvinistic. He allows no room for prevenient grace. Election proceeds from God&#8217;s great love. It is not arbitrary and not a device for sending some people to eternal punishment. Instead, it is a mechanism for rescuing some people.The author also addresses eschatology from a reformed perspective. God calls the Thessalonians into the kingdom and into glory. This call is effectual, meaning it cannot be resisted. Interestingly, Paul does not often preach about the kingdom, but he does to the Thessalonians. God&#8217;s rule is operative in believers both in the present and in the glorious future. Despite a lot of attention being devoted to the second coming in these letters, Paul still makes realized eschatology part of his teaching.I enjoyed the book because it covers the basics but also employs a perspective I have not previously seen applied to the Thessalonian epistles."},{"Title":"The First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)","review":"I have always enjoyed reading books by Leon Morris.

Russell is free from pretense, from conformism, from prejudice, and from dogma. What he proclaims emanates from his own, developed after careful and thorough thinking - a rare quality any time, any where.In this short article, he starts by bringing humanity down from heavens to the world of creatures, namely a mere product of nature. He then reasons his disbelief in immortality. But, the greatest single statement of the article is the most convincing description of a \\"good life\\" that I have ever seen: \\"The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.\\" He then expands on this highly loaded statement, and further into moral rules, and individual means to pursuing this. The article ends with a wonderful discussion on how science can contribute to the realization of a good life.As a side note, this article was used against Russell in the court hearing to dismiss him from the City College of New York Faculty."},{"Title":"What I believe, (To-day and to-morrow series)","review":"Bertrand RussellWhat I BelieveRoutledge Classics, Paperback, 2009.8vo. xvii, 48 pp. Preface to the Routledge Classics Edition by Alan Ryan, 2003 [vi-xvi].

Nature and Man2. The Good Life3. Moral Rules4. Salvation: Individual and Social5. Science and HappinessIndex===========================================Just like Maupassant's ''Afloat'' or Bryan Magee's ''Aspects of Wagner'', Bertrand Russell's ''What I Believe'' is one of those little books that contain disproportionately huge amount of wisdom. First published in 1925, this pamphlet has been reprinted numerous times since then and is regarded today as one of Bertrand Russell's most famous works, probably the best introduction to this unique man in so short a space. Surely, ''What I Believe'' is infinitely superior to the even more famous essay ''A Free Man's Worship'' (1903), which is to my mind nothing more than a juvenile exercise in mysticism and rhetoric; it also is better introduction to the personality of Bertrand Russell than his legendary lecture ''Why I am not a Christian'' (1927) for the simple reason that its scope is much wider.As is obvious from the contents, ''What I Believe'' synthesises, in an extremely condensed form of course, Russell's agnosticism and irreligious nature within regard to God and immortality as well as his opinions on matters like morals, society, science and the essence of the good life. It is worth noting that in his very short preface, dated January 1 1925, Bertrand Russell mentions that ''What I Believe'' was intended to deal chiefly with the hopes which science gives for the future, just like ''Icarus, or the Future of Science'' (1924) had dealt with the dangers. For to judge wisely, we have to be aware of both. This may explain the significant amount of optimism that pervades these pages, but it is also an excellent recommendation to read ''Icarus'' as well.It is a shame to write a long review of so short a book which is so amazingly well written and covers so vast a scope. Trying to be brief, I think there are chiefly two reasons for ''What I Believe'' to be in print 85 years after it was first published: the two reasons for the enduring value of so much from Bertrand Russell's mammoth oeuvre: his mind and his prose.I may start with the latter, and with one sincere warning to all newcomers to Lord Russell. Beware of that prose, folks, for it does cause addiction; should you have anything to do today, you had better not start a book by Bertrand Russell. Quite unlike his early years before the First World War, when he was mathematician and philosopher rather than popular writer on pretty much every subject, the mature Bertrand Russell seems quite incapable to write a single muddled sentence; nor are his paragraphs, pages or chapters any less admirable in terms of structure and lucidity. I can't think of any other style where even the commas have significance of their own.But the real treasure is, of course, the mind behind the style. Bertrand Russell was the supreme rational man. Never could he understand the masses who accept blindly comfortable myths for which there is no scientific evidence - like God and immortality, for instance. Reason always was his own personal God, a powerful substitute for the Christian one he never accepted.What I especially like about Bertrand Russell is that he is almost never given to ranting; quite on the contrary, he always has formidable argumentation. He doesn't just tell you what good life is - ''one inspired by love and guided by knowledge'' - but he goes on to analyse in detail both love and knowledge, the former as a mixture of different degrees of benevolence and delight in contemplation, and the latter as firmly scientific knowledge, not ethical which strictly speaking does not even exist. He doesn't just condemns Christianity as harmful for both man's individual and social happiness, and especially on the level of morality, but he states his reasons clearly, frankly and with amount of common sense no one but maniacal devotee would refuse to consider; from the fear on which, as all religions, Christianity too is based, through education full of superstitions and a great deal of social cruelty, until the taboo on the use of contraceptives.*As always with truly great minds, whether or not one agrees matters not. It is easy to disagree with Lord Russell. I am not sure I approve of his harsh attitude to all those who prefer cozy myths like religion and faith to the search of scientific evidence and reason; perhaps they can't help themselves; perhaps they need some help. Personally, I rather respect, and certainly envy, these people; there's no surer way to be happy than theirs. Does it really matter that it might well be an illusion if it does have all sense of reality for them? I should think not.When we come to science, I disagree almost completely with Lord Russell's reverence for the scientific knowledge and his viewing science more or less like social panacea par excellence. But one has to remember that ''What I Believe'' was first published in 1925; even at the time of Russell's death (1970) science was still very much science. I am perhaps being presumptuous, but I wonder if Lord Russell would not have changed his mind, had he been alive today. I am really curious what he would have thought about the hideous nightmare of big money business, publishing careerism and gluttonous symposia science has long since been converted into.It is not very difficult to find contradictions in Bertrand Russell's attitudes, either. My favourite is his occasional disregard of his own and very sensible conviction that opinions held with passion are always those for which no good grounds exist. When all is said and done, however, these things are of minor significance - if any. Indeed, dwelling on them seems to me just short of ridiculous. Bertrand Russell has infinitely more to offer, even in 40 pages or so.In conclusion, this little book is so huge that it must be read by everybody at least a little interested in the relationships between nature and man, society and individual, religion and science, love and hate, knowledge and superstition. Of course Lord Russell wrote a good many other books, and quite a bit thicker at that, in which he discussed all these subjects in much greater depth. But that doesn't make the superbly succinct and dazzlingly stirring ''What I Believe'' any less compelling. One may well see why it was one of the books cited as evidence during the infamous court declaration of Bertrand Russell as unfit to teach in the College of the City of New York in 1940. Last but not least, it is surprisingly little dated; it deals almost exclusively with matters as relevant today as ever. (In passing it may be noted that Alan Ryan's introduction to the Routledge Classics Edition is a rather indifferent and somewhat conceited stuff, but it does contain few interesting observations about Russell's life and opinions.)At first I was taken aback that a pamphlet of mere 43 pages has a 5 pages index. Now, having read it several times, I wonder no longer. It really is that rich.PS I have deliberately restrained myself from quoting passages, something I generally love doing. The reason is simple: it simply makes no sense. Not that Lord Russell's prose is less quote-friendly than usual, but it does have a very unusual degree of intensity and concentration.-------------------------------------------------'* By the way, the interesting ''editor's note'', left uncredited by the sloppy fellows in Routledge, about the changed attitude of some churches to birth control was actually written by Paul Edwards, the editor of ''Why I Am Not a Christian, and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects'' (1957). This is one of the very few instances when the pamphlet is dated."},{"Title":"What I believe, (To-day and to-morrow series)","review":"My husband loves this book! It was a good price and arrived safe and sound and in a timely fashion. Thank You!"},{"Title":"Plutonia","review":"I wasn't a big fan of Russian authors. During my visits to a bookstore in India, I found the title &quot;Plutonia&quot; appealing and bought the book because it was very cheap: 3 US cents.You may have heard of Jules Verne's &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;. &quot;Plutonia&quot; is similar but updated; a story of Russian scientists who travel into the northern Arctic thinking they will discover some unknown land and it will be a part of Russia. However, they experience some inexplicable events during their travels: an extremely continental deep depression into the earth's surface near the Arctic, and warm, fertile lands near the &quot;North Pole&quot;, and the strange position of the Sun. Plus, the strange behavior of the barometer, the compass and the altimeter. They also find primitive animals long extinct from Earth.The explorers realize that they have traveled to the earth's inner surface. After that, the more they go into the inner surface, which they now call &quot;Plutonia&quot;, the more they travel back in time and experience the flora and fauna of the different stages of Earth's history. The author, V. A. Obruchev, takes the reader through a journey that is so realistic.The book is not only about dinosaurs; the scientists have some fun too. The explorers get robbed by ants, yes ants, and they have a hard time figuring out who robbed them in that unmanned land. Later, they have an encounter with the primitive people. The best part about the scientists is the decisions they make; they are very knowledgeable and find the most effective and quick solutions or explanations to any problems, plus, they have a good sense of humor. After all, they are scientists. V. A. Obruchev, himself a geologist, is a very good author and &quot;Plutonia&quot; is the best si-fi book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Plutonia","review":"An excellent book once again in print. A 1914 Russian expedition to the Arctic finds that prehistory still lives. I read this book as a teen in the later 1960s (how it ended up in a public library in a tiny Southern town would probably be a good tale). Dr. Vladimir A. Obruchev must have been one heck of a writer considering how well his prose survived translation. This is one of the books that got me involved with the Earth sciences."},{"Title":"Plutonia","review":"V. A. Obruchevs &quot;Plutonia&quot; is a pretty good read! He was inspired by &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, and you can tell...but the book has an otherwise original story.Here is an overview of it:A Russian scientist seems to think there is a possibility of an underground world, where possibly there are now extinct (above ground) species of animals and plants still alive. Yep, you guessed it, he is right. Anyway, the team that goes there has many adventures dealing with a wide range of animals, from giant ants to wooly mammoths. And theyre not scared to shoot them for meat, either ;-)This is an entertaining story, although I would imagine animal rights groups would really have a field day with some of the subject matter. Give it a try....it is a little dated, but a truly good book!"},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"Stein's Three Lives, first published in 1909, is one of the easier books of her in terms of language. The third story in it, &quot;Melanctha&quot;, which is an adaption of her earlier &quot;Q.E.D.&quot;, has caused much controversy, mainly due to its racist remarks and stereotypical representations of African - Americans. It is what lies beyond this, however, that distinguishes &quot;Melanctha&quot; from 19th C novels and renders it one of the most important works within the Modernist canon. In her typical style of a &quot;continuous present&quot; and her free usage of a pseudo-vernacular she describes the relationship of Melanctha, a mulatta, with Dr. Jefferson Campbell, also a mulatto. Their struggle &quot;to understand&quot; is a battle of different modes of perception and thus connects the book to Stein's most important teacher, William James. Despite its racist depiction of African Americans, this book is a must for all interested in the beginning of Modernism presented by Gertrude Stein."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"This is not a great novella or a set of great short stories but it is a very fascinating use of prose to create drama and intense feelings. Readers expecting to discover another Tolstoy will be very disappointed. Her writing style is very unusual but she does not write great novels. Hemingway and Katherine Porter claim that she influenced their work. She probably did; but, she is a writer's writer presenting unusual structure and prose. She is not a great novelist.Stein published 26 books starting with this collection of three stories in 1909. This is her first book and she self published only 500 hard copies. She had to fight with the publisher to get it published her way. He wanted to make it more conventional. It was not written as a novel aimed at wide popular sales. She was seeking a smaller and a more critical audience.When it was written, she had left Baltimore and was living in Paris on money inherited from her father. She had the luxury of being able to do whatever she wanted. As a result, she bought paintings and wrote experimental fiction.This is a collection of three short stories. This particular book has an excellent introduction by Professor Ann Charters plus it has Q.E.D., which is another very brief collection of short stories and under 50 pages.What is she doing here? She uses very simple characters, stereotypes really, as a vehicle to try out her experimental prose. It is not stream of consciousness - that was made famous by Joyce a few years later - but rather it is repetition of blocks of prose to create mood. She got the idea of repetition from painters who use repetitive brush strokes to create paintings. It sounds like an odd ball idea but it is original and effective.There are three short stories here: The Good Anna, Melanctha, and The Gentle Lena. The first and last are about young German immigrant women and their struggle to control and be controlled, either by men or other women.The most dramatic work and the longest is the over 100 page novella, Melanctha. This describes a very turbulent relationship between a young black doctor and the mixed race, half black, Melanctha, in Bridgeport. They have a conflicted relationship filled with stress. Stein manages to effectively bring the stress to the reader by repeating blocks of their conversations with just slight changes, paragraph to paragraph. After a while the reader feels that they are in the room with the arguing couple.So, is this a great novel? No. But it is a highly original and interesting use of prose to create the intense mood of the story. It is considered by many as a milestone in American literature. Stein was tempted to follow in the tracks set by Henry James, but in the end struck her own unique chord.Of her 26 works, this is the first and one of her four most important works. The other three are Tender Buttons (1914), The Making of Americans (1925), and The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933). The last was a best seller and brought her widespread fame.For a good selection of her works, there is a 736 page collection by Vintage, March 17, 1990, ISBN-10: 0679724648 or ISBN-13: 978-0679724643 which contains all the good Stein works including Melanctha."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"This is an important work of literature. The use of language to tell stories beyond what can typically be told in narrative was radical at the time. Students of early 20th Century American literature, students of gender studies, students of American studies should all be required to read it. Not an uplifting book and certainly not a book to recommend to your friends who spend more time watching TV and going to movies than reading.There is a controversy surrounding the book's central character named Melanctha. It is unfortunate that television dominates culture in this era. It would seem that when a work of literature depicts a black person, a typical reader expects Cliff Huxtable to appear in one of his dandy sweaters to dispense advice to one of his children in DKNY clothing. Or readers of popular literature (books with bumpy covers) become offended when African American characters do not resemble one of Alice Walker's or Alex Haley's romanticized figures.Melanctha is realistic. She is most likely a composite of many of the women with whom Stein came in contact while studying medicine in urban Baltimore. Melanctha's tragedy is that her intellect will go to waste because she is black and because she is a woman. Her sin (to some readers) seems to be that she talks like a black woman from Baltimore at that time would talk. So don't buy this book if you are offended by the way black people acted or German people acted (there is a story about German immigrants, as well) in Baltimore in the early 20th century.If you are a fan of popular literature...Haley, Alice Walker, and the Cosby show are probably more up your alley. If you are interested in a very interesting experimental work from early 20th Century, by a woman who took her appreciation of post-impressionist art and tried to apply it to literature...this is it."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not. The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best. Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book. It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"read the other reviews and youll be surprised by the violent reactions of people to this book. richard wright, black activist and author, praised this book as the &quot;first true representation of an african-american in american literature&quot; and yet another famous activist labeled it &quot;senseless racist drivel&quot;What in the book provokes this controversy?The question is complex. Though Stein in all three stories uses words like &quot;black&quot; and&quot;german&quot; as undeniable stereotypes, there is no denying that these categories get deconstructed by the narrative and the style.If your read books for style, you cant go wrong here. Stein's experimental prose is poetry set to music, exploring all the auditory limits of the english language.There are 3 stories, The Good Anna, Melanctha and The Gentle Lena.The controversy is mainly about the second story. Not that the other stories dont have their issues. Eg: The Gentle Lena is probably one of the weirdest characters you will EVER see in fiction.So, buy this book and treat yourself to some pleasure in the english language!"},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"The trouble with the avant-garde is that they set themselves up to say that anyone who doesn't like what they do is, well, totally square. At the same time, those who convince themselves that they appreciate it in the correct way can lord it over the rest of us naifs.After having heard about this book for years from a dear Stein-devotee pal, I gave it a try. I must say that, not only was I disappointed in the so-called language experimentation, but I was just plain bored. I did not find the characters interesting; I did not get taken into their world view by the stream-of-consciousness writing style that is Stein's trademark; I did not feel like I learned anything. What truly convinced my pal that I am an artistic philistine - and I guess I am in her measure - is that I vastly preferred The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, which was written for a popular audience (this is, clearly written and not with all the obscure and in my view idioitic word play).Oh well, this review will no doubt get many \\"unhelpful\\" votes, but then, at least I looked at it honestly and and naively and gave it the effort an avant-garde classic deserves. NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"Returning to THREE LIVES after several years, I am again reminded of Stein's stylistic innovation and topical audacity. These are stories of working class women, one African American and two whose European heritage is still marked as &quot;ethnic&quot;, who live with modest hopes and even more modest contentment. Watching Stein imagine a narrative voice to these women of spotty education and limited worldview is itself important. This is not the stream-of-consciousness of Joyce or Faulkner, but rather a subject-verb-predicate world of simple people. That Stein can reflect emotional complexity and intellectual anxiety with a style that would seem well-suited to a reading primer speaks not only of her ability, but indeed might undercut the utility of more affected literary devices. Stein is forging into then largely ignored life and so it should come as no suprise that this book doesn't appeal to most. But there is something here that merits our attention"},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"This collection of three novellas is indicative of a major turn in avant-garde of American literature. Gertrude Stein's prose here functions through its lacuna's and omissions; it is minimalist in content, but her command of dialect is truly accomplished. Melanctha is the finest work here-the story of a black woman and her relationship in a society that hates her. Of course Stein has been accused of employing stereotypes-but such a critique fails to really live the text in its complexity. I can't say the other two works are as strong, Stein feels almost restrained in her commitment to the vernacular. Nevertheless, this is a seminal work."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"This may have been a groundbreaking piece of work in speaking in the vernacular of people of the American lower classes, but now it reads as a little stilted and (especially in the case of the middle story, about a black woman who grew up fatherless and who tries to find and make a life with an intellectual man) a little condescending toward her own characters.Clearly, the stories are meticulously crafted; she meant them to be this way. She just never gets inside the minds of her characters, treating them like marionettes on sticks instead of living within them, even for the few dozen pages of each story.I have to admit, I couldn't stop thinking, \\"You know, Henry James would have moved this along by now.\\" That may not be fair, and it's not like these stories are unreadable, not by a long stretch, but they're the literary equivalent of those hour-long documentaries on late night cable news stations: the camera-eye shows more sympathy than empathy, and it's understood from the get-go that a good end isn't really on the table for any of these characters."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"If you like experimental language and can still be surprised by linguistic expressions you thought to be impossible, you have come to the right place - get this book and read \\"Three Lives\\". It is a wonderful collection of short stories about three different women who struggle with life each in their own way, and Gertrude Stein's descriptions express linguistically, what the souls of these girls go through: Torture, boredom, helplessness, violence, love, sexual desire. Has there ever before been such an emotional language? I doubt it. The edition by Mondial (ISBN 978-1595690425 or 1595690425) includes an introduction by \\"enfant terrible\\" Carl Van Vechten, an essayist and photographer, who knew Gertrude Stein very well and delivers an interesting insight into her way of writing (and living) and the history of this book."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"A complex collection of three stories about women all living in a fictional American town during the segregation era. Melanctha is by far the best of the three short stories, and can be considered a novella. The Good Anna is extremely humorous. I don't think many can appreciate the innovative technique Stein uses, but a great read if you are interested in the Lost Generation."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"I sort of get it that Stein went \\"pedal to the metal\\" to smash all of the writing and stylistic conventions of her time. She wrote about women, the poor, the mundane elements of life that make the bulk of our lives; all that was on the fringe and to the left of center of what was considered important to write about. I get it that this is groundbreaking. Stein and this work should be applauded and recognized as pioneering, experimental and something just plain new. Stein put it out there because other writers were probably too chicken-s_ _ t to try anything new and she said what the hell. She definitely deserves major credit for that but it is still not a good read. It is a wonderful read if you are a reader who is deeply into style and form and theme and can compare and realize just how different it is point by point. If you know what she was trying to do you'll love it otherwise it is pretty boring to read as stories. The writer pyrotechnic are the star and not the stories and characters themselves, so it is not good story telling. Virginia Wolff did it stylistically much better with \\"To the Lighthouse\\" years later, but there might not have been a \\"Too the Lighthouse\\" if first there was no \\"Three Lives\\". Someone had to do it first. Stein was rich and already living outside the \\"normal\\" it did not cost her much to smash conventions. The only things that are conventional though are the stereotypes she uses. Half white and lighter skinned blacks are smarter than darker blacks. College educated blacks speak in fragmented english. Darker black are characterized as lazy and manipulative and mean. Stein used all of her innovation on style and not substance."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"I derived a great deal of pleasure from reading this book. I &quot;became&quot; each of these women. I wanted to live their lives and experience what they were going through. I identified mostly with Lena. I don't think she was as stupid as everyone said - she's a much deeper character that doesn't quite know how to express herself.I wonder if women tend to identify with these characters more? I would love to see these made into a movie.The language was difficult to follow at times. The patterns and rhythms were in the way sometimes, but if you allow yourself to &quot;give in&quot; to it - you'll be fine."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"In &quot;3 Lives,&quot; Gertrude Stein recounts the life stories of three very different women living and dying in the city Bridgepoint. With &quot;The Good Anna,&quot; we learn the story of a German maid, who maintains the homes of various grand ladies throughout her life. She loves taking care of stray dogs and scolding young ladies into what she deems to be their proper stations. She also cultivates a strong friendship with the widow Mrs. Lehntman, the great &quot;romance&quot; of her life. (Though, it's never entirely clear what is meant by &quot;romance:' either a very strong friendship or an actual intimate relationship.)In &quot;Melanctha,&quot; we are related the history of a young black woman, bright and intelligent, who wants to learn more about life and love. She develops relationships with many different men but learns most of what she needs during her &quot;wanderings&quot; with Jane Harden. After a time, she finally decides to settle down and to get &quot;really married&quot; to the right man. She thinks she finds that in Dr. Jeff Campbell, but neither one knows exactly what he/she really wants.In the final story, &quot;The Gentle Lena,&quot; Lena is a young German girl, brought to the States by a cousin. She is considered ugly and dimwitted so no one in her new family really takes to her. All the girls taunt and tease her. Finally, she is et up in an arranged marriage to a man who doesn't really like women (though it's never said flat out whether or not he is gay). They have children, and the husband falls for the children, ignoring Lena completely.All three women wind up alone, forgotten and eventually dead. But, that's not what I really didn't like about this book. Stein's use of language tended to get in the way, so much so that I could never really understand what characters were saying and could never empathize with them. In fact, with &quot;Melanctha,&quot; their constant repetition of names and long-winded sentences that turn around on themselves to regurgitate what was said in the preceding sentences, made the characters seem simple-minded. I never liked any of the characters because I never felt that I was given anything to like. And, if I was, I had trouble discerning it through the tangle of words. I re-read passages many times simply to try to understand what was happening or what a character was feeling/thinking and never really understood. They came across very two-dimensional.I forced myself to finish the book but still would have trouble recommending it, mostly due to the use of language."},{"Title":"Three lives [The New classics- New directions]","review":"I have been an admirer of Gertrude Stein's work and chose &quot;Three Lives&quot; in good faith.

If you're intrigued by the idea of mind science and just want a general idea of what the issues, approaches and shortcomings of its current state are, then this book (written for an introductory, probably undergraduate, course) is a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Self Condemned","review":"While I've always been a great admirer of the eccentric painter and author Wyndham Lewis, I find most of his fiction frustratingly unsatisfying. As George Orwell wrote in 1945, \\"Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers has been poured into Wyndham Lewis's so-called novels... Yet it would be a very heavy labour to read one of these books right through. Some indefinable quality, a sort of literary vitamin... is absent from them.\\"That's not the case with Lewis's oddly gripping masterpiece SELF-CONDEMNED. Here, for once, Lewis tells a story that engages your emotions and involves you with the fate of his protagonist. The plot is simple and terrible. Rene Harding, an icily forbidding Oxford Don, decides that history is bunk and, to avoid becoming entangled in the upcoming war with Hitler, immigrates to an utterly dreary Canadian town with his feeble-minded wife Hester. There they suffer extreme poverty and neglect, which Lewis depicts slowly and remorselessly, in Dreiserian detail. There is no relief for the reader, no feel-good ending, but there is genuine catharsis.Nobody would call this novel perfect. There are many aimless digressions and longueurs. But Lewis's vision is so original, and his descriptions are so vivid, I have no hesitation in giving SELF-CONDEMNED five stars. Highlights include a surreal, horrifying portrayal of a hotel burning down in the Canadian winter and creating a \\"fiery iceberg\\", a satirical encounter with one of those foolish Johnsonian professors who \\"roll towards their interlocutor heavy carefully picked words, reminiscent of those which thundered in the small talk of the formidable Lexicographer\\", and a funny scene in which Harding flings a copy of MIDDLEMARCH into the open sea.I'm so glad this great novel is now available as an eBook. Hopefully it will encourage other e-publishers to release more of Wyndham Lewis's work."},{"Title":"Absence from Felicity : The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles","review":"This work is an invaluable historical resource for students of A Course In Miracles. Mr. Wapnick painstakingly details the life of Helen Schucman and the scribing of ACIM. He also provides many valuable examples of personal material between Helen and Jesus. Although difficult reading, it is essential for anyone who wants to know the story of how the Course came to be. Students of the Course the world over are grateful to Mr. Wapnick for his loving efforts in the area of A Course In Miracles. Highly recommended for serious students of ACIM."},{"Title":"Absence from Felicity : The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles","review":"This is one of those indispensable books, along with Gary Renard's DU and YIR, that the serious ACIM student should definitely consider having. I had a rather different impression of Helen Shucman until I read Absence from Felicity. It puts into perspective the scribing of the Course, the events that led up to and ensued during the scribing, and the complexities surrounding Helen's relationship with Bill Thetford and others. Compared to Kenneth Wapnick's other companion guide books to the Course whose academic tone is sometimes difficult to follow, this book reads smoothly and includes a lot of Helen's personal notes, mostly letters written to Bill throughout their relationship. Most of all, Absence from Felicity shows us that Helen was just as neurotic (or, 'ego-driven,' to put it in Course terms) as any of us and that she herself made a tremendous effort to undertake the teachings of the Course. It's an informative source of encouragement that I recommend for anyone interested in A Course In Miracles."},{"Title":"Absence from Felicity : The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles","review":"Although I am Catholic and do not believe in &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot;, I think this book is the best reference to anyone who wants to know about Helen Schucman's life and her writing of the Course.

I'm not sure if it was in this book or another one of Ken's books, but he writes about learning from others' forgiveness lessons, and there are so many in this book.For example: Helen avoiding Jesus by shopping. We all do this (avoid peace, forgiveness, escape that empty feeling, etc) one way or another. One of my ways of escaping him was video games and internet surfing. I had no real desire to do these things and I knew it would be better to practice the lessons. Reading about Helen's funny little avoidance maneuvers she would use to push Jesus away was somewhat shocking and funny to me, because in her actions I could see how I was making my own escape buttons."},{"Title":"Absence from Felicity : The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles","review":"If you're a student of the Course, or not, but especially if you are, I believe this would be considered required reading for a lot of reasons that I won't go into here. But let me just say that this is as important a work as is ACIM. Because Ken had such a close and intimate relationship with Helen, he beautifully shares Helen with by using the Course and it's examples to tell her story.It's intense reading, so if you're looking for easy this isn't it. But it's gripping and enriching, so it's worth every second of it. Helen also wrote some incredible poetry in her later years and Ken highlights many of those in the same Course related fashion as well.You'll love yourself for reading this book!"},{"Title":"Absence from Felicity : The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles","review":"This is a well written book on a complicated and multi-layer subject, putting the pieces together to help us understand all that was involved in bringing ACIM to the world.

It is a story of the fierce struggle between the human personality and the divine self. For me personally it was helpful to see this separation because we all human and divine, and we all struggle in the same way, except with Dr. Schucman the struggle was extreme because the abilities and the problem were more pronounced.I found it useful, as I said, because I wanted to know how others who are clairvoyant and tuned in deal with their abilities in a very practical physical world. Also I wanted to know how a person handles with the coming of an identity who wants to channel.If these are your interest and if you want to know about the person and the process of how A Course in Miracles came about, then I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Absence from Felicity : The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles","review":"I absolutely love this book,amusing while enlightening, very well writtenreally enjoying the dreams interpretation tips from the intelligent and directDr. Wapnik,A Course in Miracles supplement in my opinion, another tool to go deeper.so once again thank you Kenneth!

Schuckman's words themselves are full of wonderful clarity. I'm sure the story of her life as she tells it is indeed an illuminating experience, you won't find much of it here.

Not only did she utterly succeed in making the crossing, but &quot;The Cult of Seizure&quot; is among the very best works of modern poetry I've ever read: it's grotesque and erotic, and the language typical of Ducornet--lush and sensual, amplified by her rather ample and surprising command of the arsenal of poetics. &quot;The Cult of Seizure&quot; ranks with Lew Welch's &quot;Ring of Bone&quot;, Olga Broumas's &quot;Beginning With O&quot;, Ted Hughes's &quot;Crow&quot;, Sylvia Plath's &quot;Ariel&quot;, Galway Kinnell's &quot;Body Rags&quot;, and James Taylor III's &quot;Fresh Leather: The Buffalo Poems&quot; as a major contribution to poetry in English."},{"Title":"The Cult of Seizure","review":"Enchanting poetry that takes you to many dreamlike places. At times otherworldly and ethereal - at other times stark and cold. What a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Cult of Seizure","review":"If you loved Rikki Ducornet's fiction and essays you will enjoy this further journey into her amazing imagination. In this book of mostly poetry Ducornet fondles objects, explores exotic landscapes, and brings the reader flavors from far and near."},{"Title":"The Cult of Seizure","review":"The lunatic algebraof Love.The frenzied orbitsof Mood.The malarial temperaturesof Wound.Symbols of the Cultof Seizure:This flesh, this amuletincised.This hot spoorof predators.This zodiac savagedin the sky.Anyone who has encountered the searing fiction of acclaimed novelist Rikki Ducornet will vouch for her linguistic and imagistic explosiveness. It will come as no surprise then that her many wonder-filled novels were preceded by lesser-known works of poetry published by small presses. One such offering, The Cult of Seizure, was first published by Porcupine's Quill in 1989 and is a work containing a lush poesis from a visionary soul. Just like the following magical fictions, it is a sensual work that augers between the erotic and the grotesque, full of mesmerising language and magnetising symbolism.Poetically speaking, Ducornet seems to come to us through the narrow channel flowing from the European avant garde, a tributary that tends to feed Latin American versifiers like Neruda and Paz rather than their North American counterparts, the latter largely following the lineage of Whitman and Williams. But there are a few that seek to answer Andr&eacute; Breton's famous call for that resolution of two disparate states of consciousness, namely Lamantia, Welch, Kaufman, and more recently Will Alexander. Perhaps in part due to her short sojourn in France Rikki Ducornet echoes the surrealist exhortation to enter into dream logic and the archetypal world of myth and folktale. The Cult of Seizure flutters with fantastic dalliances with the shadow world - from Erzs&eacute;bet Bathory, the \\"Bloody Countess\\" of Hungary, to the enigmatic Thorn Falconer.Of course, there is always a way to over-theorise poetry, to neutralise its raw power with the cloying veneer of academic posturing. One way to indulge in this work is simply to allow the wash of exotic and exoteric images to induce a state of pure pleasure. The reader will enter into a dream world of sensual intimacy, a bestiary of totemic resonance, a world that contains wild leaps of thought and all manner of cavorting symbols - all the while weaving its own internal sense of savoir-faire. There are moments of adroit imagistic coupling in the style of Lautr&eacute;amont's umbrella and sewing machine finding each other on the dissecting table - moments of playfulness and fancy in some edenic garden. But not all is sweetness and light for there are the hidden teeth of intent in all corners of this lush panorama. There are moments of frenetic violence and the tearing of flesh. Ducornet is never one to obfuscate the dark side, often writing from some ancient wound or from some Artaudian sense of miasma. Indeed it is a world of exquisite corpses and there is a theatre of cruelty at work. The reader must embrace Sade's darker side of artistic liberty or the sort of murky internal violence that can be found in Angela Carter's Shadow Dance.When the book was first released the back-jacket blurb explained that it \\"...proceeds visually through a bestiary of the small creatures that crawl -- lizards, snakes, crickets ... all rendered in the style of the 19th century steel engraving, much after the manner of a dated zoology text.\\" Indeed there is something of the Victorian miniaturist in Ducornet, the sort that is charmed by the machinations of various obscure microcosms, as is found in the journals of Dorothy Wordsworth perhaps. This cataloguing impulse is behind the lush cacophony of images and leads to the sort of \`excess of consciousness' that is often attributed to Gertrude Stein. Ducornet is fascinated by both what is seen and what is unseen, which tenders strange juxtapositions of images from the miniaturesque world with those of her attendant curiosity and imagination. Thus, when perusing Z&ouml;tl's Blakean bestiary we get a bewildering admixture of innocence and experience, intent and chance, premonition and yearning. The Cult of Seizure is the harbinger of spirituality in the frozen moment, the stupefaction at the genesis point of fascination. New combinations of possibility, both positive and negative, are given a visible space, freeze-framed in poetic introspection.Female writers have often sought to incant the body through language, whether through the psychic landscapes of Sylvia Plath's Ariel or the exploration of the relationship between boundary and desire as with Jeanette Winterson or H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous. But Ducornet seems to go beyond fixed boundaries or at least engage more infinite striations extending to the animal, vegetable and mineral world. Her poetry seeks a new iconography, one that is fluid and flux, and one that can be represented by the mutability of language. But in an entropic world the sage-poet must be able to freeze the action and capture the moment while always intending towards motion - and we have long made a cult out of the ability to do it. Thus, Ducornet achieves a final doubling - that of the fixed and free. The Cult of Seizure is a celebration of language as incantation, of utterance as a magic rite, of the exhalations of the spoken sacred into text.This new edition from Skylight Press couples the poems with two marvellous and deliciously appropriate essays, Silling and The Deep Zoo. Published as a limited release booklet by Obscure Publications in 2004, both essays dovetail exquisitely with the main text despite the temporal gap between them. The reader will confront the entropic universe of Silling and gain a deeper understanding of Ducornet's ongoing fascination with the Marquis de Sade and his declaration of war to protect author singularity (explored at length in The Fan Maker's Inquisition). In The Deep Zoo she further explores the visual inception of the authorial moment, commenting on Bachelard's reverie, Calvino's delight in the possibilities in the maze, Borges' magical dream gardens, and Z&ouml;tl's daemonic bestiary. In Ducornet's words the combined texts seek \\"to bring a dream of life through the alchemy of language.\\"\\"The passions that animate Rikki Ducornet's The Cult of Seizure are both more apocalyptic and less immediately comprehensible, and sometimes seem to indicate a surrender to the imagination rather than a shaping of it. The elemental forces in Ducornet's world explode in irrevocable acts, as in \\"Abracadabra,\\" with its admonitions to \\"Drink the dew from the spoor of a one-legged crone\\" and \\"Take an axe to the spouse of a hardened heretic.\\" Visits aren't recommended to the weak of either spirit or stomach. But if you're willing to take the plunge into poetry that cuts close to the bone of our dreams and obsessions, The Cult of Seizure contains some absolutely stunning examples of how language can transform actuality. Using as her model the medieval bestiary, wherein natural and imaginary animals mingled in glorious confusion, Ducornet, whose third novel, The Fountains of Neptune was published earlier this year, has mixed the rivetingly graphic and the ferociously fanciful into a striking volume of verse.\\" (Toronto Star)"},{"Title":"An April love Story","review":"Marine MacDonald is in love with Joel, the all-American jock at her school and everything seems perfect in life when-BHAM!

Apprently so, because the farm in North Carolina is to be shared by both familes, and in an attempt to simplify life and get back to nature, (in a sort of Amish-Commune way) there will be no telephones, electricty or grocery shopping. No more make up, fast food, or after school activities either. In fact school takes a back seat to helping her parents on the farm since milking goats, picking apples and making sweaters is the only way the families want to earn money.Suddenly, things start to change for Marine; Lucas doesn't look so annoying anymore and life isn't as dismal as it once seemed.

She loves her life and her friends. Her parents' best friends have a son, Lucas, who goes to school with Marine, but she keeps her distance. He's kind of quiet and serious and pimply.

Like all good protagonists, she's good at getting herself into danger. But sometimes how she gets out of it is so surprising that I have to wonder if Saulnier has ever read any formulaic mysteries before, because she sure isn't shy about breaking the mold when she writes mysteries of her own.Publishers Weekly said in their review of &quot;Distemper&quot; - &quot;If ever a mystery novel about serial mutilation could be called delightful, this one could.&quot; And they've got it right - it's gripping, harrowing, and occasionally downright disturbing, but above all it's thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Distemper (Alex Bernier Mysteries)","review":"I forget, exactly, how it was that I came to own a copy of Beth Saulnier's first novel (Reliable Sources), but I can tell you that it was grudgingly. Living (as she does) in Ithaca, NY, I'd seen enough of her cable access movie review show and read enough of her columns in the local paper to know that I tended to disagree with her assessment of things. Reliable Sources got me, though; hook, line, and sinker...partially, I will fully admit, because of the fact that I, too, have spent time working the beat as a reporter in Ithaca and recognized our &quot;local color&quot; with great hilarity. So, when I saw that Distemper was out, I immediately bought my copy and promptly devoured it within 24 hours.Beth's dialogue is on-the-money real, her humor is just twisted and jaded enough to suit my own, and Alex Bernier is the right combination of gutsy, stupid, smart, talented, and just plain old lucky to be a believable character...not to mention a crack reporter. This book is well-crafted and full of excellent symmetry of plot points that do not, as many do, jump out and scream &quot;this is a plot point!&quot; at you. Plenty of good old-fashioned writer deceit kept me guessing about the killer throughout and making wild statments of accusation about various characters until all was revealed. I love to be had by an author. It's so much more satisfying than figuring out the whole thing on page twelve and then waiting for the rest to unfold. Beth did an excellent job of screwing with my head.If I have one disappointment in Distemper, though, it is the revelation. Three hundred some-odd pages into this fabulous mystery--and with less than one hundred to go--everything comes to light. From there out, it's a race to page 388 and I could almost envision Beth's editor lurking near her keyboard, hassling the writer to hurry up and wrap the darn thing up, already. I came out of it feeling a bit like I'd just been picked up by a golf cart at the 24th mile of the Boston Marathon.Bottom line, of course, is that I will anxiously await Beth's next novel and devour that with similar intensity. I will be hoping, though, for a slightly more satisfying ending. And I have absolute faith that Beth can deliver it."},{"Title":"Distemper (Alex Bernier Mysteries)","review":"The only problem with this book is that I lost sleep because of it.

Alex Bernier- the heroine- is fun and human, even better than in the other Beth Saulnier book I read (and that one was really good, too, Reliable Sources).

Alex Bernier and the denizens of the local newspaper are back on the trail of another killer. Like in the first book, Alex becomes entangled in another series of murders and lets her curiosity get the better of her as she pursues the killer. A thoroughly enjoyable book that I recommend to everyone.

I've read many creative books and am a fan of numerous creative thinking authors...but Herbert L. Leff is the most creative, unassuming, simple and effective teacher of creative thinking I have ever read. I wish he would have written more books!This book was written to record a classroom situation where students were being trained to change their perceptual attitudes deliberately, thus learning about their ability to problem solve. The exercises are charming, interesting and they really work. The black and white pictures are of commonplace situations, but they simulate the way a person would look at their normal, mundane environment and find special meanings by changing their inner point of view.After taking you through many different \\"awareness plans,\\" Leff even shows you how to devise your own. It's a dated little book, but the message - that by changing one's inner perception, focus and attitude, you can become more effectively creative - is timeless. How the message is illustrated, taught & articulated is splendidly artful. It's a great resource if you are a teacher seeking ways to engage and teach creativity.

In this critical biography of Eamon De Valera, De Valera doesn't come off looking too good. More importantly, the criticisms Coogan makes of De Valera are well-founded, and well documented.Despite its many criticisms of De Valera, this book is not so much a book dedicated to denigrating De Valera, as Coogan's lamenting that Ireland was not led by Michael Collins, the brains behind its quest for independence, but rather by Eamon De Valera, who came to prominence as the only commandant in the uprising of Easter 1916 to be spared by the English, because he was deemed to be too insignificant.As a general rule politicians come in two types: the visionary whose foresight allows him or her to enact policies that are beneficial to the country, and the schmoozer, whose rhetorical abilities and eagerness to set up a spoils systems a la Tammany Hall allows them to enjoy long periods in power.Coogan emphatically asserts that De Valera was a professional schmoozer and master of bureaucratic infighting, and far less competent as a policy expert. He shows how DeV frequently chose an understanding of history that suited him, so-called \\"De Valera facts,\\" was very pragmatic when the need arose \\"As so often happened, De Valera wrestled with his conscience, and won...\\" questions his paternity, mentions rumors about his relationship with his secretary. He makes much of De Valera's propensity to make political hay out of Ireland's partition, and plead for a reunification, all the while fusing church and state to such a degree as to make this inconceivable.His most trenchant criticisms are that De Valera plunged Ireland into a civil war to guarantee his preeminence in Irish politics, that he barely if at all understood the economic facts of life. Coogan himself writes that he bears the De Valeras a grudge for what he felt was their shabby treatment of their employees; perhaps for this reason he appears to underestimate the good that De Valera gained for Ireland by keeping it out of the war.This book is well-written in the sense that if you already have a background in Irish history, Coogan will articulately and thoroughly go over the controversies that he wishes to raise, and give you his take on them. If you don't know that much about Irish history, you'll find many of the issues he refers to be at the very least close to arcane and somewhat baffling."},{"Title":"Morris Louis: Veils and variations : [exhibition] January 30 to February 29, 1992, Andre Emmerich Gallery, New York","review":"Reading Tim Pat Coogan I actually thought that Irish English was a distinct language from other forms of English. In the prologue to his \\"De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow\\" he writes \\"Was [de Valera] a Lincoln or a Machiavelli? A saint or a charlatan? A man of peace, or one who incited young men to hatred and violence? Did he seek to heal or worsen the wounds that the Irish and the English inflicted (and inflict) on each other? Was he a revolutionary or a conservative? An unscrupulous manipulator or a nice guy? The truth is that in a sense the answer to all these questions is 'Yes'.\\" The writing is clumsy and illogical, and I honestly had issues understanding the writing for the first few pages before I acclimatized myself. This biography is very long at 704 pages and very unrewarding because of the sloppy, shallow, one-sided analysis.I liked the film \\"Michael Collins\\" very much, a film that ask its audience to imagine the possibilities for Ireland if only that romantic warrior Michael Collins had lived and if that two-faced politician Eamon de Valera had not existed. Having seen the movie I was intrigued by de Valera, and that's why I picked up Coogan's biography. I was surprised and bewildered to find that Coogan in fact agrees with the character portrayal of de Valera in the film as a power-seeking self-promoter. He deliberately maneuvered his arch-nemesis Michael Collins into negotiating an unpopular but necessary treaty with the British to withdraw from Ireland, and then he gave his consent to the armed IRA uprising that killed Michael Collins. A truly amazing survivor he somehow managed to only serve a prison term for his treason, and upon release capitalized on his American financing and support to find a media empire from which he built a political empire. For Coogan, de Valera understood power politics and self-publicity but knew nothing of economics and governing, and Coogan blames de Valera for much of Ireland's woes.Coogan constantly alludes to Machiavelli's \\"The Prince\\" as de Valera's spiritual guide, but de Valera could have probably written \\"The Prince\\" himself in the second grade. Given his actions and his success de Valera was obviously a brilliant schemer who would have been a master poker player: somehow who read his opponents well, and had an intimate feel for the political winds."},{"Title":"Beyond Feast or Famine: Daily Affirmations for Compulsive Eaters","review":"I bought one copy of this book five years ago, then ordered an entire case from the publisher... to give to my friends who struggle with a compulsive eating disorder, too.

I do nearly agree with the theory presented regarding the reason the ship sank, as it is certainley more believable than the Coast Guard's reasoning. The one thing I did not care for is the &quot;arrogance&quot; I felt was displayed by Capt. Parquette. Although I did not mind reading about his experiences, he talked (wrote?) like he was all knowing, and could never do wrong. I sailed on the Great Lakes for a bit as an engineer, and I still get up there once a year to do work in March, so I have met some Captains here and there, and most seem pretty reasonable. However, I do not think much of this guy. Nonetheless, a good book regarding the ship itself, and it does present some interesting facts. So, in closing, I would recommend it if you are into the history of this ship, and would like to know as I why it went down."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"I did not even finish this book because I got so tired of Capt. Paquett's life story. I bought this book with the thought in mind that it was about the Fitz, not Capt. Paquett and his history. I am sure he was/is a great Capt. and I glad that he did as well as he did, but I wanted to read about the Fitz. Skip this book and get one of the other books on the Fitz offered by Amazon."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"I have read this book and found it very informative. The book is mostly about a ego driven Captain who has never made a mistake. Once you get to page 80 or so, the book is very well written and actually talks about the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald. Up until this part of the book the Captain tell endless storys about how great he was as a Captain. He does have great evidence on what happened to the Edmund Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"An excellent book on the Fitz. I found it to be a very feasable look at a possible theory of what went wrong on the Fitz that November day. The book gives a theory on the disaster from the viewpoint of a very experienced Captain that loaded beside the Fitz in Superior and followed it out to sea 2 hours later. He was on the lake at the same time and assisted in the search with his ship. An extremely knowledgable and thought provoking look into the tragedy. The reasoning and ideas put forth are well documented and the writing style very captivating. I would call this a must read for anyone interested in Great Lakes shipping or the Fitzgerald tragedy."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"Sure to create controversy, Paquette gives us a new insight into the tragedy. With all due respect for the victims of the tragedy,from his candid assessment of the actions taken by McSorley in his choice of routes on the final voyage to his assertion that McSorley should have demanded investigation of the \\"wiggling thing\\" are interesting,at the least. Possibly the authors place more confidence in Burgner than may be warranted, but at any rate it is a real departure from the usual depictions which portray the event as 100% freak accident. I hope he is wrong in his insinuations, but again, a much different perspective for good or for ill."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"Bishop's book hits the nail on the head with tremendous impact, most definitely due to the candor, expertise, and knowledge of Captain Dudley Paquett. Through Bishop's prose, Paquett pulls out all the stops in detailing his years on the seas, the November storm, criticizing the shipping industry and Captain McSorley (I thoroughly applaud and believe in Paquett's cracked hull theory), while paying his respects to those men lost at sea on the Fitz and others. I couldn't put this book down. It is a tremendous and easy read, while allowing the novice sailor to learn more about life on the lakes. It'll sweep you under like a rogue wave!"},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"To all the folks who talked about the ego effect of Paquette I have to say this. He was out there that night and made all the right decisions. He loaded along side of the Fitz, watched her clear the harbour, listened to her radio broadcasts and knew they were going to get into trouble. In my estimation he also has the real reason she sank. I have read and reread this book at least 6 times and belive it is the best read ever on the subject. If you want to know why the Fitz sank, get this book. As for Captain Paquette, my hat is off to him. On this night in particular, it wasn't him who had the ego problem. He brought the Sykes into safe harbour."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"I was disappointed that the reader has to wade through many chapters that had little to do with the Edmund Fitzgerald. Instead the book had great detail on Capt. Paquette's experiences and other ships on the Great Lakes. There are many other books which expound on the Fitzgerald much better. In addition the type style/size is difficult and eye straining to read. The book Gales of November is much better."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"This book is a poorly presented addition to the Fitzgerald literature. It's 143 pages of \\"I-told-you-so!\\" Judging from the previous reviews, many readers had the same reaction I did, that about half the book was about the Great All-Knowing Captain Dudley Paquette, and how he could Do No Wrong. It is true that Captain Paquette has a unique qualification for putting forth his opinion about the Fitzgerald tragedy. But in this book he comes off as a stubborn arrogant old man, who know what everyone else did wrong, as compared to him. Captain Paquette knows more than the National Weather Service! Captain Paquette knows more than the Coast Guard! Captain Paquette knows more than everyone else put together, and can't wait to document it. The first several chapters are all about his own career (of no interest to anyone who planned to read about the Fitzgerald tragedy!). It contains such interesting facts as that, on one of Paquette's previous ships, the cook would kick his wife in the legs (hardly germane to the Fitzgerald tragedy!), or that, when he had guests, he'd have two of the ladies seated one on each side of him at dinner (Who cares?). And he can't resist documenting his own wonderfulness--such as on Page 26, when, talking about the night of the storm, and the course of the Fitzgerald as compared to his own course, he says:\\"As I was thinking about this, Russ Carlson, the first mate, nudged my arm and said softly, 'It's not hard to see why you're Captain, Dudley. The north shore is the only place we should be tonight.' \\"Awwww! One hopes Paquette didn't break his arm patting himself on the back!The shame of all this is that Paquette does have a theory about the reason for the Fitzgerald's demise that bears looking at--that Captain McSorley, knowing the questionable structural integrity of the Fitzgerald, nonetheless loaded her to the brim, and pushed her out directly into a storm that the Weather Service had seen coming for several days. I know it's not nice to speak ill of the deceased. But the theory needs to be considered. It needs to come out as a respectable theory, though, not as the demented rantings of a know-it-all old sailor just who just wants to say \\"I told you so.\\""},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"Okay, I really wanted to learn about the Fitz going down, but instead this book is almost entirely about the life and ego of Captain Paquette, who was in charge of another ship that same night. The book goes on and on about how fabulous this one Captain was, how he was the world's best at everything. It is so over the top that I could hardly finish reading it. There are letters commending Paquette on just about everything, and his ego and arrogance make this book very hard to read.As for understanding the Fitz and what happened, there is some helpful information here, but I certainly would have liked to know a lot more. Like the stories of those crew members, etc.In addition to the fact that this book does not stick to the title whatsoever, I actually think it is poorly written too. There are a lot of long run-on sentences, and a lot of quick shifts in topic. Plus, much of the text is just a copy of the author's interview with Captain Paquette, and doesn't have much in the way of style to it.I would not recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"I understand the immediate response to the read mentioned. In some ways, I agree. The good captain is a bit arrogant, but I found it refreshing and forthright. His style is to the point. Did anyone else notice the photos of the good captain in uniform? In that line of work, such professionalism was rare. here's a man who took pride in his job, did it well, and if he were in command of the Fitz that night, I doubt we'd be having this debate. Arrogance is good, pride is good, because when you're right, you're right. This man mastered his chosen profession. How many people can say that?"},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"This book was recommended to me by a very hard core Great Lakes Ship addict that I mentioned in my other review on the Edmund Fitzgerald sinking. I'm not here to put blame on anyone for the tragedy. The book is a very good read and Captain Paquette does deserve respect as you don't become a Captain undeserving. Just as weather dictates a \\" No-Go ' or a \\" Go \\" decision in shipping as well as in flying there's been many lives lost and spared in making that decision. The old phrase: \\" It's Better To Be Safe Than Sorry \\" plays a great role in safety. In some cases we all have to realize, is it worth trying to get through for the sake of saving the company money and then of course there's the reputation factor that plays amongst this go or no-go decision, are you afraid to venture out, have you lost your nerve to brave weather ? It works both ways in the gossip halls of shipping. If you sink in bad weather you shouldn't have been out there or if you wait it out in a sheltered area you're \\" Chicken \\", either way you're costing the company money not to mention lives and your ship if you go for it. But if one ship makes it through one of the worse storms on Lake Superior and one goes to the bottom how does that make the others look and what opinions are formed ? Well, I think this book tells it like it was that day with Capt Paquette expressing his personal views which is his right. I too , as one of the other reviewers think that Capt. Paquette was bordering on arrogance but his facts are from a seasoned Skipper not an armchair critic. Also mentioned is the \\" Wiggling Thing \\" or the strange movement of the hull & deck under certain conditions. I really think this book along with Michael Schumaker's book \\" Mighty Fitz \\" will give readers info on to forming their own assessment of why the \\" Fitz \\" sank , there's a lot of variables to this sinking that are brought to the surface in both books. A good read from a Captain that was there ! And of course \\" Thanks \\" to Capt.Paquette & Hugh E Bishop."},{"Title":"Night the Fitz Went Down","review":"The sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald in Lake Superior some twenty-five years ago has been celebrated in song, story, and film. Now Hugh Bishop examines the main theories about what caused the loss of the &quot;Big Fitz&quot; and for the first time, cites the voice of the last captain alive who piloted a freighter on Lake Superior during that 1957 &quot;storm of the century&quot; that brought about the demise of that great ship and her crew. Blending history with human tragedy, The Night The Fitz Went Down gives the reader an informative, documented analysis of the event, revealing for the first time what may well have caused the tragedy. The Night The Fitz Went Down is &quot;must&quot; reading for anyone with an interest in the fate of the Edmund Fitzgerald and her gallant crew."},{"Title":"Walking the Empowerment Tightrope: Balancing Management Authority & Employee Influence","review":"WTET is one of the few truly practical management development books around. It is for the managerial leader who wants to create high performance. Crosby recognizes that no one is empowered unless there is clear authority. He knows that performance improvement flows from the creative tension between managerial authority in balance with employee authority. Through this balance, in the hands of managers, an employee's contribution can best be made. To achieve this balance he identifies 25 high performance factors in bite-size portions with practical suggests for implementation. The single most important factor he presents is his concept of single-point accountability. This concept will aid those managers and organizations who have taken consensus and teamwork too far resulting in the aimless empowered. While I have few disagreements with this book his concept of \\"sponsorship\\" tends to muddy its clarity around managerial accountability. Managership would be a better term to describe both the leading and managing a competent manager must do to provide direction and resources for employee success. The chapter \\"Survey Feedback-Turning Data into Action\\" could benefit from some mention of the importance of managing the increasing levels of complexity as organizations add levels of work and management. All in all I recommend this book to managers or those wanting to become managers and especially by a manager of managers to use as a book to read in common in a staff learning team to create a common foundation for management development."},{"Title":"Sacred Havens: A Guide to Manhattan's Spiritual Places","review":"What an interesting book.

For anyone interested in getting a good grasp of what any or all of these religions is about, I'd recommend this book for this benefit alone. Much of the chapter on Buddhism was superb: the difficult teaching of \\"no self\\" is explained as well as I've seen it presented anywhere. Similarly the heart of Islam seems well explained (in just a 27 page chapter): for anyone who doesn't appreciate the power of Islam, I'd strongly recommend this chapter. The other 3 religions are also presented with care and apparent respect.I had, however, a number of problems with the book:1. The presentation seems Pollyanna-ish, despite Rue's concerns at the end of book of the future of religion. For example, the chapter on Christianity doesn't mention early Christianity's persecution of Gnostic Christians and destruction of their literature, nor the Inquisition, nor the European wars between Protestants and Catholics, nor recent problems such as those in Northern Ireland. Rue's claim of \\"social coherence\\" as a key benefit of religions seems questionable, yet he seems not disposed to questioning it.Rue claims the goals of \\"personal wholeness and social coherence\\" with only a brief warning that religious institutions might abuse their regulatory activity. B.F. Skinner devoted a chapter of \\"Science and Human Behavior\\" to the issues of religous control. Do Rue's appeals to human nature establish that a regard for \\"personal wholeness\\" is a key factor in religions? If it is a key factor, does he establish that the meaning of \\"personal wholeness\\" isn't often inappropriately manipulated by religious authorities, beyond what might be needed for adequate \\"social coherence\\"? Is Rue's depiction of religion realistic and has he demonstrated that by any comparison with other plausible depictions? Some people might stay with a religion for other reasons than \\"personal wholeness\\". Is \\"personal wholeness\\" well-defined enough : Rue says it is \\"maximizing satisfaction of motives\\" which seems rather vague and hard to measure. Is it clearly critical to religious participation? Just mostly it and social coherence?2. Rue appears to have a favortism of theism. He calls his book \\"Religion Is Not About God\\" even though one of his major religions, Buddhism, isn't about God to begin with. Sure, some Buddhists treat Buddha as a god and some Buddhist branches acknowledge gods, but that's not the gist of Buddhism. Worse, Rue speaks of the extremes of \\"nihilsim and theism\\" when one opposite of theism, atheism, need not be nihilistic at all, and another opposite of theism, Buddhism, is one of the very major religions that Rue praises for providing meaningfulness.3. In his chapter on Christianity, for example, Rue, focusing on capturing the myth, ignores historical concerns. There is no mention of other religons of the time (excepting Judaism) such as the mystery religons or philosophies such as Stoicism. There seems no consideration at all that a philosophy might provide personal wholeness and social coherence. Rue takes for granted the historicity of Jesus, even though that isn't necessary to establish the myth and even though the historicity of Jesus has long been open to serious question (e.g. \\"The Jesus Puzzle\\"). Rue seems to have oversimplified in his effort to demonstrate that a religion, such as Christianity, leads to personal wholeness and social coherence.4. Rue seems to ignore whether there are non-religious ways to achieve personal wholeness and social coherence. By doing so, he seems in no position to assert that the contribution of religions to these goals exceeds that of other ways.5. While it is intruiging to consider Consumerism as a religion, as Rue does, it's hard to see how Consumerism can offer \\"personal wholeness\\", at least when one considers our American society, which seems to have many lonely, alienated affluent individuals. In fact, Consumerism arguably makes \\"personal wholeness\\" harder to attain, perhaps by leaving individuals with too much time on their hands and often too little meaningful contact with others.6. Here's Rue on human nature: \\"Human beings are star-born, earth-formed creatures endowed by evolutionary processes to seek reproductive fitness...Humans maximize their chances for reproductive fitness by managing the complexity of these systems in ways that are conducive to the simultaneous achievement of personal wholeness and social coherence.\\" Star-born?So where does Rue establish that we need a sense of personal wholeness in order to reproduce? When Rue says personal wholeness is \\"maximizing satisfaction of motives\\", why must it be \\"maximizing\\"? Can't I just get by, and be whole enough and reproductively fit enough? Won't it be stressful to have to maximize my personal wholeness and reproductive fitness? If I have a sex a lot, will that maximize my \\"satisfaction of motives\\" and, by itself, make me feel personally whole? Will satisfying my partner qualify as \\"maximizing conformity to shared standards of behavior\\".7. Rue states that \\"Pinker is delivering the final, if not posthumous, deathblow to behaviorism\\". Perhaps Rue is unaware of a March 2004 article by Roddy Roediger, president of the American Psychological Society and himself a cognitive psychologist, in the APS's Observer entitled \\"What Happened to Behaviorism\\", in which Roediger emphasizes the debt the psychology owes to Skinner and Radical Behaviorism and the ongoing benefits of (Radical) Behaviorism. Perhaps Rue doesn't read \\"The Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis\\" or 'The Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior\\" or recognize the compassionate, helpful work of Applied Behavior Analysts. Rue associates with Behaviorism (during its hegemony) a \\"dogmatic prohibition against all theories of the mind.\\" He characterizes Behaviorism's position as \\"science should not traffic in concepts about unobservable events...\\". But Skinner and Radical Behaviorists acknowledge private events as natural events and hence addressable by the science of Behavior Analysis because science is concerned with natural events whether they are observable or not. What Skinner and Radical Behaviorists object to is the practice of populating mind with fictitious entities (mentalisms) inferred from our behavior.8. Rue not only believes Pinker delivered a deathblow to Behaviorism, he also state the Pinker's \\"How the Mind Works\\" makes \\"a good stab at the subject\\". Rue should read William Baum's \\"Understanding Behaviorism\\", which should give him a strong appreciation of why no one should wish that Behaviorism be dead, but also teach him about the dubiousness of the kind of mentalisms that Pinker's book is drenched in. Rue's analyses of religion doesn't seem to depend on Pinker anyway.9. Rue states that that there be sufficient realism in a religion's root metaphor for it to be accepted. For Christianity, he then notes that the return of Christ to earth at the appointed time for the final judgment would have to have such realism in order for the myth to be effective.But for Islam, it isn't the root metaphor but the nature of who claimed it that he questions the realism of. He writes: \\"If you are a realist about Muhammed's epilepsy, then you are not likely to be a realist about his claims to be a messenger from God\\". Is it realism or ignorant discrimination that would reject Muhammed's claims on that basis? One of the most powerful depictions of God in human history and someone would discount it because it's believed to have been produced by someone suffering from epilepsy? To me it seems all the more marvelous if in fact someone could endure such an affliction and still produce a great work. William James even argued against dismissing the visions of epileptics. Rue seems to define what he means by realism very loosely and then use expand on it abitrarily.10. There seems to be little or no reference to experimental support for Rue's claims: social psychology rather than cognitive science may be more apt for grounding his speculations experimentally.\\"Religion Is Not About God\\" was a mixed blessing. The religous studies was helpful, much of the psychology of religion was unhelpful and the cognitive science seemed a liability. If you want to learn about the religions he covers, consider reading the less speculative parts of Part 2, which were well worth the value of book for me."},{"Title":"Religion is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological Nature and What to Expect When They Fail","review":"I finished this book over a month ago, and it will not leave my mind. In fact I have decided to use it as the subject of my upcoming series of Sunday School lessons, and explaining my planned presentation will be the best way to convey the book to you. First I will make a HUGE spreadsheet filling one wall of the room. At the top I will put the title and Rue's opening question about whether there can even be such a thing as a \\"theory of religion\\" (in his persuasive opinion there can, largely because we humans are similar enough for many commonalities to find their way into our religions even despite the profound diversity our various cultures produce).Then I will make 8 columns.In the left column I will list the various characteristics of all Religions which Rue discusses (I won't list them all here because some explanation and subdivision is required for each, but to give a flavor of this column I will say here that Rue discusses 1) the education of the emotions; 2) the various strategies used by religion - intellectual, experiential, ritualistic, and aesthetic, both at the individual and institutional levels; and 3) two overriding religious functions, namely increasing personal wholeness and enhancing social cohesiveness.The next 5 columns (2-6) will be for the classical traditions which Rue discusses (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism). In each case I will fill in how each tradition fulfills the theory as presented in Column One.The next column (#7) will be for Consumerism as a Religion, and the last column (#8) will be for Religious Naturalism. Note that Rue is ambivalent about whether Consumerism actually qualifies as a Religion, but I found it a fascinating example to use in testing the rest of his theory, and I think it will make an awesome discussion for my class (made up of a nice cross-section of Americans, one Hindu, and one other person who grew up abroad).Each week we will discuss a new column, showing how Rue's theory of religion plays out in a specific cultural and historical context. Although I am officially allotted 4 weeks (which would not be enough), the class is usually very willing to extend a unit, and I anticipate that this discussion will be especially lively. Nonetheless, I will try to save some time by only mentioning and not discussing the \\"doomsday scenario\\" with which Rue introduces his treatment of Religious Naturalism. That is because I do not entirely agree with his implication that the only way Religious Naturalism will ever get a foothold is if some sort of collapse occurs. And besides, while I agree with Rue that such a scenario could play out, our class has already been down that road. For most readers I think it is important to consider Rue's ideas on this point, especially since he uses it to think through how the all-important Religious Naturalism could arise. But the reader should not, in my opinion, let that part of the book distract him or her from the overall point, which is to explore the common wellsprings of all religions.It is a book everyone interested in religion should read. In fact I think it is perhaps the only modern full-blown \\"theory of religion\\" which adequately accounts for what science has taught us about evolution, about the biological roots of our human nature, the psychology that grows out of those roots, and about the ways cultures intersect with that nature to produce local variants on the invariable tendency toward religious experience and practice."},{"Title":"Religion is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological Nature and What to Expect When They Fail","review":"This is a fabulous book that deserves a wide readership. In a world torn by inter-religious strife and the seeming never-ending battle between faith and reason, few things are more important than helping religious and nonreligious people alike celebrate the mythic/religious impulse of humanity from a science-based, naturalistic perspective. I simply cannot recommend this book too highly. Also see his earlier masterpiece, \\"Everybody's Story\\"."},{"Title":"Religion is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological Nature and What to Expect When They Fail","review":"This was the third and best book I have read written by Loyal Rue. He develops here a general theory of religion in this book. Yet you do not have to be a psychology or philosophy major to read the book. I for one am a retired agronomist or horticulturist. He approaches the subject from an evolutionary psychologist point of view, emphasising human nature. Rue claims religion is not about God it is about us. It is not about coping with insecurities, it is about group survival.Rue's approach is to examine the following five religions(Judaism,Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism) to show how they fit his criteria. Then he adds Consumerism to this list, somewhat tongue-in-cheek I think. However, he does note that the prosperity gospel that appears to be a part of this 'religion' may be a \\"well-funded source of resistance\\" against promoting the view that sustainable goals and policies must be enacted to save civilization. He, like I and many others worry that we are using the world's resources at an unsustainable rate.Read this book and find out what the religions of this world have in common as they serve man."},{"Title":"Religion is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological Nature and What to Expect When They Fail","review":"By the Grace of Guile: The Role of Deception in Natural History and Human AffairsFirst, do not let my \\"one-star\\" rating dismay you or retard your interest in reading any of Dr. Rue's books. He is an interesting writer and no-doubt a beguiling lecturer. My review is more of an example of Dr. Rue's life-paradigm/belief system, to put context into \\"Religion Is Not About God.\\" The reader then can be informed (truthfully) as to the perspective from which Dr. Rue writes. Once that perspective becomes clear (which is best understood by reading his ESSENTIAL MASTERWORK \\"By the Grace of Guile\\", 1994, $60 on Amazon!), a discerning reader then understands the template from which all utterances from Dr. Rue must be translated. As such my review serves (using his version of reality) as truly a \\"five-star\\" rating, except for the modifier \\"truly\\", which for him contaminates the point almost (but not quite) completely.Yet that is a good thing, since mere mortals (such as myself) need the grace of greater intellects (such as himself) to tell us \\"just-so\\" stories we need to hear (and believe, like global warming, or \\"Religion Is Not About God\\") so that world peace and human commerce can chug along unabated, allowing his tenure at Luther College to lazily continue into the cold sunset of the Iowa plains. And that is an end that truly is worthy of being called truth, even though he believes ardently there is no such thing (well, almost).Since the above two reviewers have ably discussed the content of Dr. Rue's latest excursion into post-modern truth-teasing, I am lead to shine the light of reality on Dr. Rue's motivations for his latest book on \\"religion\\" so-as others may not become quite so beguiled as might otherwise result. Indeed, the title of his new volume alone (\\"Religion Is Not About God\\") is one a non-religious, born-again child of the Lord Jesus Christ can embrace and love.And playing both sides of the coin, he speaks much near-truth appealing to atheists, naturalists and evolutionists, as the first reviewer coos and qualifies. Yet the dissonance of that reviewer is again a result of his not understanding Dr. Rue's real premise which he spelled out so clearly in his seminal treatise (\\"By the Grace of Guile\\"). There he explains that deception is integral to the 'nature' of things. In the Introduction (of \\"Guile\\") Dr. Rue cites Friedrich Nietzsche's \\"insight\\" that \\"untruth\\" is a condition of life. As my teenagers often exclaim at my frequent cluelessness, \\"Duh!\\"Rue failed to credit the original reporter of this story, Moses, who wrote the first full account of untruth entering the world (empowered, of course, via the Holy Spirit). In Genesis 3 he blew the cover off that headline story 3500 years before Nietzsche's come-lately, National Enquirer-style analysis. Of course Nietzsche is credited for his genius as he expanded the concept to \\"...beyond good and evil\\", as the best Deceivers (see again Genesis 3) always do.Rue's current \\"Religion\\" book is ably written by a man who happily proclaims the only truth is nihilism. Yet in so-proclaiming he borrows Bertrand Russell's famous qualifier \\"almost certainly\\" and modifies it via post-modern double-speak; aka \\"Adaptivism.\\" (see page 274 and following of \\"Guile\\").Dr. Rue goes on (in \\"Guile\\") to allow that Joe and Betty Sixpack recoil in contorted horror when they are presented (by penultimate truthsayers such as himself) with the ultimate, certain reality of nihilism equating to the absolute truth of existence. And since nihilism is seen as such a monstrous horror to most of us common folk (and not just theists, but also the new-school atheists of the Richard Dawkins, \\"God-delusion\\" variety), then the enlightened Illuminati such as himself and the New York Times must feed those masses with sweet lies that lead us to a peaceful life of indentured servitude gladly acquiescing to the \\"almost-certain\\" truths they gracefully posit.But if we dare to throw back Oz's curtain, \\"Guile\\" is in essence Rue's prosaic effort at recanting by analysis John Lennon's nihilist anthem \\"Imagine.\\" Yes, \\"By the Grace of Guile\\" is indeed dressed up in scholarly navy blue hard covers, and carries with it a prohibitive $60 price-tag (that being the price of admission for other would-be Illuminati, such as this reviewer). But I must confess that even for non-illuminated dullards such as myself, \\"Guile\\" is well-worth the price of admission, unlike John's sad song. However, it's value lies only in learning that there are influential, powerful people and establishments that really believe such first-tier, psychotic psychobabble and gobbledygook, and they desire to craft a new world order via feeding lies to the masses while masking the hard-truths only they can assimilate and manage. And therein lies (and I do mean \\"lies\\") the great rationalization (nee intellectualization) which is the paradigm in which the Illuminati are straight-jacketed, permitting them in their own self-certain \\"enlightenment\\" to rule the world of us pathetic morons. And that really means no K-Y for the home team, folks.And if you think I'm exaggerating, read the The New York Times Book Review of \\"By the Grace of Guile.\\" The reviewer proclaims it is one of the 100 most important books ever printed! In there with \\"Love and Will,\\" \\"Walden 2\\" and the \\"NY Times Crossword Puzzles.\\" You do the math.And therefore \\"Religion Is Not About God...\\" is part of the Illuminati-Jihad product-line designed to gracefully guide (via guile) those of us entrenched in the huddled-masses to assimilate Dr. Rue's truth-through-guile-telling with molasses in the Castor oil (or should you prefer reality, it's a piece of dog-poop mixed into the pan of yummy chocolate brownie mix: First question: How much is too much?).So the next question/problem remains for the Jihadis: \\"How do you dress up nihilism so the new-school Atheists, who are convinced in their own life-purpose (THAT's a laugh, way to go Dr. Dawkins!), will buy this book and are only disappointed over Rue's failure to dismiss the historicity of Jesus?\\" (like our top 1000 reviewer above, \\"calmly\\").Answer: Write a book like \\"Religion Is Not About God.\\" Our intrepid reviewer above joyfully and calmly read (though with nervous dissonance dripping though the cracks) every word of Master Rue. Our second reviewer Michael Cavanaugh, apparently a born-again evolutionist/Christian, is going to use \\"Religion\\" as a reference in teaching his Sunday School class, for God's sake! Hosanna, Messiah Rue!!! By the grace of guile!!!So the final question/problem hangs pregnantly, and it represents the greatest challenge and potential penultimate victory for the deception-Jihad (and it will be a penultimate victory at best; see Revelation 20:7-15 for the ultimate reality). The final question is: \\"How do you hook orthodox Christians (like myself) into embracing (and better yet buying) Dr. Rue's graceful guile?Answer: They need some help from good old-fashioned retail marketing. The title alone is what caught my eye. \\"Religion\\" is a bad word for me and my many fellow-followers of our precious Savior, the LORD Jesus Christ. In fact, the first 4 Commandments (see Exodus 20) forbid man to make YHWH (The LORD, The Lord God Almighty, I AM WHO CAUSE EVERYTHING TO EXIST) into a religion. Religion is almost always about man making God in man's own horribly deluded and sinful image (aka \\"nihilism\\" for Dr. Rue, which is his personal religion, with himself as Messiah, so-anointed by the Times).In reality God approves NO Religion except the kind that takes care of widows and orphans in their distress all the while keeping oneself from becoming polluted by the filthy thinking and behavior of the world (James 1:27). God is a Person, THE Ultimate Person and THE Source of life for all people and all stuff; and knowing God personally is His command to all people, His purpose for creation, so He would be known and glorified.Knowing God is all about relationship with Him, walking with Him and being taught by Him by His word, the only Good Book in existence. Knowing Him personally (like a Friend, a Father, our One God) is the definition of true, eternal life in koinonia (authentic fellowship) with God, not ever \\"religion.\\" So Dr. Rue's title appeals to my fellow Christians who understand the destruction religion brings to authentic, personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Religion puts God in a box with a name on it that has nothing to do with Him (but more looks like the deceiver who informs Dr. Rue and the Times editorial board). I wonder how many born-again believers have bought this book because Amazon listed it as something they might find interesting?Count me in. As Rodney Dangerfield once said: \\"the last time I saw a mouth like that it had a hook in it.\\"Ah, the grace of guile. 5-stars for marketing alone for \\"Religion Is Not About God...\\""},{"Title":"A Sound of Thunder / Something Wicked This Way Comes","review":"Dark is truly a scary monster. I cannot think of a more horrifying image than skin being covered with crawling, squirming images that seethe and move deeper under the flesh and surge out in the next moment. One spider crawling up my arm is enough to give me a fit. In movies, an illuminated man usually is pictured as a tattooed man - but that is not what Bradbury created here. This being's skin literally crawls around because of multitudes of images being alive. (Plus, Dark enslaves souls because he feeds on their suffering, and age is not a consideration - he'll take children as well as men and women.) I know I've become jaded to horrific visual special effects in movies. Under the skin crawlies or burns or bloody tears are common. But I've never seen this holographic/maggoty effect done except for where a tattoo of an eagle or other single creature pulls away from the skin and flies off. The other movie effect is some maggots or similar insect-like creatures which bump around under the flesh. But maggoty-like moving faces that seeth and crawl on the skin? It brought to mind a particular Doctor Who episode, which was also creepy, but I think Bradbury's creation was far worse.Now that I've completely freaked you out, you should know this is not a gory or excessively violent book. Perhaps sensitive people should avoid it, but it would be a great book for a father to share reading with a son, and then to discuss responsibility in taking action if someone appears to be in trouble, the social boundaries of friendship and relationships, and how seductions into evil behavior are not always so easy to resist or easy to spot. Of course, this depend on what kind of kid you've got, too. Myself, as a child, I read everything I could get my hands on, so I was precocious to a degree and far ahead of my peers AND parents in comprehension and literary pretensions. I've grown out of part of this, can you guess what I still have to a fault?In this book Bradbury's word choices sometimes run away into thick fogs or overgrown gardens, and sometimes he gets lost exploring a sound/word group of descriptions that he tries to use instead of sentences for atmospheric actions or scenes. He's not as good at this as Dr. Seuss, but then this isn't Bradbury's strength. What he is good at is writing muscular speculative stories with vivid characters who face dramatic ethically challenging situations heroically, which can be read by people of all ages.I don't believe I would like carnivals at all.Sound of Thunder was included in my audiobook of Something Wicked. ... Hello, Tyrannosaurus Rex hunt! Cool!"},{"Title":"Light and Darkness: An Unfinished Novel (Unesco Collection of Representative Works: Japanese Series)","review":"This is the last and unfinished novel of his works. He died suddenly without finishing it.It is the story of the wife, who suspects if her husband loves another woman, and him, who can't forget a past lover. Abandoning his composition style of the individual narrater so far, he represents the different world views from each viewpoint of all the characters. The world of the characters are revealed as the panorama from the point of view of the God. The composition method of each plots proceeding contemporarily is just the modern method of the novel, so I can remember that surprise as if the completion of the Japanese modern novel sprang up under my eyes, the first time I read this novel. The Japanese contemporary novel has already begun at 'Light and Darkness.'This complicated composition method doesn't aim to lose the entertainment reading novels. Rather in reverse. It clarifies the various relationship among each people from their different viewpoints and digs out the psychology of each characters. It is psychological and historical at once. Each plots are the psychological analyses with the amazing insight and at the same time the preparation for the following ones.Readers may pierce the Dostyevskian in this novel. However, and more, they will be surprised at the complicated psychological structure of Japanese women. I have thought even now that there are no analyses of the Japanese culture superior to it. It is why the woman keeps the depth of their own culture in many cases."},{"Title":"Light and Darkness: An Unfinished Novel (Unesco Collection of Representative Works: Japanese Series)","review":"No doubt some novels are much more difficult to translate than others, but the problem is usually that the translator must transform the scintillating language of the original into equally attractive language in the translation. Works like \\"The Master and Margarita\\" (Bulgakov) or \\"The Devil to Pay in the Backlands\\" (Guimaraes Rosa) come to mind. What to do, though, when the original consists of purposely vague and banal conversation for hundreds of pages ? This is the problem faced by translators of LIGHT AND DARKNESS, Natsume Soseki's last work. Soseki's concern with human psychology, the minutiae of daily life, and Buddhist philosophy create a novel that is structurally deep and subtle, but boring in form. Soseki focusses on contradictions in human nature---love vs. self-centeredness, honesty vs. falsity, egoism vs. selflessness, for some examples. His five main characters show varied combinations of positions on these continuums and the novel may have been meant to show their transformation towards more enlightened states. Their progress is slow, almost imperceptible. There is a soap opera-ish quality introduced by the fact that it was serialized in a newspaper in 1916 over 188 days. They engage in endless conversations of extreme mediocrity--the dialogue is nothing if not wooden in English, but I wonder if it could be more exciting in Japanese ? Perhaps it would only seem more natural.Tsuda goes to the hospital for a minor operation. O-Nobu, his wife, visits him, visits her relatives and gets some extra money which the couple needs because they are rather extravagant. Kobayashi, a poor, unemployed former friend, visits Tsuda and advises him to change his attitudes, vaguely threatens to reveal his (not so colorful) past to O-Nobu. Kobayashi visits O-Nobu too, but nothing happens. Tsuda's sister tries to get him to realize his obligations towards his parents. Mrs. Yoshikawa, the wife of Tsuda's boss and a meddler, tries to get Tsuda to change his ways too, sending him to a hot spring resort where at last he meets Kiyoko, a former love, of pure heart, now married to another man. That is the entire story. The reader must concentrate on attitudes and psychology because action is nearly nil, conversations banal. Soseki's ability to probe each character's psyche, both male and female, is at its brilliant height. We don't learn the conclusion because Soseki died before the novel was finished. While Buddhist philosophy and stories planned on a vast scale may appeal to some, I would have to disagree with the translator's comments in my edition. LIGHT AND DARKNESS is neither the best modern Japanese novel, nor Soseki's masterpiece. It is atypical. I am glad that I read it, but that is more because I wanted to know Soseki's work. Put it down to curiosity if you will. If your taste runs to philosophically complex and extremely insightful literature, you may find this a wonderful novel. It is certainly original. However, even though LIGHT AND DARKNESS is widely praised in Japan, I have to look at it from the point of view of potential readers in other countries. I would not recommend it to people looking for \\"a good novel\\" in a standard sense, or for an idea about Japanese literature in general."},{"Title":"Assessing Academic Programs in Higher Education","review":"This book covers all the fundamentals of program assessment, including philosophy, strategies, and all the possibilities and pitfalls when trying to close the program improvement cycle on college campuses.

Also he gives 1-4 stars ranking of important aspects for the New Lunar Year on career, money health and love, a most welcomed addition.The only beef I have is with the publisher and all those in like that dish out books on magickal and feng shui stuff, is the absence of an email or contact address from the author. Readers who buy and read these works obviously will try to apply tips for themselves and more often than not, need clarifications on areas that puzzle or confuse them. What's worst is not having something tried and not work than doing it WRONG and inviting a host of unintended bad vibes or bad luck.

She's broken up with her fianc' because of his philandering habits, and has decided that she will never date another athlete because they can't be trusted. When Casie's mother persuades her to chauffeur Joyce to The Happy Stork to buy some maternity bras, her resolve to stay aloof from the maternity madness weakens and she agrees. While her sister is shopping, Casie meets the hunky clerk, a man named Scott Karstetter. Scott is the kind of guy with whom Casie would love to get involved - a nice regular guy, not an egotistical athlete. But when Scott turns out to be a high school coach, Casie must decide whether she will maintain her resolve, or follow her heart.The set-up for this story is really cute - a man in a role stereotypically filled by a woman. The theme of the novel is that stereotypes are not always true. The author creates a really great character in Scott. He's a masculine man, who loves sports and women. But he also is a kind and caring person who helps his friends, even when it is difficult. Casie is a perfect example of a woman wounded by her former experiences with men, and must learn to trust again. It is fun to watch these two characters interact, and learn from each other. The plot is not contrived; it describes the normal lives of two normal people. This is a sensual novel, with one love scene that is not explicit at all.

It talked about his childhood, the difficulties he's had socially, and with the church. It explained how he became interested in iridology and natural health, and how that eventually lead to his practice.Her description of the court scene was particularly good. I felt like I was right there, and I wanted to squeeze that fat little bad guy's neck. She also tragically told the story of the death of Solomon's son at age two.The book described how the releasing and codes just came to him, then developed over time.

But they key was they lived on a farm where they could self-survive and not in the city, like many of us non-Amish, where we have to be around things that subtly pull our minds, bodies and spirits down without us comprehending this is happening.I enjoyed learning about the man that I have only heard about from afar. Had no idea even some of his own people would persecute anyone with such a gift to help mankind. The 'codes' were something I had not heard about that he did.

You very well may walk away totally cured (I know of several people who can say that, they use the word cured not temporarily helped with pharmaceuticals).

Add to this the command line tools for dealing with wireless, and you have a recipe for confusion. \\"Linux Unwired\\" demystifies the Linux Wireless system, and provides guidance for purchasers to make sure that they buy the most supported equipment possible.It should be noted early on that 802.11b is not the only thing covered in the book. The other variants (a and g) are there, in addition to IRDA (infrared), Bluetooth, and Data over Cellular. On the latter point, much of the content deals with US based providers, but it still provides a good backing on the subject for those of us outside the country.802.11b is the main focus, taking up around half the book. It starts with a discussion of the chipsets behind the cards, and how the map to Linux support. Here is where the reader gets advice on which card to buy, or at least what to look out for when buying a card. One thing I found interesting was the WLAN driver loader, which is an inexpensive product that lets Linux load binary WLAN modules. Some cards are not supported enough in Linux to do things like WEP security, which is where this product comes in. Again, the book leads the reader around the situations when this is necessary and when it isn't.In addition to WEP, other methods of authentication are covered such as 802.1x authentication and 802.11i, the successor to WEP. It's also a good example of the broad scope of the book and a focus on interoperability with existing systems, rather than assuming the reader is building everything from the ground up.Access points take up two chapters, the first looking at how to use them with Linux. Before reading this book, I was under the impression that access points all used web browsers or telnet for configuration, but apparently some need Windows software. There are situations where people have developed software to emulate this functionality, and pointers are provided. The second of the two chapters is on building your own access point, which is a fascinating look at using micro-linux distributions and mini-x86 hardware to build access points with rich functionality (for those less adventurous or well funded, the same can be done with any old hardware). There is also a look at soldering on a serial port to a popular Linksys router to allow command line access to the underlying Linux OS.Bluetooth and IRDA are less common uses of wireless that let computers speak to phones and PDAs. I was completely unaware of the level of support that existed in Linux until after I read these chapters. While the Bluetooth coverage was comprehensive, it went to a deeper level of detail than I thought necessary, such as a detailed breakdown of the Bluetooth stack of protocols. However, at the end, it is possible to use Bluetooth and IRDA to pull data from devices, and to connect to their resources (ie modems and databases) over the air.I should also mention the chapter on GPS. It is fairly thin on its own, but as an addition to the 802.11b section (ie wardriving), it does well.A couple of things stood out about this book. The first is that the target audience isn't necessarily Linux geeks, but Linux users. You don't have to be a Linux guru to get this stuff running, the level of detail is sufficient to get anyone who isn't scared of a command line up and running. The second is that the authors spent a lot of time testing various hardware. Many wireless cards and Linux distributions were tested in the early chapters. Where several options for software existed, they were all looked at (such as the source vs binary drivers mentioned above). This all adds to the book's value not only as a howto manual for wireless, but also as a guide for navigating through product and software selection.\\"Linux Unwired\\" is perfect for anyone who wants to use wireless on Linux, be it connecting to an 802.11b network, or trying to use a cell phone to send a fax. Those looking to purchase equipment will want to go through the book first to make use of the product advice and compatibility testing.More information is available from the O'Reilly website at http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lnxunwired/index.html which includes a sample of chapter 3, \\"Getting on the network\\""},{"Title":"Linux Unwired","review":"I was impressed with this book. It's short and focused. It strays a little on the non 802.11 chapters, but that seems to be the way with all of the O'Reilly wireless books. Here is the blow by blow:Chapter one is WiFi basics, it's short and solid. Chapter two is about the hardware and it's quite in depth in terms of getting the interface card installed and configured. Chapter three is about connecting to the network it's a little short and basic, some more effort could have been spent there. Chapters five and six are about the server side of the equation. Chapter six is a bit long, it's about building the server and covers the entire setup from hardware to software configuration. Chapters seven through nine are about non 802.11 networking through bluetooth, infrared and cellular. These chapters are a little skimpy and graphics heavy, but you probably won't be getting the book for them. Chapter ten is a brief introduction to GPS.I would recommend this book to anyone with issues around Linux wireless network. Linux documentation can be a morass and it's worth your time and money to plunk down a book that walks you through the process."},{"Title":"Linux Unwired","review":"This is a valuable book for two reasons.First of all, and most significantly for a Linux book, it's hard to get a handle on the subject from the free information available on the web. I'm sure all of the information in this book is out there, but it's scattered far and wide, and this book is clearly a big time saver.Second of all, the authors know their subject inside and out, and they have organized it pretty well. I have an Orinoco card, and the explanations of the differences in the various drivers for the card have been extremely helpful to me. Some drivers will let you scan for wireless networks, and others won't -- that's the sort of thing that would burn hours and hours of troubleshooting time, but it's all explained clearly here.I bought this book so I could get a wireless connection going on a Linux From Scratch laptop, but after reading the book, I'd like to build my own access point with Linux."},{"Title":"Linux Unwired","review":"Based on postings to user forums it seems that one area of Linux where people tend to have a lot of problems getting it to work is wireless networking. With wireless finally coming into its own over the last couple of years &quot;Linux Unwired&quot; is a very timely and useful book. All the aspects of wireless in all of its current manifestations are covered including Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), Bluetooth, infrared, cellular networking, and global positioning system (GPS) devices.Before getting into the details of getting Linux to work with wireless the authors provide a thorough understanding of radio waves and how they act, hardware, and antenna types. Understanding these basic concepts is important if your system is to work the way you want.One of the really nice features of the book is the information on picking the right card so you have the fewest problems getting things up and running. The authors even name specific manufacturers and card models that work well with Linux and then they go through installing the driver and configuring the software to work with the device. Along the same lines they provide information on Linux friendly access point providers and even building your own access point.One you have your Linux system up and running on wireless there is a chapter on locating hotspots and using them to get onto the Internet. This chapter really only covers the basics of locating hotspots. If you are really interested in this area you might try another O'Reilly book just on this subject titled &quot;WarDriving, Drive, Detect, Defend&quot;. Of course, if you are concerned about your wireless security (and you should be) it includes information on configuring Wired Equivalency Protocol (WEP) and Wireless Protected Access (WPA).If you are anticipating moving your Linux system to a wireless interface you can't go wrong with &quot;Linux Unwired&quot;. The authors do an excellent job of providing all the information you need to get it done right. &quot;Linux Unwired&quot; is highly recommended for anyone interested in Linux wireless networks."},{"Title":"Linux Unwired","review":"I didn't even originally realize this book had a chapter on cellular data until I found Brian Jepson's site, Jepstone.net, and began reading about using cellular phones and PCMCIA modem cards. This book's cellular chapter was just what the doctor ordered! There are instructions for Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cingular and T-mobile, that make things more manageable even for advanced Linux users. Way to go, guys!"},{"Title":"Linux Unwired","review":"The authors describe the convergence of two trends. The first is the usage of linux as a free operating system. This has intersected with the second trend, wireless networking. The book is a detailed description of the extent of this overlap. To some of you, it will be a sign of the vitality of the linux market; that it already has and continuous to develop support for the major wireless modalities.Half the book is devoted to WiFi. A direct measure of its popularity. It describes the various types of hardware available for the different 802.11 protocols. Specific instructions on installing and using. They also provide an entire chapter on the installing and running of an access point. Some WiFi users have this as their key need, because the access point is how a WiFi net communicates with the rest of the world.Other types of wireless interactions are possible. Bluetooth. Infrared. Cellular. GPS. Each gets its own chapter. Typically with a survey of the latest vendors' hardware. The level of discussion is detailed enough for practical use."},{"Title":"Linux Unwired","review":"Although slightly dated, this book is an excellent resource for wireless communcations with Linux. It also covers a lot of information about wireless computer communications in general. Want to build your own access point? The info is in this book! There are lots of ideas to build from in here!"},{"Title":"The Gift of the Atonement: Favorite Writings on the Atonement of Jesus Christ","review":"\\"Without the Resurrection, the gospel of Jesus Christ becomes a litany of wise sayings and seemingly unexplainable miracles-but sayings and miracles with no ultimate triumph. No, the ultimate triumph is in the ultimate miracle: for the first time in the history of mankind, one who was dead raised himself into living immortality. He was the Son of God, the Son of our immortal Father in Heaven, and his triumph over physical and spiritual death is the good news every Christian tongue should speak.\\"--Howard W. Hunter, page 84.This is my new favorite book. I hope it starts appearing at baptisms, confirmations, ordinations, farewells, and in Christmas stockings.As Joseph Smith taught, the atonement is the central doctrine, with all other things being mere appendages (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 121). This book, then, focuses us on this one thing that matters most. This book has selections from both the prophets and the scholars.Contributors include Presidents Howard W. Hunter, John Taylor, and Bruce R. McConkie. In fact the first entry is by Joseph Fielding Smith, so it starts out on the right foot. But other contributors are Chieko Okazaki, Sheri Dew, and Ardeth Kapp, so we have the distaff adding testimony. There are even quotes by Hugh Nibley, Gerald Lund, and it also has Steven Robinson's \\"Parable of the Bicycle,\\" so all the bases are covered.Also included are Orson F. Whitney's, and Melvin J. Ballard's visions of the SaviorTwo criticisms: There is no index, just a table of contents, and they missed Joseph Smith's quote that I alluded to earlier. The first is forgivable, the second isn't. They also missed Lorenzo Snow's, David O. McKay's and David B. Haight's visions of the Savior (Ensign, Nov. 1989). People at Desert Book can e-mail me for more comments.This is not a \\"brass-knuckles\\" doctrinal treatise, but a soft, reassuring testimony of Christ and how His atonement applies in our lives. Indeed, this book provides a great way to buttress talks, testimonies, and lessons with verifiable and reliable statements on the Savior.I have nothing but raves about the packaging. The book is both informative and beautiful. The profound picture fix the passion and emotion associated with Christ's life. Philosopher Adam Smith pointed out in his \\"Theory on Moral Sentiments\\" that sight was the key to moral feelings, and they have capitalized on our capacity to feel by sight.This book provides a great overview of the Atonement from many authors and many points of view. All of these testimonial arrows hit their target, which is our heart and our mind."},{"Title":"The Gift of the Atonement: Favorite Writings on the Atonement of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a very good book about the atonement.

Each time I read a section/chapter, I learn and feel so much about my Savior. The way these authors share their testimony and feelings about Christ is so clear and wonderful. Their words hit me deep down and I can actually imagine the scenes they are describing about the Savior's life and his love for us. Reading about their feelings and experiences helps me to conform my life more to the will of the Savior because I can feel the spirit deep in my soul. I just feel really good every time I sit down and read a few chapters. Especially when I start wondering why I'm having a problem or a challenge, reading a chapter in this book reminds me of how much Jesus Christ went through and his willingness to do that for me, and all of mankind. I recommend this book for everyone who is a Christian."},{"Title":"The Nazi Germany Sourcebook: An Anthology of Texts","review":"This book is long overdue for students of Nazi Germany that have not yet mastered the German language. Included in this book are chapter after chapter of important primary documents from the late 19th century and World War I to the Historians Debate concerning Nazism in the late 20th century.Stackelberg includes a very readable introduction to each chapter that puts the documents in that chapter in their historical perspective. Most documents are ordered chronologically, however a few are thematically ordered because they're best viewed in that context.This isn't a book of just dry Nazi government documents either, it includes works from others that were influential in the development of the Nazi ideology, such as Wagner.In contrast to other books, such as the series by Nokes and Pridham, this book also includes an index, which prevents scholars from having to search through the entire book to find a document on a particular subject.This book should be read by anyone that has a serious interest in Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Nazi Germany Sourcebook: An Anthology of Texts","review":"Stackelberg and Winkle do a magnificent job of accumulating important primary sources into one, easily accessible sourcebook. Whether you are writing a dissertation on a topic of Nazi Germany, or are just looking for extra reading material, this book is not only useful, but also intriguing. Over 150 primary sources are included within the text, each including an introductory paragraph or two, which means you are getting your moneys worth.I initially bought this book for my Nazi Germany class, but found myself reading through it for fun. I had never been into the historical topic of Germany during the WWI and WWII period until I opened this book, but now its one of my favorite subjects. Many people think they know, at least in a moderate sense, about the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party, but questions about what influenced Hitler's radical anti-Semitism and how he was able to seize and use the emotions of one of the most intelligent nations in the world are answered. I recommend this book to anyone even vaguely interested in Nazi Germany or how one of the world's most devastating genocidal wars came about."},{"Title":"The Dragon of Lonely Island","review":"I am 8 years old and I loved this wonderful book .

This was read aloud in my daughter's fourth grade class and this description (taken literally as a 9 year old will do) was shocking and hurtful to my daughter. Even though the story continues along to a happy conclusion for Mei-lan, Mei-lan is repeatedly described as \\"worthless\\" in the story.The other kids in her classroom definitely picked up on this, as the boys in the classroom got a hoot about claiming that they were better than girls. And a bully in the classroom increasingly tormented my daughter for the rest of the school year. Was that related to the marginalization of Chinese girls?

This book is about a 3-headed dragon and the three kids who visit Lonely Island. The dragons are NOT in any way blood-sucking or in other words they don't feast on humans. The dragons tell tales to the 3 children and they each have a moral from which each child benefits off of. I have read a lot of books with dragons in them, from Harry Potter to Jeremy Thatcher Dragon Hatcher, but this is dragon life from a point of view that most people wish for dragons to be like."},{"Title":"The Dragon of Lonely Island","review":"Not a slow or dull page in this childen's adventure book about these 3 dragons in one! My 9yr old, reluctant to read fiction was so captivated, he read it three times in a row."},{"Title":"The Dragon of Lonely Island","review":"This book tells the story of Sarah Emily, Hannah, and Zachary and their adventures on Lonely Island where they meet the Tri-Drake who introduces them through stories to Mei-Lan, a girl in ancient china, Hitty and Will, a brother and sister whose plane crashes on a deserted island, and Jamie, the kitchen boy on an old pirate ship during the nineteenth century. It is a very wonderful book, but some of the descriptions are vague and written for a younger audience. I would reccomend this book for readers ages: 5-12."},{"Title":"The Dragon of Lonely Island","review":"This is about some children who stumble upon a &#65533;tri-drake&#65533; and listen to stories by each of its three heads. My son read this a few years ago (I think when he was 6...)and read it over and over and over and over! I read it with him sometimes and thought it was not bad - good book with some lessons thrown in. Plus - there's a DRAGON in it!"},{"Title":"The Dragon of Lonely Island","review":"This book is mainly about a group of kids that found a dragon and every time they went to see the dragon they got told a stroy. Well I thought thats somehow the writer should have put more action in. The plot was OK but kinda boring. But what happenes in the story is three stories and there is no main story line.

I give this 5 stars because I love dragons and the writer did a good job of writing this story. I love this book and I hope you will to."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"No doubt about it, \\"Tell No One\\" is a gripping read, one of those books that late at night finds your clock a mortal enemy. Coben spins a story guaranteed to draw in even the most jaded thrill seeker.Rather than simply rehash plot points, let me say that while the book is a great escape, it does have flaws worthy of downgrading its rating from a perfect score.The first problem lies in what I call \\"The One Pager\\" - that mysterious character that appears briefly to tie all the strings together. It's a cheap writer's trick and beneath the rest of the book. I felt a bit cheated.The second problem lies in the cliched stereotyping of politicians (always bad), businessmen (always bad), drug dealers (not only good, but with hearts of gold), and others. This lends an air of smug superiority that detracts from the rest of the novel.The third problem may or may not be an issue for some, and that is the switches between voice. The main character speaks from his limited perspective, but then the next chapter is from an omniscient narrator's point of view. This alternating change of voice was definitely different, but felt odd in reading. Definitely the reader's call.\\"Tell No One\\" may not win any literary awards, but for anyone seeking a good way to wile away the hours, it's a fine way to forget the rest of the world."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I was browsing the book section in the grocery store today, hoping to find another true crime story. The title of this book caught my eye(I just watched 'Don't Say a Word' on DVD) and when I read the back cover, I thought, okay [that price]for a book isn't bad and the story sounds interesting. I started reading at 2:30 this afternoon and I just finished it(6:15 PM - I would have read it faster but I had to keep putting it down to make dinner and check on my kids - believe me it was hard to put this book down). I thought I had figured out what was going on about halfway through the book and I was completely wrong. When I read the last page and a half all I could say OUTLOUD was WOW, no way, WOW as the chills went up and down my spine. Excellent read, you won't put this book down until the end! Bravo to the author!!! Harlan Coben has now been put on my list of most favorite authors."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"With TELL NO ONE, Harlan Coben demonstrates in a big way that he can be terrifying and terrific even away from Myron Bolitar. The plot twists and turns as the reader learns -- or thinks he learns -- whether Elizabeth Beck was really murdered 8 years ago. And why the events of that night have come back to haunt her husband David . . . and can cause death again and again. I had to take my blood pressure when I read this one, to make sure it didn't get too high from excitement. And unlike many well-plotted but weakly written thrillers, Coben's writing here is superb. TELL NO ONE is a gem."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Excellent story telling. Strong characters. Good pace. The story entertains you and the book is very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One is one of those edge-of-your-seat thrillers that make you want to ignore all of your responsibilities i.e. children, chores, work, etc., etc., just so you can keep on reading. Seriously, I did not want to put this book down. It's a little less than 400 pages, but they really flew by. And that's really how I like my mysteries. I don't want them to drag, I want to care about the characters, and I want a plot and resolution that's not too simple yet not too complex. 2 out of 3 ain't bad.I guess the reason I gave Tell No One three stars instead of four is because of the plot twists. Now, don't get me wrong, I like plot twists as much as the next mystery-thriller fan. It's way better than a great sounding plot that has you guessing the killer in about fifty pages [glares at The Vanishing of Katharina Linden]. However, there is such a thing as too much. When the first plot twist came up, I was like \\"Whoa!\\". When the next one came it went \\"Intrigue!\\". Then, they just kept popping up in a span of fifty pages, which were the last ones, and then I was like \\"Don't think too much about it otherwise you'll find tons of little plot holes that would blow that theory to the water...\\" This book would've been a bit better if one of those \\"plot twists\\" had gone unexplored. I'm not picky to one in particular. But after a while it becomes a bit mind-bending (and not in that good way).So, again, I liked Tell No One. It flew by for me and I really was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I also really loved the characters and thought Beck was a really great, sympathetic, hero. However, too many plot twists really made this a \\"suspend belief just for a couple of seconds\\" type of book. But like I mentioned at the beginning, 2 out of 3 really isn't that bad."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck is trying to get on with his life. 8 years ago, his wife disappeared from their lakeside hideaway, and he was suspected of foul play until other evidence pointed to a serial killer in the area. Case closed...or is it? Now, he is receiving cryptic messages, apparently from his dead wife. He determines to find out if she's still alive, and the chase is on.This was the first \\"stand-alone\\" thriller from the author of the wonderful Myron Bolitar mystery series, and it is a chilling, relentlessly-paced thrill ride of a novel. The innocent-man-on-the-run theme is reminiscent of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and the hero is someone to root for. The recent French film version was very good, but the book is even better. And when you're finished with this one, try his other excellent thrillers. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"What a great thriller! From the first page to the very last, the author never let up the pace. I cannot read a book straight through, but I was tempted to try with this one. The characterization was marvelous, especially the author's encouragment to empathize with the protagonist in his possibility of recovering a great loss. Bits and pieces of the puzzle were revealed through a well developed plot but the entire understanding of the situation was not revealed until the very end. I don't like reviews that give too much of the plot away so I will just say - read it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"'The Greedy Jew' was about the only stereotype missing from this book. On several occasions I threatened to put the book down but the story itself was just good enough to keep me going in spite of characters that amount to little more than caricatures. Coben's view of people hinges on bigotry. It's amazing how many stereotypes filled this one book. From the 6' tall, gorgeous, blond, supermodel that draws adoring gazes from all the poverty stricken minorities at the free clinic on the poor side of town to the requisite black street thug named 'Tyrese'. LOL! Unbelievable! More amazing is the balding, ambulance chasing attorney who tells Tyrese to stop with all the posturing because he is no more menacing than Mary Poppins (oh, brother) even though Tyrese just killed a man in cold blood just an hour earlier. Okaaay! Of course the stereotypes wouldn't be complete without the overbearing gay who threatens to knee the District Attorney in the groin. What a farce! Even with these short comings I still give the book 3 stars solely because it was a good story with unique plot twists. This book has been made into a movie by producers who, thank God, were not saddled by Coben's narrow view of society so they eliminated the unnecessary stereotypes. The movie, now on DVD gets 5 stars.Hopefully, Coben will eventually learn that all gays are not overbearing, all doctors and lawyers not self righteous, all blacks are not street criminals and you don't have to be a 6' blond to be stunningly attractive. What year is this again??"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"How riveting is Tell No One by Harlan Coben? It was riveting enough that I carried this book with me everywhere I went for two days straight. I find Coben to be a step above the other prolific mystery writers, such as James Patterson and Robert Parker.Pediatrician David Beck is a young widower, having lost his wife eight years before in a heinous crime. Elizabeth Beck was kidnapped and found dead along the side of a road five days later. David was clubbed with a baseball bat and left for dead. Beck has never gotten over the loss of his wife, immersing himself in his work. One night, he receives an email telling him to click on a hyperlink at \\"kiss time.\\" Only Elizabeth knew that was 6:15 PM. David starts double-checking on the things that happened eight years ago. Two bodies are also found near the original crime scene (a long-abandoned overnight camp owned by the Beck family) and the police begin to think that Beck may actually have been his wife's killer. As Beck begins investigating what really happened that night, it becomes obvious that he is dealing with a rich, powerful and dangerous person. It is a race to clear his name and to find out the true story before Beck himself is killed. This one had me going until the surprise ending.What makes me appreciate Tell No One is the fine writing. From page one, Coben pours it on. Beck observes \\"There are misfortunes we almost expect in life--what happened to my parents, for example--and then there are other dark moments, moments of sudden violence, that alter everything. There was my life before the tragedy. There is my life now. The two have painfully little in common.\\" Also, Coben has one of the best supporting characters in any mystery, drug dealer Tyrese Barton. Dr. Beck treats Tyrese's blind, hemophiliac toddler son. It will take Tyrese's unorthodox talents to help the endangered doctor.I don't pick up every book that Coben publishes, but when I do read one, I'm never disappointed."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"LOVED it and am instantly hooked on Harlan Coben, can't wait to read more by him."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One by Harold Coben is a thrilling novel that I had trouble putting down.Coben seems to have a way of drawing you in, sometimes for hours at a time without even realizing it. Tell No One is directed at anyone over the age of 17 with strong references to drugs, sex, murder and other adult matters. One of my favorite aspects of the book was the way Coben used situations to develop his characters. It worked very well because he didn't just describe them, he used their actions to describe themselves. The plot was also especially strong. I found myself trying repeatedly to figure out just how it was going to end, and without fail I was wrong each time. Tell No One is a great book because it keeps you guessing and you are always on the edge of your toes while reading it. The many twists and suspenseful cliffhangers made it extremely hard to put down.Coben's writing style really affected my feelings personally towards the characters in the book and I found myself rooting for Dr. Beck the whole time. I felt like I connected with Beck throughout the entire book, just from the way Coben described him and the feelings and emotions he had. I felt strong remorse towards those who went against Dr. Beck, which I saw as a good sign because I was relating to what was happening in the book.I thought this book was wonderful and I give it my strongest of recommendations. Coben's combination of suspense and his eerie way of twisting the plot just when you think you know what's going to happen make this a thriller everyone should read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Now this is one thriller. A book which once gets in your hands will never come down. I had a tough time at my work place. I mean i was literally lost in this one and got up only when i finished it off.This is the first book i have read of Harlan Coben but definetly not the last.You actually visualise the whole book like a slick movie.(By the way when are they coming out with the movie?).Suspense till the end! Not many books can achieve that!I had a tough time keeping the book down. Don't believe me? Try it out!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I very much enjoyed the twists and turns of &quot;Tell No One.&quot; Coben succeeds in writing a fascinating tale of intrigue and mystery. The characters are well drawn and you care for them. However, I read this book after &quot;Gone for Good.&quot; I noticed many similar plot twists and characters. &quot;Gone&quot; kept ringing in my ears--the stories are different, but too many things reminded me of the other book. I don't want to be too specific and ruin it for those who have not yet read it, but the echoes are there. Still a fun, easy, and engrossing read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Mr. Coben has not only written such a nice book, but also he is so abreast with the information technology. The book is chilling right from the start. You may not want to leave it unless you finish it.It's a good material for a Hollywood movie. Directors..?? are you listening."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I just love Coben. His characters are alive, his writing is crisp, and he just can't help but be funny.He also really LIKES and respects women and is not homophobic - two traits virtually unheard of in male mystery writers.I couldn't put this book down and kept on reading even though I had LOTS of other things to do - it was that good.And ... for what it's worth, I think the final twist is fine."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I'll be the first one to admit that I don't like a difficult-to-read book. &quot;Tell No One&quot; takes that notion to the other extreme. It was far too easy of a read, as I was flipping thru the pages like i would a comic book, and I found myself on the 300th page without realizing it. The writing was incredibly informal as it sorta read like a movie script.But in the end what really counts? None of us read mystery novels to improve our vocabulary. We want a mystery novel that intrigues us and captures the reader's attention. &quot;Tell No One&quot; had a gripping plot that entertained the whole way thru. The twists were not forced like in other books. They eased into the plot and kept me surprised the whole way thru. And I loved every minute of it. Part of the reason the novel worked is because it did not take itself too seriously. Plenty of comedic elements hid any flaws the book might have contained.Overall, an A-level mystery!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I loved it--couldn't put it down but was disappointed by the final plot twist. It negated the premise of the entire story of David's (the main character) not having a clue into why someone might want his wife dead. Let's see--something like this happens and then a couple months later your wife is killed, and you just think it's a coincidence? The last plot twist just does not make sense. But it is a great mystery--just do not read the ending."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"We called this book, &quot;That D@mn Book&quot; last summer because it was very difficult to put down. It was floating around the shore house, and when someone was reading this book, that person did little else. My husband stayed up until 3 am, and my sister-in-law was ignoring her kids on the beach, just to give a few examples. This is a page-turner to say the least."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell no one is excellent thriller I absolutely loved I could not put it down once I started reading it. It is full of surprises and twists and turns, and you will have no clue whats going or whats going to happen untill Coben wants yout to. This book has the most shocking unexpected ending ever. I'm not a reader at all in fact I hate it but when I started reading this book I couldn't stop I read in 3 days! Coben keeps you in complete suspense untill the very end which is good because it makes the book harder to put down because you want to know what's going on, I practically lost myself in this book I could picture the story in my head and felt like in some way I was part of the story it was wonderful. Coben is a excellent writer,I will definitley read more of his books. Tell No One is awesome I reccomend this book to everyone it will keep you in suspense and the ending will not let you down, it is a great page turner."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first read of a Coben novel. A fine writer and one I'll go back to, hoping for something better in his other books. For a less accomplished writer I'd ... him. For any piece of fiction the reader has to believe in the characters, in every line. The ending of this novel reveals a secret that makes all of the actions of the good doctor suspect. He never questions the disappearance and death of his wife Elisabeth, even after she's been beaten up, after he's done what he's done (I won't give away the ending); attributing it all to a serial killer. He makes all of these logical deductions (the ones involving the emails) which are actually endearing. But he's had 8 years to think about all of this and hasn't considered any other possibilities? Sorry, but his editor and first readers were asleep at the wheel. For a writer as good as this, it's the waste of an otherwise wonderful piece of writing."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"David and Elizabeth Beck are married just a few months, but have been in love since the second grade. The newlyweds revisit their old stomping grounds near Lake Charmaine, Pennsylvania. They go swimming at night together, but their joy turns to horror as Elizabeth begins screaming. David goes help his soul mate, but someone clubs him with a baseball bat. Later, the police find a corpse that Elizabeth's dad identifies the body as that of his daughter while David physically recovers in a hospital. Serial killer KillRoy left his trademark on the body.Eight years later and now a pediatrician, David works at a Washington Heights clinic when he receives a strange e-mail with a hyperlink. He clicks on the link only to see Elizabeth appear on the monitor. However, before he can follow up, the FBI focuses on David as the killer of Elizabeth and two other men murdered on the property that day when his wife allegedly died. Someone else also observes David closely. A person with resources who wants vengeance on the individual who murdered his son. This billionaire knows the Becks are somehow involved.Without any doubt, TELL NO ONE is Harlan Coben's best work to date. This breathtaking thriller starts at a rapid pace and accelerates even faster than the speed of light. The tale is loaded with numerous shocking twists and unreal turns that Mr. Coben makes believable. Thus, the audience feels compelled to keep on reading until the finale in order to learn what really happened back then and why.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"As a mystery writer with my first novel in its initial release, I have noticed that Harlan Coben has had a mighty high profile at every recent mystery convention I have participated in as an author. He has been guest honor, toastmaster, charity auctioneer, and participant on the most popular author panels. His recnt work, TELL NO ONE, perfectly illustrates the reason for this fine author's enormous popularity. TELL NO ONE, a stand-alone thriller, involves a man named David Beck who has rebuilt his life following the murder of his wife, who also happened to be his childhood sweetheart. As David continues to attempt to move on from his great personal tragedy, suggestions arise that unanswered questions involving his wife's death can still be answered. David sets out to answer those questions in this most fulfilling thriller. TELL NO ONE is a great book, and Harlan Coben proves his literary range stretches far beyond his popular series set-up. I recommend this book heartily."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"While reading this book I kept seeing it as so many of the movie thrillers that are out today. You spend a lot of money and walk out feeling like you have been ripped off, which, indeed you have been. On a positive note, I checked this book out from the library and didnt buy it.The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I actually finished it and there was something that made me want to see how the whole bloody mess would finally end. What an unbelievable plot, flimsey characters and mediocre (at best!!) writing style.If you enjoy books that have some element of style and depth and memorable characters, then dont bother with this book. If you like poorly written books, with characters you could care less about then this may be the book for you.Im still shaking my head over all the positive reviews that made me want to read this book in the first place. I just dont get it!!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One by Harlan Coben. What an apt title because you should tell no one to buy this book. Ok, it wasn't that bad, but I could not recommend it to anyone who likes a meaty book with depth.The whole story deals with a guy whose wife was supposedly murdered eight years ago and has now possibly come back from the dead by sending cryptic emails and webcams of herself. The book was so breezy! I read it very quickly as there was just nothing to it. The finish was so rushed and unfulfilling."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck survived that horrible night eight years ago. The same night his wife was abducted and he was left for dead. The same night he looked upon the face of his beautiful wife for the last time. Everyone tells him to begin his life again in order to erase the heartbreaking memories of the past but for Dr.Beck this is an impossible task.A message appears on his computer with a phrase that only his dead wife would know. Is Elizabeth alive? Beck as been warned to tell no one. He flees from those he trusts and dives deeper and deeper into a pool filtered with a deadly secret.The author carries his reader along with the finesse of a circus clown dangling candy before a crowd of children. I could not turn the pages quickly enough while adhered to my seat. This story was well written and flowed like a river to the very last sentence. As soon as I read the final page, I closed the book, sighed with a smile, and then took my patient puppies out for a walk. I look forward with much anticipation to reading another acclaimed novel by Harlan Coben."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I just had my wisdom teeth pulled and I was having problems falling asleep. I was laying there thinking about the pain. So I got up and took a couple Tylenol PM. That should've worked and probably would have had I not started reading &quot;Tell No One.&quot; I soon forgot about the pain and sleep altogether. Next thing I knew it was 4:00 am.I am usually not a fan of mysteries and other genre fiction. I tend to like reading what would be called &quot;literature.&quot; This book has made me doubt myself.I won't tell you what happens at all (read it yourself), but I will tell you that of the 20-25 people who work at my bookstore, 6 have read this book and all 6 consider it one of the best BOOKS they've read in years. These are people who read 3-5 books a month.Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The plot goes from intriguing to unbelievable, with lots of artificial constructs and holes in the story. It was a fun read but only up to a point, about half-way through. Then it went rapidly downhill. In the end, I felt it was shallow and manipulative of its readers.Like bad science fiction...."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I found that I could not put it down. It is a great story, something exciting going on chapter to chapter. I have never read any of Mr.Coben's books before, but this one had such great reviews, I thought I would try it. Well, I loved it. I have spent all afternoon reading it,ignoring my housework, the phone and the doorbell.(Thank goodness for caller I.D.!)Anyway, if you want an exciting thrill ride, read this book, although I do have one small complaint. At the end there is something that I think needed a little more explanation. But it doesn't really take anything away from the book as a whole, so enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Mr. Coben outdid himself this time! This novel had more twists and turns than a mountain road. Before you even read the first page, you might as well resign yourself to the fact that you won't move until you finish it.I was somewhat disappointed to find that Mr. Coben's book was not about Myron Bolitar as I had become very fond of him. Tell No One, however, is Mr. Coben's best story yet. Halfway through this book, I was asking, &quot;Myron Who?&quot;Imagine having your wife be your best friend since the age of seven and after a few months of marriage, she is dead. Eight years later you are still mourning her death only to find that she might not really be dead. Everywhere you turn to discover the truth, you are met with roadblocks and dishonesty. Nothing is what is seems and no one is who you thought they were. Friends aren't necessarily and help comes from the oddest places. The plot is so interwoven that you really need to read it with little or no knowledge just so you can enjoy the ride, and it is quite a ride - right up to the last page. The character development is outstanding. This is a book where you really have feelings about all of the characters - maybe not all are favorable, but feelings, nonetheless.Anyone who enjoys a fast-paced mystery filled with intrigue and surprise must read Tell No One. If you haven't read any of Coben's other books, you might even want to spend the rest of the summer with them. You won't be disappointed and you certainly won't be bored. I will be waiting with great anticipation for his next book."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The beginning of the first chapter seemed a little trite and cliched, but I stuck with it. By the end of the third chapter, this book gave me a chill that not even Stephen King could achieve. Unfortunately, that was the high point. My problems with the novel: 1) Coben occasionally undercuts the seriousness of the situation with sarcasm, and some of his metaphors get in the way (there's a boxing analogy during one key confrontation that goes on too long); 2) Some of the characters (the FBI agents, Eric Wu) are a little too broadly drawn, and seem almost cartoonish; 3)Some of the characters have epiphanies at just the right moment to save their skins (Beck taking his dog for a walk, Elizabeth at the airport); 4)there is a bit too much coincidence, and everything fits together too neatly, like a small jigsaw puzzle; and finally 5) the very last revelation at the end seemed to negate some of what came before, i.e., if it were true, why did Beck do some of the things he did? I know part of the reason I didn't like this novel is me-- I like my fiction very dark (Thompson, Vachss, Sjowall and Wahloo), but the problem also lies with much mystery fiction today-- it's the equivalent of a three card monte dealer, relying more on fooling the reader than it does in being grounded in real-life psychology. As clever as this novel is, I only give it a passing grade."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I regularly lend this book to friends who aren't regular readers and tell them &quot;Just read the first chapter.&quot; They are of course then hooked and read the whole book in less than a week. This book is the reason mystery/thriller readers read. It grabs you and doesn't let go. So, even if you aren't much of a reader but are going on vacation, on a long flight, etc. this is the book to bring with you."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I won't give away the end of this gripping story, but...for those who have not read it, my problem is that the 'killer' just makes the lead character more of an important part of the mystery than one ( as the storyline goes ) who is clueless and is trying to find the truth. Very disappointing conclusion that almost makes the first 99/100ths of the story meaningless."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The story zips along without sacrificng character development. Enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. Villians to hate without having to drown you in detailed viloence. A satisfying and sensible end with one more little twist for the road.

A simply fantastic thriller that lead the reader down a path with so many bumps and turns that it kept one on the edge of your seat to the very last moment! Two thumbs up, highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I first heard about this book through BookSense ( a great publication put out by independent bookstores). I had a great time reading it. The plot is simple: a man who thought his wife was murdered by a serial killer finds himself accused of that same murder eight years later. There is lots of suspense here and Harlan Coben knows how to move pages -- but for seasoned mystery readers there is nothing new. I found I enjoyed the author's running social commentary throughout the story best: Medicaid, drugs, welfare, violence. Also, Harlan Coben's over-the-top characters are plain fun to read about: Shauna (the hugely famous, plus-size, lesbian model) and Eric Wu (the shell-shocked, war-ravaged, terrifying goombah) were two of my favorites in this story.This is the first book I have read by this author and I plan on checking out his earlier work. If you are looking for a quick, easy read you cannot go wrong with this book!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"It's written well enough, and I like the use of technology, esp. the way the author explains it to newbies. The final determination of the son's killer (though actually unimportant) strikes me as contrived....a final twist that adds little to the story, and is a bit of a bait-and-switch. Good enough for a summer weekend, but I wouldn't make a gift of it to anyone."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"If there is one drawback to being a suspense novelist, it's that you are so familiar with the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; mechanics of the genre that you can accurately predict where other suspense novelists (or screenplay writers) are headed long before you reach the end of a book (or movie). The trouble is, you have planted so many clues and red herrings and set up so many twists in your own work that you can usually see them coming from three hundred pages away in somebody else's. This was not the case for me with TELL NO ONE. Harlan Coben has deftly created a true page-turner. For literally the first time in years, I was thoroughly entertained and stumped by a suspense novel, was reluctant to put it down, and found myself pondering the plot whenever I did have to put it down. I had no idea whether the protagonist's wife was truly alive. Though the answer is revealed long before the end of the book, the tension is heightened, rather than diminished, when we find out the truth. The twists are fast and furious as the plot heats up and the pace quickens. Coben manages to create a foreboding atmosphere with the subtlest of details--the mere mention of plastic tarp crinkling in one scene gave me goosebumps. The romantic elements of Beck's relationship with his lost wife were effectively emotional without crossing the line into gratuitous and sappy. Another plus: most of the secondary characters are vividly three dimensional. In particular, I was touched by Coben's poignant characterization of Tyrone, and was pleased that he stuck with gritty reality rather than going for the expected, too good to be true cliche. The story was so streamlined and cinematic that I could practically see the movie's credits rolling when I reached the end. Thanks, Harlan Coben, for a terrific read!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was a GREAT read! It flowed very nicely, the plot well designed. The author is excellent in his ability to create a feeling of unease and foreboding as you make your way through the pages and I sat back and allowed the author to steer me through the story. The ending was a HUGE surprise to me and I did not see it coming, which was so gratifying! In retrospect, the clues are there, just be open to ANYTHING! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am sad it is over! I have never read anything else by Coben and am usually reluctant to try an author I have no experience with....nothing like taking the risk and being disappointed! But now I can't wait to get my hands on other books by this author."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I decided to start reading again, so I go to the book store and pick up a best seller hoping it'll keep me reading. Keep me reading, what an underestimation-- I was hooked. I had to bring it everywhere with me! I even tried reading while I was driving."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"all the unorignal characters you never wanted to meet again are here in this story. the well meaning doctor, the crooked cops, the over-bearing and plus sized lesbian, the self-important defense attorney, the gangsta drug dealer who has a really good heart. don't waste your time on this waste of time."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Please tell no one (sorry) that I missed work because of this. Wow...this is a page turner! I started the book last night at about 8pm, read non-stop until 3am, couldn't sleep because I was all riled up, took the following day off and finished it by 12 noon (even lost weight due to sweat-provoking anxiousness). In general, I have found Coben to be lightweight, with the characters and plot often unbelievable. The dialogue in his books walks the cutesy line a little too much for my tastes as well. This book has much of that (a bit unbelievable--both characters and plot....I especially found the lesbian and african-american &quot;speak&quot; particularly annoying), but it really didn't matter. I was so absorbed in the book, that I found it impossible to put it down. You really aren't allowed to breathe easy at the end of any chapter....constant trouble for our poor Beck. Great book.....lot's of fun.....save it for a day when you have nothing else to do and read it from start to finish."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Coben has written an absorbing and engrossing page turner. He instantly captures the reader's interest on the first page , and clamps down, never letting go.Dr. David Beck and his wife Elizabeth, while on a romantic getaway soon find themselves in a nightmare. Out for a evening swim, David hears his wife scream, then disappear as he tries to reach her. Eight years later, he receives mysterious e-mail messages from her.Although &quot;Tell no one&quot; can be somewhat predictible, and unrealistic, the book is an enjoyable read. It's the perfect book to throw into your straw bag with a bottle of snapple lemonade, and head for the nearest beach, or shade tree.&quot;Tell No One&quot; is a quick thrill, and a fast paced reading adventure. I'm telling everyone to pick up Coben's latest."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben has done it again. Hot off the Myron Bolitar mystery series, which I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone, Coben introduces us to Dr. David Beck. Eight years after his wife is identified as a murder victim of a serial killer, he receives an e-mail that has to be from her. Throw in a crooked aristocrat with some heavy muscle, a lesbian love affair, out-of-sync police officers, and a trying-to-do-right-by-his-son drug dealer, and you have an amazing read. TELL NO ONE is the best book that I have read in the last five years. Get this book, and you will not put it down until the surprise ending. Another solid effort from Harlan Coben."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I don't get it. After just finishing this read, I'm amazed that this author isn't enjoying the notoriety of say a Crighton, Deaver, or Follett. Albeit, I haven't read his earlier serial Bolitar novels yet. But if there is any similarity to this David Beck thriller to those early works, the public is being cheated by not knowing about Harlan Coben. &quot;Tell No One&quot; has a splendid, well thought out and crafted plot surpassed only perhaps by Coben's crystal clear style of moving the story from a gut wrenching intro to a delicious conclusion. There's very little drag in the 330 plus pages but plenty of hot spots with intense action, intrigue and suspense. All developed nicely into good entertainment."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"David Beck's wife, Elizabeth, is inexplicably kidnapped and murdered. Eight years later David, still reeling from the loss receives an email and hyperlink showing a very quick moment of what looks to be his wife, alive!Why write a middle of the road review? Because I like Harlan Coben's stories very much. I listened to this one (audiobook), I liked it, but I wouldn't seek it out again. This story has a great premise, and it is well written and entertaining. But it had one glaring flaw for me that was like the proverbial elephant in the room; the reasoning behind Elizabeth's long disappearance rang so shallow to me. Usually, I am able to overlook something like like this, but not in a story entitled \\"Tell No One\\" with a premise promise like this one. If that wasn't your view then I'd say a four star is about right."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have read this novel over and over, and it never fails to disappoint. Over the years I've lent it out at least thirty times and I have yet to find anyone who doesn't become a fan. Harlan Coben owes me money for the number of people who have bought every book he's ever written because of me lending them a copy. The quality of this book came as a complete surprise after the first six or seven books he wrote. Myron Bolitar seemed like the creation of a guy who had his lunch money stolen every day in the cafeteria. He had no bad qualities and was this super guy who dated supermodels. It was completely canned. Tell No One was the start of his assault on the genre. I count down the days until his next novel is published. Only about 320 to go..."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I took the day off and pulled this book off my shelf. Bought it YEARS ago, but never got around to reading it. I went to the UCLA writers weekend and heard Harlan speak in a writer's conversation and vowed to take time to read all the books I have bought of his that I never got around to read -and boy this was a good one!I'm not going to go into what I loved because there is so many reviews.... but I just had to leave a review and give FIVE stars! I'm on to the newest one in his collection! But yes I definitely recommend TELL NO ONE!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. I would have to call it a thriller classic. I cannot believe that it has not been made into a major movie yet, it would be great on the screen too. It keeps you guessing until the very end and has a very satifying ending too. Coben is such a great author, and I so far this is the best one of his books I have read. I have only read 3, but I will certainly be reading all of the rest! I do not see how this book cannot be given 5 stars...it has it all. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I don't usually read books like this a second time, but it grabs you from the first page and becomes a must read.He is a fine writer and has done exceptionally well here.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One grabs you from the first and races to the end at break-neck speed. In the book, David Beck discovers that his wife, who died several years ago, might still be alive. This novel is about his attempt to find answers and be reunited with his wife. As I was reading Harlan Coben's descriptions of how it feels to lose a spouse, I am convinced that the author Coben has lost someone very dear to him. My husband died suddenly twelve years ago, and the description of the emotional pain felt was exactly as Mr. Coben describes it. I have never found anyone who has been able to capture the feelings of loss as well as this. I read the passages and I kept saying to myself, \\"That's it. That's exactly how I felt.\\" No one can write like that unless they have experienced it. And, believe me, if I thought there was a chance that my spouse was still alive, I would go to the ends of the earth to find him - just as David Beck did in this book. It is full of mystery and suspense as he tries to unravel the truth and be reunited with his dear Elizabeth. Definitely a must read. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"When looking for something to read, I always head to mysteries and thrillers. I like the ones that curl my toes and shiver my bones. Because there aren't many these days that do that, I wondered where this one would lead. I worried that this would be just like so many others our there, a clone of every other one with the disappearing spouse and the husband trying to find her. I did not know Harlan Coben's books, but Tell No One intrigued me from the start. Imagine my surprise when I read it and found it to be one of the best stories in a long time. I didn't find the usual predictable ending, and I am not sure yet if I like it. What I did find was that Beck was an exciting character who responded well to his challenges. I wanted to find out if his wife was really alive. I wanted to find out why she did what she did, if it really was she who was sending those e-mails. I completely enjoyed his narration, revelations and humor. I read the book at one sitting and enjoyed being completely involved in a story. My cat loved the fact that I didn't move at all while reading, and I was happy that there was a book out there to tingle my toes as the night moved on to the morning. I thought the book was fun, intrguing and certainly one to recommend to others. I don't know Coben's other main character in his other series of books, but this one was decent, pliable and haunting. I do plan to read other books by this author, and I hope to find his name on future best selling lists."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck has managed to put his life back together in the 8 years since an attack by a serial killer which claimed the life of his wife, Elizabeth. And then one day he gets a cryptic e-mail message hinting that the sender is his dead wife - with a warning to tell no one.As he attempts to find out the source of the continuing messages, Beck finds himself not only swept up in a world of power brokers with hired assasins and witnesses who know more than they're telling, but accused by the FBI of murdering Elizabeth.This is an elegantly wrought novel of high suspense which keeps you guessing and ties up all the loose ends at just the right time. This is a perfect beach take-along for the mystery aficionado."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Read it! Loved It! Told Everyone"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is the first Coben book I've read, and if it's any indication of his previous books I will definitely be investing more of my time reading them all. I was really impressed by his style of writing. He is very short and descript with everything, and it lets the story move at an excellent pace. He leaves more to the imaginiation than other writers (like King). Usually it takes me a while to sink into a novel, but I was into the story after the first page. A very involving story, and very difficult to put down. If only it were longer."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"What!!!! Five stars from almost everyone....this book is just o.k., not great, not riveting, tho the ending was a surprise. Easy summer read. Why did I stick with it...who knows."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell no One is a high octane thriller which grabs you on page 1 and does not let go until page 339. This novel is a departure from Coben's Myron Bolitar series, And trust me you will not be disapointed. The suspense is so thick you can cut it with a knife and there are plot twists galore. As in all Coben novels you will be guessing right up till the end."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This Harlan Coben book came to me from recommendations, while I searched for another book. I'm very glad for discovering Coben. This book kept me up a little later each night I read it. In fact, towards the end, I slowed my reading because I didn't want the book to end. I am now looking into some of Coben's earlier written books, I'd love to read them all. One of the best authors to cross my path this year."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I picked this book up at 3pm on Thursday, thinking I would spend the weekend leisurely reading this on the beach. Four hours later, I was finished with it! I couldn't put it down! The only other authors who write books I can't put down are Patricia Cornwell and the old John Grisham. &quot;Tell No One&quot; is by far the best book I have read all year. I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. This is definitely a MUST read book!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"With TELL NO ONE, Harlan Coben demonstrates in a big way that he can be terrifying and terrific even away from Myron Bolitar. The plot twists and turns as the reader learns -- or thinks he learns -- whether Elizabeth Beck was really murdered 8 years ago. And why the events of that night have come back to haunt her husband David . . . and can cause death again and again. I had to take my blood pressure when I read this one, to make sure it didn't get too high from excitement. And unlike many well-plotted but weakly written thrillers, Coben's writing here is superb. TELL NO ONE is a gem."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is an outstanding piece of writing. I was captivated by this story from the first few words. &quot;Tell No One&quot; will go down as one of the most original suspense thrillers in years. I read this book from start to finish in one day-skipping lunch because i was so mesmerized by the tale. The book starts at a full run and ends at a full run. I can sum my feelings up about this book with one word--WOW!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"i have read and enjoyed all harlan cobens previous books and i was hesitant about trying this book.i am so glad that i did read it.it is totally different than his myron bolitar stories.this was exciting ,with great twists and turns and a superb ending. i look forward to reading his new book. i am so glad that he is stepping out from his easy to read bolitar series and moving on to a totally different type of mystery.this should prove what an excellent mystery author he is."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"There are three very good reasons to read this book, and one of them is that it's full of mysterious events. The book starts off with a married couple in there 20's who are off at their private cabin. One night the couple were at the lake swimming when out of no where the wife was kidnapped in the dark. The husband got smacked on the head and passed out in the lake. The husband, who is a well-known doctor in the small community that they live in survives. The wife is found on the side of the road dead, and a serial killer is to blame. The second reason to read this book is its full of surprises. Nine years goes by and the husband gets an e-mail from his dead wife, but it says to tell no one! Well, he keeps it a secret and tries to find out more about it, to see if he believes them or not. The third reason to read Tell No One, is because it has major suspense. As the husband investigates about these e-mails his friends keep dying out of no where. The big twist comes into play when his wife's case is re-opened and he is to be blamed for the mysterious murder. The husband gets more suspicious that the truth is being hidden from him. Throughout the book I kept having to change who I thought the real killer was. This book kept reading until the very last word, so tell everyone about Tell No One."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I did not give this book 5 stars simply because I had read Hoben's &quot;Gone for Good&quot; first. On the other hand, I found myself unable to stop turning the pages even when I knew I should.I do have some misgivings about the final plot twist regarding Beck's past, but I can overlook that considering what a overall great read this was."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Lovers of thrillers have to definelely read this book. You wouldnt want it to end. Suspense and &quot;surprises&quot; stay all the way to the end, to the very last page of the book. Coben also enriched its book with certain remarks and common knowledge he got."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I liked this book well enough, but I can't say it is one of my favorites. This story has a lot of action and it is not a boring book, but for some reason, I just didn't really care about these characters as much as I have in other books. If you can, pick this one up at a used bookstore."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck is married to Elizabeth, his soulmate and childhood sweetheart. Through a senseless act of violence the love of his life is taken from him. He now is contacted, eight years later, over the internet with information that may lead Dr. Beck to believe that Elizabeth may still be alive. The clues given could only be known by Elizabeth. How can this be possible? Thus starts a roller coaster ride of a thriller. Nothing is as it seems. The twists and turns of this book are great. It is a real page turner.As I said tell everyone to read this book if you enjoy a good suspense novel."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Coben's writing is beyond anything that I have read in a long time. He has a way with words that makes you become part of the story or feel like you are the character. The plot twists and turns and you try you damnedest to figure this book out before the end. Wonderful, amazing. His gives his characters the right amount of emotion as well as sarcasm and all that jazz. Read this one and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"From experience I've found that its rare to find a suspense or mystery novel that packs as large an emotional punch as it does thrills. Tell No One is one of the few exceptions to this rule. Coben has accomplished two things with Tell No One: he's created a good, solid, strong mystery and he's written a story with likable, well constructed characters with emotions that we can all identify with to a certain degree. Despite the top-notch characterization, the action of the story never falters. As promised, there are plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. While it's a relatively easy read, the story is clearly well thought out and engaging. A fantastic, fun read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was an INCREDIBLE Book! The supense in it was great!!I had a hard time putting it down. I Highly recomend getting it. Although, I got mine at the Local Public Library for free (aren't Librarys great!?!)"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first Coben book and I thought it was great! I knew nothing of his previous books but the pages flew by and I became a fan. In a previous review someone mentioned the 'horrific' dust jacket. Personally, the cover is what first caught my eye as it sat on a shelf with 300 other books. Sometimes less is more!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I believed that this book was a very good one to read. It was very detailed and would always leave you wondering. It is very suspenseful making you want to read till that last word in the book. This book will leave you on the edge of your seat, not being able to wait to read what will happen next, since it is so suspenseful and gives a lot of mystery. It has a lot of problems that you could relate to your own life and implies to never give up on what you believe in."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I just finished this on a library loan.

It is a timeless book that leaves you on the edge of your seat time-after-time. The character development and the plot leave the reader fully enthralled and wanting more!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I used to read the older series of his books and loved it. I decided to Tell No One after reading the good reviews. It was even better than I expected.I loved the flowing writing, the many details coming together, and the suspense.

Fast paced from start to finish. I'm looking forward to reading more books by Harlen Coben."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Started out well aand sunk into banality midway through. Was so disappointed I couldn't even finish it. No surprises here predictable and like so many other in this genre. What's all the hype about? $12.60 unwisely spent. Back to my authors of many years ago."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A very suspenseful mystery when most of the time, it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Corben well orchestrates the main plot, but also supports it with many fascinating sub plots. Dr. David Beck, the main character, has a shady background which is suggested in the first chapter but not revealed until the end of the book. Wonderfully done.Coben's characters are real and his story is fast moving, the perfect combination for a good read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The story has an interesting beginning which draws the reader in, but itbecomes overly contrived and the characters are hardly more than cardboard.I like a story with some attachment to reality, but ths isn't it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I recently read this book cover to cover one night while I was babysitting. I'm not known to read in that way, so that speaks volumes about how great it was (for me, anyway). Prior to reading the novel I had never heard of Harlan Coben, so I did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and cannot wait to see the movie and read more of his books. I would highly recommend the book to anyone.

I couldn't put it down from the moment I picked it up. If I did put it down for even a brief moment I couldn't stop thinking about it.After you think that you've solved a mystery another one is thrown at. There were many twists and I almost couldn't keep up. There was a rare mix of characters in this book. This book was incredible and literally had me at the edge of my seat. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is an engrossing thriller that twists and turns to a complete surprise ending. The characters are wonderfully crafted and their pain and struggles leap off the page. Warning: you will lose sleep staying up late since you can't put it down."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I saw the French film version of the book first, which usually doesn't happen, but I have to say it really did the book justice. The tension is nearly non-stop in this fast pace thriller and Coben is a master at portraying the average guy caught in the middle of a wild and dangerous scheme. His endings always surprise too, and this one does not disappoint. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck has been mourning the loss of his wife Elizabeth since her murder eight years ago. When he starts getting messages purportedly from her, he begins a search to find out what really happened and if his beloved Elizabeth is still alive.The story, although very good, is a little confusing and far-fetched. When I purchased a copy from Amazon I didn't realize that I had bought and read a copy from an airport bookshop a few years ago. I didn't remember much of the plot or \\"who-done-it\\", but I do remember it keeping my attention for several hours of a long flight. I didn't enjoy it quite so much this time around, but, although it is not my favorite from this author, it is still a good and fast-paced read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book made its way into my book club. It was a suggested movie to watch, but I decided to read the book first. Amazing. I couldn't put it down. I read it within a day or two. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I understood the book the whole way through and didn't have to go back and reread anything to fully understand. I love this book. I saw the movie, which is in French. I liked it, but would have never really understood the storyline if I hadn't read the book. Great author!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is a page turner that cannot be put down. Short chapters and vivid details will have you staying up late to see what happens next. Harlan Coben has woven an almost perfect web of mystery for YOU. His characters come to life and his fast moving plot has enough twists and turns to satisfy anyone. Read this Book!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The first of Harlan Coben's books I have read and definitely not my last. The plot is excellent and leaves you guessing until the very last page, literally!I have however, one question. The story is told by the main character himself, Dr. Beck. He asks himself and others questions making it seem like he knows nothing of the unfolding events. So if the ending is like it is, how come he's playing so naive? He should have known at least a couple of the lingering questions.Overall I found this book absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Having read and loved all of this authors &quot;Myron Boloitar&quot; series (some more than others) I was extremely disappointed in his latest attemt into the mainstream thriller genre. Characters were not developed or likable. If you can stand to wait until the last 80 pages for things to pick up, this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I got this book because I was indecisive and the books title was familar to me. The book was alright at best. It had the premis of a good plot. However, the characters are shallow and not well rounded. Also, the further you got in the book the more the plot took turns for the worse. You can read longer reviews if you want. Overall, it was a quick read and somewhat interesting. Not intellecutally stimulating."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"On the beach in Bermuda... took only two days. Fast paced, exciting and engaging."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Well, actually, I did. I was kinda looking forward to more of his exploits, but this was a fantastic read in its own right. Enough twists and turns to hold your interest and more. Thoroughly enjoyed it in a fast two days.

Well, only a little longer, ok?"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book is suspense at it's finest.. Everytime you think you know how the plot is going, you turn the page and your wrong.

The characters are interesting and fairly well developed as the doctor hero attemps to unravel the mystery of his wife's presumed death before he is implicated in her murder. This was the prefect read for this insomniac."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben has really outdone himself this time! It's an amazing story with twists and turns down to the very last page. I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone I know. Because of Harlan's wonderful use of words, there is nothing to graphic so it makes it a great gift!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first book from Harlan Coben. Wow, this book is amazing. Fast paced, fast read, and loads of twists. This was great. I have read No Second Chance and Just One Look thereafter and they are great too. But this book is trully a great read, pick it up!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is the first book of Harlan Coben's that I have read, and I came away with it with some understanding. First of all, he must be pretty hip, since he writes about a lesbian couple (totally gratuitous and a sickening attempt to let us all know just how PC he is). There is not just a mention of this couple. They are totally unnecessary to the story, yet they keep popping up relentlessly. For example, one of the women leaves the other, causing her (I can't remember which one-it doesn't really matter) son to start wetting the bed, from the anxiety that his mother's girlfriend is gone. How sad!!Also, we should learn a lesson from this book besides that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. Besides the fact that there is nothing wrong with being a lesbian, there is nothing wrong with being a drug dealer. Evidently, drug dealers are really just misunderstood, unselfish people who would go out of their way to save your life if only they had the chance. Please!!It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this book. I wanted to like it and read his other books, but I was a little too disgusted by this one to waste my time on any of his other books.If Coben could focus more on his story and plot and less on forcing his political correctness down the readers' throats, he may actually turn out to be a decent writer."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"It's not that the book is bad, it's just not good. It's fast-paced and you can get through it in a couple of sittings, but you come out of it feeling like you just ate fast food. I have a feeling that all of Corbin's books are predictable and cliched like this.Here are a few specific points:- Why doesn't Elizabeth ever contact David all those years? The reason of \\"constant danger\\" doesn't hold up to me...not for a deep love, there would be SOME way around it.- Why didn't Elizabeth's father tell his own wife? Sitting there, grieving all of those years...it doesn't make any SENSE.- Totally lame ending for Eric Wu. A hugely built up character with no payoff.- The guy in the woods. Too convenient and feels like a plot device.- Throughout the book David repeats over and over a true, honest statement, and then follows up with a \\"Ridiculous, I know\\" or some variant. This drove me crazy.Overall a mediocre book. Bleh."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. I love thrillers because they never allow you to put them down and say &quot;Ok, I'll continue tomorrow&quot; and this qualifies as one of the best thrillers ever written.

Its premise is thin, the plot is predictable and Coben's attempts to build suspense and throw in twists at the end fall far short.Stick with Myron Bolitar!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One was one of the best novels I have ever read and I read a lot!!

I love the Myron series and I have never been more disappointed in a book as I was in this one.One of the things that I enjoyed so much about the Myron books was the witty dialogue and likeable characters (like Win and Esperanza). In this book, Coben tried to be too serious so the dialogue was very sappy and unoriginal (the same goes for the characters). The readers are also treated to the main character's constant running social commentary on the lower class and how some criminals are just misunderstood. \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" stuff.Another problem that made me uninterested in all the characters was the fact that the good guys are ridiculously good (the main character, his wife, and his sister ALL work for the poor), the bad guys are ridiculously evil (the evil billionaire and his unbelieveably sadistic hitman), and, in classic Harlan Coben style, the cops investigating are all dumb, bull-headed creeps who, if they were any worse, would be wearing swastikas on their arms. Oh yeah, and I forgot the \\"look at me, I'm so politically correct\\" lesbian couple, the typical boisterous defense attorney, and the drug dealer with the heart of gold.If you're a Harlan Coben fan, stick to his Myron Bolitar novels. This is like a Myron book without any witty dialogue, likeable characters, or interesting plot developments. Coben's best work is clearly behind him unless he resurrects Myron, I don't think it's going to get better."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The book was listed as GOOD.

Now, I have been a big fan of Halan Coben and have read most, if not all, of his prior novels. Therefore, I was very anxious to read this novel. But disappointed I was! What happened? Has Coben stooped to having college students write the novels for him? If this novel left out a single sophomoric clique, I would like to know what it is.

He was a black drug dealer. His was the best part of the story but only a small part. I was intrigued with Eric Wu. I had not read about a thug with his talents before.My problem was the author using slight of hand or gimmicks rather than substantive suspense. Examples follow.1. A few times conversations were drawn out to delay suspense for a couple of minutes. It was artificial. For example, A has a question and meets with B to ask it. Instead of asking the question right away, A talks about other things or asks other questions before finally getting around to the main question. Or, A wants to tell something to B but beats around the bush with other comments before getting to it. It bothered me because if I were the character, I would have said the thing right away instead of beating around the bush.2. Two guys are in a car. If I were one of the guys, I would have said or asked things that he did not. His silence allowed an interesting twist to be revealed a few minutes later. It was convenient for the author, not logical for the reader.3. I like twists and surprises but the main twist was hard to believe. A loving couple kept secrets from each other, which were the kind of secrets a loving couple would not keep from each other. But that was the basis for the book.The overall result is a decent mystery story. But my problems were linked to characters' actions not fitting their motivations.The narrator Ed Sala was very good. I liked the way he paused. Some narrators don't pause enough.DATA:Narrative mode: David parts were 1st person. Other parts were 3rd person. This worked well.

But this book was a disappointment. I won't spoil it for you, but the plot is very superficial and ingenuous. The protagonist lost his wife years ago and, suddenly, starts receiving misterious messages that may cast some light into her death. The idea looks interesting, but the result is not. My impression is that the autor started to wtite from the ending, and made up a story just to fill the pages. And the ending itself, supposedly conceived to amaze, in fact dos not add up with the protagonist's personality, as it is build throughout the book. If you are not experienced in crime fiction, you may find it entertaining. If you like more mature writing, try somewhere else."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Except from Peter Robinson's Alan Banks series of books, I'm not a big fan of today's habit of writing an entire series of thrillers with the same major character...it seems every author is cashing in on that trend nowadays.So after having finished reading \\"Tell No One\\" last night, I hope to find more stand alone thrillers written by Harlan Coben.I watched the film first and liked it so much that I had to read the book. Film and book are very close which always works out well.The film was mentioned in the imdb discussion board from \\"The Next Three days\\" (Russell Crowe) and that's how I found the movie \\"Tell No One\\".The French seem to make excellent movies based on American novels, for instance \\"The Big Picture\\" (book by Douglas Kennedy)(2011, with Cath&eacute;rine Deneuve) or \\"The Passengers\\" (1977, with Jean-Louis Trintignant) [...]which is unfortunately not available on DVD.I highly recommend reading \\"Tell No One\\" and then watching the movie.

The truths unravel piece by piece to expose what really happened that evening by the lake. I have to be honest I thought had a hunch and was putting it all together when the whole flipped upside down on me.

Even after finishing the book, I'm confused as to what exactly happened and why. The book alternates between first and third person, with the first person holding back information until the end.

And you don't act like the government with their \`proportional responses' and all that nonsense. If someone hurts you, mercy and pity must be put aside. You eliminate the enemy. You scorch the earth. Those who scoffed at this philosophy, who thought it unnecessarily Machiavellian, usually were the ones who cause excess destruction.\\"So wrote Harlan Coben in his very enjoyable book with a theme of vengeance and revenge. At center point in this novel is Doctor David Beck. A man of medicine and a man that does not believe in the modern day psycho babble nonsense concerning such things as closure. For David Beck, time does not heal all wounds. First his father died twelve years ago in what could have been a simple traffic accident or a suicide. Then, eight short years ago, his wife was murdered.The fact that he was powerless to stop it, dropped by blows to the head that cracked his skull does not alleviate his pain and his guilt over her murder. They were at the family retreat and she was grabbed, he was brutally assaulted and pushed off the dock to drown in the lake. The fact that he survived was a medical miracle and something that he has never accepted. He misses her tremendously every single day of his life.Despite the fact that everyone had told him to move on, he can't. And as it comes time to mark their anniversary, he is reminded how much he misses her. Then, he gets a strange e-mail with a message containing a phrase that only the two of them shared. No one else could possible know the phrase or what it means. Then, he gets a second message a day later and is soon directed to a web cam that for a moment, somewhere in the world, shows her. Or someone that looks amazingly like her.He begins a frantic search, turning to his friends and family. At the same time, someone is searching for him and to find out what he knows about happened eight years ago. And they will stop at absolutely nothing to get the answers they seek to end the problem once and for all.This is a very enjoyable novel and primarily action oriented. There is some character development on a rather limited scale, but the focus is on a man running for his life from events beyond his control. Sure it has been done before but this one is better than most. This good read novel keeps the reader turning the page and is full of numerous false clues and detours until one reaches a very surprising ending."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book is fast paced and well written.

It's not a terrible book, but I also didn't think it was all that great, either. Harlan Coben's writing style is easy to read, making this a speedy read that kept me reasonably entertained on my daily bus journey to and from work. However, I didn't have any trouble in putting it down and leaving it, when necessary. Its main flaw is that all of the good characters are sickeningly good (most are charity workers with politically correct attitudes and no flaws at all), and all of the bad characters are so bad that they totally deserve whatever they get. There are no real shades of grey in these characters, which makes them kind of boring. As a mystery, it is an interesting enough story, but there was nothing in it that made it stand out in my mind as being a \\"great\\" mystery and the \\"plot twists\\", although not glaringly obvious, didn't really come as much of a surprise to me when they did appear. Overall, this book does not inspire me to read anything else by Harlan Coben, and I intend to follow the advice given in the book's title, when it comes to recommending this book. That is, I intend to tell no one about it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben's great talent is presenting an unusual premise to the reader and then hurtling him into a maze of fast paced plot twists.

In Tell No One, a young doctor loses his beautiful wife to a crazed killer. Or does he? Eight years after that fateful night, he receives a cryptic message that could only have come from his wife. Determined to know the truth, he soon realizes that other forces want to stop him, at any cost.

TNO starts out okay, but plot hole after plot hole begins to appear, characters are running all over the place for no apparent reason and Coben is not an accomplished enough writer to pull off the first person to third person switching back and forth POV. As a representative example of a glaring plothole: (semi-SPOILER if you haven't read the book) How could the police charge the narrator w/ the murder of that photographer after an autopsy revealed all of the unique and intense damage that Eric Wu had done to her w/ his hands? That's just one of many, many fumbles committed by Coben as he tries to develop his ambitious plot. Characterization is thin, plotting is interesting for awhile, but then fizzles. Writing is competent, pedestrian. Tacked on &quot;revelation&quot; at the end is especially annoying. I envision Coben hunched over his keyboard, typing this novel and a neon sign in his brain flashing: &quot;Movie Deal Movie Deal Movie Deal . . .&quot;"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I put a huge endurance to finally finsh it. never buy any book by Mr. Coban"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"After reading the first few chapters of this book it was pretty easy to see what the outcome of the book was going to be.

Coben does a decent job of grabbing your hand and pulling you along Beck's life, and I REALLY wanted to see how we got to the end. The final pages were a bit far-fetched and involving characters that were not fully developed (re:Beck's father-in-law and Scope,Sr.). Final note: I'll pass the book on to someone instead of donating it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I like Harlan Coben and gratefully, he will be around for a long time. I look forward to reading another Cobenesque tale, but not like this one.He is a master of plot, unfolding one surprise after another. The problem is that some of the surprises qualify as surprises only because they are completely unbelievable. Look at Alfred Hitchcock. He was successful because he took ordinary people like James Stewart (Rear Window) and Cary Grant (North by Northwest) from ordinary jobs (photographer; sales manager) and exposed them by accident to extraordinary events (witness to murder most foul; mistaken for a KGB counter agent). But they were ordinary folks and remained ordinary.Dr. Beck seems to be disengenuous, almost dishonest. And what bothers me here, is that he is disengenuous with me, the reader, who plunked down X amount of dollars to listen to his story.Let me give you an example. If I scrape the bumper of our car at the mall, I may forget to tell my wife; if the nordic blond secretary kisses me on the cheek for my birthday at the office, lacking any kamikaze-like inclinations, I may avoid telling my wife; if I take my sons to the Lions game, and they overhear some foul language from a row behind us, I may elect to not tell my wife. But if I see her boss robbing a bank, if I witness a shoot out between armed insurrectionists, these are things I'm going to share with my partner.And Dr. Beck doesn't do that. He leaves things out, doesn't give her the information he ought to have. For someone that he has worshipped since the second grade, he witholds certain information from her.She is murdered he believes and he still weeps for her 8 years later but they had secrets from eachother. I think the simplest but honest relationships wouldn't keep those kinds of secrets from their spouse.It's a good action read. Lots of twists. I'm left with the feeling that it was written for another medium that absolutely pays no attention to logic, ergo the movies.I'll read Mr. Coben again but frankly I was disappointed. Not even sure I liked the characters."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One, by Harlan Coben, is one heck of a fun read. After reading some of the other reviews - both professional and customer - I would not dispute that there are some cliches used in this book. There are also some tried and true plot devices and there is not a ton of new ground covered here. But who cares... for me, the novel makes the leap from 4 stars to 5 stars due to the very relevant fun quotient. This is a fun and thrilling book to read. Coben's story was so fast paced, I literally could not put the book down. The characters are engaging and there are laugh out loud moments mixed in with thrills and chills. There is nary a dull moment in the entire book.This book is great fun to read, and is one of those ultimate beach reads.

Coben builds up a long, complicated plotline in the first half of the book, unveiling only a few clues. The clues come faster, almost too fast, in the latter fourth of the book.This a very easy read. The writing just flows. Some of the plot devices and characters were a bit contrived (one character early on who you knew was going to show up at the end to tie some things together). Still, a good book for a quick summer read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"My first experience of Harlan Coben's writing. The story builds well enough through the early stages. When the main character falls foul of just about everybody things start getting a bit far fetched and the scene revolving around the airline tickets was totally out of keeping with that person's meticulous actions prior to that. The eventual rendezvous could easily have taken place right up front and saved everybody (including the reader) a load of trouble. But the sucker punch for me was that when one is finally armed with the knowledge of the ultimate twist all that has gone before makes next to no sense any more.

When he gets a mysterious e-mail on their anniversary, &quot;D.B. + E.P. /////////////////////&quot; he is floored. Only Elizabeth would know the meaning of such a message. Could she be alive?Suddenly Beck finds himself wrapped up in a gut-twisting, heart-pounding race to find his wife before the noose tightens around his own neck. Because for some reason, after eight years of believing KillRoy murdered Elizabeth Beck, the FBI is questioning her husband. Not only that, but when he goes to his father-in-law for answers, he gets only more questions. And now an old friend has been murdered, and someone is framing Beck.My two main complaints about this book: 1. The point-of-view switching is a little confusing; however, after the first switch, I began to expect them, and it wasn't too difficult to follow. 2. This is my real complaint--there wasn't enough build-up to the twist at the end. Yes, there was a little (very little) foreshadowing. I would have preferred a little more. The reader gets a pretty intimate look inside Beck's mind, and I felt blindsided by the revelations at the end.I would still recommend this to anyone who isn't squeamish (innocent characters do die, painfully) and who loves the mystery/suspense genre."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"'Tell No One' by Harlan Coben starts of very nicely. Mysterious murders, nice guy leading man trying to find the truth, sinister baddies appear continuously, and the story becomes more and more complex and interesting. Coben also writes is a very lucid style, with all the characters being well drawn. So it is shame that he goes wild in the last 20% of the book in trying to pull together all the loose ends and instead twists the entire plot from barely believable to utterly preposterous. It seems that the author got too fanciful and caught up in the narrative. In the end I feel that all the reading enjoyment was snuffed out.Bottom line: author creates an interesting story before hitting the self-destruct button. Missable."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"My literary tastes have always run very far from this type of fare. I'm usually in search of things with more weight and substance. But when I was suddenly in desperate need for my one and only beach read, I instinctively went with &quot;Tell No One&quot; and I had a blast. I tore through it in a day. I agree with some that there are conveniences, stilted characters, occasionally terrible dialogue,(and hold onto your brain while you try to accept the endless loopy end). No matter what the shortcomings, ingesting this one is like going to see a blockbuster summer thriller movie. You go for the popcorn and the ride. Ain't no Oscars within miles, you know? Surprisingly, there is genuine emotion on display here. I was moved when...oh..we don't want to give things away. Not being a fan of this kind of fiction, this was a guilty pleasure. It was like sneaking a Krispy Kreme. You know it's not good for you, but man it feels good going down. Desserts usually don't satisfy and you usually have that craving all over again hours later...but I'm gonna give this a thumbs up just for the fun writing. This guy had a great time and undoubtedly had the loving support of loved ones doing this. It's clear he took a risk, so let us encourage literary bravery. This will sell by the truckloads. Word of mouth will get it there. Can smell a NY Times bestseller. Expect little gang...enjoy what you can. Isn't that what life is all about?"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck's wife was murdered by a serial killer, and he was beaten and left for dead, on the shores of Lake Charmaine, a place the husband and wife visit, every year, on the anniversary of when they first met.Eight years later, and Beck is still trying to come to terms with the loss of his wife. He receives a mysterious email, which turns his world upside down once again, as it seems to strongly suggest that his wife is not dead after all.I found this book an enjoyable read, as Beck discovers one clue, and then another, in the bid to find out what exactly happened to his wife, eight years earlier, on that fateful night. The twists come thick and fast towards the ending, which, I thought could have possible been a bit better. Overall, though, a pretty good story."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"\\"Tell No One\\" is a dazzling high-wire act of a suspense novel, over-stuffed with plot complications but nevertheless maintaining its equilibrium and delivering a solid reading experience. This accomplishment is thanks to author Harlan Coben, a plotter who daringly - perhaps dangerously - toes the lines of excess. By all rights \\"Tell No One\\" should be too much - and at one point it is, but Coben maintains his firm grip on the action and somehow manages to make it all work together. Deranged hit man? Check. Corrupt politico? Of course. Serial killer? Got it. Wrongfully accused doctor on the lam to clear his name? Present and accounted for. Cold case that may hold the key to solving it all? Check and check - two for the price of one there. And, finally, dead person who may not be so dead after all? Well, anyone who's perused the dust-jacket can tell you that that's the whole point of the novel. Throw all these elements into a blender and you should end up with a disgusting, gooey sludge, but Coben makes it all come out tasting all right, with perhaps only a mildly unpleasant aftertaste from all the competing flavors and a dizzying suspension of disbelief. The fact that it works at all, nevermind that it works well, is a credit to his prowess as a mystery writer.Tell everyone: whether you're looking for a read for the beach, plane, or a rainy day or just in need of a break, \\"Tell No One\\" is superb escapist reading.Grade: B"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have been reading Coben books since Play Dead(now out of print) and I have yet to read one of his books I did not like. This is no exception. Granted I missed Win kicking A** but the book was a fun, quick read. I just wish it was longer. I read it in just under 5 hours and was left with that &quot;No, I want more&quot; feeling. For anyone who has not read a book by Harlen Coben, what are you waiting for? Pick this one up and you will not stop reading this great author. And the best thing, he is a fellow Jersey boy."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is the first Coben book I've read, and if it's any indication of his previous books I will definitely be investing more of my time reading them all. I was really impressed by his style of writing. He is very short and descript with everything, and it lets the story move at an excellent pace. He leaves more to the imaginiation than other writers (like King). Usually it takes me a while to sink into a novel, but I was into the story after the first page. A very involving story, and very difficult to put down. If only it were longer."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben has ventured into Hitchcock territory very successfully with the release of TELL NO ONE. The first true top notch thriller of the summer. Many books will cross your path during these stifling summer nights but STOP! Do not pass go until you pick up a copy of this surely satisfying thriller. Mr. Coben is like a fine chef incorporating all the right ingredients, stirring in proper amounts of suspense, unexplained murders, a serial killer, unique hitmen, a trail of lies, a dash of deceit, a dollup of mystery and a splash of romance. Then mixed together and heated for 340 pages. To tell you the plot of TELL NO ONE is an injustice to the reader since you never know what will happen next. Have I wet your appetite? Then let Mr. Coben satisfy it for you. You won't go away hungry."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"After loving every Myron Bolitar Book Coben has written I was not dissappointed in his venture away from Bolitar. This book was just as good as the other ones with quick dialouge, great characters and an excellent plot. The twists and turns are well thought out and belivable. This book is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I thought that Tell No One was an excellent story and that it would make a great action movie. It is a can't-put-it-down book. I did however think that it was a little bit unrealistic when it came to the main character. He was a consevative doctor at first and then he turned into some big hero. I didn't think that was well done, but other wise it was a great story filled with suprise and suspense!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"&quot;Tell No One&quot; is my first Harlan Coben book. It truly is a fun and interest-grabbing pageturner. You'll want to read it straight through from start to finish to see how it all works out. I recommend this for light summer reading at the beach or while traveling but don't be surprised if you put off sight-seeing to complete the book!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I listened to this as an audio book on a long round-trip car journey, which probably emphasized its flaws. It has a gripping first section--the entire carload was collectively holding its breath during the scenes where Beck follows the mysterious Internet clues. But I became increasingly dissatisfied with the story as it went along. The police and FBI agents behaved in ways which were very hard to believe; obstacles which were presented as serious challenges were suddenly overcome with the wave of a hand; and the final series of twists broke the back of the story for me. I could not believe that the first chapter and the last could be reconciled, except as a specimen of authorial trickery--I saw no reason why the narrator had withheld certain information from the reader except to create artificial suspense. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.There were also a few scenes of violence and murder which I could have done without. Several minor characters are developed at length only to be brutally killed. As soon as it became apparent that each was certain to die, I would have preferred for the narrative to cut away. Apparently the point was to make the bad guys seem monstrously bad, but that point was made far more times than necessary, and to a degree approaching caricature (especially in the case of the Asian villain).This might work better in novel, rather than audiobook, format; it will read more quickly and that may emphasize its strengths (excellent suspense, some deft characterizations) rather than its weaknesses (serious plausibility problems, pointless violence)."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"To me, the mark of a great suspense novel is when you have two contradictory feelings while reading it: you want to read it as fast as possible to find out what happens, but also you want to go slowly, not wanting it to end. Based on this criteria, Harlan Coben consistently puts out great books, and Tell No One is no exception.Tell No One begins with a brief prologue following David Beck and his new wife, Elizabeth. David and Elizabeth have known each other since childhood and, to the narrator David, they were soulmates upon first meeting. Revisiting an isolated campsite where they first kissed as kids, David is severely beaten and Elizabeth is apparently killed by a notorious serial killer. The word \\"apparently\\" is used for two reasons: one, there are doubts that the killer (now on death row) was actually responsible; and two, David is presented with evidence that she may still be alive.This evidence is presented eight years later when the bulk of the novel takes place. The digging up of a couple bodies near the campsite triggers a new investigation of the old crime, with the police and FBI now looking at David as an apparent suspect. Meanwhile, David receives an e-mail that refers to things only Elizabeth would know. This is followed by other proof that she might be alive (or it might be a hoax). Somehow, a billionaire named Griffin Scope fits into all this; Griffin's involvement brings in the nasty assassin, Eric Wu, who leaves a trail of dead bodies of his own.Most of the story has David desperately seeking the truth with both killers and cops out to stop him. Coben keeps things moving along quickly with a high level of suspense. As a small bonus, Hester Crimstein, a character from his top-notch Myron Bolitar series, has a minor but critical role in this book. There might be slight problems in the story, but they are only slight and only noticeable in retrospect. This is a great page-turner by an author who's one of the best in his field."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"They were bonded by such a fierce tie of love that when she was taken, his heart was ripped to shreds. David Beck chocked for eight years, smothered under a blanket of guilt. He had been there when she, his beloved Elizabeth, had been taken. He had heard her screams moments before the baseball bat hit him. If he had only swam across the moonlit lake with faster, sharper strokes, his life might still be whole, might still be worthwhile.That fatal night, the thirteenth anniversary of their first kiss, is a whole burned permanently in Beck's mind, in his life, and in his heart. His soul mate was murdered by the infamous \\"Killroy\\", her flesh charred with the letter \\"K\\" he uses to mark his victims. Her body, found days after the abduction, was covered with cuts and bruises, her face grossly disfigured and beaten. The excruciating pain Beck has felt for eight years heightens when he receives a strange email on his office computer. It contains a phrase the two of them alone know, with a link to a street camera that shows him something he will never forget, something his eyes have been starved of for eight long, lonely years. And Beck has been warned to tell no one.As if that isn't enough, the FBI has uncovered more evidence concerning Elizabeth's murder. Evidence that suggests that Beck was involved in more ways than just being an innocent bystander. Coincidences fall into place too neatly to be accidental. The cops begin to paint a false picture of Beck's guilt and thrown it at him, hard. This is too much pressure for a man who has lost his wife.Harlen Coben has created a masterpiece of suspense and mystery. Contrary to what the story line may suggest, this is not a mushy love story. Beck is driven by hope and egged on by denial. He refuses to face the rational, he looks instead towards the unlikely chance that his wife is somehow still alive. This book has captured the very essence of thrill and tension. It has so many twists of plot and turns of fate that you won't know the truth until the last page. Laced with action and draped with secrets that could cost lives, teens and adults alike will be gripped with fear and overcome with joy when reading this enthralling novel. This book is highly recommended for everyone seeking suspense and mystery intertwined within a highly complex plot."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I finished this, my first Harlan Coben book, in less than 48 hours. Once I started it, that's all I wanted to do, solve the mystery. I read 10-12 books a month, mainly mysteries. Trust me when I tell you that most are drivel, a shameful waste of the trees to print them. When you stumble across a writer this talented you seek out all his other works."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I read this book in half a day. I couldn't put it down! Exciting, start to finish. I had so many different theories of what the outcome would be--only to be proven wrong many times over. This was the first Coben book I've read and will not be my last."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I just recently discovered Harlan Coben recently when I picked up a copy of THE WOODS. It was so supsenseful I read it almost in one sitting. I didn't see how this masterful storyteller could top himself until I read TELL NO ONE, a story that begins with a man losing the great love of his life to a brutal attack that leaves him injured and her dead. Or is she? Several years later, the impossible happens and the love of his life comes back into his life, leaving mysterious clues about herself. Is she really alive? And why has her reappearance coincided with the activities of some very nasty characters who not only live to maim and kill, but who also seem to have an interest in seeing our hero's good name ruined. This one I DID read in one sitting because its page turning appeal is irresistible. If you like a good solid, extremely entertaining read, this tale of secrets and life or death peril is for you."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"One of the best suspense books I've read in a long time.

I read 50 pages before bed and finished it the next day, it was that good! The plot turns were amazing, however, one thing that really spoke to me was the way that the main character, David Beck, spoke of his wife. It is evident that Coben really understands and knows love. I thought the writing was really good, and loved the way that Beck is actually speaking directly to the reader; it was a nice change of pace and a wonderful read. I think I will check out more of his books!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Are you ready to go on a bone chilling heart racing quest? Well in the book \\"Tell No One\\" by Harlan Coben you do just hat. This mystery takes placefirst at Lake Charmaine and later in Manhattan. Dr. David Beck a serious obsetrician who's remined every day for the past eight years the heart-breaking tragedy of his wife's disapearance. \\"I keep on hearing the gleam lake, the pale moonlight, and the piercing screamsof the night shewas taken\\". Everyone tells him it's time move o, to forget about the past once and for all. But for David Beck there can be no closure. One day a message appearded on his computer, a phase only him and his dead wife know. Suddenly Beck is faced with the impossible that some where, and somehow, his wife is alive. And he's been warned to \\"Tell No One\\".Harlan Coben author of \\"Tell No One\\" used tons of realisticdetail. He saids \\"There should have been a dark whisper in the wind\\". Also, Harlan Caoben used humor threw out the whole book. He saids, This was Homer Simpson as in the TV show The Simpsons. Alot of things go on in this book but the main problem is that Dr. David Beck's wife Elizabeth has been taken fromthe Lake on their anniversary. He does not no if she is died or aliv. Eight years go by and all of a sudden Dr. Beck gets a email, a message with a phrase only he and his wife know. The comparisons with other books and genres are really differnt. Like in the book \\"Little Women\\" its sad, back in the early 1900's, and mainly a love story. And in \\"Tell No One\\" its up to date, a thriller, and full of suspense. This book is very differnt from other mystery books. For example, in \\"The Hardy Boy\\" series, they have books based on finding ghost, and coal-mine robbers, and is more of a out-doorsy missions. And \\"Tell No One\\" is more like CSI Miami and suspensly hair raising, bone chilling mystery. \\"The Hardy Boy's\\"books are anmatures compared to \\"Tell No One\\". Their are a few comparisons with works by the same author. Harlan Coben's book \\"Gone For Good\\" is a novel of suspense just like \\"Tell No One\\" and thats how the compare. Lastly, I love Harlan Coben's use of style. He has a very crative style, he uses alot of personification and metaphors. His use of tones and the characters attiudes are writtin very well. And he makes you feel right here investigating.I believe anyone who likes mysteries, and drama will like this book. And why is because once you start this book you can not put it down. I felt like I was right there in the book, I thought the book end great.The book just kept getting better and better. My reading process was good I picked it up and read the back page summary and was instantly hooked.I read it nonstop from the very first page to the very last!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Doctor Beck and his wife Elizabeth fell in love when they were 12 years old.

But on their 13th anniversary, when they came back to the tree, Elizabeth is kidnapped and murdered.Trying to move on with his life, Beck dates some women here and there, but he can't seem to find the perfect relationship. 8 years after Elizabeth disappears, Beck recieves a mysterious e-mail and a picture of Elizabeth on his computer that makes him go nuts.

Trying to prove his innocence, Beck finds out that Elizabeths Best Friend has been murdered too. While David tries to resolve the mystery of his supposedly dead wife, nothing will stop him.I would deffinatley reccommend this book to anyone. It is one great fast paced mystery that you can't put down. Every chapter leaves you hanging with possibilites, either leading you in the wrong direction, or to the unthinkable. The characters in this book were also great.

The characters are convincing, the writing flows very naturally, the plot is fast paced, and the book even manages to weigh in on some very touchy social issues all at the same time. Well done and recommended."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"\\"Tell No One\\" is a fast-paced suspense novel that slides down as easy as a peanut butter & jelly sandwich. As with many popular novels, the emphasis is on action more than character. The plot twists with David Beck bounce back & forth faster than a ping-pong match. I liked the characters, except of course the master villain, Eric Wu, who seemed to inhumanly inflict cruelty. Why Corben picked the only Asian character in the book for this could seem like stereotyping, but Wu filled me with such trepidation that there were times I didn't pick up the book before bed because I didn't want to be kept awake! Wife Elizabeth seems like the long-distance romantic lead whose love spans 8 years of absence. Rooting for the lovers to reunite was an excellent plot mechanism. Tyrese was amazingly interesting, the criminal whose love for his son was stronger than his lack of morality. The fact that he becomes a hero in the process was an interesting twist. The little character Jeremiah Renway was a nice touch as the fugitive bogeyman hiding in the woods. I enjoyed the book. I didn't expect it to be deep; and it wasn't. If there were a theme, criminals can be good guys and wealthy respected people can be ruthless. This is a fun beach book to entertain.

I honestly cannot recall reading a book where I almost had to put the book down for a day (actually I did switch to another book - non-fiction for two days) due to the suspense. Perhaps the closest thriller I can recall was the movie, Wait Until Dark, in the late 60's. The plot in the book is such that you never &quot;asked&quot; to suspend your belief in reality for the sake of the plot. As other reviewers mention, I was not prepared for the ending.

After Dr. Beck loses his wife one tragic night, his life is set on a course that will go into the realm of the near-impossible as she seems to reappear years later....or has she?. A few words of advice: Don't get so wrapped up in the turbo-charged tension that you fail to enjoy the wonderful writing in this book. And make no mistake - Coben is among the finest suspense writers out there. How many writers, for instance, can write a first paragraph as tight and foreboding as this one?:... ' There should have been a dark whisper in the wind. Or maybe a deep chill in the bone. Something. An ethereal song only Elizabeth or I could hear. A tightness in the air. Some textbook premonition. There are misfortunes we almost expect in life- what happened to my parents, for example - and then there are other dark moments, moments of sudden violence, that alter everything. There was my life before the tragedy. There is my life now. The two have painfully little in common....'"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"What a story!!!!

Every time you think you know whats going on, its takes you on another twist, all the way to the end.Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Until a few weeks ago, I didn't know who Harlan Coben was. Of course, I'd noticed his books in the store and seen his name recommended by other readers on the websites, but I had no desire to find out more about him, or to read any of his novels. That changed when I saw a blurb on his newest thriller, TELL NO ONE. The premise for the story sounded so good that I decided to risk a couple of sawbucks and buy a hardback by an author I knew next to nothing about. I'm happy to say that the gamble paid off big time and with huge dividends. I now have a small stack of his other books sitting on my coffee table, waiting to be read. Life doesn't get much better than this! In TELL NO ONE, the plot centers on Dr. David Beck, a man who has tried to put his life back together after the tragic death of his wife, Elizabeth, eight years before. It happened one night at their summer retreat on Lake Charmaine. After swimming in the lake with her husband, Elizabeth made her way back to the cottage and was attacked by one or more assailants. Her screams for help brought David running to her aid, but he was beaten with a baseball bat and left for dead. A few days later, her body was found alongside of the highway with the letter K branded into the side of her face. Elroy Kellerton, a serial killer (a.k.a. KillRoy), was eventually charged with her murder. Now, eight years later, David Beck sits down at his office computer and opens an e-mail that gives him a piece of information only Elizabeth could know about. Has his dead wife suddenly returned from the grave, or is someone playing a cruel hoax on him? It isn't long, however, before Beck is running for his life! It turns out that someone has been watching him for eight long years...someone who'd paid to have Elizabeth killed...someone who wanted to be absolutely sure that she was, in fact, dead. As those closest to Beck start dying and he's framed for their murders, he quickly realizes that there are few people he can trust. Now, he not only has to avoid these unknown killers, but the police as well. All of this can't stop our reluctant hero from following the only course of action opened to him-finding the woman he still loves and killing those who would harm her. TELL NO ONE grabs you by the seat of your pants in the first few pages and doesn't let go till the last, breathtaking page. \\"WOW!\\" was the only thing I could think of to say after I finished the book and laid it down on the couch beside me. Why? Because Mr. Coben had created characters you truly cared for, while at the same time, weaving an intricate story line that kept them walking a narrow tightrope of intemperate danger and kept the reader sitting on the edge of his seat in avid anticipation. Each time I thought smugly to myself that I had it all figured out, Mr. Coben surprised me with an unexpected plot twist, or a villain that kept to the shadows until he was ready to pounce. I couldn't help but smile as I realized how skilled the author was at manipulating my mind and emotions, and I mean this as a sincere compliment. It takes sheer craftsmanship to be able to do this successfully. I should also add that this novel is as much a love story as it is an action-packed thriller. There was one point in it where I felt goose bumps rising on my arms at the strength of David and Elizabeth's love for each other. I wanted them to make it out alive, but wasn't sure if it would actually happen. TELL NO ONE is definitely an \\"In-Your-Face\\" novel that will make you an instant fan of Mr. Coben. Buy it, read it, then quickly order the rest of his books, but don't forget to spread the word about this terrific writer. Harlan Coben is one of those \\"best-kept secrets\\" that need to be announced from loud speakers at the Super Bowl!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"When looking for something to read, I always head to mysteries and thrillers. I like the ones that curl my toes and shiver my bones. Because there aren't many these days that do that, I wondered where this one would lead. I worried that this would be just like so many others our there, a clone of every other one with the disappearing spouse and the husband trying to find her. I did not know Harlan Coben's books, but Tell No One intrigued me from the start. Imagine my surprise when I read it and found it to be one of the best stories in a long time. I didn't find the usual predictable ending, and I am not sure yet if I like it. What I did find was that Beck was an exciting character who responded well to his challenges. I wanted to find out if his wife was really alive. I wanted to find out why she did what she did, if it really was she who was sending those e-mails. I completely enjoyed his narration, revelations and humor. I read the book at one sitting and enjoyed being completely involved in a story. My cat loved the fact that I didn't move at all while reading, and I was happy that there was a book out there to tingle my toes as the night moved on to the morning. I thought the book was fun, intrguing and certainly one to recommend to others. I don't know Coben's other main character in his other series of books, but this one was decent, pliable and haunting. I do plan to read other books by this author, and I hope to find his name on future best selling lists."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"There are very few books you start reading and can't put down until the final page, no matter what is on TV or happening outside of the book. This thriller is one of those sensational novels.Dr. David Beck lost his wife eight years ago after being knocked unconscious by a baseball bat, to a serial killer named Killroy who tortured her for three days before branding and killing her. He has never gotten over her death but has tired to lead a normal life by helping out the underprivileged children through his surgery in a rough neighbourhood. Nearing the anniversary of her death he received an e-mail which makes him question his sanity by giving him a small hope she may not actually be dead.Meanwhile two more bodies turn up at the lake where Elizabeth was abducted alongside the very baseball bat used to knock Beck unconscious. The FBI suspects Dr. Beck may have more to do with his wife's murder than they previously thought and when more murders occur that point to him, he becomes one of America's most wanted. He can't surrender though, because his wife might just be out there trying to contact him and in custody he may miss the chance to ever find out if she is alive. The violent people who murdered her eight years ago have also become interested in Dr. Beck and they want to have a little chat.This is a sensational thriller. Buy a blank tape for your VCR as well as Tell No One, because you will not be watching TV or doing anything else until you have finished this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have to admit, what attracted me to this book in the bookstore was...the bright orange cover. Thank you orange cover! This is one of the best mystery/thriller books I have ever read. This book is well written, fast-paced, has great characters, and best of all a great plot. Coben will not disappoint you in this book, especially when everything begins to unravel. The problems with a lot of books is that many of them have disappointing endings and leave you feeling unsatisfied. Not this book. Go read it!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Many writers of thrillers and crime fiction are more interested in deconstructing complex events than they are in creating real characters. This certainly applies to Harlan Coben in TELL NO ONE, where this reader found an involving mystery that did not really carry a cast of characters who, to me, were largely stick-figures or clich&eacute;s.Dr. David Beck, the protagonist of this mystery, is my case in point. Here, Coben writes Beck as a very decent man who yearns for his wife, eight years after her purported death. But Beck's voice never acquires much depth or credibility, even though he narrates many chapters. Thus, his adventures-and they are many-capture a flat semi-character, not a person reacting to events. Upshot: After roughly 200 pages, Dr. Beck ceased to involve me. Thereafter, only plot existed to sustain my interest.Further, many characters are outright clich&eacute;s. These include Griffin Scope, the evil corporate big shot; Shauna, the brash and beautiful lesbian; and Hester Crimstein, the criminal defense lawyer. (Every cop is right out of central casting.) Meanwhile, Coben writes others counter to type. These include Larry Gandle, the avuncular murderer; Eric Wu, the murderous Asian computer nerd; and Tyrese, the paternal drug dealer. But these characters are still stereotypes, even though Coben adorns them with antipodal qualities.Why go on about characters in a mystery? Certainly, Coben fans and readers who love this genre will find TELL NO ONE to be an accomplished and involving novel. Reason: It includes snappy dialogue, some lovely prose at the beginning of many chapters, and an intense and totally involving chase, with the wimpy Dr. Beck escaping from the police in a burnt-out section of New York. Still, those who like to read about characters pushing through emotional challenge will find this mystery thin."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck will never forget the night his wife was killed and he was left for dead. Still grieving for her 8 years later, he receives an email that could only come from her - secret code words only they knew, then an email with a web-cam picture of her, asking him to meet her and \\"tell no one.\\" Is this for real? Is his grief making him crazy? Is she still alive? He must find out - at any cost, and so begins the ride. It picks up speed after a few chapters, a thriller you will find hard to put down!My first Coben book was his newest The Innocent, which I enjoyed very much and went looking for others by him. If this is any example of his talent I will be reading more by him. Highly recommended for suspense and fast-paced reading."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was one of the most satisfying books I've read in long time. Dr. David Beck lost his wife to a serial killer eight years ago. They had been in love since they were twelve. While life goes on, the loss is overwhelming. That is, until he gets an email with information that only they shared. David suddenly begins to think that she may be alive. The rest is a frenticly-paced thriller with the most diabolical villains and unlikely friends. I read this extraordinary thriller in less than 24 hours. My only criticism is that the last twist is really superfluous."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Hold on folks you're in for a ride. I loved it. I don't care what anybody says. It was riveting. I got sunburned on the beach because I could not tear myself away from TELL NO ONE. Just the type of juicy mystery and deep dark secrets I love. Wonderful, just wonderful. Anybody, especially critics, who pan this book, are just jealous that they cannot write thrillers this well."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck and his wife Elizabeth have been participating in a ritual for years: Each year, they return to the tree where together they carved their initials as kids. During one celebration, Beck is beaten up and Elizabeth vanishes.Eight years pass. Elizabeth's body has been found, her murderer has been jailed, and Beck has tried to get on with his life. It hasn't been easy, and it sure doesn't get any easier when Beck gets an email from a person who seems to know things that only Elizabeth could know. Now if he could only find her. That might be difficult: The police have uncovered evidence that Beck might have had something to do with Elizabeth's death. But they're not the only ones after him.With \`Tell No One,' Harlan Coben has established himself as one of the genre's top mystery writers. And while I think his next book \`Gone for Good' is a better book, \`Tell No One' delivers mystery, suspense, action, thrills, deception, and danger on a very high level. I had a few quibbles here and there with some of the characters and their motivations, but the story was gripping and made me turn the pages at a pretty good rate. If you haven't tried Coben, \`Tell No One' is a good place to start. You certainly won't be bored. Tell everyone."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"It's clique I know, but Coban's novels always have me on the edge of my seat. Well, at least this one and Gone for Good. I think I've found one of my new favorite suspense writers. This guy is great!I loved this book because one- it's fast paced. You're not bored to death at the unimportant details of this guy's life. Two- the characters are likable. I love how at certain parts he's talking to you. Three- you don't have any idea how it will end up. But he feeds you enough along the way, so that you, like the character are figuring somethings out in the process.This book was a fun read, it went by very quickly. If you're looking for a new author to try and you like authors like James Patterson, Michael Connelly or John Grisham, I'd recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck lives under the constant shadow of his wife's abduction and brutal murder eight years ago. Although he knows he must move on, he can't forget the only woman he loved since childhood. Then one day David gets a myterious message directing him to a Web site. What he finally sees on the site nearly stops his heart--is that who he thinks it is? Who is the person sending him these messages with phrases only he and his wife shared? And why is this person warning him to \\"tell no one?\\"This is the first Coben novel that I read, and I enjoyed it. Yes, you need to suspend disbelief somewhat, but it is an all-around fun suspense thriller that can be read easily in one sitting. Coben allows David to tell his own story which is both suspensful and humorous at times. David's self-deprecating manner makes him an edearing character.I think this book is worth the read. Take it to the beach, read it on your commute, curl up on the couch on a rainy day...it may not be deeply profound, but it's a fun read. I also recommend Gone For Good--very similar plots, but I think I actually liked it better than Tell No One.(mellion108 from Michigan)"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Author Harlan Coben in his first venture outside his Myron Bolitar series really has not deviated much from that proven script by producing a page-turning suspenseful story with some interesting and largely sympathetic characters.The story revolves around the abrupt disappearance of the childhood sweetheart and then wife of Dr. David Beck, Elizabeth, some eight years prior during a nocturnal outing at a private lake. Elizabeth's body was supposedly found days later, the victim of a serial killer. But after all of that time, strange things begin happening. Two bodies are found at the same lake and Dr. Beck receives some mysterious E-mails. Dr. Beck, not having quite the resourcefulness of the redoubtable Myron, fumbles his way through these developments and even draws suspicion to himself as a suspect.Dr. Beck gets a lot of support from an old college friend and now a lesbian super-model and a crusty, tough female lawyer as the mystery unfolds. He gains some exceedingly timely assistance from the network of a street drug-dealer whose son is a patient at the clinic where Dr. Beck works as a pediatrician. There is a certain amount of inexplicable computer expertise exhibited by not only the bad guys tracking Dr. Beck's every move but also by the mysterious E-Mail sender.Plausibility may be stretched at times in this story and several fairly important developments are largely left unexplained. For example, a fugitive who has hidden in the area of the private lake for thirty years is convenient for the story but the reader learns little about him. The role of the father of the murdered wife is key, but good explanations for his behavior given the story outcome are somewhat lacking.Despite any shortcomings the book will keep the reader's interest. There is a compelling main story line, not to be revealed here. It will be interesting to see how Coben does in his other non-Bolitar books."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I started Tell No One last night and finished it this afternoon. I had to force myself to put the book down and go to sleep! The action is non-stop and I hung on to every word.Coben does a great job developing his characters and I found myself really caring about, not only Dr. Beck - the main character, but the supporting characters as well. He managed to avoid sterotypes (in his portrayal of lesbians and drug dealers) and give each character a different edge.This is the first book I have read by Corben, but it certainly will not be the last!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I don't know how this got as many good stars as it did. I'll keep this short since there are so many long reviews that tell you everything but the dedication. Overall the plot had a good premise. But, the characters aren't well developed. Toward the end of the book it pretends to be a thriller. It is a easy read, and yes somewhat enjoyable. Nothing that I would EVER recommend to someone."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Great premise...a good read but only up to a point, about half-way through. Then, Mr.Coben spoiled it with his politically correct speech, cardboard characters and predictable plot twists.It's a pity!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I was blown away by the suspense in this book. I honestly could not put it down. I had only read one Coben book before so I can't say I was a huge fan. I am now. I read this book in one day and have now purchased all past books by this author. Hugely entertaining."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book is entertaining and will keep you engaged, but the characters are the typical flat, somewhat over the top characters you find in most thrillers these days. I didn't see anything remarkable about this writer, he is pretty typical of the genre these days: the book is plot-driven and about as deep as a two-year-old's wading pool. That said, it delivers what most people want, which is a fast pace and enought plot twists to keep you going. I had it figured out about a third of the way through, though."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is the third Coben novel I've read. All were enjoyable, but each is dragged down by Coben's penchant for complex plots that often veer into the unbelievable. He also has an unfortunate tendency to carry some characters from one novel to another. This is particularly grueling because Coben's characters aren't well developed to begin with.All that said and done, Coben is a thoroughly enjoyable read.His plots, as stretched as they become, have a glow of craftsmanship to them. They definitely do propel you through the story. The characters, flat as they often are, still have enough heft to keep your interest.In short, Coben and in this case &quot;Tell No One&quot; are just plain fun reads. They will keep your interest. I intend to pursue all of Coben's novels, not only because they are fun reading, but because this writer has a future and could indeed turn out to be one of the best suspense novelists of all time. It's kind of fun to watch his growth.Jerry"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is a truly brillliant book! Me and both of my friends have read ti and we all agree that it is fab!

Definatly READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book is certainly an easy read and a page-turner, and yes, it has a neat little twist at the end. But I didn't believe in a single one of the characters; they were nothing but cardboard cut-outs. Of course, the hero (and all of his friends) are extremely clever, and the police are all extremely stupid (and malicious). The story regarding the disappearance of the wife is laughable in its implausability. I really wanted to like this book, but just can't give it a good rating."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Not only does this have a non-stop dose of suspense and tension but the writing here is among author Harlan Coban's best EVER. After Dr. Beck loses his wife one tragic night, his life is set on a course that will go into the realm of the near-impossible. A few words of advice: Don't get so wrapped up in the turbo-charged tension that you fail to enjoy the wonderful writing in this book. And make no mistake - Coben is among the finest suspense writers out there. How many writers, for instance, can write a first paragraph as tight and foreboding as this one?:... ' There should have been a dark whisper in the wind. Or maybe a deep chill in the bone. Something. An ethereal song only Elizabeth or I could hear. A tightness in the air. Some textbook premonition. There are misfortunes we almost expect in life- what happened to my parents, for example - and then there are other dark moments, moments of sudden violence, that alter everything. There was my life before the tragedy. There is my life now. The two have painfully little in common....'"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I read the premise of this book and that convinced me to read it. Beck thinks his wife his dead, then gets a mysterious email that makes him think she is still alive. Sounds great, and it is. Once he receives the email, Beck begins to investigate the circumstances around his wife's death, hoping to find out whether or not to believe in the impossible, that she isn't really dead. This part of the book is fast paced and exciting.But if his wife is really alive, then what happened eight years ago when she supposedly died? Obviously there has to have been a conflict eight years ago, and this is where the story falls apart. First of all, the situation, which involves murder and blackmail seems contrived. The bad guy also seems to be all powerful and have thugs working for him that can do anything, yet we get no sense of who the bad guy is. Finally, towards the end of the novel, when what happened 8 years ago is relevant to the current story, we find out about it by the author having one of the characters tell what happened.Richard North Patterson is an author who uses flashbacks effectively. They would have helped immensley in this story. The situation surrounding his wife's death is obviously important, yet Coben forces us not to care."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This got a pretty good review in the Washington Post Book World so I decided to read it. I don't know...the narrator being best buddies with a drug dealer who's always there to watch his back...? I just didn't buy that AT ALL. That kind of thing was done better and much more believably in &quot;Marathon Man&quot; years ago. And the ending -- where the heck did that come from?

TELL NO ONE leaves nothing to be desired. This is, by far, the best mystery book out there right now.Dr. David Beck gets an e-mail from his wife who has been dead for 8 years, and he is now sent on one remarkable ride, meeting up with several interesting characters. Coben intertwines them so perfectly with a nice, faced-paced, easy-flowing storyline, you cannot help but enjoy this book.TELL NO ONE keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire whodunnit book. This book is amazing. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. This is a MUST READ. It will not dissappoint."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Let me begin by saying that I am not a major fan of suspense-thriller novels, so I read this book after my wife walked away from it feeling confused and disappointed. I was intrigued by the fragments of the story she shared with me, and so I picked it up and gave it a read.The novel, &quot;Tell No One&quot; by Harlan Coben, is a somewhat dis-jointed novel about a husband who loses his wife while on a getaway with her at a family cabin. He is attacked and left for dead, and when he recovers, he discovers his wife is taken.Eight years later, having long believed that his wife is dead, he receives a strange Email that suggests that she is anything but. Before long, the story delves into a tale of deceit, murder, corruption which ultimately leads the husband into a world that put his life in great peril.Sounds like fun, doesn't it?It is, but the novel, written partially in the first person, partially in the third, reads more like a screenplay than a novel. The characters are shallow, with little or no development which often leaves the reader feeling indifferent about the situations they are placed in. Coben's ability to depict some of the graphic acts taken on various characters throughout the novel read more like a &quot;how-to&quot; manual than descriptive narrative, leaving the reader feeling grossed out and unsettled (which may be the desired effect), but his inability to translate that method of storytelling to the thoughts and motivations of his characters again leave the reader feeling unsympathetic to the plight of the victims.To his credit, this story moves quickly, and does not drone on with the exposition so many writers of this genre employ, placing and presenting background for the situations and events in a way that can often bore the reader, or be insulting to their intelligence, but I think this novel could have used a little character expositon to give them depth and belivability.For those looking for an incredible, unbelievable story that they can escape into for a few hours, this novel is probably for you. However, do not expect it to be a great literary work-its not. Its very predictable, relying on graphic violence to fill the void of genuine suspense. If you are looking for a more intense novel in this genre, try Thomas Harris's &quot;Lecter&quot; novels. They hit the mark far more solidly than this effort.Scott Kolecki"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I feel that it is a mistake to compare this, the latest of Harlen Coben's books, to his suberb series starring Myron Bolitar. They are two separate and distinct entities and should be viewed as such. This novel is excellent in its content, characters and plot. Coben builds a fascinating, gripping story from page one and episode upon episode keeps us turning pages and striving to unravel the mystery of Elizabeth! The roads he leads us on are winding and treacherous and my mind would not rest until the last page. What an excellent display of artistic talent and how marvelous that Coben can stretch that talent to give us yet another marvelous read. Unlike many mysteries that are solved speedily in the last chapter and leave me thouroughly disappointed - I found that the clues were there for me to solve along with the writer. I liked how the title &quot;Tell No One&quot; was repeated in the novel but not in the same words. Look for them when you read. How subtle and intriguing! Of course, it was not easy at all to solve, but the fun was in the many times I changed my mind as to what was happening...and the fact that I was shocked and amazed at how it all turns out. So actually, I never solved it but had fun trying!I wish I could hand Coben a bouquet of flowers for his courage in following his muse and venturing forth on this new tack to his writing....and for succeeding in giving us this gem of a novel. I waited patiently for this book as the author had told me in an e-mail that this would be a 'stand alone' novel. Harlan, it was well worth the wait.Thank you!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Normally, I wouldn't review a book I'd only read a few pages of, but the writing here is so disappointing that I had to say something. I've read two other Coben books (not the sports ones), and while he's not my favorite, the books did keep me interested. Not this one.Like others have said, this feels like writing done fast and under pressure. The narrator keeps making asides to the reader, such as \\"Please don't gag when I say this.\\" I feel like the author is admitting to us that he knows how corny the writing is.In addition, the racial politics were really off-putting. The narrator says he's not 'Benevolent White Man' right in the middle of being just that, taking care of poor little black girls (and their mothers) who don't know any better. Give it a rest! But hey, his sister's a lesbian so it's all good, right? Ugh."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I'm sure I've read worse books than Harlan Coben's \\"Tell No One\\", but at the moment, I'm hard-pressed to think of one. James Patterson's \\"When the Wind Blows\\" is certainly in the running. \\"Tell No One\\" is about a thirty-ish New York pediatrician whose wife had ostensibly been murdered,eight years before, by a serial killer while the childhood sweethearts were frolicking at his grandfather's abandoned summer camp. Suddenly the good doctor begins receiving e-mails from his presumably dead wife containing information only the two of them could have known. So far, so good.Coben has us genuinely intrigued and engrossed in this \\"Diabolique\\"-like scenario. From this exposition the book goes downhill, as a convoluted, far-fetched plot shot through with holes confusingly weaves through enough layers of ruling class corruption, cover-ups, deceptions and \\"surprises\\" to suffice for a dozen potboilers of this ilk. Unfortunately, Coben's writing \\"style\\"-to use the word advisably- is all too well-suited to this at time laughably implausible yarn. Aside from his confusing switching from first to third person, to say Coben's prose is as spare as it is pedestrian is like observing that Al Roker could stand to lose a pound or two. Now, there's nothing wrong with bare-bones prose when utilized by a master such as Hemingway, for whom less was more. Sadly,in Coben's case less is even lesser. This third-rate prose style is further sabotaged by the author's relentless penchant for shopworn cliches and similes and metaphors so egregious that even the likes of Mickey Spillane wouldn't think twice about blue-penciling them.Thus, we are treated for lines like \\"His pounding heart was like a bird desperately trying to escape from a cage.\\", or \\"the shocking realization hit him like a falling piano.\\" Plot contrivances abound, along with the de rigeur stock characters infesting this genre: the politically correct creation of characters such as the lesbian couple raising a child(the doctor's sister is gay), and our hero's tough, felonious, yet supportive and protective Afro-American drug dealer allies -really a patronizing, modern update on the \\"noble savage\\". As \\"Tell No One\\" tripped, stumbled and fell toward its predictable climax,I was already envisioning the mediocre, yet unreasonably profitable film that will no doubt ensue from this dismal fare.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this author; so much so, that I went on to read No Second Chance. I would surely read more Coben."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlen seems to know the reader's pulse. But, it seems like most of its ideas are getting repeated. Nontheless, nothing can take away the credit from \\"tell no one\\".Dr. Beck seems to be devastated from his wife's death and even after 8 years, couldn't forget her. Then, one day, an email changes his destiny. He finds out that his love of life, his wife, Elizabeth is alive. But, she cautions him that he'll be watched and followed.What happens from there is a high speed drama, non-stop action pitching to the heights of the Everest and as low as the Marina trench. Harlen should be credit with the gift of story telling and how to keep you at the edge of your pants.But, this beautiful piece has its own flaws. First of all and the most important, is the gory details in which the author has went to describe the state of Beck. Time and again, it pops-up from nowhere and take you by surprise. You are into a formula 1 car and suddenly there is a bump. And if it happens time and again, you are bound to get irritated.So, you will enjoy the drive but its a bit bumpy."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Made it to the end of the book but wished I hadn't bothered. Not worth reading. The writing wasn't very good, the story kept wandering about and wasn't very believable and neither were the characters."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Very intense book, I had no idea who really killed Brandon Scope until the last chapter, I was really shocked."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Too many reviews go into great depth about the story.All I have to say is if you want a good read and have read a few of his books so far then this is the best one.The story flows all the way too the end and finishes leaving you satisfied with the time you have invested in reading it.It makes me want to read more of his work."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Riveted to the pages !!!!! Deepest love story. Lots of twists and surprises......but I knew who the villain was early on."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I was drawn in by the excellent character development. The characters were interesting yet believable. I liked the lesbian angle, especially that it was not overdone. I thought that the father-in-law character should have been better developed.I liked the summary which gave some closure.I like that the main character had flaws.It would be good to know which books that include these characters require an order in which to be read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have enjoyed most of Harlan Coben's books, but this one kept me reading late into the night, lots of twists and turns. I enjoy mysteries and this one was a little different than what I was expecting. Enjoyable, hope there is a sequel."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I started reading Harlen Coben books after seeing him on the Today show talking about his new book Stay Close. That one was good but Tell No One was better. I read it in a couple of days, which is good for me because I run a Bed & Breakfast and I am pretty busy."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first Coben book, so I went in without preconceptions based on his Bolitar series. Despite a little distraction over what I'd consider writing style in the first couple of chapters, where the main character seemed to keep saying things like \\"Sickening, I know\\" or \\"Crazy, I know\\", or \\"Insert-one-word-description-here, I know,\\" I found this book a really engrossing read and \\"almost thoroughly rewarding.\\"I found it intriguing when messages containing information only Elizabeth could be privy to begin surfacing 8 years after her death. The story is revealed in a way that creates significant subtext and keeps the reader engaged in trying to figure out what exactly is going on. I also like the author's flair with simile throughout. My favorite example: \\"Human beings . . . littered the floor like losing stubs at an OTB.\\"My only real criticism--and it's one that could just about ruin the whole thing for me if I let it--relates to the profound twist that came at the very end. Granted, it could have been a really cool twist if it worked completely. It just didn't. That last twist was just a bit too much and, for me, it called the believability of the characters' actions into question.Nevertheless, on balance, a recommended read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This one doesn't have the humor of Coben's buddy novels, but it's a good, fast, suspense story. I enjoyed it as much as his others.It reminded me of a good James Patterson book."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Really enjoyed this one. I read it on holiday and didn't want to put it down. I won't go over the plot, as others have already done that, but it is a very good thriller and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Got Netflix recently and happened upon this title without realizing it was the same as this book. A very good job the French directors did at making it into a movie."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Eight years ago, Dr. David Beck seemed to have it all. Most of all, the love of his life, his wife Elizabeth. They had know each other since they were children and at the age of 12 had shared their first kiss and carved their initials in a tree at the lake front summer camp of David's grandfather. Every year since, they returned to that tree for their \\"kiss time\\" anniversary. Or they had until that night eight years ago, when they were attacked at the lake, David knocked unconscious and Elizabeth dragged away to her death at the hands of a serial killer, KillRoy.Or was she?On the anniversary of her murder, David receives an e-mail, making a reference to something only he and Elizabeth would understand. But how could it be? Her body was found, her killer is in jail. Is this some horrible joke? Is he going mad, wishing to believe something that is impossible or could, somehow, Elizabeth possibly be alive. He is warned to tell no one. Can he trust anyone to help him find the truth? The police, the FBI, his best friend since college, Shauna...will asking for their help put Elizabeth in more danger if she is alive and what price is David willing to pay to find out the truth of what happen that night.This is the first one of Coben's books that I have read and a fine introduction to his work it is. It is a well written, fast paced thriller with enough action and twists and turns to keep you interested from the first page to the satisfying conclusion. And he also treats us to a good cast of characters to accompany us on the journey, characters that are never one dimension. There are good cops and bad, fine upstanding citizens that may have some very nasty secrets and even our \\"hero\\" David may have a few skeletons of his own that he would rather keep unknown. But the price of truth may have a very high cost that will play out until the very last page.Overall, a satisfying, entertaining thriller that will certainly have me checking out some others of Mr. Coben books. Tell No One is a stand alone mystery but I am also anxious to check out his Myron Bolitar series, for which he is perhaps best known."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was one fantastic book! It was the first book I read by Harlan Coben, but what a place to start! It had mystery, suspense and it never failed to make me keep turning pages, no matter how tired I got at night!! I couldn't put it down! If you're a fan of mysteries with great character development, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I first saw the movie, an excellent French movie. It was so good that when it was done I thought that I had not seen anything that good in years. My big surprise was that it was based on an American novel by Harlan Coben. I like Harlan Coben's novels. They are all 4 stars for me. They are enjoyable reads with great twists and turns. However, I forget them as soon as I'm done. The film however is unforgettable. Not only a great mystery but a great love story. I just read the novel, interested in seeing if Coben went beyond my usual 4 stars and no, he did not. The novel is his usual great rollicking plot based mystery thriller. However, it is not a great love story.The plot is pure Coben where it grabs you on page one and just keeps getting unraveling from there until it comes together at the end. A pediatrician lost his wife to a serial killer eight years ago. Two other bodies are discovered that tie into her murder at the time the story begins, eight years after her death. This unleashes all sorts of inquiries into her death and most bizarrely, the husband receives an email message from her present day with a video showing she is alive. Her email message though is that he must tell no one that she is alive. So he tries to find out if she ever really died eight years ago and runs into obstacle after obstacle."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I liked this book a lot. It's pretty exciting to read and doesn't kill you with suspense and drag it out like some other 'thrillers'. Anyway I liked this book enough that I am interested in reading more of this author's books but it seems that they are pretty much all the same - someone is supposedly dead and an event happens that provides possibility of that someone still being alive. Definitely worth the read, though."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Excellent condition - received in a timely manner - would buy again from this seller"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was a good mystery. Was off to a good start with an attack and loss of the main character's wife. Fast forward then 8 years to him still recovering from losing his wife, now a successful pediatrician, but one that has no real life. Suddenly mysterious emails and live links that seem to indicate that his wife is alive. He is the ultimate victim, no only a widower and really nice guy, but suddenly at this same time law enforcement is looking to nail him for the crime. So, he is off, being pursued by the police and the bad guys to hook up with his wife (hoping she is still alive)and ultimately prove that he did not kill her. Story lines are her family (who end up being directly involved in her disappearance), a asian for hire murderer that kills with his hands (interesting), and a black male drug dealer who saves his life over and over again because he depends on the good doc to care for his small son. Good tension, lots of twists and turns and a happy ending. Still a question though as to where the wife was for 8 years and why she couldn't try to link up earlier (even though very dangerous). Eight years is a long time. I enjoyed this but enjoy other thriller writers better like Allison Brennon, Mary Jane Clark, John Darton, are better."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was Coben's first post-Bolitar stand-alone novel, and he starts out with a theme that reoccurs through many of his stand-alones -- the missing and/or presumed dead loved one. It borders a little on over-used, yet it never fails to create suspense. It takes a while in this story before you're really sure whether or not Elizabeth is alive, but figuring that out is far from the whole story. There's a lot going on here -- so much that I got a little lost in a few places -- but Coben does a good job of tying it all up in the end. And I really did not guess the final twist. It was twisty enough to make you rethink some of Beck's actions. Gotta love that!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"One of my first Harlan Coben stories, but I loved it. I enjoy a story full of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very end. This story did not disappoint. I thought I had it figured out and he added a new twist that changed everything. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. It kept my interest the entire time and was quite the page turner. I can't wait to read another one of Harlen's mysteries. Read this one and it won't disappoint!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Can you imagine seeing your spouse...eight years after he or she died? Read this book and you will experience just that.There were so many twists and turns to this plot! It kept me turning the pages. I just had to know what was going to happen. Even during the parts when I knew what was going to happen, I had to keep reading to know why.A brilliantly spun story...I wonder if the movie will be any good?"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Coben is way out of his league here in his attempt to concoct a serious thriller. The plot makes no sense with numerous inconsistencies, and the characters are equally implausible. His Myron Bolitar novels are also implausible, but light and funny, with comic book characters so over the top I laugh out loud. This is a different and much more difficult genre for him altogether, and I couldn't wait for this experiment to end."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"although slightly similar to The Woods, I still really enjoyed this book......Coben continues to write great stories, I can't wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book was a very interesting and action-packed book. It kept me guessing and reading until the book was done. Harlan Coben really knows how to write a book. He speaks well to the reader and keeps everything simple, easy, and to the point. He hides nothing from the reader and this is something that I for one really appreciated because some authors will make things hard to understand and use fruity language. The language he uses is very modern and language that is used in the real world. He also includes real situations that make it easier to relate to the story. This is a great thriller and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck is a pediatrician who is still grievibg the loss of his wife Elizabeth, 8 years ago.

All this time later as David still searches for clues as to what really happened-appears a message on his computer, It is a warning which reads \\"Tell No One.\\" Tell no one what though? This writer keeps giving warnings to David, and the next thing he sees is Elizabeth's picture waving at him looking as though she is still alive and well-and maybe she is. But in the process, David is getting framed for strings of murders, as someone is against him, and wants revenge. And this person will stop at nothing to get David, And not only that, but he just knows that Elizabeth is still alive after receiving clues to meet her at a resort.I thought the book had too many twists and turns at once, and in places was disjointed as well.

What a surprise ending!!!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I think that this may be one of the most exciting books that I have ever read! It is a real page turner with twists and turns at every corner. Some may have thought that it was a tad unbelieveable but so are soap operas yet millions still watch them, to me thats the point of a good novel to get wraped up in a non-reality so to speak. I've given this book to my entire family and they all LOVE it and continue to pass it on. I give it 5 Stars!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Easy enough to read on an airplane, but not complete fluff. Just good old fun! Lots of suspense and twists. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book from the very first word starts you on a journey of twist and turns that are totally believeable. I gave this book to three other people who had the same problem of putting it down. This is a must read book for everyone.... Tell everyone about this book. I sure have."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Fun and fast paced, Tell No One is a great vacation book. Get lost in it for a week when you're on the beach or away for Christmas. Once you start, it's hard to stop with this one. My only complaint is the ending--slightly too much &quot;who's on first&quot; that adds nothing to the great three hundred pages that preceeded it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A good story with a compelling plot, but a little too sappy for my tastes. Overall I enjoyed the book. It's an easy read and Eric Wu was a fearful bad guy. But Beck is just not a strong enough lead character. Bring back Myron and Win."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have never read a Harlan Coben book before and just happened to pick this up. It was SO good I couldn't put it down and I read it in one day. I'm anxious to read some more of his books."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Excellent book! Could not put it down. Lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing throughout the whole book and ends with a surprise. First book I read by this author and will seek other books by him as well."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book started promisingly, then fizzled. It was the writing itself...not great. Lots of stereotypes, cliches, repeatedly uninteresting phrasing. I thought if I heard the response \\"WHAT?\\" in dialogue one more time I would go mad. I wanted to say \\"DUH.\\" I've asked it a thousand times in these reviews...don't they edit writers these days? This book is like some amateur college writing attempt...the writer had a \\"good idea\\" but wasn't experienced enough to carry it through as a truly smart, literary accomplishment.If you would like to read a truly fantastic book with a similar subject matter (love a man's life, presumed dead, surfaces years later) try \\"Waking The Dead\\" by Scott Spencer. Now that's a literary coup.One other thing: I listened to this book on Recorded Books, Inc., (unabridged) tapes. The reader, an excellent character actor named Ed Sala, was very good. However, this is meant to be a New York City book, with savvy New York characters, and Ed Sala is obviously a southerner. I couldn't help seeing it taking place in some backwater town in a state like Kentucky or Tennessee. Hello! Was anybody home at Recorded Books, Inc., when they assigned it to Sala? It really took away from the novel, I feel. Though it wasn't, as I said, a very well-written book, it might have been presented more authentically if someone who was a true New Yorker had read it. I hope someone at Recorded is listening...so to speak."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"There aren't many books that I have read where it gave me the feeling of satisfaction of a good read. Tell No One pleasantly surprised me just when I thought it was getting a bit cheesy when the cat and mouse chase. I enjoyed it and I would recommend it as a good, fun, quick read for the summer."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One is a wonderful escapist thriller that is guaranteed to keep the reader guessing. However, it's certainly not a book for all.The plot of this book is its best attribute. Coben has set out a wonderful, interesting story that keeps one reading. This is one of the few books that I can say I actually read in 24 hours and didn't get bored with. Coben's pacing is his greatest asset. He knows how to keep the story moving, and provides an unending number of twists.The writing, however, certainly leaves something to be desired. This is a first-person account, and often the narrator takes time out to speak directly to the audience on trivial issues, such as cliches. It takes away from the novel. Also, like many writers today, Coben feels the need to blow up his similies and metaphors. He describes a character's dress as plunging like a deep sea diver. Some of the literary aspects are forced, and will bother some readers.To sum up the book -- in Coben's style -- it is a fun read that goes by faster than snot when an elephant sneezes."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I recently joined a neighborhood book club and this is the second book we have read. I am almost disappointed that it read it so fast... now I have to wait weeks before we meet to discuss. It is a fast read and full of surprises. I enjoyed it very much. I think it would make a great movie! The book is action packed and I was very surprised at many of the plot twists and I could never guess what was happening next. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have read all of Coben's books and have been a fan for years. \`Tell No One' is by far the most suspenseful. I couldn't put it down. It would have gotten a five star review except Harlan fell asleep on the last page of the book. His final twist was one too many and damaged the credibility of the story line.Where was his editor? Someone should have had the courage to stop the rollercoaster ride one page before it ended!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I loved this book. It was well written, thrilling and exciting. I would highly recommend this book. It is hard to put down though so make sure you have enough time to read straight through."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have nothing against unreliable narrators or surprise plot twists, but Coben's use of such devices here is excessive and ultimately undercuts the entire book. Time and again we are suddenly given information that Beck, the book's hero, has had since the beginning, and which clearly changes the situation, but which is kept from us simply in order to provide a moment of &quot;shock.&quot; What becomes apparent after a while is that these evasions are necessary to distract us from the fact that very little of the plot actually makes sense. For example, without giving away the ending, the revelation that comes on the very last page requires us to believe that the main character acted in a way totally out of keeping with everything else we know about him, and totally out of keeping with any logical or even believable course of action. If the events described had actually occured, would any sane person have simply kept quiet about it? Would any sane person fail to see the connections between that event and the wife's abduction?Eh, I'm ranting. Two nights wasted, as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I read a wide variety of mysteries and thrillers and was pleasantly surprised by this book with the flourescent pink cover. It caught my eye on the new shelf at the library. I thought the author did a great job of building the mystery, layer by layer. I knew how I wanted it to end but was never sure how it would. Many times I have it figured out and it ruins the book for me. Unlike a previous reviewer, I grew to care about the main character and his deceased wife. I did find the lesbian sister and partner characters lacking . Their relationship was never fleshed out so it came off as being thrown in to be politically correct. Other than that, I loved the book. I couldn't stop thinking about it and read it nearly non stop to see how it would end."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"After several people told me this was great fun, I plunked down my [money] and looked forward to a fast paced, thrill ride. Unfortunately, it reads more like a how -to -write- a -mystery -and -hope- the -movie -people -buy -it -book. I finished it but only to see just how dull it could be...I wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Okay, I confess. I love Harlan Coben. I've read every book he's written and he just gets better and better. It's a brave author who'll break from a winning series&Ntilde;Dennis LeHane did it recently, brilliantly&Ntilde;and Coben does it in Tell No one with great success.This tale of a doctor still grieving the murder of his wife eight years after the fact takes off from the blocks at a gallop and never lets up for a moment. The writing is simple and effective, with moments of sweet humor; the plot is sinuously complex and ultimately most satisfying.Harlan Coben is getting the recognition now he so richly deserves. This is a terrific book; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is my first Harlen Coben book---but it will NOT be my last! I could NOT put the book down and was so depressed when it was over ! I wanted more, more !!!! Didn't want to do anything but read, read, read !!

Shelley in Iowa :-)"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The suspenseful story caught - and held - my attention immediately. And everything in the story seemed to work together to keep the action moving. Nothing thrown in that didn't fit. And with every page that I read, I kept thinking - and what next? How are we going to get through or around this. How are we going to find the answers? And who is going to manage to survive? Thoroughly enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"What!!!! Five stars from almost everyone....this book is just o.k., not great, not riveting, tho the ending was a surprise. Easy summer read. Why did I stick with it...who knows."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"It doesn't matter if Mr. Coben is writing in his Myron Bolitar series or writing a stand alone, the result is the same. A well written story with a fast pace, twisting plot and dynamite ending. This book will keep you turning pages and provide perfect entertainment for those who like a good who-dunnit. If you have never read Harlan Coben you have the pleasure of going and starting his Bolitar series--all entries are excellent."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A little half-way thru the book, I kept wondering &quot;where is the story to this book?' I very rarely put a book in the &quot;trade&quot; pile without reading it, but this one went there quickly. I don't care about any of the characters, I don't care what really happened to anyone in the book. Second Chance was so good - - what happened, Harlan???"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I became a great fan of Harlan Coben after reading \\"gone for good\\" and \\"no second chance\\". Both are marvellous thrillers, with an additional touch of humanity, care, and social concern, that represent an important difference from most macho-driven thrillers. The greatest thing about the two books was that they did not resemble each other at all.But \\"tell no one\\" was a great disappointment: first, it consisted of many motives that appeared in the two other books (e.g. without being a spolier: the final meeting in a deserted camp in the woods; the dead wife; the hero is a doctor... and many more). I don't know which book appeared last, but obviously reading \\"tell no one\\" as the third of the three gave me little pleasure because it all seemed so familiar.The second problem is that the fantastically suspending story of \\"tell no one\\" is resolved in a very unsatisfactory way. Lots of \\"holes\\" in the story, strange plot turns, and at best twists that were predictable 20 pages in advance (compare to the breathtaking twists in the other two novels).But I'd hope that this was just a novel published under publishing house time pressure... I'm sure there's a lot more of great things to read from Harlan Coben"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Love suspense thrillers that keep me on the edge of my seat until the very last page."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"If this is better than his other books I won't bother with reading them. So many twists and turns it was totally unbelievable. I know its fiction but give me a break........."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The book starts out with a catchy premise but rapidly goes downhill (or is it nowhere?). The characters are cardboard (or styrofoam) and the plot just too outlandish. Honestly, it reads like it was written by a ninth-grader with a great imagination but little knowledge of the writing craft. I can't believe this book was a bestseller or that so many people recommended this author to me. I'm certainly not tempted to try any of his other works."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A very fast paced novel, and thankfully because as you think about the crimes that were supposedly committed and subsequently investigated by police and then closed - you laugh outloud at the unreality of it. These Keystone Kops couldn't find a matzoh in Brooklyn. It was reduced to comic book \\"take it on face value\\" logic, more for Hollywood then for serious writers who should have the time and space to develop realistic plots and situations. One example is the bad guy's invincible omniscience handed to him by literally bugging every house, phone line and computer in Christendom, for years on end no less. Maybe if the victim cleaned his house once in 8 years he could find these bugs in every pore of his living space. I was laughing too hard or I would have helped him.The story gets too ponderous to believe, by the time you realize the plot is as leaky as an Enron tax return, you're sucked in and you owe it to yourself to finish. Don't expect to be enchanted and mystified with the ending, it's not Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz in climax but more like Archie and Edith Bunker.So if you can check your intellect at the door, sit down with the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus and Spiderman, you'll have a fast pace read, that even is so bold as to pit a black drug dealer against a billionaire businessmen's own personal Odd Job. Maybe Hollywood will make it more believable?"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is the most stupid, unbelievable, shot full of holes BS I've ever read. I can't even bring myself to write areview it's that worthless. The characters are all extremists (the baddest of the bad and good goodiest). They areunbelievably lame. I've read most all of Coben's Myron Bolitar novels and thought they were pretty good. Theydid start to get old tho. But this Tell No One stinks. It's cheap. Sorry, like I said it's not even worth a review. SoI guess I'll just place my star vote and shutup."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A cracking, couldn't-put-down read.

I just can't wait to get hold of the next one!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The writing style is choppy and overly dramatic. It seemed like a parody or a movie script in parts.

Beck is now taunted with the impossible... his dead wife, Elizabeth, may be alive... or is it all a hoax.Tell No One is a suspense. You won't be able to put it done. It's full of twists and plots. Things that are unexpected, happen. A book this size usually would take me a few days to finish, but I finished it in one day. I couldn't put it done."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The first time I started reading this book, I put it aside due to its violence. If you're used to graphic violence in books, it won't bother you at all, but if most of your experience with thrillers comes from Agatha Christie instead of Stephen King, it might bother you.After a week or so, though, I came back to the book, because I absolutely had to see how it ended. The plot twists were, in hindsight, not very original, but while you're following them, they do indeed keep you on your toes. The suspense finally got to me -- I had to figure out who was sending David these e-mails.The deletion of the two hit-men would make this book a much more pleasant read, and detract from the plot and suspense very little."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first Coben read.

Tell No One had me from page one and I could not put the book down. Great character development and plot twists that will have you squirming. I was unable to guess the ending and I love that about Coben's writing."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I picked up this book one evening, intending to read for maybe 30 minutes before bed. Well I couldn't put it down, and I ended up reading it all the way through. Partly this is because it's quite suspenseful and I was worried that I'd have bad dreams if I put it down, but also because it gripped me from the start and held me tight.David Beck's beloved wife, Elizabeth, was murdered eight years previously. The book opens with the murder, but thankfully it's not described too graphically. Now, eight years later, he is receiving emails from someone who seems to think that she is still alive. Pretty quickly it becomes evident that he is also under surveillance and in danger himself.This is a swiftly paced book with several great twists. I passed this book onto my husband and he read it just as fast and enjoyed it just as much as I did. I highly recommend it to all thriller/suspense fans."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"WOW!WOW!WOW!WOW!WOW...! MY HEAD IS SPINNING WITH COMPLETE ASTONISHMENT!

This took a great deal of imagination and hard work to put this masterpiece together..."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben has broken his mold. The Myron Bolitar series was a delightful, irreverent bit of light mystery fun. &quot;Tell No One&quot; is completely different. This is a hold-on-to-your-seat tension-filled thriller. Dr. David Beck tries to make sense out of the mysterious e-mail he got from his wife -- who was murdered 8 years earlier AND whose body was identified. As he follows up the terrible forces of evil close in on him. Is his wife actually alive? What happened 8 years ago? How will Beck escape? These questions grip you as you read. My only advice ... just enjoy, because it is a very fun read ... and don't worry too much about the gaping logical holes, astonishing reversals and miraculous escapes of Beck. Hey, it's a story, after all; it doesn't mean it really has to happen."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Don't hesitate to get this book. It sucked me in at the very beginning and I had a terrible time putting it down. Read it, read it, read it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I looked forward to reading this book considering the amount of positive reviews. However, once I started, I quickly found the author's tendency to jump back and forth in the story line rather irritating. I found it rather exhausting in the beginning of the book to constantly change gears from Beck and Elisabeth to Wu and Gandel to Linda etc.. The story itself is rather suspensful and I don't regret reading this book. However, I personally prefer a more organized writing style."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"this is the first book i have read by this author and i am very impressed. it was entertaining, quick read. i highly recommend and plan on reading other books by Harlan Coben."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this new offering from Mr. Coben. It had everything needed for an enjoyable read. If the main character, Dr. David Beck was flawed, then it only made him more human and believable a character. I was surprised by the ending, but maybe the dog days of summer have fried my brain. This was a fun read, which I did not find predictible. The other characters were interesting as well - it becomes boring and trite reading about perfect, beautiful characters living in their perfect worlds."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"After reading about a chapter and a half of this book, I flipped to the inside cover about the author to see what awards he had captured. I had not heard of them before. I showed the first chapter to my 16 year old (a budding author) and proved that you don't have to be a great writer to get published! The idea and plot were ok and I read the book quickly (chapters stared 1/2 way down the page and a black page seperated each chapter) but my 16 year old could be the writer. His character and setting descriptions were so amateurish. Right from the beginning I noticed how poorly written this was."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A couple of years ago, my brother turned me on to Harlan Coben. I wasn't all that impressed with the book that he got for me and asked to read. It was ordered through Amazon. They sent me this e-mail about this book, &quot;Tell Know One.&quot; It featured a note from Harlan on how he got the idea for the book. I was immediately intrigued and couldn't wait til it came out. And the book did not let me down. From the minute I opened the book til I closed it I was glued. The plot has a lot of twists and turns. And the characters are very well thought out. I admire Mr. Coben from taking a departure from his normal character, Myron Bolitar, to give us this very well crafted and adventourous book. I'm telling everybody I know to get it! It will not let you down. I promise!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was the first time in many years that I couldn't put a book down! This one grabs you right on page 1, and forces you to surge ahead, anxious to FIND OUT!

The plot of the mystery was fairly interesting, yet the style of writing distracted me from it. I thought the writing was juvenile and phrasing of dialogue very conversational. I had read a few excellent reviews about it. I also notice the reviews from the Amazon readers- so maybe it is just my taste!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"i truly enjoyed this book--not necessarily because it was incredibly well-written, but because it told a great story and kept me guessing until the end!!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is a one day reader. It was very intense and the ending was surprising. I did not care for the idea that the main character would still be that in love with his wife after 8 years of thinking she was dead. They were middle school sweet hearts and this whole romantic idea was hard for me to swallow. Definatively, a good book and worth the time."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I was disappointed at first because it wasn't a Bolitar novel, but that feeling was quickly replaced by WOW!! Coben has REALLY out-done himself with this one. I don't want it to end. Obviously, I haven't finished it yet, but I wanted to let you know a little of what you are in for. I can't give away the ending...I don't know what it is yet, but I can't wait to find out!! You WILL want Coben to make a series out of this one as well!!David's wife Elizabeth is murdered less than a year after they are married. 8 years later they're after him for her murder.The characters are so vivid, you can actually SEE them. And the love David and Elizabeth have for each other through everything since the age of 7!! Tyrese's criminal background and heart are a great combination. There IS a little of the Bolitar in this book, too. Guess who I found lurking around town and chasing after David Beck? If you are a Myron Bolitar series fan you'd recognize him by his toothpick and boots, lovable and laughable and almost always headed in the wrong direction, Detective Dimonte!!! Is he after the wrong guy....AGAIN!!! Detective Carlson is after only one thing....the TRUTH!! Will he find it??"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"By Far the best Mystery Book I have read this year. This is my First Coben, and I am hooked. It was impossible to put down, Do not miss this book, read it You'll Love it!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Although some of the plot devices are a bit far-fetched and the writing is not exactly literary, this book is one that holds your interest. It's a good mystery with multiple plot twists, however the revelations came too quickly at the end."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is one breathtaking ride. Is there anything more intoxicating than the possibility that someone you know with absolute certainty is dead .. is not? Or at least, may not be? Or maybe told someone something really secret about you that nobody else should know before they died? Or maybe you're losing your mind? This is a good read and some of the side characters like the hopped-up drug dealer who cares deeply for his blind, hemophiliac baby, are alone worth the ride."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I finished this book in one enjoyable day involving a long airplane trip. I chose this book because I enjoyed Harlan Coben's more recent thriller, \\"Gone for Good\\". There are many similarities between the two books that made them both enjoyable reads--a loved one missing for a long period, likable characters, particularly the main character and fast paced action.Tell No One involves a very nice guy, David Beck, whose wife was murdered years ago. Beck, a pediatrician who works in a ghetto clinic, has never recovered from this loss--his childhood sweetheart and love of his life. When he gets an email from someone who appears to be his wife on a special anniversary known only to them, his life gets turned upside down. Others are also interested in his wife's murder or reappearance from the FBI who try to set him up for the murder, to nefarious characters who don't want her to reappear. Beck walks a fine line to avoid both types of enemies to find out if his wife is alive. He makes an unlikely alliance with a drug dealer who is the father of one of his patients and that world adds interest. When the plot winds down, we get a big surprise that doesnt seem to ring as true as the rest of the story--this is my only complaint with an otherwise enjoyable book.Although this is a stand-alone book, it has settings and minor characters that cross over into the later book, Gone for Good. I give the later book a slightly better rating due to its more satisfying ending but I recommend both books."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book started promisingly, then fizzled. It was the writing itself...not great. Lots of stereotypes, cliches, repeatedly uninteresting phrasing. I thought if I heard the response \\"WHAT?\\" in dialogue one more time I would go mad. I wanted to say \\"DUH.\\" I've asked it a thousand times in these reviews...don't they edit writers these days? This book is like some amateur college writing attempt...the writer had a \\"good idea\\" but wasn't experienced enough to carry it through as a truly smart, literary accomplishment.If you would like to read a fantastic book with a similar subject matter (love of a man's life, presumed dead, surfaces years later) try \\"Waking The Dead\\" by Scott Spencer. Now that's a literary masterpiece.One other thing: I listened to this on a Recorded Books, Inc., (unabridged) presentation. The reader, an excellent character actor named Ed Sala, was very good...but too folksy! This is meant to be a New York City book, with savvy New York characters, and Ed Sala is obviously a southerner. Everybody sounded like they were from some backwater town in Kentucky or Tennessee. Hello! Was anybody home at Recorded Books, Inc., when they assigned it to Sala? It really took away from the novel, I feel. Though it wasn't, as I said, a very well-written book, it might have been authentic-sounding if someone who was a true New Yorker had read it. I hope the people at Recorded Books are listening...so to speak."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This novel is missing only one thing...a warning label on the cover reading: &quot;WARNING! Only open this book if you have the time to read it cover to cover.&quot; This book is so exciting that you will not be able to put it down. It pulls you in and doesn't let you go."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One, by Harlan Coben should be titled TELL EVERYONE! This book is awesome. It is a story full of mystery and love. The author will want you to keep reading. I did not put this book down for one second, it kept me alert at all times. And in the end you will be shocked for the truth is revealed and nothing of what you expected. If you love mystery and love books then this is the right book for you. I enjoyed reading it at all times!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is one of those books that could be read from cover to cover in one sitting. I think some reviewers have done it, and if I'd have had the time I would have too. As it was, I finished it in about 2 1/2 days. The action is fast from the very first page and it almost compels you to read fast to find out what happens next. I usually take breaks after between chapters, but with this one I was literally blowing through the chapter breaks like they weren't even there.Coben has created a great work here, and I can't say enough good things about it. The key to this one is that he has created a main character that most readers will care about, and a unique &quot;what if&quot; situation that will appeal to almost anyone. Most everyone has lost someone they loved. What if you could see that person again. What if they may not really be dead. It's hard for this premise not to appeal to the reader.This one wasn't on my planned reading list, but after someone gave it to me and I read what it was about I threw it to next in line. I am so glad I did. This plot twists so much that it approaches Deaver and Patterson status. I loved it, and I'm sure most readers will as well."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"If you are a fan of his prior series' featuring the sports hero Myron Bolitar, you will probably like this book, but be a little wistful at some of the missing elements as he changes genre. Bolitar is the hero of 7 prior novels that fall in the &quot;Comic Mystery Thriller&quot; category populated by Lawrence Sanders, Lawrence Block and Janet Evanovich. Characterizations in the Bolitar books are so over the top that they make you giggle, even as you are consumed in a pace so fast that you finish the book without taking time to get a snack. Conversation is witty and cynical and you wonder if the author was a stand up comedian in a prior life. When looking for a beach book or just a great read to get over the rest of the stress, Coben is a hero to most.So, &quot;Tell No One&quot; is a big departure, and only Shauna, Tyrese &amp; Eric Wu, supporting characters in the story, will remind you that this is Coben. If you loved &quot;Tell No One&quot;, be prepared that you may find Coben's earlier books too light for your taste, if you believe a thriller is a thriller and any comic touches are just wasted words.Only 2 things hold &quot;Tell No One&quot; back from a five star rating. Coben's hero, his weaving of a tale of romance and familial loyalty, his pace and his ability to leave you guessing as his plot twists and turns are terrific! His cops are believable and admirable and his hero spins in every direction when discovering how easily he has been duped about the murder of his wife and how he has incredibly passed 8 years since her murder in absolute ignorance.The 2 things: The final unveiling of the murderer was one twist too many...we could have left the tale much more enthusiastically without it. And, the dust jacket is horrific and looks as though a middle school child covered his English text in something his mom brought home. Small things. Tell No One might be the most exciting book you read this year!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben, the author known for his series about the sports agent Myron Bolitar, has crafted a fine thriller in his book Tell No One. In this stand alone title, Coben takes his readers on the ride of a lifetime. From the first page till the last, my heart raced and I found myself staying up late at night to finish this book.David Beck, once married to Elizabeth, has finally rebuilt his life since the kidnapping, disappearance and assumed death of his beloved wife several years before. Now, a respected doctor with a practice in New York City, David finds himself experiencing some very strange events which lead him to wonder if Elizabeth could still be alive. First, an e mail arrives with information known only to the two of them, then two bodies are found on property owned by the Beck family which may have been involved in the kidnapping, and finally an image appears on a web camsite which looks suprisingly just like Elizabeth. With fury and determination, Beck begins to investiage Elizabeth's kidnapping and what has happened in the intervening years. Along the way Becks efforts are thwarted by a billionaire who may or may not be involved, the father of one of his patients who uses his street smarts to help out and a cast of other characters who are quite memorable.The pace is fast, the book becomes wet from holding it too hard with perspiring hands and you most liely will might find yourself holding your breath as the book moves along to a startling conclusion. But readers need to be warned to slow down a bit for the last 50 pages as the plot and action moves quickly fronm page to page with complicated and somewhat convoluted twists and turns.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and instead of Telling No One I tell everyone to read this book. This may have been my first Harlan Coben book but it certainly won't be the only book of his I plan on reading."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Dr. David Beck lost the love of his life eight years ago. The story of her death is so gruesome he can't bear to think about it. Elizabeth was the love of his life; they were two halves of a whole. So how can he explain the e-mail that appears so mysteriously on their anniversary, mentioning things that only they would know?This is only the beginning of a novel that reads like the twists and turns of a mountain highway. When I became ensconced comfortably in a plausible scenario, honestly believing I had finally figured things out, the author ripped the rug out from under my feet and hit me with the finale. I still shake my head at the outcome.This books reads so fast you hardly have time to hold the pages as they breeze by. When I was away from it I couldn't wait to get back to it. I had been in a reading slump until I picked up this unexpected pleasure. Coben slams the story home with believable characters and a plot that speaks to everyone who enjoys a good thriller. An Excellent book.

Opening the email will plunge David into the heart of terror, as the message contains a strange link that features a video feed of his wife - present day - mouthing the words &quot;I'm sorry&quot;!Sickened by what he just saw, David wants to dismiss this a nasty joke, but the email gives specific instructions about the future messages he will receive, and if he wants to see his wife again, he better TELL NO ONE.Desperate to find out what is going on, especially if there is a chance of Elizabeth being alive, David enters into a deadly game where someone will kill to keep their secrets safe.'Tell No One' is a slam bang page-turner that grabs hold on the first page and doesn't let go until the shocking climax. With it's well drawn characters, unbearable suspense, and stunning plot twists 'Tell No One' gives readers a night of non-stop action.Harlan Coben has written many great novels, but none as good as this one. His new novel has surpassed all expectations, and pushes him to a new level, one that ranks with John Sandford, and James Patterson.Destined to be a huge bestseller, and a must read beach book 'Tell No One' ranks as one of the better thrillers to come out in some time.A MUST read!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Just when you thoughts Harlan Coben couldn't get any better, he does. He continues his literary magic with this truly phenominal book.Coben, the mastermind behind the excellent Myron Bolitar mystery series, puts forth an amazing effort in TELL NO ONE. Meet Dr. David Beck, a loyal, caring doctor who lost his wife whom he has loved since the second grade, but manages to carry on. Left for dead himself, his wife, Elizabeth, is positively identified for dead as another victim of a serial killer. Eight years later, he receives an anonymous e-mail on the anniversary of their first kiss, leading him to believe that she may somehow still be alive. The twists and turns are a plentiful, and the adventure is one of non-stop excitement.Coben brings together a wonderful group of characters that all blend together incredibly nicely. From the drug-dealing yet good-hearted father, Tyrese, to special agent, Nick Carlson, this super cast of characters is so well-developed, you can't help but thoroughly enjoy this book. There are even a few familiar names from the Myron Bolitar series, but you'll have to read the book to find out.Overall, this novel is nothing less than spectacular. Coben's unique, yet thorough writing style shines ever so brightly in TELL NO ONE. The cogent storyline is well-developed, and the nerve-shattering suspense is outstanding, keeping you guessing until the unbelievable, surprise ending. It will not let you down."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"While some editorial reviews proclaim this book is not up to par with Coben's other literary works, I found it to be far superior to his previous books. With well-developed, realistic characters and lots of action, this book contains an element of similarity to the Alex Cross novels of James Patterson. Although &quot;Tell No One&quot; is perhaps not quite as spectatcular in comparison, it comes close and is certainly worth reading.David Beck marries his childhood sweetheart, Elizabeth Parker. Elizabeth is believed to be kidnapped and killed by a serial murderer known as, &quot;Kill Roy.&quot; But...is this really what happened? Beck starts receiving e-mails, supposedly from Elizabeth. Is Elizabeth really alive or is this the evil madness of a demented mind? The police attempt to pin the murder on Beck, himself, while a group with more sinister motives tries to frame Beck for the murder of Elizabeth. What really happened? The answers lie in the bold conclusiion. The chilling plot is full of twists and turns that holds the reader's attention from start to finish. While Coben lacks the pragmatic writing style of Patterson, the author's unique mode of psychological suspense makes the book a capricious thriller you will not want to put down until the final page has been read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"David Beck thought his wife was murdered eight years ago, the victim of a serial killer. Then an anonymous email arrives which suggests that, just possibly, she's still alive. To add to the intrigue, the murder case is reopened and Beck is now the FBI's main suspect. The action takes off when Beck becomes a fugitive and is not only pursued by the police, but also by a bunch of thugs intent on silencing him for good - and how on earth do those blokes come into it?. All the while, he tries to meet up with the mystery correspondent, not an easy task when it seems his every move is monitored.I found this to be one of those books that seems a lot shorter than it actually is because the action is non-stop, you barely have time to get over one near miss when you're confronted with some other danger or a new piece of the puzzle is put into place. It's a compelling book thanks to the mystery surrounding the death of Elizabeth Back, wife of David Beck. This was one of the more enjoyable books I've read this year and rate it very highly purely on its ability to entertain."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"When you find the love of your life, it's hard to let go, even after the loved one dies. David Beck, the protagonist of &quot;Tell No One&quot;, has continued to carry a torch for his long lost wife, Elizabeth, who died eight years before. When he receives a mysterious e-mail that couldn't have come from anyone but her, Beck goes on what can only be described as a wild goose chase--only, there are people who don't want the truth to be discovered, and they'll kill to keep it buried.This book is a refreshing change from the Anne Rices, John LeCarres and James Micheners of the contemporary literary world: the narration--when in first person--is simple, conversational and easy to understand, without being &quot;dumbed down&quot; or compromising the plot. The characters themselves are also realistic and believable--I love Beck's sister and her partner, as well as the thug with a heart of gold, Tyrese. The ending is a crisp slap in the face. &quot;Tell No One&quot; demands a second reading--reading it again allows you to see all the clues that clearly point to the outcome, even if you don't see them the first time around.&quot;Tell No One&quot; isn't without a snag, however. The jumping from first to third person narration becomes annoying, and often breaks up the flow of the plot. Of course, this could be a tactic to further confound the reader and keep him/her off the trail; I found myself re-reading some chapters just so I could remember what was going on the last time Beck spoke.Other than that, it's a book that's difficult to put down. Die hard fans of a good mystery will not be disappointed, and the plot twists will leave you scratching your head happily. I hope there's a sequel."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A decent junk food read, I suppose, although most of it was half-baked. The ending annoyed me, as did most of the characterizations and the implausibility of major parts of the plot. Regarding the characters and the author's mini-dissertations throughout: Was the author trying to be PC and instructive rather than horribly condescending? My ambivalence toward the book was there from start to finish--I did turn the pages to see what happened, and then I felt manipulated and disappointed."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"After reading \\"Gone for Good,\\" I was certain Coben knew how to tell a riveting, tightly-twisting tale. Now, having gone backwards chronologically to read \\"Tell No One,\\" I'm convinced...This guy's good!\\"Tell No One\\" cranks up the adrenaline levels, but never forgets that it's dealing with real people. We follow Dr. David Beck's attempts to uncover the truth of his wife's murder eight years previous. Out of the blue, Beck is receiving emails that imply Elizabeth is actually alive. The more he tries to figure things out, the more deadly the game becomes, the more shady each character's actions seem. Coben's secret is that he makes us care about these characters. The resulting suspense is more than cheap Hollywood thrills; it's unabashed concern--gulp, even emotion--for this story of love and terror and redemption.As usual, Coben doesn't let us relax too much. He not only keeps the humor and social insights coming, he twists us around with one plot twist after another. He may use larger than life villians to add a sense of danger, but he uses very real, normal protagonists to drive the story--and these very real, normal people do very real, not so normal things. Almost everyone has a secret to hide, and the reader has the pleasure of watching the story unfold.Once again, Harlan Coben shows his stuff. In the end, we are left with a deeply satisfying tale that ticks with the precision of a Swiss timepiece, yet continues to beat with the heart of its characters."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben's novel is an intense thrill ride. It has been eight years since the death of Dr. David Beck's wife, Elizabeth. He is still grieving after all this time and has not moved forward in his life. On the day of a very special anniversary he receives an anonymous e-mail. In it he gets a hyperlink that takes him to a web cam in an anonymous city. He is shocked when he sees his \`dead' wife on the screen.He is now searching for the truth about what happened eight years ago. A serial killer now serving time in Death Row allegedly murdered his wife. There is a group of people who do not want him to learn the truth so they try to frame him for murder and try to find out what he knows.The novel has a lot of action and it is very intense, however, the ending seemed to be a little bit abrupt after all that has happened. The other problem I had with this particular book was that it reminded me of Greg Iles' latest novel, DEAD SLEEP. The stories parallel one another and one just needs to make several substitutions to get the same plot. This book is hard to read in several days, one has to read it constantly in order to find out what happens next. I liked it but I was prejudiced after having read Iles' novel."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have been so caught up in James Patterson, I almost didn't pick it up. I'm so glad I did. Tell No One is full of suspense and plot twists. I can ususally get a handle on the &quot;who-dunnit&quot; aspect of a book, but I wasn't completely sure who did it until the last page. That makes it a &quot;10&quot; in my book! Tell No One is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"David Beck believes his wife, Elizabeth, is dead and so do her parents as well as her friends. So, when Beck sees what he believes to be proof that Elizabeth is not only alive but wants contact with him, he doesn't have to be told to &quot;Tell No One&quot; since he doubts anyone would believe him anyway. This book definitely deserves to be filed under the can't-put-it-down category. &quot;Tell No One&quot; is the first Harlan Coben book I've read, and based on the writing alone, I'll be checking out other books he's done. Coben's characters are well defined, and his plotting is excellent. Eric Wu is a character to make your toes curl at the mere mention of his name, and Tyrese makes it very difficult to look at men in his line of work the same way ever again. I'm definitely telling all my friends about this book, and my guess is that they'll do exactly the same thing. It's that good."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I loved this book. It grabbed me from the start and took me on a roller coaster ride all the way through. I am suprised by the less than favorable reviews and the criticism. This is fiction and very entertaining. I have put down many a book because I just didn't care about how it ended. Never could you do this with this one. It is escapism and maybe the ending is suprising but heck, I really enjoyed the whole book. I have read plenty of Harlan Coben's books - many of the Myron Bolitar series but they are getting tiresome. This is a welcome departure and one of the most interesting, attention grabbing, fun reads in a long time. Thanks Harlan Coben whoever you are!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Enjoy the languid, still, romantic first scene in this book. It&#65533;s the last quiet moment you will have, like traveling through the Tunnel of Love only to find you are on the Super Chief roller coaster.This is a departure novel for Coben, which seems to be the fashion this year with Lehane&#65533;s &#65533;Mystic River&#65533; and Crais&#65533; &#65533;Hostage.&#65533; Coben also catches the brass ring and shows new depth and sensitivity. (Though I always think of Myron Bolitar as a very sensitive guy.) David Beck&#65533;s love defines him and drives this novel through every turn.As always, Coben loves his quirky characters: Shauna the plus-sized super model who is Linda&#65533;s (sister of Beck) not-too-faithful partner, Hester the attorney from hell, and Tyrese the multi-sided drug dealer/fond father. When Coben describes Fein, the rapacious district attorney, all I could think of was Hamilton Burger of the Perry Mason TV series.The twists and turns of the plot made me wonder if Coben was trying to out-Deaver Deaver. I notice that Deaver gave him a big send off on the back cover, and well he should. &#65533;Tell No One&#65533; is a fast, enjoyable read and remember, in the immortal words of Casey Stengel, &#65533;It ain&#65533;t over till it&#65533;s over.&#65533;"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This story starts off with a bang and doesn't let up. Dr. David Beck's wife was murdered 8 years ago. He has just received an email that leads him to believe she may still be alive, but he must Tell No One. The injustices in some parts of this story made me uncomfortable, tense, and even angry. The police and the FBI suspect Beck of wrongdoing. Innocent people are murdered to protect the guilty. The descriptions Beck makes of the abuse suffered by some of his pediatric patients is also hard to take. It's the surprisingly humorous writing style of Coben's that makes the tension bearable. In the midst of one particularly tense scene, I actually had to stop and giggle. The police are chasing Beck and as they begin to close in, Coben writes, \\"The cops were coming closer. I was totally exposed. I flattened myself closer to the wall, like that would help. Like they might turn the corner and mistake me for a mural.\\" Yes, this is fiction, but Coben brings David Beck and the other characters in this tale to life with style and grace and makes the adventure seem very real. It seemed I couldn't read fast enough to reach the conclusion, but when I did, I wished I had taken it slower to better enjoy the ride. I noticed than some of the reviews here are not complimentary. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoyed it. In fact, I will go so far as to say, I think this is the best book I have read this year."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was a quick, entertaining read without a lot of substance. Given the reviews I read prior to purchasing the book, I was surprised to find that the plot was so predictable. The characters were interesting, but there is nothing new here. I broke my policy about buying only paperbacks when I bought this book, and boy do I regret it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is a burner of a book. It can and wants to be read in one sitting. My advice: &quot;Don't start the first page after 9.00 pm.&quot;The plot twists and turns like a cork screw. Surprises follow surprises. Unlike most &quot;can't put it down&quot; books, Tell No One successfully uses misdirection. Just when you think you know what will happen, your fooled again.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I'll admit, I was looking forward to a new Myron Bolitar novel, and although I still am, Tell No One was an excellent book in the interim. The plot is very engrossing, is Elisabeth really alive or is someone playing games with Dr. Beck? The book moves at a lightning pace with plenty of twists and no dull spots. The ending is also great with a very suprising revelation. This is a must read for mystery and thriller fans. I look forward to Harlans next book, whatever it is about, but as good as this was, I do hope that there will be more Myron in the future."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One, Coben's first book outside his Myron Bolitar series, is one you won't want to miss. If possible, I would rate it '4 1/2' stars. In typical Coben fashion, his newest book moves along at the pace of a runaway train. Once you start Tell No One, its twist-filled plot, interesting characters, and subtely humorous, yet realistic dialogue will make you forget everything else around you. If you're a fan of the Bolitar series, you'll be more than pleased by having to wait for the series to continue. If this is your first Coben book, I think you'll agree that after reading Tell No One, you'll be adding Coben to your list of 'must read' authors."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"If you're like me, you've read so many \\"Thriller-Suspense\\" novels you probably could write one yourself. It's so hard to find one that feels 'new' in this crowded field. Well, look no more. I read Coben's book in 2 sittings (and even got up in the middle of the night to finish it)! Absolutely loved it. Fast paced, completely original and unexpected. I'm not one to like first-person narratives either but this worked. The story is about a woman that's dead and her husband's struggle with the aftermath. I won't tell you anymore because it would spoil the fun. I plan on reading all of Coben's books now and passing this on to a lot of people. I know they'll love it, you will too.

He is describing the scenes with such a vivid accuracy that chills go through the reader's mind . This book has a level of suspense so high that I will not even recommend it to someone who has high blood pressure -lol- honestly , the author is able to be as descriptive and as realistic for all the readers . I discovered his work about 9 months ago and i have since read all of his books going from the detective work of Myron Bolitar to the asian mean character who masters all the tactics to hurt someone using that person's own body.Well , just read it you will not be disappointed ."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Usually I will not read a book review until after I've finished said book myself, because I can't stand even the tiniest spoiler. However, when I do read a review, I'm not looking for a book report, if I want a synopsis, I'll read the front flap. Want I really want - from a regular Joe reader - is answers to these questions: On a scale of 1 to 5 how good was the read? Was it worth the $15 - $25 asking price, and better yet was it worth hours of my leisure time?To answer these questions, in reference to this book...If you are a fan of the thriller genre, this is a great book! Tell No One, is definitely worth every minute of your time, and twice the price. I believe that an author is a bit magical when he can arrange simple words into sentences that when read, can make my heart beat quicker, that's what makes a thriller a thriller.

It established him as a bestselling author and made him into one of the most successful writers of mystery/suspense fiction working today.This novel is a good place to start if you want to start reading Coben. I didn't find TELL NO ONE particularly believable, but it is very entertaining to read. Coben has cleverly designed this novel so that a major twist in the plot occurs every 20 pages or so. It is a formula that keeps you turning the pages, trying to guess what happens next. I read this novel in one sitting.This novel isn't perfect. In the end, this novel has too many plot twists for its own good. Like a lot of readers, I found the final twist in this novel to strain credibility. I would have personally preferred a different type of ending. I also wish that Coben had spent more time on characterization in this novel -- many of the characters struck me as underdeveloped and kind of cliched.Overall, though, this book is very good. If you liked this book, I would recommend THE INNOCENT by the same author, which I thought was superior to this one."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlen Coben has proven his talent with this novel. Carefully and masterfully interweaving intrigue, pathos, mystery and heart-stopping suspense, he tells a tale any man can believe. When all hope is lost and the world demands one \\"move on,\\" Coben shows how the love of a woman--THE woman--has the power to save one's soul."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I listened to this marvelous book on tape and truly enjoyed it. This is only the 2nd book I've read by Coben...he was suggested by another woman in the doctor's office. (Ask someone who they're reading and you're liable to find some great authors!) Everyone else has given an overview of the story in their reviews and I'd have to agree with all of them...it's the tale of true loss and grief and a really twisted mystery that carries you urgently to the last page. There are several great mystery authors out there, Vince Flynn whose books are the scenario for the popular 24 series, Jonathan Kellerman, Stephen White, James Patterson, Robin Cook, Susan Isaacs, Linda Howard,Stephen King, and countless others, but now I've added to my list of favorites, Harlan Coben!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first book by Harlan Coben, and I was not disapointed in the least! Usually in books there are parts that are slow but not with this author. Every moment was excitement around the corner and I couldn't wait to turn the next page to see what was going to happen next. Great book, now I'm reading 'Just One Look\\" by him also."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have read several Coben novels, all were winners but TELL NO ONE is by far my favorite. TELL NO ONE will hold you captive hours beyond your bedtime. Coben, who has a talent for creating rich, multi-dimensional characters and rivetingly original plots, has out done himself with this narrative. For eight long years Dr. David Beck has moved numbly through his existence. Since the day that his wife, Elizabeth, the woman he had loved since the age of seven, was kidnapped and murdered, David Beck has survived for his patients. Then a strange email pops up on his screen with information only Elizabeth knew and the words \\"Tell no one.\\" The accounting that follows as Dr. Beck delves into his wife's death, hoping that she is still alive, will give you chills and raise the hairs on the back of your neck.

Coben book I have read, I had bought it quite some time ago, and just picked it up to read last week. This book was EXCELLENT, for many reasons, one it takes you through short period's at a time, never leaving out detail's and the end give's great closure. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a great suspence and a book that takes you on a wild ride, right along with the main character. This book also pulls together in the middle allowing you to gain helpful insight while not giving away the ending; yet not bombarding you with a boom suprising and jumbled conclusion. Harlan, is very clever in his writing and he also has an impressive poetic side, that if your are a poetry lover you'll notice right away, especially during the beginning of this book. Tell No One, you didn't like this book, it would be a shame. This is definitely a page turner, you will not want to put down. *****'s FOR SURE.I have already purchased four more of his book's, AND I can not wait to read them."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I was plugged in from page 3. The book was with me in the shower, on the train, during morning walks (which turned into morning sittings), even in smoke-filled Italian diners or the nondescript Chinese restaurant on my street corner.David had his wife kidnapped and murdered 8 years ago in an incident that left him wounded in the head and left to drown. He didn't die. Did she? All his efforts to forget the event and get on with his life have been in vain, until one day, 8 years later, he receives a note saying &quot;Tell no one. Lets meet&quot; (or something to that effect). Well, was she dead? Why the shroud? Whats the danger? Actually, why had this happened in the first place? Who had dunit? What will &quot;they&quot; do next?You'll find yourself skipping heart beats and short of breath. There'll be goose pimples and sleepless nights. And even then, the denouement is not cream puff Hollywood type settling of scores and everything coming clean. This is a marvel of the thriller genre, and I doubt Coben will re-visit this class again.If nailbiting, riveting thrillers are your thing, get your hands on this book as soon as you can.

Any leads into the story will be doing injustice to the concept of a mystrey novel. So let me just say that I was faced with a train journey of 32 hours across the country and so I bought a book that promised to hold my interest to help me pass the time. I started the book after 7 hours of sleep - which left 25 more hours - and by the time I had finished it, I still had 17 hours left to pass. It was that engrossing and fast. It was the first Harlan Coben that I read and it certainly won't be my last. People talk about the ending being a little disappointing, but I beg to differ.The reason I can't give it a five star is that I could predict a part of the edning.

I just happened upon it on the grocery store bookshelf. But was thrilled with this book and am now looking to buy others by Mr. Coben. It was impossible to get bored with this book or let your mind wander. Each chapter ends with a suspenseful sentence to draw you in and basically force you to read the next chapter...and then it happens again in the next chapter! I had trouble putting it down, and lost considerable sleep because I was so into it!The best quality of this book is it is so unpredictable and fast paced. I never could figure it out, as I can with many suspense authors! The plot is also very original.This is a must read!! You won't be sorry if you are looking for a fresh new suspense novel."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The most exciting breakthrough novel since The Firm, Coben's Tell No One has the slick, stylish freshness of early Grisham which lifts it way above the standard hard-boiled crime writing of Patterson, Deaver, Hall, Connelly and all. There's a touch of the David Morrell suspense thriller in there. Having an ordinary doctor-in-jeopardy rather than a clued-up super-sleuth as its hero could be the key to why Tell No One has overshadowed Coben's well established Myron Bolitar detective series and makes it feel like a debut novel.Written in the fast-paced cinematic-style of short, rapid scene changes, no wonder this very filmable thriller sold to the movies for so much money. The constant shifting from first-person voice to third-person narration has become a popular gimmick of the crime genre lately, thanks mainly to James Patterson's success with his Alex Cross thrillers and gives the added suspense of the reader knowing things the main character he's rooting for doesn't. A device that runs the risk of upsetting the balance of viewpoint and pulling the reader out of the story as you struggle to re-adjust; thankully, Coben manages to pull this off seamlessly. At times, however, he tends to slip into author intrusion - unfortunately the sickly-sweet Nicholas Sparks \\"male sensitivity\\" sentimentality variety (to appeal more to female readers, no doubt) with a stereotypical supporting cast of macho, cliched cops and hard-ass hoodlums thrown in to balance things out (and satisfy male readers, no doubt) with all the expectant ingredients of the essential crime potboiler.Nevertheless, this pacy read never flags and will keep you guessing through a clever weave of intricate plot twists till the surprise and very satisfying conclusion. Nearing the end you keep telling yourself you'll sneak a look at the last few pages to find out what happens, just a quick peak! The page-turning suspense is truly pulsating! You need to know what happens. You're hooked on Harlan Coben right from the beginning of Tell No One and can't wait to read his next novel Gone For Good before you've even finished it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"In the category of Suspense ''Tell No One'' has to be among the best. This story is fast paced, full of twist & turns. In the first chapter it had all the right ingredients to capted my attention; while celebrating their anniversary a happily married doctor's wife is abducted right in front of his eyes, a few days later, she is found murdered, in a most violent manner..., presumably by a serial killer lurking in the area...Eight years later the husband, Dr. Beck, receives a strange e-mail on his office computer making him suspect his beautiful wife might still be alive... but to get to the truth, the message clearly says he must ''Tell no one''...Well by then I was really hooked !Ok, I must admit the writing is so-so, there are alot of corny clich&eacute;s and metaphores like, ''flaky as a Greek pastry'' or '' more than any dying man in a desert wants to find an oasis'', that were at times even a bit nauseating but in this type of book I was more interested in the outcome of the story, the tension factor and the action than in the writing. The plot never stops...It's a real page turner...This book delivered, I enjoyed it and recommend it... and now I can get back to the more serious stuff."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I read this entertaining and suspenseful book in two hours because it's the very definition of a &quot;page-turner.&quot; The pace is fast and the story is great...that is, until the end, when twist after twist piles up into a truly improbable, dumbly cinematic, slapped-on ending. It almost felt as if Harlan Coben died before the book was completed and a third-rate substitute writer was brought in to author the ending. I was quite disappointed that Coben didn't work harder to wrap things up in a more believable and interesting way.If this book had ended differently I would have given it maybe four and a half stars, because it's so incredibly engrossing at first."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I was awake until 2:00am finishing &quot;Tell No One&quot;, despite a scheduled early morning meeting.

I look forward to the company of your characters for many evenings to come."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben doesn't seem to be like all the others. He manages to keep me up all night with his constant mysteries. &quot;Tell No One&quot; is the best book I have ever read. Right from the start to begin to feel what the characters are feeling. When they cry, you cry. When they laugh, you laugh. He manages to create something for everyone!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book was excellent.

I'm a fan of Chandler, Crumley, DeMille and other practioners of the first-person thriller. Coben is the first I've encountered who has successfully fused first- and third-person narrative in a single, cohesive work.Mystery: Dr. David Beck receives an anonymous email. He instantly realizes it could only have been written by his wife. One problem: his wife was murdered more than eight years ago. The ensuing plot twists, action and mayhem which occur are frighteningly well written. Coben is masterful in his command of the story and his characters.I have but one issue: Humor. There is none. Chandler, Crumley and DeMille - to name but a few - are exceptional at going the extra mile. They intersperse a deadly serious plot with witty repartee, sarcasm and insights. This aspect is the only one missing from Coben's work. Aside from this small matter, &quot;Tell No One&quot; hits on all cylinders and should be on the &quot;must read&quot; list for any fan of mysteries and thrillers."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"What a great book! My first Harlan Coben novel, but not the last. I read it in one sitting (many hours worth, on a dismal day), and &quot;a-ha-ed&quot; aloud with each plot twist (towards the end, there are several). I recommend this book highly, and look forward to reading the others."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Four stars for this book is something of a compromise. For 99.9 percent of the book, I probably would have been inclined to give it five stars. After the last page and a half, I am almost inclined to drop the rating to three stars. I won't give anything away, but I will say this: After writing a very, very good book, Mr. Coben wraps it up by being too cute by half. He capped a hum-dinger of a story with an unsatisfying (and unnecessary) twist at the end. That unfortunate slip aside, this book is well conceived, well written, and a great read. (Good enough, in fact, that I'm in the process of reading another of Coben's books.) Check it out...if you can overlook an overwritten ending, you'll have a great time."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A few weeks ago, my wife told me she wanted to buy a book for casual reading by the swimming pool. I had read a short review of Harlan Coben's latest novel (\\"Gone for Good\\") and on the basis of that review urged her to buy it. Because she was already in the middle of another book I decided to read Coben's in the meantime. I finished it in two sunny afternoons, and I was delighted by the plotting. Needless to say, I rushed out to buy \\"Tell No One.\\"The bloom is off the rose! It turns out that \\"Gone for Good\\" is a sort of variation on the theme of \\"Tell No One.\\" Both involve a sad protagonist who has lost a loved-one to death (or not?), both involve family conflict, both have plot twists and surprises and chapter endings that practically beg you to read on to the next chapter.Regrettably, Coben's writing style annoyed me. I became painfully aware of the number of times that the protagonist's heart performed one acrobatic trick or another to illustrate his surprise or fear or tension. Then I became aware of other trite references to physiological changes (dry mouth, churning stomach, etc.) My awareness of these stylistic \\"tics\\" detracted from my sheer enjoyment of the story. Coben would do better just to spin the yarn and let the reader decide how the characters would react.Still and all, if you want a quick and entertaining story for light reading, \\"Tell No One\\" is worth your time."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I typically read fiction and literature but I was in the mood for suspense and did this book ever deliver. It was not a typical mystery or thriller with no plot or point but to thrill. It was suspenseful, but there was so much more to it than that.The protagonist, David, is developed so well that you feel like you are experiencing each twist and turn as he does. With every page, something new is uncovered and another emotion exposed.David and his wife have been together since the second grade, and on the night of their anniversary, she is taken away from him. What appeared to be a murder by a cold blooded serial killer resurfaces eight years later when David receives mysterious e-mails from someone who knows things that only Elizabeth could have known. And suddenly David's world is again turned upside down.Was the killer really who it was reported to have been or was it one of several other people who emerge as possible suspects? And could it possibly have been David or any of the people who he'd trusted his entire life? And why suddenly is the FBI involved?David is an amazing, tenacious character who will stop at nothing to find out the truth. And the truths that emerge in this book will have you on the edge of your seat throughout.I highly recommend this book and was satisfied from start to finish. This is one I will pass on to friends and family, and I will also be looking for more books by Harlan Coben. He is an incredibly talented writer of quality suspense thrillers."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben's \\"Tell No One\\" is like a giant jigsaw puzzle. This book is so convoluted that when I reached the end, I had to double back and reread certain passages to clarify how all the pieces fit together. For the most part, however, \\"Tell No One\\" is a satisfying, fast-paced and exciting thriller.Dr. David Beck is a widower who is still grieving after having lost his wife, Elizabeth, eight years ago. She was apparently abducted and murdered by a serial killer, who is now on death row. Suddenly, some mysterious events occur which call into question everything that David thought was true about the past. He starts investigating on his own, hoping to unearth the truth about the events surrounding his wife's death. Suddenly, David finds himself on the run from the police who suspect him of murder, and from some bad guys who have their own reasons for wanting him silenced.Although this plot sounds trite and is reminiscent of many similar thrillers, Coben pulls it off. One way that he does this is by creating some colorful characters such as David's lawyer, Hester Crimstein, a ruthless barracuda who takes no prisoners in defense of her clients, David's friend Shauna, a lesbian/model whose loyalty is exceeded only by her aggressiveness, and Eric Wu, one of the most menacing and deadly villains that you will ever come across. The most entertaining character is Tyrese Barton, a street smart drug dealer whose friendship for Dr. Beck proves to be a life-saver.The book's dialogue is fresh and witty and the action scenes are thrilling. My biggest reservation about \\"Tell No One\\" is that some of the explanations at the conclusion of the novel were extremely far-fetched. However, if you enjoy a lively thriller that will keep you on your toes from the first page to the last, you will probably be entertained by \\"Tell No One.\\""},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I start by saying that this is a fast read and it helped me get through a long flight. The author does not try to make the characters very deep, which helps the pace. But at the same time, will not make the book particularly memorable. I found the plot to be too predictable. An example: when secondary characters are introduced, it was obvious their 'skills' would be used later. That was a vague statement, but I do not wish to spoil it for the potential reader. The book takes off immediately, and maintains the high pitch throughout, hoping to distract the reader from questioning the plausability of the story and the actions and reactions of the characters. I have a hard time suggesting this book to anyone wanting some depth to their stories and characters. But, if you want a book that is for helping you to while away the hours, or a no-questions-asked reading experience then this is for you."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I first got hooked on Coben's books with his fabulous, funny Myron Bolitar series.

The writing, I am not talking about the story yet, is what you might expect from a High School freshman. It is clumsy, predictable, and has little imagination. The writer also tries to save himself by having quirky charcters yet ruins it by giving them traits from a typical sitcom.

It's not even good enough to be classed as a 'fun junk food' read. The plot is full of idiotic developments that are meant to be 'surprises', and ridiculously convoluted action/chase scenes. Yet another aspiring screenplay masquerading as a book.I won't even attempt to explain the plot. I suppose the only good thing I can say about the story is it didn't turn out to be another hokey 'serial killer' drama, after all...though that would have been an improvement!There are far too many cases of characters 'keeping secrets' and double-crossing each other...but the 'big secret' revealed at the end is the worst of all, destroying the slim chance that the reader might actually salvage something from this train-wreck.Plenty of other readers have already commented on the ridiculous supporting cast, which seems to be a Coben trademark, alongside his New York settings and poor plotting, so I'll skip them, and hope 'Hester' doesn't mind!Read if you're a Coben fan, skip if you actually like stories that make sense and lead somewhere!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Someone please help me...has anyone read a good book in the past year?

I only finished this book just in case Harlan could salvage it in the last few pages--alas, it was worse than I expected.Bottom line--it sucks. First--Coben jars the reader every other chapter by switching points of view from first person to third, back to first, first again, and then third and I think at one point there was even a fourth person point of view thrown in to keep the reader confused. I'm surprised the dog wasn't given a few pages for his viewpoint, which would've been at least midly humerous. Second- the characters in the book were sooooo idiotic and overdone...can we have some original characters again? A doctor that could be the best doctor on the planet but instead helps inner city youth . ..now I really, really, really like him . . . blah, blah, blah . . . and a lesbian sister and a lesbian (I think) woman attorney named Hester? Hester is almost as ridiculous a name as Harlan. Third--the plot is so over the top and ridiculous and confusing that I'm still not sure what happened or if anything happened.This was not an enjoyable book. Don't buy it. I won't buy any other Harlan Coben novels again. I read this book recently called Manhunter because I liked the cover at B&N; and it was actually pretty good. Try that one. And someone let me know where are all the writers?"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This looking-back memoir of a couple drawn together in an unusual manner shows how and why Dave didn't give up on seeing her again. Something only the duo knew kept him clinging tightly to the \\"tie that binds\\" the link between life and death. They'd been drawn close together at a young age and their puppy love expanded into real, not true love. He never ever gave in to showing grief as that would show beyoungt doube that she hadn't merely vanished and, for all purposes, would never surface again. Shortly after she vanished withough a sound, Dave discovered a message on his computer, something only he and she knew. He was warned to TELL NO ONE.Beth always had held her head high, back straight. Beth and David were both bright kids, rational in the face of irrational love. Their first kiss was at the age of twelve; they married at age 25. Eight years earlier, Dave's wife had been abducted at Lake Charmaine, Michigan. Fifty years ago, this was the site of a rich-kids summer camp Christine may have hated. If the relationship could survive on the unspoken lies. On the 13th year after she was gone, nobody discovered, a strange happening occured. He would never have closure, so he married Beth, his first love and she took a place in the yearly pilgrimage and rituals to keep alive her memory good and bad.Dave's therapist, John M. Randolph, urged him to try to forget that day, put it in comtemplation perspective the fact that it was over and done with, thatshe was gone for good,k but loving Beth with her melancholy moods like Meriweather Lewis long ago was alaive and willing to make him the man only she could bring alive and impatient for growth. He lacked the patience and experience of life, never able to bring fruition to t heir married life or joyful union behind closed doors. A premonition taunted his sensibility that the fault lay within him.Actually, it was unresolved fears on the wife's conscience which caused the problem to prolong and grow into a hugh mountain with deep chasms to keep their secret under wraps. He may one day overcome his problem with the help of Beth, who had loved him her whole life. She was God's helpter, the angel sent to save thir marriage and life together.

Never buy a book by an author you do not know where the onlyblurb on the book is from other authors.2. Never buy a book where the blurb from the &quot;author-reviewers&quot;includes cliches like &quot;gut wrenching suspense&quot;.3. Never buy a &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; novel. That is one with so fewcharacters that either (a) the bad guy is obvious or (b) yourealise they all could have done it and you are just waiting forthe author to pick the guilty party.4. &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; never had ( cliche alert ) a &quot;slam bang surpriseending&quot; - and neither does this book, despite what one of theearnest &quot;author-reviewers&quot; says.This book is incredibly poor.

I recommend this book to anyone who is simply a fan of great books. A non-stop thriller!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben's &quot;Tell No One&quot; is a terrific mystery-thriller--it's the story of a pediatrician for the indigent, Dr. David Beck, who's still trying to get on with his life after the apparent murder of his wife eight years ago. Beck and his wife had been best friends since they were seven years old and eventually (after going to separate colleges) get married. Eight short months after (and several important events occur in these eight short months...events the author reveals as the story progresses) they're wed, Beck is hit over the head with a bat, and his wife is taken and believed to be murdered by a notorious serial killer. If this all sounds far-fetched, it doesn't come off that way in the text. The novel moves rapidly as it is revealed (the author skips eight years) or made clear that perhaps Beck's wife is still alive. The reader is treated to many twists and turns and a slew of suspects and suspicious behavior as Beck attempts to make sense out of what happened eight years ago (and in the months prior) and whether or not he will be reunited with his wife, or tried for her murder.The only real complaint is the switching (and subsequent alternation) of the narrator about midway through the book. Initially told in the first person voice of Dr. Beck, for some reason (likely convenience as it doesn't really enhance the story at all) the author resorts to a third person narrator in order to reveal the actions of some of the other major characters in this mystery. The book would have been more powerful if the entire mystery and its solution had been told through Beck's character.Nevertheless: a rapid read (easy to finish in a weekend) and a heckuva thriller/mystery. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"edge of your seat suspense,sometimes i find it hard to get into a book,it has to catch me for word one and this book did.I read like i was watching a brilliantly entertaining and thrilling movie,keeping me engaged from page 1 to page 339.For anyone who like crime novels with twists and turns your will love this."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is the best mystery/thriller I have read in years--and I read A Lot! Though I had never heard of this author, the synopsis intrigued me so much, I purchased it. From the very beginning I was not sorry. I read into the early morning hours, literally until my eyes crossed, and finished it the next day. I have to admire the author for thinking up such a intriguing plot and for being able to put down the words in such a way that I couldn't stop reading."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"First book I'd read by Harlan Coben - it was a page turner until the end. I've read one other by Coben - one of his Myron Bolitar series - didn't get to me like Tell No One, but I felt compelled to read to the end to find out what happens. I'm reading his &quot;Spin Back&quot; now and it's holding my interest. I'm not into sports at all, but find that his Myron Bolitar stories are fairly interesting and can be quite amusing in spite of the sports aspect. Would recommend his books."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben's newest tome has more than a little in common with The Fujitive: doctor, dead wife, police manhunt, lots of seemingly trivial clues. Dr. David Beck's idealic marriage to Elizabeth is shattered when she is murdered under strange circumstances, and eight years after the event it appears that she may not be dead. When new evidence turns up associating Dr. Beck with the past &quot;crime&quot; and a new murder of an old friend, the doctor goes on the lam. There is an assortment of secondary characters, ranging from a vengeful billionaire to a drug dealer to a pair of deadly hitmen, that spice up the plot as it moves forward to a suprising conclusion with several twists and turns along the way. The usual humor and wisecracks associated with Coben's Myron Bolitar series are missing from ths book, and may disappoint fans expecting another seriocomic romp, but Tell No One should attract a wider audiencer for the writer. Coben knows how to create a suspense scene, even when the reader knows the protagonist will somehow make his escape to continue his adventure. All of the miscellaneous plot points are neatly pulled together, and at the conclusion of the book the reader finally understands the true meaning of the title."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"One of the most enjoyable books I've read this year!

You'll be glad you took the time."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I just have to say, that this book was awesome. The first couple of chapters alone gave me goose bumps. I would definantely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read. The reason I am giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is strictly do to the fact that the last 2 pages, simply put, came out of &quot;left field&quot;, and totally discredit the hero of the book, Beck-who up to that point, I thought seemed fairly intelligent. If you can put that aside, this book would definantely be 5 stars. I would give it 6 if I could."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"There were enough twists and turns to give you whiplash.

Too bad!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I first discovered Harlan Coben after picking up a second-hand copy of Gone for Good as was pleasantly suprised by the quickness of the read and his ability to keep the reader turning pages. With Tell No One, Coben has hit the bullseye again.The story this time centers around David Beck, a very decent citizen and doctor whose wife and soulmate was supposedly murdered by a serial killer eight years ago. Everyone in David's life has told him to move on but no one he has met comes close to replacing his former wife in his heart. Then suddenly on the eigth anniversary of her death a message comes across David's computer screen that contains knowledge that only his dead wife could possess. Is she alive? Or his someone playing headgames with him?From here Coben's novel zig-zag's through the usual plot twists and turns which will keep the reader turning the pages very quickly. Although the characters are not of incredible depth, Harlan Coben gives you just enough detail and dimension to keep you rooting for them as they try to overcome the obstacles set in their way.Coben writes with a lean prose style which makes the action transpire very quickly and keeps the book moving at a breakneck pace. If you enjoy the thrillers of James Patterson then you will love Tell No One."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"If only Amazon allowed us to review in half-stars. Frustration!Coben's first stand-alone is still his best. I was so taken with this novel that it, along with Darkness, Take My Hand by Lehane and Cujo by King, created within me the irresistible urge to write genre fiction. The writing is crisp and at its most descriptive here than in any of his other books, the Bolitar series included. His characters are believable, albeit still overly quirky. For some reason Coben thinks a character can only be interesting if he crams them full of colorful idiosyncracies. Fans of Myron Bolitar know this tendency of Coben's to be true. Their eccentricities occasionally detract from the story, but the strength of the plot and the twists and turns provide the impetus to forge ahead.And you're not disappointed. The twists come at a relentless clip (only Deaver can compare in the twist department), and as the pace picks up you gain the sensation of free-falling, as if Beck's life has gotten so out of control that there's no way he can right it again. Yet at the end it all comes together, and credibly at that. You're left with one heck of a ride, catching your breath and wanting to read the next stand-alone. A four and a half stars guaranteed thrill."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I was introduced to \\"Tell No One\\" back in 2003 and happy I was. It was definately one of those books where page-turning and wanting-to-know-more kicks in!It's a whirlwind of events that go on with the main character. There are twists and turns and reading it makes you want more! This book lends itself to a screenplay. Hmm.....that's an idea."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This review is for the Bantam Dell reissue paperback edition, June 2006, 370 pages. TELL NO ONE, first published in 2001, was on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list for 24 weeks between July 2001 and June 2006, reaching a peak position of fifteen. Mr. Coben's first two books, Play Dead and Miracle Cure, are collectables. Starting in 1995, he published seven novels in the Myron Bolitar series about a Sports Agent sleuth. These were followed by five stand-alone thrillers beginning with TELL NO ONE. He recently published another Myron Bolitar story. All five of the stand alone thrillers and the most recent Bolitar book have been on the USA Today top seller list.TELL NO ONE begins with David Beck, in a prologue, recounting his near death and the kidnapping of his wife, Elizabeth, at a remote lake in New Jersey. Several days later, his wife's body is discovered, apparently the victim of KillRoy, a serial killer who is soon caught and eventually convicted of murder, although not Elizabeth's.The story continues eight years later when the bodies of two thugs are discovered near the lake. The sheriff links the dead men to Elizabeth's kidnapping and soon the FBI thinks maybe David, not KillRoy, killed her. Then, David receives an e-mail that suggests Elizabeth is still alive, and we learn that Elizabeth's father, a cop, and his brother, a Federal Agent, identified Elizabeth's body, which was cremated.The plot continues with a cast of colorful characters and bit players, I counted fifty-seven in all, and many twists and turns that do not require large leaps of faith (until the very end). It's a good, fast paced story that holds together."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book was recommended to me by my local bookseller a few years ago. He raved about this book for at least twenty minutes so I decided to give this author (new to me) a try. I agree with some other reviewers-that this book has a wonderful set up, and yes once we hook our relunctant hero to become a private investigator--which happens a lot if we're to believe the mystery writers community--we're off on a page turning ride. But as we start closing down the home stretch, you find yourself dodging quite a lot of plot holes and then you're leaping buildings in a single bound like superman to suspend disbelief. Overall, it's not a bad book per se, but it's not the Holy Grail as some of these other reviews will lead you to believe."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell No One, yet another hit nobel from Harlan Coben, grabs your attention from the first chapter and doesn't let go until you've finished it. Having started it on a Friday, because of a coworker's recommendation, it called to me everytime I attempted to put it down. The following Monday, I returned it to my coworker and thanked her for an absolutely great read.Suspenseful throughout the entire book, I never found myself stuck in a chapter that I didn't like. Unlike other suspense thrillers, each aspect was explained well, and in a way that kept you begging for more. Although I was somewhat disappointed with the &quot;out-of-left-field&quot; ending, I still felt that the book was worthy my time. Chapter after chapter, I kept changing my suspicions until finally I reached the end and was surprised to find out that none of my suspicions turned out to be right.This book keeps you guessing, but never to a point of wanting to put it down. Easy to read, and easy to follow, this book's plot develops into an almost hollywood-like storyline.Well written, and extremely suspenseful, I absolutely recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense thrillers, and doesn't mind losing a night's sleep or two."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I 110% recommend this book!

But out of the blue, he receives an e-mail that appears to be sent by his murdered wife - it contains information that only the two of them would know. How can that be? This is the start of the mystery that David Beck begins to unravel.While trying to figure out who sent him the e-mail, he gradually discovers more and more secrets from the past. At the same time, David Beck realizes that someone is out to get him. As the book progresses, he finds himself in greater and greater danger. This is (in my mind) the perfect thriller set-up - the protagonist is being chased, while at the same time trying to solve a mystery.TELL NO ONE is a quick and easy read. The plot unfolds at a good pace, as more and more is revealed, and it kept me hooked until the end (with some good final twists on the last few pages).This is the first book I've read by Harlan Coben, and I will definitely read more by him.

He consistently gives his readers a rollicking ride and \`Tell No One' is no exception - it's full of hairpin turns and twists of plot.Unfortunately, in this case, a few too many twists.I enjoy reading Harlan Corban and I'm willing to overlook a few gaps in logic and a ridiculously convoluted plot or two- after all they come with the genre - but \`Tell No One' twists so many times I felt a little betrayed at the end. After the final page it was apparent that the novel just didn't make sense anymore.The ride starts fast and furious but one too many unbelievable plot twists made me feel manipulated (not in a good way) and took away some of the enjoyment I got reading the first half of the novel."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"but not the best of his books. Just a few minor nitpicks. There are a few minor logical lapses, a few de rigeur twists too many (twist for the sake of a twist that really doesn't do anything), the usual omnipotent friend (Tyrese in this case), and a Korean misnamed Wu.

I CAN say this is a great novel on its own, and anyone looking for a thriller should be happy with this. No, there aren't many light-hearted minutes, but the story progresses nicely with the tension being notched up just a little with each chapter.

I cant identify with Back, the hero of the book- I think that Coben neglacted is caracters. He need to give them more depth, more personality.

It certainly was a page turner.The story is told from the point of view of Beck - a pediatrician whose beloved wife was murdered eight years before. Or was she? Recent events have led him - and the FBI, and the original people who paid for the killing - to question the official story.It is also the story of love - friendship love, companionship love, parental love, and spousal love.I really enjoyed this book. There is a bit of worldview attributed to the doc that you can tell is that of the author (how he looks at his patients, and their parents, is often a topic in the book). The casual back-story of his sister and her partner, and their trials as a couple, are told almost off-hand, and aren't of huge impact to the plot, but are, nonetheless, necessary to the story. They give you a fuller picture of the supporting cast than you usually get in the summer suspense."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"After I read Gone For Good, my first Coben's book, I went to the local book store, and purchased everything else that was available there by Coben. Tell No One was my second book (it's in fact Coben's first stand alone novel - his previous seven books are series about a sport agent/private investigator Myron Bolitar, and Coben did not disappoint me again. The plot, the characters, the twists - it's all there. One could not wish for a better mystery novel. In fact, after doing some online research, I found out that there is a French movie in the making that is based on this book. I'm hoping it'll make it over here as well, so anyone who is not familiar with Harlan Coben's work can appreciate it on a big screen. But back to the book - why only 4 stars and not 5 - as I said before, I read Gone for Good before I read this one, and I did give Gone For Good 5 stars. In my opinion, Gone For Good is slightly better. But don't let me be the judge here, pick up the book and read it yourself. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book is a wonderful example of a mystery/suspense book, as well as a snaking plot of surprises and twists. The underlying love between the two main characters is what makes the book connect, as the reader you root for the characters and the idea of everything working out and coming together.

Instead, the book's hero is David Beck. He'd known his wife, Elizabeth, from childhood - they'd met when they were seven, had their first kiss at twelve underneath a tree at Lake Charmaine and married at twenty-five. (Lake Charmaine was once a kids' summer camp, and is now owned by David's grandfather). After their first kiss, they carved their initials on the accompanying tree and, being a very cheesy couple, returned every year to add another notch beneath them. However, the evening they add their thirteenth notch, the couple are attacked - David is left for dead, while Elizabeth is abducted. Three days later, Elizabeth's body is found and is later identified by her father - from the signature branding, it seems the couple had been attacked by the serial killer Elroy \\"KillRoy\\" Kellerton.Time moves on, though David remains single and never properly gets over Elizabeth's death. Eight years later, he's working as a paediatrician, with the majority of his patients on Medicaid. Unfortunately, events are about to bring what happened at Lake Charmaine back to the surface. The first thing provides possibly the biggest shock of them all - an email from Elizabeth, containing phrases only she should've known. The same afternoon, David is contacted by the local Sheriff about two bodies that have just been found near the lake. A baseball bat buried with them has blood traces on it that matches David's blood group - B positive. However, while it's not entirely clear what part - if any - these men played in the attack on David and Elizabeth, things aren't about to get any better.Obviously, David finds this all very unsettling. Despite a warning in one of Elizabeth's emails - \\"tell no-one\\" - David decides to confide in Shauna, his ex-roommate and his sister, Linda's, long-term partner. Linda manages the Brandon Scope Memorial Charity, named after the son of a local billionaire who'd been murdered several years previously. The charity had been founded by the billionaire, Griffin, an ex-classmate of both David's and Elizabeth's fathers. Unfortunately, it's clear from very early in the book that Griffin has some business dealings some very unsavoury people and is keeping a very close eye on Davis.Overall, I found \\"Tell No-One\\" a very enjoyable and easily read book. Coben tells the story in two distinct styles. The sections of the book about David are told from his point of view (\\"I tried to reach for it, but someone leapt in my back\\"). However, the sections that focus on other characters are written about them (\\"Griffin hung up the phone and snapped on a pair of latex gloves\\"). While the approach may put some off, I felt it worked well. The ending, on the other hand, seemed a little too neat and not quite as dramatic as it should've been. Nevertheless, it's still a recommended book."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The death of Dr. David Beck's wife has haunted him for the past eight years. Now a secret person sends him some email relating only to things Dr. Beck and his wife would know. He can't figure who this is and the sender urges him to \\"tell no one.\\" Beck goes through the book in fear of his life. People he knows and loves start acting very strange and he can't figure out why. His friends tell him to let go of the past and to get closure on the loss of his wife. He just can't seem to do that. The messages send Beck into near insanity while he searches for the mystery person in the emails.Harlan Coben does an excellent job of keeping you reading. I think one of the reasons this book was so good was the fact that it was so believable. The reason it was so believable was because the characters were all human and none of the humans did anything that stretched the truth very far. Coben did a great job making you feel how Dr. Beck felt throughout the book. For example when Beck is faced with life threatening encounters I could feel the fear that he felt. Also this book takes place in New York which makes it more believable. As Dr. Beck searches for the mystery person behing the emails he winds up in the places like central park, the Bronx and Queens.This book was probably the best I've ever read. I think that has to do with the fact that I just simply couldn't put the book down. I've never been so engaged with a book before, and for this I give this book a perfect rating. This book is for every one. So read it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I finished this book more than a month ago, and in all honesty, my heart is still racing. If you want to talk suspense ... talk about TELL NO ONE!!I'm talking, sleepless nights, parched throats, and the urge to get SOMEONE to turn this incredible story into a movie!!After a grueling 8 years following his wife's death, David Beck has managed to re-establish his life since that awful day she was murdered. He found the strength to finish medical school and instituted himself as a pediatrician, opening his own practice. Things are slowly but surely falling back in place... that is until he receives a puzzling email on the anniversary of the first kiss he and his wife shared. What's even stranger is that the email contains a code that only she would know. Now Beck is faced with the reality that the only love of his life may still be alive.In an instant his life is consumed with trying to find out the truth of what has haunted him every single day for years. Is Elizabeth still alive? You'll have to read to find out... but there are some very serious lengths that Beck with have to go through to find out and Coben leaves NO room for guessing."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Tell everyone you know to read this book. This was my first of Harlan Cobens stand alone books, and its my favorite. Twists that will surprise the ever-livin jesus out of you!! Its great fun and a very fast read. Fast paced. I gave copies to friends for their birthdays and they all loved it and are hooked on Coben's books. You will be too!!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The first 40 pages of this book were fantastic; a good set-up of the plot, the characters were interesting, a huge plot twist is brought in, and the suspense level was so high that I thought I would have to read this entire book without putting it down. Then, everything changed. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a BAD book. The story of a doctor whose supposedly-dead wife seems to reappear after 8 years by email and in other strange ways was well-written and had some interesting characters, but author Coben tried to get too cute; he packs in so many supposed plot twists (I say supposed because they're all basically different versions of the same twist) that the story gets convoluted and the reader gets to the point where he just doesn't care anymore. Also, too much of the book was the type of material we've all seen a million times before---characters who are just stereotypes, chase scenes, etc. I started this book thinking it was going to be one of the best books I had read in years and finished it thinking it was only so-so. I'd say this one is good for the beach or a long airplane ride; a few good hours of entertainment but nothing that will stick in your mind forever."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"If you enjoy mystery, twists and turns, and a surpise ending, then you would really enjoy this book.His wife disappears when they are at his families summer cottage. She is taken and found a couple days later.... dead.it is now eight years later and Dr. David Beck is still trying to move on. He receives an email from an unknown person who knows only something him and his dead wife would only know about. His immediate reaction is that it's her, but how?Now he is receiveing more emails, but is being watched by someone he doesn't know. He is now holding onto every thing that he can to make himself belive that she is still alive. Nothing is going his way and he ends up risking his life chasing someone who is supposed to be dead.I personally could not put this book down. i can't tell you any more because I would give away the book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I was hestitant when starting this book, however, it proved to be very exciting. 'Tell No One' has many twists and turns and the ending is just as exciting. I highly recommend this book.It is one you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is the second book by Harlan Coben I read (first is 'Gone For Good'). Both are exceptionally well written and have everything: great plot that keeps you guessing till the end, good characters development, etc. The only thing that prevented me from giving this book five stars is that somehow it reminds me the first his book I read (I am not sure which one was printed first). The theme of missing woman, which is actually hiding, is just too similar. Other than that great mistery novel."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"If there was a higher rating available, this book would receive it from me. I dont know how anybody could rate this book any lower. Mr. Coben has such a great talent. You are hooked from the very first page, and just cant get enough of his writing. A++++"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is probably one of the best thrilers of 2001. Harlan Coben is definitely onto a winner with this book.The plot is a stunner, i shan't bother summing it up here, as it's probably been done many times before. But trust me, it's a corker. Coben could have, but wisely didn't, overcomplicate the book. because of this it is a great, simple, easy to understand read, which just makes those pages turn even faster (there's nothing worse than reading a complicated pageturner, where you want to keep turning those pages, but because the details are so complicated, you have to keep re-reading bits to make sure you understand all the parts of the plot.)David Beck is a great character, and the reader feels great empathy and sympathy for him, not just during the first (superb) chapter, but throughout the rest of the book, when we think, having found her, he might loose Elizabeth yet again.This is a very emotionally charged book, with many twists and turns, which keep you reading, never letting you lull into boredom. This was my first Coben book, and definitely not my last. I cannot wait for Gone for Good, and after that, i may well make my wya into his Myron Bolitar series.Certainly a must-read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book caught my eye in the library's new section. I noticed a blurb by Dennis Lehane on the back cover so i took it home. I was not dissapointed. I had to stay up till 2:30 am to finish it, there was no way I was sleeping till I was through. I will definitly be checking out his other work."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Just finished this latest. Excellent. He's good, fast paced, surprises to the last page. Interesting characters. I said in the newsgroup I would give this one 4 stars...I meant 5! Kept me occupied every spare moment today. I once wouldn't even pickup one his books because of the sports theme...that was a big mistake! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"this was my first harlan coben book, and after i read it i read everyone of his other books. it grabs you from the very beginning, and doesn't let you go till the very end.i highly recommend this book and am looking forward to anything harlan coben writes."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Ok, I miss Myron and Win, but &quot;Tell No One&quot; certainly did not disappoint.Not a different level, but definitely on a different plain, this work is equally enthralling as Coben's previous works. Still containing strong characters and humor coupled with thrilling escapades and dark scenarios, Coben was able to break from a series unlike most authors.Don't get me wrong, I anxiously await Myron's next stint, but it is nice to see a versatile writer appeal to a broader audience."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben is a favourite author of mine already. His earlier novels have consistently been clever, witty and generally engrossing stories. But none have showcased Coben's talent for fabricating a brilliant story to the degree of this book. Truly, it is his most intelligently-constructed novel to date. Complex, exciting, and absorbing - I read it in one sitting - till 7 in the morning on a WEEKNIGHT!This book has firmly cemented my interest in this author and I eagerly look forward any new works... I think I may even re-read some of the old ones!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Usually I read history and biographies but every once in a while I like to read a mystery or thriller. Something that I can read quickly and not have to invest too much of myself in. This book fits that qualification well. The main characters were well thought out and very interesting. They have more dimensions that most books of this genre usually endow their characters with. The story is very fast paced and carefully plotted. A young doctors loses his wife and while not adjusting well, has come to accept the fact that she is gone. The without warning, he receives e-mail messages which leads him to believe she is still alive. This sets off an interesting search. Other characters, such as the lesbian lover of the husband's sister and the friends who try to help him in his quest, are also very well captured.I would recommend this book highly to anyone looking for a bit of a diversion. This is the perfect summertime &quot;beach book&quot;."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I have read one Harlan Coben book before which i really enjoyed (One false move, if you're interested), but to be honest i forgot all about him until someone bought me this book. And, honestly, i read it in a day! Its one of those books and i'm a bit disappointed that i have finished it! Although parts of it i found a little predictable (i'm sure you will know the bits i mean once you read it, i wont spoil it), the big twists were less obvious and more shocking. He has again made his main characters likeable but flawed and realistic. The plot was gripping and the ending satisfying. (you can decide if thats a good thing or not!). The mood was just right and the suspense keeps you gripped until the end. I dont think he's at his best yet but he is getting there so i can only anticipate the next one. I enjoyed it alot and am definitely not going to forget about him this time around! I only hope hollywood don't destroy it too much. I can see it ending up as a straight to video flop if its not done right!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is the first of Harlan Coben's books that I've read, and having done so I'm ready to go back and read the others now! The story is laid out so vividly I felt as if I were watching a movie while reading the book. Excellent mystery/suspense novel."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It takes off like a rocket on page 1 and continues like that through the last page. There are so many twists and turns that you don't know who did it until the very end. In amongst the blood and guts there was also plenty of humor and charm that made the characters extremely likable."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Yes, the book is suspenseful and contains lots of semi-unforeseen plot twists, but Coben's writing style is annoyingly bad. The dialog is often clunky (real people just don't talk like that), characters (particularly African-American ones) are two-dimensional at best, and much of Coben's descriptions of his character's personal histories and feelings are cliched.What makes this worse is that Coben *acknowledges* that his characters' feelings are cliche. About a dozen times in the book, he says something like, \\"And it's a cliche, but it's true...\\" or \\"It was just like you see on TV.\\" At one point, he actually has a character say, \\"This is just like on 'The Practice.'\\" If I wanted to have the flat characters, settings, and plot of a TV show, I would watch TV. Books allow for far more subtlety and originality, and Coben fails to take advantage of his medium of choice. And he compounds this by explicitly falling back on the tired cliches of TV police dramas.For these reasons, I found the book immensely frustrating. By way of comparison, I like a lot of Elmore Leonard's stuff, I like Patricia Highsmith, I loved all but the very end of Lehane's Mystic River, and I'm a big fan of Jonathan Lethem's \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" and \\"Gun, With Occasional Music,\\" both of which are much more fun and original and *truly* engaging than \\"Tell No One.\\"I realize that this is essentially beach/airplane reading, and not necessarily designed to be great literature. But my point is that Coben's writing style is occasionally so awkward that it makes the book frustrating, rather than fun, to read.I can say a couple of positive things about this book: it is suspenseful, the plot twists are just predictable enough to make you feel like you could figure them out ahead of time if you think about them (a good things), it has a few visceral moments that really draw you in, and the use of two narrative perspectives is interesting and, for the most part, well executed.BUT, this will be the last Harlan Coben novel I read, unless someone tells me his writing style has dramatically improved since he wrote this one."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I am picky about the authors I read. I don't have much time to read, but when I read, I want something I'm going to enjoy. So it's rare that I choose an author I'm not already familiar with.However, my wife and I listened to the audio version of \\"The Innocent\\" on a long trip and I was really taken with Harlan Coben's writing.Since then, in audio and print, I've taken in four more of his books. The latest was this one, \\"Tell No One.\\"I think this is my favorite book of Mr. Coben's. Interesting characters, plot twists all over the place, but a fairly believable overall story. I couldn't help but stay up late to finish the book off.I highly recommend this book for fans of Coben, fans of thrillers and for anyone who needs a good book to read for a few hours."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I've been a fan of the Myron Bolitar Series and decided to read one of his stand alone novels while I was waiting for the newest Bolitar novel.While I generally read 1 or 2 books a week, I don't recall ever reading a book of over 300 pages in ONE DAY! I just could not put it down!I've read where some felt some of the many plot twists and turns took away from the experience, but for this mystery junkie, they just sucked me in more and more with every page!I'll even give you that the very end was a bit strange, especially the actual \\"who\\" done it, but wow, I just LOVED this story!I can't recommend this book highly enough! :D"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Eight years ago, Dr. David Beck was severely beaten and rendered unconscious and his wife, Elizabeth Beck, was kidnapped. A few day later, she was found dead and presumed to have been murdered by KillRoy. Exactly eight years later, two bodies are found at the same place Elizabeth was taken, and the authorities begin questioning the unsolved pieces of Elizabeth's murder. As they are putting the final puzzle pieces together and connecting these three murders, the evidence seems to be pointing towards Beck being the killer.At the same time, Beck is receiving e-mails from an anonymous person who uses codes that only Beck and his wife knew. He, too, starts questioning his wifes murder. He puts the situation into his own hands to find out the truth to what really happened. Little does he know he is being closely watched, not only by the authorities but also by someone else, someone who also has people working for him and who does anything to keep many dark secrets -the truths- from being revealed.Dr. Beck is a gentle, good willed, and respectable man with unconditional love for Elizabeth who would do anything to have her back. And the strange e-mails someone is giving him is beginning to make him believe that she is still alive. His love for her is so strong and overpowering that he breaks the law just for one chance of possibly seeing her, if she is still alive. But even his wrong doings are comprehendable. The events that he goes through cause you to understand how he feels and why he does what he does. They are not unrealistic, they are only part of being human.Coben is fantastic at getting the reader instantly hooked to his book. By the end of the first chapter, there is already a mystery with many unanswered questions that push you to keep reading to find out more. And the more you read, the more questions there are that put you in complete suspense and grip you to the book. Overall, it's a well thought out book with high climax's and a good plot."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first chance to read anything by Coben and, like many experiences with highly acclaimed fiction, it didn't live up to the hype. Yes, it was truly hard to put down, and, yes, the plot had its turns, twists and surprises; but I have to stop short of giving it 5 stars. In fact, if there had been an option to choose three and a half I would have chosen it.The narrative has an anoying habit of breaking into Fun-with- Dick-and-Janeish choppy sentences and fragments. Not just some here and there to speed up the action, but pages of it--so much so that I had to make sure I wasn't reading an edition that had been adapted for ESL classes.As one reviewer before me said, the was an unnecessary twist at the end, to which I will add an out-of-character act of violence by the protagonist that conveniently, and unconvincingly, goes unpunished.Buy it and read it; it is an exciting book. Just don't expect it to be in a league with Francis, Highsmith, and others for whom 5 stars are appropriate."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben pens perhaps his best novel to date in \\"Tell No One\\". After having read \\"No Second chance\\" - his latest, I was eager to read something else by the talented writer. I was drawn to this book after hearing a few friends tell me that this is his best work and that movie rights had been bought for the story. The talk was not just hype, Coben writes a masterfully suspenseful edge-of-your-seat thriller. It is a fast-paced story that manages to keep you intrigued and guessing for all of its 300+ pages. Let me tell you a few things that may help you make up your own mind about &quot;Tell No One&quot;:Coben grabs your attention from the very first page. You learn in the first chapter that 8 years ago Dr. David Beck was celebrating the anniversary of his wife and his first kiss when she is kidnapped and a few days later found dead. During the kidnapping David is beaten and left for dead. Flash forward to present day - after 8 years something happens to shift the reality of what may have really happened that night. Is his wife really dead? The reader is hooked and the story does let go until the thrilling (and surprising) conclusion.Coben combines characters that are cops, FBI, drug dealers, and mafia hitmen and does it all masterfully. Pick this book up and you likely won't be able to put it back down until it's over. It's a very entertaining read by a very talented author."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"David and Elizabeth Beck are married, are very much in love and they have been returning to Lake Charmaine every year since they'd been childhood sweethearts. But sadly, on their thirteenth visit, Elizabeth is kidnapped and murdered and David is left for dead. For the next eight years he tries to come to terms with the horror of what happened on that very bad night, while Elizabeth's killer sits on death row. Then an image of her shows up on his computer screen, and the years are ripped away. Can it be? Is Elizabeth alive somehow? Or is somebody playing a cruel joke on him? Then Beck's life turns into a non-stop terror-filled ride as he tries to get to the bottom of it all in an attempt to find out if the only woman he's ever loved is alive or dead. But even as he hunts the truth, someone is hunting him.Once again Mr. Coben has written a thrilling tale of suspense guaranteed to quicken your pulse as you read the night away. I couldn't put the book down. Eat, sleep, work, it seems you don't need that stuff, not when you've got a Harlan Coben book to read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I read this book in 5 days...which is rare. I usually take my time with most books, but this book is really fast paced for the most part, it pulls you in. A real page turner, as they would say. Beck, the man character is quite likeable, and his relationship with his wife is very sweet. All the other characters in the book are very well drawn out and all very enjoyable to learn about as well.The book can get somewhat confusing- so many characters linked to so many others in so many different ways. Even when you fly thru this book really quickly, things get mixed up sometimes. The author does a great job of tying things together nicely to make sure we remember what has happened throughout the book. That all said- there are tons of twists and turns, and a lot of surprises. Nice twists and turns at that.I noticed that the book seemed to get better and better, but then it started to drop off. I think the ending was somewhat of a let down, but it's ultimately satisfying. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close.Coben has a great style. Dr. Beck, the main character, basically tells most of the story, and I think that's a great angle to take. The author is also clearly gifted in his craft...great use of description to really put you into the story, great character development to keep you interested.I liked Tell No One a lot, and it's actually somewhat sad that Dr. Beck isn't a regular character (I find that I become attached to a lot of characters in books, which I guess is normal.) It's always an added bonus to read a great mystery with a great lead character that you can relate to. It felt as tho I could have been in his shoes the entire time...just an average guy on a really big adventure. Hope to read more from Coben soon..."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Unfortunately this is a very average thriller. The plot is great; David Beck is attacked and left for dead when his wife is kidnapped and brutally murdered. Eight years later, he receives a mysterious email which suggests that his wife may not have died after all... what a great hook for a reader! The novel, however, is rambling and by the end, I was desperate to finish and skim-read the book not because I cared about the characters, but so that I could find out whether Elizabeth Beck was, in fact, dead or not. The characterisation was pretty average too. In summary, a good story but not a book that is going to keep you gripped on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"So it isn't great literature, but it grabs you and holds you until you're done, period. I mean, I skipped TWO MEALS because the next chapter was more important than nutrition. What a wonderful, exciting, fun read!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book came highly recommended to me, and I must admit, I was not as impressed as I expected to be. Despite the fast pacing, I found the plot itself to be easy to predict. There were a lot of exciting scenes that felt very cinematic in scope - and after learning about the French version, I definitely plan on renting it. I read it in one sitting though, and I would read another book by this author, though I may not rush out to go get one. The characters were a little stiff, but what surprised me the most was the level of pure sappy romance in the book. It spoiled the tone for me, a bit, but overall, this was a fast and fun read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"The tension and drama in \\"Tell No One\\" begins from the first page. Author Harlan Coben has written a gripping thriller that grabs readers and keeps them enthralled until nearly the story's end, with a unique twist on the killer that you won't see coming.The story opens with a married couple, David and Elizabeth Beck, who have gone off to their family cabin in the woods to celebrate their anniversary. While skinny dipping at the lake after dark, an incident occurs that will change the course of their lives. Elizabeth is kidnapped, David is knocked out and left for dead. All this is mere prologue to the real story, however.Eight years later, after Elizabeth's body has been found, and the killer imprisoned for a series of murders of young women, David receives an email message from his dead wife. By now he is working as a doctor in an impoverished New York neighborhood, but he is still haunted by the loss of Elizabeth, whom he has known since childhood. At first he thinks it must be a cruel joke, but the email shakes David to his core because the email contains information so specific that no one else except his wife could have written it. And the final warning that comes in the message: \\"Tell No One\\" is the book's title.A later email arrives along with a link to a street camera, and for the first time, David thinks he sees a woman who could only be his wife. His sister's partner, a close friend who's familiar with the world of advertising, tries to show David that the image could have been a manipulation of videotape. Yet David will continue to pursue the clues...to their deadly end.Along the way, both old and new plots will develop, bodies will be found at the lake house, David will be accused of murder, and a local gangsta (whose son David has been treating medically) will come to his rescue as David is pursued both by police and unknown thugs who are out to kill him. As the tension builds and bodies pile up, new clues and questions emerge. Everyone appears to be hiding something: Elizabeth, her family, her friends, and David himself.It's a taut, tense journey from beginning to end. At some point near the end, the story becomes so convoluted that the author loses some of his game, trying to keep all those balls in the air until the story's end. He does it, but he weakens the plot slightly. Overall, however, it's a gripping journey into the lies families tell each other and a great read."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Very gripping suspense novel. Easy and fun to read. A bit of wit, a bit of gore, a bit of character development. But, certainly not a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I found this book to be a real page turner. And, after all, isn't that what you want in a mystery? So, maybe I should give it the fifth star. But, there were so many improbable twists and turns that I kind of felt betrayed by the final one. Almost like the author was showing off so I'd know how clever he could be.Still, the writing is good enough that I plan to read another Coben book. And, if you like crime mysteries at all, you might be pleased if you read this book or another of his works. He clearly has big league writing talent."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I could not and did not want to put this book down. This is my 3rd book that I've read by Coben and I've liked every one of them. Loved the twist at the end!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"this is a realy good book if you keep on reading. it its a bit hard to understand at first but if you keep reading it all comes together its realy good and i dont read alot but if you give it a chance you will like it."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first Coben book, and now I am hooked. Tell No One is like a crazy roller coaster with dips and twists and highs and lows. When I started the book I had no idea that it had been made into a movie, but the whole time I was reading it I was thinking 'someone should make this into a movie'. If you enjoy suspenseful, Morgan Freeman/Ashley Judd like stories then read this book."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"As with all of Mr. Coben's books, this grabs you right from the start and has an ending that will blow you out of the water. He's the reason people don't get back from lunch on time."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"After reading Coben's \\"No 2nd Chance,\\" I was convinced I'd found a new favorite in an author. Favorite authors can be difficult to come by these days. But then I read \\"Deal Breaker,\\" Coben's first Myron Bolitar mystery, and it had a pretty pukey aftertaste. One book is a possible favorite, the other would taste like puke if served up as an entree. What's a man to do but give Harlan Coben another chance, right? I had a few to choose from, and I chose \\"Tell No One.\\" Well, I'll say right away that the prologue and first chapter immediately pissed me off. That's not a good start. But on the other hand, Harlan Coben is a bestselling author, and other authors such as Dan Brown and Jeffrey Deaver endorse his work. HMM. Does that make him a great author? We'll get to that later.Now in all honesty, Coben's a master storyteller, there's no denying that. And he does that with the good Doctor, David Beck, weaving together a web that isn't about to untangle itself! This is about a love lost, and a hope that burns deep, never willing to put out the flame. Beck's wife was taken from him, and everything he thought he'd lost just may give him an 8 year glimmer of hope. Is his wife, Elizabeth, actually alive? Just maybe. But there is one catch...TELL NO ONE! You wanna play games? Then make sure you make the right move, because somebody will always be watching! Oh yeah, Harlan Coben puts together a story that makes a thinking person think even more. And the ending is electrifying, and highly satisfying!But back to my original question. Is he really that great of an author? I guess he is pretty slick! But in his own way he is highly deliberate. He lets you know what kind of company he keeps through his writing. He makes for certain that there is no mistaking what you read in his works. For some authors that's great. For Harlan Coben, that's great. But where does that put him? With \\"Deal Breaker,\\" he was at the top of some trash heap, if you ask me. And as far as best-selling authors endorsing his work? Oh well, that's nice. I know what pissed me off in this, and there's no need for me to hash and re-hash. But I know. And even though it did get under my skin, it showed some minor humanity. And even a little bit of humanity, combined with a great story is enough for another look. For me it is kind of a two way street. There were some things that got on my nerves, but there was even more that I liked. Am I right? Will I enjoy Coben other works and offerings?

The twists and turns may not be entirely fresh but they are very entertaining nonetheless."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This was my first Coben book and I've been a fan of his since.

I was intrigued through the duration of the whole day I read it. I found that I was not able to put it down without going back to it and telling myself one more chapter til I was at the end.

The book starts off very promisingly, but then quickly turns hokey. I was very disappointed. The best thing about the book is some of its rich characters, but the story just doesn't ring true and didn't work for me at all. A great concept, just badly realized."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Actually, I was looking up customer reviews for another mystery book, and someone suggested Harlan Coben. Well, I wish to thank that person, as well as Amazon for having this review section. What an incredible &quot;page turner&quot;. My mom and I are hooked. She went on to read two more Coben books and she raves about them. Keep writing, Mr. Coben!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Harlan Coben was born in 1962 in Newark, New Jersey to Carl Gerald and Barbara (Kronberg) Coben. In 1988 Coben married his wife Anne, who had been his sweetheart since the age of twenty, and together they had four children. In the 1990s Coben made his mark as a mystery novelist that embraced the professional sports world. Some of his other novels including &quot;Play Dead&quot;, &quot;Miracle Cure&quot;, &quot;Gone for Good&quot;, and seven novels in his &quot;Myron Bolitar&quot; mystery novels, including &quot;Deal Breaker&quot;, &quot;Dropshot&quot;, &quot;Fade Away&quot;, &quot;Back Spin&quot;, &quot;One False Move&quot;, &quot;The Final Detail&quot; and &quot;Darkest Fear.&quot;Annotation: On their yearly trip to Becks grandfathers' cabin, his wife Elizabeth is killed. Now, eight years later it seems that Elizabeth may still be alive. It turns out that after escaping the police looking for Elizabeth that he isn't the only one who is searching for Elizabeth.I fully enjoyed &quot;Tell No One&quot;, and at times it was hard to set it down when I was left hanging after a chapter or while at school, when the bell rang for the period to end. This book followed me every where, from school, to home, even to work. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little mystery in their life, and to anyone who doesn't mind be a little confused until the end of the book. One thing I would recommend would be to sit down and try to read the book in a few sittings, for extended it over a period of time may leave you utterly and confusing, also not being tired while you read it. I would say being alert and awake is the key in figuring out what Coben is hiding behind the next page, for he is an excellent writer and i can't wait to read &quot;Gone For Good.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I don't need to replay to the plot for you. One hundred reviewers already did that. But I will say that this book was an exciting page-turner. Some contemporary novels feel the need to slip into sex scenes and profanity to add a touch of realism, but Coben is a good enough writer to need neither. This is just a good old-fashioned mystery which kept me guessing until the very last page. I was hooked by page two and hated to put it down. If you are looking for a great, clean, fast-paced thriller, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Can't miss with a Coben, even though they are a bit on the formula side- they are fun to read"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"So much suspense...couldn't put it down.

This is my first Coben book I have read and I will be reading his others."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I've read a few Harlan Coben novels and definitely enjoyed \\"Tell No One\\" the most. I think the problem overall with his books is he has a tendency to use the same plot devices and writing ticks and tricks in many of his books, which means that there's a definite case of diminishing returns. But, as a one-off, if you like well plotted thrillers with credible characters and plenty of suspense, \\"Tell No One\\" is a great read. (P.S. The 2006 French film adaptation \\"Ne le Dis &agrave; Personne\\" is well worth a look too)."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book was a quick read with an enticing story. 5 stars because I just wanted to read it instead of go to work."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This is argueably the best book of the genre that I have ever read.

I give it 5 Stars!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I read this book before I discovered the Myron Bolitar series by the same author. This remains my favorite story by Harlan Coben. Suspenseful, entertaining, it will keep you guessing - and caring - about the outcome."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"When you lose someone you love, time eventually closes the wound a bit and you hurt a little less. Not so for Dr. David Beck, who's wife was abducted and killed 8 years ago. He's still wrapped up in Elizabeth's death, as if it just happened yesterday. Beck receives a strange email containing references to things only he and his deceased wife would know. Someone wants him to think Elizabeth is still alive. Beck \\"tells no one,\\" as instructed, but searches for the truth and uncovers many unexpected truths along the way.Good mystery that answers all questions asked during the read. Something about the writing style bothered me - I just can't place it. Mostly in descriptions, I found myself missing what was just read and having to constantly go back. I thought I was just tired, but it happened all through the book. I'll try another Coben book and see what's up."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"This book is one you will read in a day or so considering its so addictive. David Beck has been attempting to put his life back together since the murder of his wife eight years before, a murder that took place on a trip to the lake for the couple's anniversary. Years later, Dr. Beck begins to receive emails from a person who knows things only his wife could. Is she dead or is she alive? That's as much as I can tell you.\\"Tell No One\\" is a great mystery and it has many layers. Frightening bad guys, kind of good bad guys such as Tyrese and likeable characters such as Dr. Beck and Shauna. Some of it is in first person and some in third person and its done in a way that isn't at all distracting. Once you open this up, you won't be able to figure out what comes next. I read this in a day and a half and couldn't put it down. If you want good suspense with good writing, pick up this one."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"It is astonishing to read all the other reviews and to find out how readers were divided by this book, hardly any mediocre opinions. I for one found it highly entertaining, well written and extremely exciting, and seems I am with the majority here. \\"Tell No One\\" is definitely one of the best thrillers I have read in a long time (and that's been quite a lot of books).There are a few clich&eacute;es along the way, certainly, but all in all Dr. Beck's crusade to find the truth about his wife's murder eight years ago will not leave you cold. Both the romantic moments and the violent pages in this book (my first Harlan Coben novel, but certainly not my last) grabbed me deeply, and I found myself devouring this book in three sessions. The ending is a bit of a let-down, alright, but the excitement created by the author throughout the first 300 or so pages more than make up for that."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Mr. Coben's work is both witty and enjoyable. Although I miss Myron, Win and the gang, I enjoyed this work simply because it was fun. No political diatribes, no senseless whining about policitcal correctness, and no intellectual snobbery. You read it, you laugh, you anticipate, you hope your guesses about the plot are correct and then you wait for the author's next work."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Started reading at 8 a.m., in my nightgown with a second cup of coffee. Finished reading at 2 p.m., still in my nightgown. Loved it, obviously! Believable plot with lots of twists and turns, well-drawn characters, lots of tension, plenty of action, exceptionally well-written -- this book has everything. I had resisted buying this one because it was NOT Myron Bolitar, but from now on, I'll read whatever Harlan Coban wants to write!!"},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I'm not as enthousiastic about this book as many others writing here. I didn't care about the main character too much, whose \\"do good\\" persona felt much more irritating to me than Myron Bolitar's, the hero of Coben's other books. Though both heros share a lot of traits, the sentence \\"it's the little things\\" really got on my nerves when the hero encountered another endearing thought or situation.That said, the plot moves along well, and even though the primary description of characters as \\"weasely\\" doesn't leave much room for surprises, I felt myself drawn into Beck's pursuit and really needed to know the ending. This, however, wasn't the big revelation for me as it seems to have been for others, instead I felt vaguely cheated. You'll have to see for yourself, there's no way I can think of discussing it without giving it away.I wonder whether we'll meet Myron again somewhere on the road. I sure hope so, as the plot of Coben's new book (sans Mr Bolitar) seems to rehash some of the key elements of this book."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"A great book that's really hard to put down!

This isn't my usual book choice, but a friend gave it to me, so I decided to give it a go.

Now everyone gets involved: the police, the FBI, David Beck, his father in law, a local millionaire with hired hitmen, a downtown drug dealer and more.

Suddenly he switches narrators, from 1st to third, then every other chapter the narrator switches back and forth, even within the chapters themselves. Most annoying. Harlan is clearly a good writer but this book would have been so much better if it were all in the third person or he wrote a slightly different story with the 1st person point of view."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Amazon reviewer says Tell No One is the thriller tht will break Harlan Coben out of the mystery genre. This statement is wrong on so many counts that's it hard to count them (usually when a reviewer maks a comment like that I just stop reading the review, since it shows that the reviewer has no understanding of what he or she is writing about. Thrillers are mysteries and it's the mystery plot in Tell No One tht keeps the reader going. We want to find out who killed the Scope boy and why Dave's wife is in hiding. The problem with the book is that the first person narrator (noting that other parts are third person) keeps back one piece of information until the final pages, leaving the reader conned rather than surprised. Plus since Coben does this at the very end, you don't have time to say, \\"Wait a minute, how did the killer manage to get away with it? That's how a five star book turns into a one star review. As for review, I'd give in minus 5 stars."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"I've read better fiction in my freshmen creative writing class. At least, the students have been exposed to the elements of a good story.Every one of Coben's characters in this book are one-dimensional. The good guys are very, very good and the bad guys are truly evil. The hero is a doctor who loves practicing in the inner city, marries his high school sweetheart, and has a lesbian sister. His wife disappears and is found dead three days later with the letter \\"K\\" branded on her face.Fast forward 8 years. The hero receives a startling email that leads him to a webcam where his back-from-the-dead wife silently mouths the words \\"I'm sorry\\" and then disappears. Our hero will stop at nothing to find her. I kept wishing he would so the book would end.The bad guy is a billionaire with more tentacles than an army of octopi. Oh yeah, the bad guy hires hit men who break concrete blocks with their hands and kill their victim by thrusting their bare hands into their innards. *Yawn.*I'm not sure if Coben thinks his choppy non-sentences are clever or if he uses them to fill in the huge gaps between important thoughts, but they don't work; not even in a tongue-in-cheek way.What bothers me more than the author's bad writing/plot/characters is that lot of talented writers can't find a publisher, while this hack continues to churn out tripe like TELL NO ONE.If you like to read and have some time to kill, help me grade my freshman class' essays. They're better than this. Trust me."},{"Title":"Tell No One","review":"Too tricky for its own good, this story never grabs hold of your emotion or wills you to suspend your disbelief.

I especially like the &quot;Family Write-Along&quot; which helps my daughter's writing, spelling and drawing skills all at the same time. And, again, it allows us to have quality family time while helping our daughter improve upon learning the skills that are so important at this age.

Amazon should place information about the book being an OCR copy upfront rather than below where the book description is."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Hegel's Philosophy of History is his easiest book to read. He angered some people by saying that History is Freedom, and so those countries which did not have Free States (in 1821, the year he wrote his book) were not truly part of History but part of the Pre-historic period. He begins with a narrative of Africa in 1821 which was steeped in Slavery, both internal and external. He stated that all nations were once at this level of Pre-history, where no king could last more than a year. But China was the first nation to make One but only One Person free, namely, the Emperor. This was the beginning of History. From this point Hegel traces those nations which increased Freedom slowly - from Egypt to Assyria to Babylon to Persia to Greece to Rome to Spain and then Europe as we know it today. The Idea of a Free Republic was born in Greece, but was first made material in Rome. Caesar opposed the Republic because he knew that the fullness of time had not yet come for it; so he opened up barbarian Europe instead. The Free Republic eventually grew to a point where a great, courageous World Historical Individual, Napoleon Bonaparte, overthrew the Medieval structures and paved the way for the eventual abolition of Slavery. Hegel was an Abolitionist and lived to see England and Spain renounce Slavery, but died long before Lincoln, so his view of the USA was pretty pessimistic."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Hegel's lectures on History (along with those of his on Law) probably represent the most accessible introduction to the thought of this very important German idealist.Hegel's ideas on history and social organisation and Law had a critical influence on many key 19th and 20th century Philosophers, including Karl Marx, Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper. While some philosophers followed Hegel, many also vigorously rejected his ideas and thought, and it is only more recently Hegel is undergoing a kind of rehabilitation in Philosophy.This reaction though is understandable since Hegel is a very difficult philosopher to both read and understand. His prose is certainly in my experience the most awfully written and most obscure of any philosopher, and much of the time Hegel seems to be writing nonsense which makes little sense (especially in his more idealist works like phenomeology of spirit). It is understandable then why Schopenhauer called him a 'charlatan' who spouted nothing but 'sophistry' which ruined the intellectual background of Germany, and Bertrand Russell said his philosopy stems from a 'set of simple logical mistakes.'Nevertheless Hegel is a great Philosopher, and the fact he is extremely obscure does not invalidate some very original and profound and interesting ideas which are to be found in his philosophy, especially in his notion of the dialectic, of Spirit manifesting itself through history and historical events, of his interesting reaction to Kant, his ideas on Art and the reactions to his philosophy from students like Marx. His idealism also influenced important philosophers like Fichte and Schelling in the 19th century, and in the 20th century idealists such as McTaggart, F.H. Bradley, and J.N. Findlay, who built on his thought and provided valuable new philosophical ways of thinking about the Absolute and in bringing religion and mystical experience back into a better relationship with Philosophy, given much of Philosophy since the time of Hume has savagely attacked religion as meaningless nonsense. In the 21st century, it is probably Hegel's thought on ethics, art, history and religion which have the most relevance."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Philosophy of History is Hegel's most accessible introduction to his thought.The introduction and preface are the most valuable parts of the book.Much of the book is only of historical interest. His history of Greece, Rome, Israel and the Germans cannot be taken seriously anymore. There are racist and jingoist views in this book that seriously date it.On the other hand, the book clearly expresses Hegel's spiritual philosophy of an evolving God who learns from the history of the world that is his thought.For those who are looking for an introduction to Hegel that is written in his own words, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"(The page numbers come from the Brittanica Great Books Series, volume 46).Hegel is trying to overcome the dilemma that social life poses: per man's subjective life the important thing is freedom of spirit. However, man also lives in community and the norms of the community often bind his freedom of spirit (it is to Hegel's credit that he recognized this problem generations before Nietszche and the existentialists).Given Hegel's commitment about the fulfillment of spirit, it follows that communities grow. As seen above, Hegel's applies to history the problem of self-fulfillment. How does man realize the fulfillment of the Idea?Eastern Cultures: Hegel notes that these cultures--India, China, Persia, Egypt--were unable to bring about a harmony of spirit and sense. The Greek world developed from the Oriental world because it was able to embody Geist in such a way to emancipate spirit from \\"dead matter\\" (258).Jews: realization that God is pure, subjective Spirit. Ends up negating finite reality.Greek: opposite of Jewish mentality. Harmonizes God with \\"natural expression.\\" Ends up with idolatry. Greek polis is pariochial. Each state his its own God. A universal realization of spirit is thus impossible. Men were identified with Greek state. Democracy natural expression. There is a necessary contradiction within the Greek polis: only represents a part of finite reality.Romans: Origin of the idea as \\"Person,\\" bearer of \\"abstract right\\".Christianity: the finite subject and absolute spirit can be reconciled. The task of history is to make this reconciliation public--this is the Church.Germans: they were to take it to the next stage.The rest of European history is a working out these processes, a transformation of institutions. It is hear that we see feudalism, etc. At this point we need to correct a mistake about Hegel: Hegel is not saying that world history climaxes with Prussian Germany. There is no sensible way he could have believed that. Germany was weak and defeated when he wrote (it would have been interesting and perhaps more perceptive to say that Russia was the bearer of the World Spirit, especially in light of 20th century politics). Nonetheless, as Hegel notes and as his critics routinely miss, history did take an interesting turn in the 19th century and the force of ideas does not simply stop because the historian wants them to stop.Monarchy and the StateHegel sees \\"the state\\" as the mode in which the individual enjoys his freedom, but only in the sense of the willing according to the whole. In order to avoid confusion, Hegel must be seen as continuing Herder's thoughts: healthy states are organic outgrowths of individuals and communities (170).Another term of possible confusion is Hegel's use of \\"constitution.\\" By it he does not mean the vehicle of salvation that American conservatives think. A constitution is simply how society is arranged and not necessarily on paper (173).Hegel writes, \\"Now monarchy is that kind of constitution which does indeed unite the members of a body politic in the head of government as in a point; but regards that head neither as the absolute dictator nor the arbitrary ruler, but as a power whose will is regulated by the same principle of law as the obedience of the subject (208).American constitutionalists love to pretend that monarchy = despotism, but Hegel demonstrates that this is not the case. If we judge the world on how modern America develops, we will fail to understand Hegel. In Hegel's time, as per most of history, societies were often ethnically unified along a cultural (usually religious) center. Because of that, the monarch usually would not will something to the detriment of his subjects. Today's America, however, is officially predicated on the negation of that unifying center and Americans, even (especially!) conservatives, cannot understand that.Hegel warns of the chaos of the Republicanism that plagued Greece and Rome. While it is good that man is free and makes decisions, the problem arises when all men are free and make decisions that contradict one another. This kind of Republicanism necessarily leads to oligarchy, for the the individual with the most power and money will make the most powerful decision (and thus negate the weaker individual's decision and free choice). By contrast, Hegel points to the monarch as the final arbiter (281).ConclusionThis is probably the best place to start with Hegel. One should consult a history of philosophy manual and get reasonably familiar with Hegel's terms. Having done that, this text is fairly easy to read, if somewhat boring at times."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"An OCR copy should not be the first copy to come up on Amazon's site.

Sibree, copyright 1899, in the revised edition I am looking at from a library in an old city that has plenty of Irish Catholics but also many churches that attempt to maintain the kind of righteousness maintained by Hegel on page 456:Lastly, as to disposition,we have already remarkedthat in the Protestant Churchthe reconciliation of Religionwith Legal Right has taken place.In the Protestant world there is no sacred,no religious conscience in a state of separation from,or perhaps even hostility to Secular Right.Part I of the book, The Philosophy of History, begins with The Oriental World, and Section I is on China. When Hegel was giving his lectures, a Chinese document of history from 2357 years before Christ, was more than a century older than documents from Egyptian, Assyrian, and Indian history. Hegel has a fundamental understanding of the oldest document:Here we have the One Beingof the State supremely dominant --the Substance, which, still hardand inflexible, resembles nothingbut itself --includes no other element.Hegel provides some details about maintaining respect within the family, and the Emperor is described as exercising power paternally.He is the Patriarch,and everything in the Statethat can make any claim to reverenceis attached to him.The Emperor claims the deepest reverence.Modern society attempts to impose social pressures for human engineering to join in the gambling addiction that makes such epistemic modalities quaint.

Every concept is contingent upon and reduces into every other concept, or evolves into it, or whatever. This is not an attempt at an original inquiry as much as it is Hegel attempting to put together a historical justification for his broader philosophical system by attempting to anatomize the pyschological 'states' of various periods of history, a dubious project, at best. An awful lot of it boils down to this kind of sinister justification for a brand of uber-nationalism which seems eerily reminiscent of what made the first half of the twentieth century such an unbelievable nightmare. Though maybe some of my issues with the text have to do with the Sibree translation, which is piss-poor at best. After reading this, I kind of suspect that Hegel's prominence in Western philosophy has more to do with his creation of a system so byzantine that its nearly impossible to coherently refute (Which means it must be right. Right?) rather than from any profound insight it offers"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Worst book ever written. Run for the hills! Run away! Upon reading, anticipate headaches.

He believes that there has to be reason that cause all the historical events.. That reason is the struggle for freedom of human kinds. This central theme is presented through out the book. The way Hegel present the history is not through chronological order but he present it as being from East to West. This representation of the his history is very interesting in itself. By the time that Hegel wrote Philosophy of History, China was still under imperial rule therefore chinese could have much of the freedom. One of the criticism that I have on Hegel is that he threat the Far East as the strange and unrelated area.. Next interesting point that I found in this book is that the western civilization start from Greek.. (I definitely agree with him because Greek is the birth place of western philosophy, art, and politics).. By the time Roman take over the Europe, the center of culture m! ove from Athens to Rome..(Here, again everything moved from East to West). During the Roman Era, there were struggles of people against imperialism... In the sections about Roman, he wrote about the development of Christianity. As an advocated Christian, Hegel believed that Christianity is the divined political plan for people to be free from Roman Emperor.. (That's my interpretion of the Hegel's section on Christianity. It may be different from Hegel original idea) The last section he used Germany as the example of how modern nation evolved. In other word, he traced the history of Germany from barbaric period, to age of Holy Roman Empire, to the era of Germanic empire.. The transition from Holy Roman Empire to the Germanic Empire is the struggle for freedom from Catholic church by Germanic states..."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"This is a work from the full flower of German Idealism. Hegel thought we could trace the history of consciousness by making a specialized study of the historical development of a few (hand selected) civilizations. Hegel makes history more fun, but proving a massive thesis with examples doubly selected to fit (only some facts matter, only some civilizations matter) is suspect. Any thesis based on history seems questionable, as the 'facts' of history are already considerably picked over. For example, historical 'facts' may survive because they are chosen to be recorded by the winners of wars. Some historical facts are survive by accident--depending on which written records still remain.Marx turned Hegel on his head with dialectical materialism, a Marxist joke on Hegel's dialectical idealism. However, I think knowledge of Hegel isn't essential to understand Marxist philosophy. Hegel is essential background for Kierkegaard's works. Hegel is also a background source for deconstructionism, that modern haven of 'historical facts selected to fit the theory.'"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"This book was wonderful. It shouldn't be read as a history but more as a philosophy. Even there, it is a bit short of the greats. Why then do I call it wonderful? It is a view into the past intelligentsia. His history is antiquated; from a modern perspective some of it is wrong. However, it is great to see the history of views about history and the philosophy of them. I am not a pursuer of the P.C., and understand that the context of civilization, at his time, is the molder of his views. Old books such as this are windows into time and are treasures to be cherished. As far as his philosophy I intend to read more of his work in the future to get a better perspective, but I found it interesting. I am on board with Hegel in that we should pursue our Ideal of the Greek Golden Era to maintain a lofty goal for civilization. Which can be summed up by Thucydides in his description of Athenian life; &quot;We love the beautiful, but without ostentation or extravagance; we philosophize without being seduced thereby into effeminacy and inactivity (for when men give themselves up to Thought, they get further and further from the Practical--from activity for the public, for the common weal). We are bold and daring; but this courageous energy in action does not prevent us from giving ourselves an account of what we undertake (we have a clear consciousness respecting it); among other nations, on the contrary, martial daring has its basis in deficiency of culture: we know best how to distinguish between the agreeable and the irksome; notwithstanding which, we do not shrink from perils.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"In his Philosophy of History, Hegel stated, \\"Philosophy concerns itself only with the glory of the Idea mirroring itself in the History of the World. . . . [W]ith all the changing scenes, the History of the World . . . is this process of development and the realization of Spirit - this is the true Theodicaea, the justification of God in History. (Hegel, 457) As stated in the previous review, Hegel's Philosophy of History has impacted the modern historian of past decades as well as the postmodern historian of more recent decades. Hegel's worldview and resulting philosophy of history can be better understood within the cultural context of Hegel's homeland of Germany, especially in the areas of Pietism and German idealism.In his work, Christianity Through the Centuries, Earle Cairns explains that in Germany, Lutheranism of the of seventeenth century emphasized the intellectual aspect of religion. The cold orthodoxy of Lutheranism resulted in Pietism, which emphasized the subjective aspect of man's relation to God. Cultivation of a pious life included good works as an expression of true religion. Pietism emphasized prayer and individual Bible study with the Holy Spirit as an Illuminator of the Bible. (Cairns, 272, 413) Hegel stated, \\"Luther repudiated the authority of the Church, setting up in its stead the Bible and the testimony of the Human Spirit.\\" (Hegel, 416-417) Hegel's background of Pietism seems to have influenced his view of Luther's role in the Church.Within Pietism, indifference to doctrine led to some adopting the philosophy of idealism. (Cairns, 272, 413) Where the Enlightenment appealed to human reason, Romanticism appealed to human imagination, which was capable of recognizing the profound sense of mystery which arises from realizing that the human mind cannot comprehend the finite world, let alone infinity. Human subjectivity and inwardness were now seen as a mirror of the infinite. Confident that they could know the inner secrets of absolute reality, the idealists concluded that all objects of knowledge, and indeed the whole universe, are the products of an absolute subject, an Absolute Mind. (McGrath, 227-228 & Stump, 306, 316) Hegel conceived history as the \\"development of humankind's awakening consciousness.\\" (Nash, 109-112) Romanticism identified the infinite with human subjectivity and inwardness. Hegel likewise described the history of philosophy as the development of the Absolute's self-consciousness in the mind of humanity.Hegel defined truth as the synthesis of humanity's subjective will (their own thinking) and the universal Will (which is objectified in the laws and organization of the State). Hegel believed the World Spirit is working out its own freedom throughout the process of history. When humans act feely, they advance self-consciousness in their nation. Different eras of history manifest different degrees of freedom which become incarnate in one nation at a time. (Nash, 109-112) Hegel spoke of the rational will of the whole society, yet he viewed morality as an element in the dialectic process representing the relation between freedom and duty, between the universal will and the individual will. Stumpf explains that for Hegel, the highest freedom occurs when the individual acts according to the universal, rational will of the whole society. In his Philosophy of History, Hegel used examples of various peoples who represented \\"three moments in the development of freedom.\\" (Stumpf, 312-316) Hegel described these three moments in terms of the Orient, the Mediterranean, and Hegel's own Christian Germany.Hegel identified the Orient as the first moment, which included the immersion of Spirit in natural life. In all the pagodas, the Brahmins instruct prostitutes and dancing girls. \\"Theological doctrine - relation of religion to morality - is here altogether out of the question.\\" (Hegel, 157) The State appeared first in [China and India] as an immediate, natural unity - as a despotism. Because the form of government was an absolute monarchy, freedom in such Asian states was merely potential. (Nash, 113) The Orientals knew nothing of freedom except that the potentate alone could do what he wished. (Stumpf, 315) As stated earlier, Hegel described the history of the world in terms of \\"changing scenes.\\"During the second moment of Hegel's history, the scene shifted from the Orient to the Mediterranean. Hegel explained that \\"God not appear to the Greeks in the flesh. . . . [b]ecause man was not duly estimated, did not obtain honor and dignity, till he had more fully elaborated and developed himself.\\" (Hegel, 249) The nations of Greece and Rome rejected despotism in favor of aristocracy / democracy. Among the Greeks, the notion of law was the important innovation. (Nash, 113) Although the Greeks and Romans knew the concept of citizenship, they limited this status only to a few and regarded others as being by nature slaves. (Stumpf, 315) Since only some were subject to law in Greece, the essential rights of all people were not yet recognized. Therefore, freedom for the Greeks was an accident. (Nash, 113)In the third moment of Hegel's history, the scene shifted from the Mediterranean to Germany. Within the Christian Germany of Hegel's time, the Pietists emphasized the subjective rather than the objective. The subjectivism within Pietism seemed to merge with Hegel's interpretation of Lutheranism. Hegel believed the Lutheran understanding of Truth \\"is not a finished and completed thing; the subject himself must be imbued with Truth, surrendering his particular being in exchange for the substantial Truth, and making that Truth his own. . . . In the Lutheran church the subjective feeling and the conviction of the individual is regarded as equally necessary with the objective side of Truth. As subjective Spirit gains emancipation in the Truth, Christian Freedom is actualized. (Hegel, 416-417) Hegel believed freedom reached its full realization in his homeland of Germany. In his final chapter, Hegel described the Modern Time of Germany in terms of Reformation, political development, as well as Illumination and Revolution.In his discussion of Reformation in Germany, Hegel stated, \\"That harmony [of Objective and Subjective Will] which has resulted from the painful struggles of History, involves the recognition of the Secular as capable of being an embodiment of Truth; whereas it had seen formerly regarded as evil only, as incapable of Good--the latter being considered essentially ultramundane. It is now perceived that Morality and Justice in the State are also divine and commanded by God, and that in point of substance there is nothing higher or more sacred.\\" (Hegel, 422) Hegel seems to elevate the secular state as the most true, the most sacred of all substances.In his discussion of political development in Germany, Hegel described a certain phenomenon common between the Catholic and the Protestant world as a tendency of the human mind to regard \\"the Inward, the Abstract, and the Religious element\\" as \\"utterly alien to the secular.\\" As man awakened to the \\"lively consciousness of his subjective life and the inward origin of his volition,\\" he considered his \\"belief in Evil, as a vast power the sphere of whose malign dominion is the Secular.\\" (Hegel, 425) Hegel seems to reject the dualism of Plato (between the temporal and the eternal).In his discussion of Illumination and Revolution, Hegel used the term Eclairissement (Aufklarung) when referring to Reason. He defined Reason as \\"the Laws of Nature and the substance of what is right and good.\\" (Hegel, 441) For Hegel, the dialectic process in the ethical sphere is constantly moving toward a synthesis of subjective spirit and objective spirit, towards knowledge of the Absolute. Since the Absolute is disclosed in Nature and in the human mind, human reason can reach the inner essence of the Absolute. (Stumpf, 307, 312-316) For Hegel, human reason is sufficient for knowledge of the Absolute. Hegel seems to ignore the Christian understanding of faith.Hegel described his homeland of Germany in terms of Reformation, political development, as well as Illumination and Revolution. Hegel described the \\"Essence of the Reformation: Man is in his very nature destined to be free.\\" (Hegel, 416-417) In Hegel's own Christian Germany, he believed, the state rose out of the particular forms of freedom existing in the past into universal freedom. In the constitutional governments of his day, all men were free. (Nash, 113) Hegel's description of modern Germany as a sacred state pointed to the Reformation as the basis for man's freedom.Hegel's understanding of freedom is a primary theme in his political theory of the state as well as his social theory of the family. Within Hegel's theory of the state, man's freedom begins with the single unit of the family wherein individuals grow up, leave the family, and enter into that larger context of similar individuals that is called civil society. These individuals now chart out their own lives and have their own purposes. (Stumpf, 313)One feminist writer, Patricia Jagentowicz, points out that Hegel \\"excludes woman from the spheres of civil society and the state, the spheres in which man manifests his freedom.\\" (Mills, 81) In her review of Feminist Interpretations of G. W.F. Hegel, Elke Heckner described Hegel's social and political theory as \\"extremely influential within political philosophy. . . . Hegel's theory of the state has shaped two current versions of political theory: standard versions which ignore the role of sexual difference in Hegel and feminist revisionist interpretations of Hegel.\\"A second feminist writer, Heidi M. Ravven, points out that Hegel's concept of the family is superseded by civil society and government. Hegel considered the \\"piety of the hearth\\" as a \\"profoundly subjective state of feeling. The immediate and undifferentiated reconciliation of self and other in feeling that characterized the family is precisely similar to the customary harmonious political life of the ancients as Hegel describes it in The Philosophy of History.\\" (Ravven, 234-235) Although a prevalent theme in Hegel's history of the world seems to be the ultimate goal of freedom, feminist interpretations of Hegel indicate that his concept of freedom did not include freedom for women.Seyla Benhabib writes from a secular perspective, stating that Hegel rejected the notion that gender definitions are naturally defined. Nevertheless, the concept of the European nuclear family is reflected in his acknowledgement of functional complementarity between genders in the modern state. The female is confined to the private sphere and the man (due to his superiority) is in the public sphere. Hegel considers men and women to be spiritually different, defining women as \`lesser' human beings. Like Plato and Aristotle, Hegel not only assigns particularity, intuitiveness, passivity to women and universality, conceptual thought, and \`the powerful and active' to men, but sees in men the characteristics that define the species as human.\\" (Benhabib, 29-31) In his discussion of political development in Germany, Hegel seems to reject the dualism of Plato (between the temporal and the eternal).Joan Burgess writes from a Christian perspective. She explains that \\"Mind/body dualism has tended to equate femaleness with the body, with nature, and with the earth. Maleness has been equated with the spiritual, the intellectual, and the cultural. Women's bodies are also commonly viewed as sources of sinfulness; therefore, denigration of the body and bodily experience is equated with pursuit of spirituality. That which is corporeal and natural is regarded as inferior to that which is spiritual and cultural. Van Leeuwen points out that any view of women as inferior cannot be supported biblically. (Winfrey, 153-154)In the nineteenth century, the conception of the Bible as an ethical guidebook became fashionable due to the influence of German idealistic philosophy. (Cairns, 444)Hegel believed the highest duty in Scripture is the command to love God and to know God. He stated that in his day, public opinion had shifted from the question of knowing God to the doctrine that it is impossible to know God. (Hegel, 14)For Hegel, the history of the world developed as a \\"rational process, constituting the rational necessary course of the World-Spirit - that Spirit whose nature is always one and the same, but which unfolds thus its one nature in the phenomena of the world's existence, . . . presenting itself as the ultimate result of History. (Hegel, 10) One scholar describes Hegel's Geist. . . as \\"a transindividual principle that unfolds in history.\\" Geist. . . transforms nature into a second world, externalizing \\"itself in history by . . . shaping the given such as to make it correspond to itself, to make it embody its own subjectivity, that is, reason and freedom.\\" (Benhabib, 29) Hegel's statements indicate his belief that human reason is sufficient for knowledge of the Absolute. Hegel seems to ignore the Christian understanding of faith.The Christian historian John Warwick Montgomery criticizes Hegel for his error in purporting to deduce historical substance and goal from reason itself. . . . The [Hegelian] dialectic can describe a continual refinement of evil as well as a continual refinement of good. Hegel's chief error is his \\"conviction that the historical dialectic is moving toward the specific goal of freedom.\\" (Montgomery, 18-19, 30) Although a prevalent theme in Hegel's history of the world seems to be the ultimate goal of freedom, feminist interpretations of Hegel indicate that his concept of freedom did not include freedom for women.In his introduction, Hegel stated, \\"God governs the world; the actual working of his government--the carrying out of his plan--is the History of the World.\\" (Hegel, 36)Hegel concluded his work by stating \\"Philosophy concerns itself only with the glory of the Idea mirroring itself in the History of the World. (Hegel, 457) In his work, The Meaning of History, Nash sated that Hegel honestly believed the history of ideas had reached its fulfillment in his system, which, if so, would bring about a frightening proximity between Hegel's mind and the mind of God. (Nash, 106)Stumpf believes the power of Hegel's thought can be measured by the fact that most 20th-century philosophy represents ways of revising or rejecting aspects of his absolute idealism. (Stumpf, 302) Ultimately, Hegel's Idealism and its goal of freedom theoretically elevated the State over God, resulting in a practical loss of freedom for several generations of those living under totalitarian systems of government.Although Hegel's description of modern Germany as a sacred state pointed to the Reformation as the basis for man's freedom, Hegel's description of the State as the ultimate expression of truth and morality, the most sacred of all substances, seems to be the embodiment of his World Spirit. Hegel's concept of the State was instrumental in the development of Marxism with its denial of freedom for both men and women.Freedom for men and women can only be found in God whose truth and righteousness transcends His creation. In Acts 5:29 we read, \\"We ought to obey God rather than man.\\" The government of God over his creation supersedes any government established by man."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Having just read the introduction (which is the theoretical core of the work), and having read a different translation, I can safely say that Sibree's translation progresses about as smoothly as one sloshing around in a Turtle(tm) pool full of runny egg-whites with three Sumatran carpet- sharks tied to one's back. This is an essential philosophical text; but try and get just the introduction (*Reason and History,* translated by Robert Hartman on Macmillan/Lib.

Tyler doesn't offer any information on how to use the herbs - as a matter of fact, from the way he describes them, you'd be sure he never ever touched, or tasted any herb. If you're read this book, you'll discover that there's no point in using any herbs because there are only two categories for herbs in this book: they either fall in the category of worthless or deadly.Tyler does his best to downplay or completely disparage the effectiveness of every single herb mentioned, and when he is unable to prove that the particular herb is ineffective, then he states that even though the herb was empirically effective, there is no sufficient research to back it up.The book is basically loaded with information on why you should not bother using any of the herbs listed in this book - either because in Tyler's opinion they are ineffective or they could be dangerous. And for the herbs that have been proven effective and were in use for centuries, Tyler states how \\"pharmaceutical industry\\" lost interest in these herbs. Of course they lost interest - how would they have interest in herbs if they cannot patent that are available everywhere? On the other hand, because of people's interest in herbs, you'll find shelves at your drug store loaded with natural supplements. Some people just don't want to poison themselves with pharmaceutical products (for that matter, you may want to check out compenium of pharamceutical products to find out how deadly side-effects of those can be).If pharmaceutical industry can not make money, why would they still be interested? And to state that this book is free of commercialism, just \\"honest\\" herbal - what a joke!For burdock, which is a blood purifier, Tyler further states \\"in spite of its long use as a folkloric remedy, no solid evidence existst that burdock exhibits any useful therapeutic activity.\\" (Burdock happens to be one of the four herbs which have proven very effective in helping people heal innumerable diseases, cancer being one of them, because it does help to detoxify the body.)About Chickweed, Tyler writes: \\"Despite the fact that it is prominently listed in almost every catalog of herbs currently available and also that many writers describe it as a valuable herb, I can think of no good reason to allow space to this worthless weed. ... Let's not waste any more time and space on the imagined medicinal value of this ineffective herb.\\" (On a personal note, chickweed is a popular herbal supplement for weight loss...)And, well, I can only suggest that you invest your money in some other, decent and honest, herbal that actually offers some useful information regarding the use of herbs. Do consult a genuine herbalist who is truly interested in helping people.

It has an almost iconic status with people who grew up in the early Baby Boomer years.Way back in 1946, toy stores were quiet uncrowded places. In one toy shop there was a rocking horse, a GI Joe Doll and a few cuddly soft toys ........ and one grumpy red painted tugboat called Scuffy.Scuffy was ambitious. He thought he was meant for bigger things, than just sailing in a bathtub.The toy shop owner (with his memorable polka dot tie) and his little boy, took Scuffy off to a laughing brook. It was springtime and the brook was running fast. Scuffy was soon off on his adventure.The pastoral world he passed through seemed placid, but at night the hooting owl gave him a fright.The river got bigger and busier. Scuffy was proud because he knew it was HIS river. He was nearly squashed between two logs that were on their way to the sawmill. With the spring melt a great flood burst the rivers banks. A lady and her cow had to be rescued off her roof.Pushed along by the floodwaters Scuffy arrived in the big city. It was a very noisy and busy place. When Scuffy tooted nobody noticed.Scuffy was just about to be swept out to sea. He wished the man with the polka dot tie and his little boy could rescue him. Miracle of miracles, there they were just as Scuffy was about to pass the last bit off land. He was rescued.Scuffy realises that sailing in the bathtub is not such a bad thing ...... in fact he said &quot;this is the life for me&quot;.The illustrations by Tibor Gergely are what make this book so appealing. The scenes are full of life and activity, be it the pastoral river scene with its friendly animals and the colourful towns and cities. Look for the details in the city scene. Try to find the horses.Tibor Gergely was a great children's book illustrator from this period. In addition to his artwork in Scuffy you can enjoy his illustrations in those other &quot;Little Golden Book&quot; classics, &quot;The Little Red Caboose&quot; and &quot;Tootle&quot;. These three books are perfect companions in any young person's library."},{"Title":"Scuffy the Tugboat and His Adventures Down the River.","review":"In the early 1950's I was introduced to the wonders of the the world when my parents bought me &quot;Scuffy&quot;. Who would have believed that a little red-painted tugboat could captivate me for nearly 50 years.Scuffy, the brave and somewhat feisty little red- painted tugboat, tires of his existence of living in the toystore owned by the &quot;man with the polka dot tie&quot; and states that he was meant for &quot;bigger things&quot;.The bigger things leads Scuffy on an odyssey through quiet mountain brooks, singing streams, rushing rivers, floods and eventually the sea. On his journey, Scuffy meets cows, men in &quot;great boots&quot; pushing logs, victims of floods and the scariness of the big city. As Scuffy hurtles towards his ultimate destiny, the sea, he longs for the joy and comfort of the toy store and the love of the man with the polka dot tie. Just as Scuffy is about to pass the last piece of land, prior to entering the eternal sea, the man with the polka dot tie catches the frightened red- painted tugboat with the blue smokestack and returns him to the toystore and his new domain, the safe and calming waters of the bathtub.A delightful work that will surely be requested night after night by children.

I did do big things and I want my kids to do big things too. That's why I bought this book to read to them, though it was hard to find. There's something comforting to a child's mind to know that Scuffy is right: that there are bigger things out there than his bathtub. He goes out and sees the big world and the worst that happens to him is that he is scared. But his safe bathtub is still there to come home to. And even though we adults know that Scuffy will always be a toy and will never do big things, kids know that one day they will grow up and may be ready to see the big world and do big things. But until they grow up, their safe little bathtub will always be there to come home to.

This benevolent shop owner takes Scuffy home and places him in a bath tub to sail. Convinced that he is meant for even bigger things, Scuffy is still not happy, so the shop owner takes him to a brook. Scuffy quickly learns that all water runs to the sea where a small tugboat finds himself quite vulnerable. Luckily, he is rescued just in time to avoid disaster. Gergley's use of line furnishes this anthropomorphic toy with facial features that complement and extend the text; therefore, at the end of the story, when the he has grown as an individual and matured, his transformation is not only evident in his speech and actions but also in his appearance.

'Scuffy The Tugboat' has earned its everlasting place in the canon of illustrated children's literature. As Scuffy verges on the abyss, I hope the eyes of today's children yet widen with anxiety at his impending, unthinkably cruel fate, and that as I did long ago they too learn and cherish 'Scuffy's' poignant lesson of the sweetness, goodness, warmth, and solace of the promise of, and the hope in, Redemption."},{"Title":"Scuffy the Tugboat and His Adventures Down the River.","review":"Animation studios are desperate to find proven material for their feature films--especially in the wake of disappointments like \\"Treasure Planet.\\"That's why I'm surprised nobody has optioned the rights to one of the greatest children's books ever; it has emotion, thrills, an important lesson, and one of the cutest lead characters I've ever seen.That book is, of course, \\"Scuffy the Tugboat.\\"Scuffy is a toy tugboat (hence the title) who dreams of something more than \\"sailing\\" in his little bathtub.

Since I'm still using the phrase at age 50, I obviously took something I value from the Scuffy book.I only rate it 2 stars because the problem is that the message I took away from it as an adult is not the only or even the usual way to read this book. The most common message is a fear-based warning not to seek anything outside the safest confines life has to offer because the world is dangerous and doesn't notice or care about us. It's a disempowering message. As a child my favorite parts of the book were the parts where Scuffy was having the adventure of sailing away. My least favorite parts were when Scuffy was overwhelmed by the enormity of the world and entirely lonely. I didn't like it when his only option was to go back to the bathtub.So I didn't buy this book for my daughter when she was little. We both grew up to work internationally because we're curious about our world...and neither of us has a case of Scuffy the Tugboat Syndrome because we aren't out here for our egos.

Upgren in _Many Skies_, explored alternate solar, stellar, and galactic systems and arrangements and what effects these might have had on the history of the world.Upgren divided the book into four sections, chapters in each section either exploring an alternate universe where the sky as it appears on Earth is different or discussing some aspect of astronomy as set-up to an idea for an alternate universe in a following chapter. The chapters described the different sky, why it was different, how this sky could have come to exist, what it would look like to an observer on Earth, and then what effects this might have had on the history of science and the history of the world in general. Often times the discussion of the effects were just questions the author would raise though in several cases he went into more detail. There were many diagrams and charts to help illustrate his points and Upgren did a good job of explaining astronomical terms such as proper motion, retrograde motion, and globular clusters when needed.Part one looked at different systems and arrangements for our Sun and Moon. What if the Earth had three moons? What if the Earth had not one Sun but three? What if the Earth were alone in space with the Sun, with no Moon or other planets, comets, or asteroids?Part two looked at alternate planets in our solar system, including our own. What if the Earth had rings? What if Jupiter existed in the orbit of our Venus? What if a bright planet, known to the ancients, orbited the Sun outside of the primary plane of the solar system, going far to the north or the south of the ecliptic? What if very bright comets were more frequent? What if Mars or Venus had a moon the size of our Moon (if Mars or Venus had a satellite as large and as bright as our Moon it would easily be seen by the unaided eye; if the Moon was seen from Venus when Venus is at its closest, about 26 million miles away, it would outshine all but the Sun and the Earth)?Part three looked at alternate stellar and galactic systems and arrangements. What if a star close to the Earth became a supernova? What if the Pleiades Cluster was about as close as the Hyades is now, not thousands of light years away but instead only a hundred light years away, with its stars visible in the daytime? What if the solar system were above the galactic plane, perhaps well outside and to the north of it, with the northern sky completely black and empty to the naked eye?Part four didn't really delve as much into different skies but touched on other topics, including issues of light pollution and astronomical causes of mass extinction on Earth.Not surprisingly, many of the various scenarios dealt primarily with alternate histories of science (particularly astronomy) as a result of these different skies. In some cases these alternate skies were beneficial to science. If the Earth had more than one Sun and/or had more than one Moon, or if Jupiter or Venus had satellites visible to the naked eye it would have been possible that the heliocentric model of the solar system would have been adapted centuries earlier, perhaps in the days of the Roman Empire, as it would have been apparent to ancient astronomers that not every object orbited the Earth. Similarly, in an alternate universe with a closer Jupiter (in the orbit of Venus perhaps), close enough that the unaided eye could detect a disk; it would have been possible to see a full set of phases and lead the intelligent observer to conclude it orbited the Sun and not the Earth.In other cases these alternate skies would not have helped the advancement of science. In an alternate universe where the Earth had rings, the only fully dark skies would exist near the poles, where the rings, lying on the equatorial plane, would be below the horizon and thus not visible. At lower latitudes the sky would always be too bright for the observation of faint objects and it is very likely that as a result the development of stellar astronomy would have been severely retarded. In a system with only the Sun and the Moon (no planets, comets, or asteroids), the issue of whether or not the Sun revolves around the Earth would likely not have been solved until the 18th or 19th centuries when the aberration of starlight and direct measure of stellar parallax could be accomplished with better instrumentation, Kepler's Laws of planetary motion could not have been devised, nor probably either Newton's laws of motion (or at least both would have been devised much later in history). Additionally, no concept of a week or a month would have suggested itself, producing perhaps changes in timekeeping.Changes to world history would of course not be limited to just astronomy and Upgren does explore that as well. He suggested that if the Earth had had more than one Sun and/or Moon, it is possible that monotheistic religious would not have arisen at all or have arisen later in world history and perhaps in the present polytheistic religious would still be quite common and widespread. In an alternate universe where the northern sky is pure black (due to the solar system being well above the galactic plane), astrology would not have developed and many world mythologies would have been less rich.An interesting and thought provoking book, my only complaints are that I would have liked more development of non-science-related historical topics as well as alternate evolutionary histories of life on Earth."},{"Title":"Many Skies: Alternative Histories of the Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars","review":"Emeritus astronomy professor Arthur Upgren presents Many Skies: Alternative Histories Of The Sun, Moon, Planets And Stars, an imaginative discussion of how bodies in the night sky could just as easily have been arranged in very different ways. Exploring scenarios such as if the Earth had multiple moons, or rings like Saturn, or if the Sun were a double-star or triple-star system, Many Skies contemplates how different theologies, astrologies, and methods of tracking time would have evolved. Many Skies also scrutinizes how human interferences such as light pollution is changing the night sky, and warns that increased satellites displaying products will change the appearance of Earth's atmosphere. A vivid and contemplative account, as appealing, understandable, and enjoyable for lay readers as for experts in the field."},{"Title":"Many Skies: Alternative Histories of the Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews many well known professionals in the astronomical community. As a professional in the Aerospace Industry and an \\"Amateur Astronomer\\" for 40 years (with undergraduate degrees in Chemistry & Astronomy) I found this book to be fascinating in the various solar system scenarios the author describes but also disturbing for another reason. The different \\"Alternative Histories\\" were well thought out and showed an excellent grasp of astronomical and physical principals.However; Dr Upgren, like his colleague and predecessor Carl Sagan (\\"Pale Blue Dot\\"), clearly goes out of his way to display what I consider to be an obvious Christian bigotry. In the book, the author attempts to determine how our earlier Western European culture might have acted and developed under several different solar system scenarios where humans could have developed and advanced.As many academics do, he compares actions and motives from hundreds and even thousands of years ago to today's societal and cultural values and utterly fails to put these facts in any sort of historical context. He seems to delight in \\"bashing\\" the christian church and its leaders. At the same time, all other religions and societies appear to be treated fairly if not in some cases with a status that may not be deserved.Unfortunately, in my opinion, this very transparent bigotry on the part of the author is very distracting and significantly diminishes the scholarship of this work."},{"Title":"Songs From Unsung Worlds: Science in Poetry (Science 85)","review":"This anthology covers several areas of science, but breaks them into catagories: Subject is Science; Observations of the Natural World; Science as Metaphor; and Satire and Criticism of Science. It is prefaced by an interesting dialogue and includes biolgraphical notes of all the authors. Sciences include: astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, physics. Poets include Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson to Annie Dillard and many contemporary American poets.

The lifetime warranty is astounding, and yet I still find myself keeping it in the box, so as not to scratch or ruin it.It has been a great tool in study, and if you want conservative notes, has excellent notes in it.A few things:1. For those who are looking for &quot;THE King James&quot;, the spellings of many words have been Americanized (Savior instead of Saviour, etc.). This does not bother me, just thought some might be interested in that.2. I am NOT a KJV only person and I laugh every time I read the notes that help you understand what is being said in the old English. Usually, it is very similar to what the NLT would say.3. The 2 silk markers are very nice for doing read through the Bible and holding 2 spots.4. This Bible MAKES me want to read and study, it is so nice.5. Every once in while, I have found myself at odds with the opinions of the note writers (nothing unusual in any study Bible) and would recommend that readers determine doctrine for themselves, rather than take wholesale any note. (Always a good rule of thumb)6. There is some excellent introduction material on how to study the Bible at the beginning.7. Maps are OK, I guess I really like maps so am more inclined to use Baker's Bible Atlas or some such other resource. Good for quick reference.Overall, an excellent Bible."},{"Title":"The Antietam and Fredericksburg","review":"I picked up a copy of this book because General Palfrey is a brother of the Psi Upsilon fraternity, and an honored military leader. The book provided a great timeless perspective on multiple campaigns and was a page-turner especially considering the genre. I would fully reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"A Secret Madness","review":"The book held my interest for the most part and was a quick read. Finished it over a couple of days. Her style of writing was rather dry and repetitive at times, but this must have been a difficult book to write. I just don't understand why she ever married him in the first place.. there were red flags well all along. Then to stay with him all those years, he didn't work the first few years, and when he did get a job, he didn't hold it for any length of time. He would clam up and refuse to speak to her, make cryptic comments, and how many times did he say things like, \\"you're better off without me\\" or \\"I'm leaving\\" The fact that she stayed in the same house with him,slept in the same bed, even after he started to become violent towards her, with a small child in the house is just beyond bizarre. Glad she finally took daughter and left...I have a relative with an OCD and it's severe and debilitating.. Not sure if what he had qualified as OCD strictly speaking.. but I do know that OCD is so much more than just hand washing...... it's all kinds of weird thoughts and actions... some that seem to spring up overnight... my relative not only washes hands for hours on end, and showers for hours, she will wash and rewash clothes (can't get them clean), she wont' touch anything without plastic on hands, she won't sit on toilet but squats over, won't talk on phone without a cloth over mouth, toothbrushes are disposable and will only use plastic utensils and the list goes on and on..."},{"Title":"A Secret Madness","review":"Sometimes you read and hear all the doctor language of a mental illness like OCD but it is hard to understand what that really looks like in everyday life. This book really shows how it can be living with someone with OCD, how isolated your life can become, how detached they can be. This brought much understanding, however I didn't like that it had no happy ending. Very sad book."},{"Title":"A Secret Madness","review":"It's quite easy to get information about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, but what isn't readily available is an insight into how it feels to live with the problem. Elaine Bass isn't medically qualified but when Gerald was moved to comment that his daughter was 'just like him' she knew that she had to get to the bottom of the causes of his mental illness if only for her daughter's sake. Her attempts to get Gerald to talk about his problem and the details he reluctantly provided give an amazing insight into how frightening the symptoms must be. I've read superficial descriptions about people with OCD constantly washing their hands, remaking beds, but this book goes far deeper and provides some insight into how the sufferer feels and what drives them. If a friend or relative suffers from OCD this book should be essential reading."},{"Title":"A Secret Madness","review":"I read a review of this book in the Telegraph and was under the impression the book was about autism. As my husband is autistic I thought I would gain a new insight into this illness. Unfortunately the book describes post-war Britain, which in itself is very depressing, as well as the author's marriage to a man who is criminally insane. I did not find any references to autism (as I know it) in the book, except perhaps the fact that he lives in himself and is unable communicate. The violent physical attacks on the author I can not associate with autism. Also the ending is a bit strange, in as far as her daughter stays in contact and has a good relationship with him. Her sadness at his death is bewildering. All in all I can say I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for help in dealing with autism."},{"Title":"Anthropology in Theory: Issues in Epistemology","review":"I have a love hate relationship with this book. It is as difficult as any Chem, O-Chem or Physics text.It started with all hate...Passe I thought to myself. All this theory is so old school. So then. As this book moved into the Post Modernists I detached myself a bit and then started to get warm fuzzy feelings about the theory and how I was using it in my day to day life and how well all this verbosity and inference was going to and has served me well in my current classes. Months later I find myself digging through it and my class work to find some Foucault for references. With a mix of Anthropologists and many social scientists I think I might be inspired to take on a few units for a minor in Sociology.If you are using this as a school text. Do not doubt the importance of the introductory pages. I would repeat myself but I know if you have to read this book you are a bright soul.Good Luck with that theory class!;-)"},{"Title":"Anthropology in Theory: Issues in Epistemology","review":"This book is huge and heavy- but they packaged it really well and there was no damage! It was also in better than new condition"},{"Title":"Shinkage-Ryu Sword Techniques: Traditional Japanese Martial Arts Vol.2","review":"Tadashige Watanabe dared to boldly go where no one has gone before! The techniques of the Shinkage Ryu have been closely and jealously guarded for centuries. To find not one, but two books on the shelf concerning this magnificent and ancient art is astounding. To my knowledge, Watanabe's are the only books on Shinkage Ryu swordsmanship in print. Although this book lacks indepth technical instruction, the hundreds of photos allow the moderatly experienced swordsman, no matter the style, to gain an insight into the technique, practice and application of each kata (form). Although the novice might find this a bit confusing, with a little patience and a lot of practice the &quot;way&quot; will soon begin to become more clear. As mentioned previously, this book is a first for Shinkage Ryu swordsmanship, and to anyone with knowledge of the Japanese culture, the lack of written detail is not surprising. There are, perhaps, those who opposed the release of this manual, but thanks to Tadashige Watanabe's diligent effort, this traditional and secret warrior method can now be glimpsed by all. A must for any martial arts library."},{"Title":"Shinkage-Ryu Sword Techniques: Traditional Japanese Martial Arts Vol.2","review":"I am very early in my studies of shinkage ryu, although I have practiced other martial arts for more than 25 years. My teacher is a student of Watanabe Sensei.Like books about all styles, this volume is meant not as a stand-alone course, but as a reference to be used in conjunction with face-to-face training. As it is not a video, but a series of still photographs, there are necesarily some details left out. One can no more learn sword from a book than learn how to do a spinning tae kwon do back kick, a shiho nage aikido throw or a proper one two punch. All these take place in three dimensions and require an expert to convey their true essense.What this book, and it's companion volume, do provide are a reference to some of the basic techniques of one of the greatest surviving sword systems as practiced by one of the world's foremost masters.If you want to learn Japanese sword, buy the book AND find a genuine teacher. You won't be disappointed with either."},{"Title":"Shinkage-Ryu Sword Techniques: Traditional Japanese Martial Arts Vol.2","review":"The first warning is that you should have some experience in the traditional (older) fighting system. this book is not a tool for the novice. It does however bring a wealth of information of the Koryo Kata's of Shinkage-Ryu. Even those that are not practioners of ShinKaGe can glimpse and acquire knowledge from the volume of pictures.

However, this is not a book for a beginner. Indeed, as one of the reviewers correctly stated, \\"You cannot learn Japanese swordsmanship, no matter what style, from merely reading a book.\\" This is a book for intermediate and advanced students. It is filled with clear photographs showing the techniques; nevertheless, you cannot learn these sword techniques without guidance from a competent kenjutsu instructor. Not all martial artists will find this book of value.In conclusion, if you are involved in kenjutsu, kendo, Iaido or other sword systems, you might find this book of interest.Rating: 4 Stars.

If you want to learn swordsmanship and have a limited background in Koryu style swordsmanship (im not talking about kendo background, or even Iaido) you will find this book with its lack of explantion, a difficult way to learn anything other than Shinkage ryu has a lot of forms.... This is not to say this is a bad book. Many in the &quot;world of koryu&quot; balk at even the idea of these forms being displayed let alone printed with any kind of detail. Not wishing to be harsh on this book's lack of user &quot;friendliness&quot; I will simply state that like the other books by this publisher (namely THE DIETY AND THE SWORD [KATORI SHINTO RYU]) they are good first efforts that hopefully will lead to more detailed, and hopefully better written instructional books in the future. -Vic"},{"Title":"Oracle DBA Automation Scripts","review":"This collection of scripts cover all of the major DBA functions. Since most experienced DBAs have already amassed their tools, this book is for the newer DBA. It will give you a ready made collection of the basic scripts, which you can modify and perfect as your experience grows.I like this collection because it allowed me and my team to bundle production ready scripts into an application that we developed for internal company use. Although me and most of my team were DBAs in the past out personal script collections were out of date. We bought this book, tailored the scripts we needed to production tasks to support our application and were able to release a turn key application to production. Since the scripts were provided on CD ROM and were relatively bug free this book saved us hundreds of development hours and allowed us to deliver a system that had a higher value than one that is tossed into production.If you're a new DBA this book and the scripts that come with it will kickstart your tool library. If you're a developer that is building an Oracle application and want to deliver a complete solution this book will save time and money."},{"Title":"Oracle DBA Automation Scripts","review":"This is a superb book. It has a lot of escencial Oracle DBA scripts written for UNIX / NT environments. Some scripts have really nice value added; for example the backup script provided also creates a file for restoring files backed up.

Automation scripts made my job much easier in database backups. With the help of this book I couldconfigure new Oracle 9i database and made it fully functional in four hours. Its a great book if you are working on Oracle installed on windows or unix. I feel that it is really worth its price."},{"Title":"Oracle DBA Automation Scripts","review":"I bought this book mostly out of curiosity - what a Principle Consultant and DBA with Oracle Corporation may have to offer. While the book is decent in terms of technical contents, it falls way short of the BIG claims made by the publisher. Many scripts are just too simple to be production-strength utilities. New DBAs may find the book helpful in getting started, though."},{"Title":"Alter your life","review":"Everyone should be born with an Emmet Fox library. Whatever is troubling you, EF will help you set it to rights."},{"Title":"Alter your life","review":"The title'Alter your life' by Emmet Fox (1886-1951)engineer and metaphysicist sums up the message.Fox makes a powerful statement 'there is no need to be unhappy'.He reiterates' Poverty, loneliness are really bad habits'.He says'you must seize the rudder of your own destiny..steer boldly for the port you intend to make'.Not only that but if you are not sure what you want in life'The Law will tell you what you want and get if for you too'. Fox's powerful conviction is centred in God- belief in God and the Great Universal Power.Spiituality and Science are comfortable bedfellows here. Fox doesn't spiritualise everything. Quite the opposite. He grounds his spiritual belief in everyday reality.Logical thinker and mathematician that he was he outlines a simple procedure to connect with the Universal Power in a real and tangible way. Decide 3 things that you want and 3 you don't want in your life, he advises. Reflect on these every single day for one month and at the end of a month, he declares, there should be a definite change for the better in your circumstances.Today the market is on overload with positive thinking manuals.

The symbolism of the number 12 is also considered here.Fox focuses exclusively on the esoteric symbolic exegesis, but for the seeker of truth it is important to understand that there are many layers of meaning in the Judeo-Christian scriptures, and that the literal is often equally valid or relevant. In this regard it is always helpful to study the way in which the Hebrew sages approach the text, in both the Talmud and the Zohar.Other chapters of valuable insight include the Seven Main Aspects of God and the Magic of Tithing. Amongst the best passages are those that warn against false teachers and provide guidelines to discern the false from the true, and the section on the precession of the equinoxes and the long, mostly unknown history of mankind. The most comforting chapter: God The Deliverer, is a discussion of Psalm 18.This book was first published in 1931. On pages 116 and 117 of this 1950 edition, Fox deals with the great changes to come and their timing. Unfortunately here he has been proved wrong, as he maintained that the most revolutionary and far-reaching upheavals in the circumstances of human life \\"will be over and done with in from twenty to twenty-five years from now.\\" I am not aware of any major changes of such significance that occurred anytime between 1951 and 1956, unless he meant the coming of Elvis!That failure in timing aside, Alter Your Life is still a great read on various levels.

He perceived that there was only one real danger to the USA - grave division among her people. He maintains that such a danger cannot arise as long as the American people are careful never to allow party spirit to become so embittered that the destruction of political enemies seems more important than the safety of the country.An orderly democratic state will only endure as long as the people loyally accept the verdict of the majority of their fellow citzens when expressed constitutionally, and loyally support those who are elected to office, whether they like them personally or not.

The characters ride horses, gamble in the town's saloon, cuss, smoke &quot;quirleys&quot; and visit &quot;soiled doves.&quot; But aside from that the story takes on a different genre from the traditional Western. That's because Sheriff Ben Stillman takes on a different type of killer. &quot;Bar fights, spontaneous shootings, horse thieves, cattle rustlers, and bank robbers he could handle,&quot; the book explains. Those cases had plenty of witnesses. &quot;All Stillman had had to do was walk up, remove the smoking gun from the killers' hands, and throw the culprits in the hoosegow.&quot; This time the killer leaves no trails - no witnesses, no motive. Author Peter Brandvold spotlights one character after another; Stillman's African-American deputy, local cowboys, soldiers, the town blacksmith, the Chinese restaurant owner, a wife-abusing farmer, showing each as the possible killer. The plot thickens as one after another murder takes place and the sheriff's job comes into jeopardy. In the process Brandvold tells the story of the West the way it was, from the brothels and bars to faithful marriages (including the sheriff's). Through it all he spins a good tale, revealing just enough clues as he goes to keep your interest. You might say this is a Western murder mystery. This is the first Brandvold book I've read, but hopefully not the last. His style is direct, clear, and compelling, qualities found in all the best authors."},{"Title":"Once A Lawman","review":"Don't really know why this is sold as a western. Must be the town where it took place. It is a mystery through and through. People are being killed in the town of Clantick, Montana. All different kinds of people. So old, some young, a soldier, both men and women. There has to be a connection. Sheriff Ben Stillman and his deputy, Leon McMannigle try to figure it all out. It is left up to a woman to make the connection, then Ben knows who the killer is. Not bad for a mystery, real bad for a western. I was surprised at the end result. For a western writer Beandvold has done a flip flop."},{"Title":"Once A Lawman","review":"\\"Once a Lawman\\" is the 3rd Ben Stillman Western by Peter Brandvold who I think is one of the finest Western writers working today. Ben Stillman is the sheriff of Clantick in the Montana territory. There seems to be a serial killer in Clantick. A prostitute, a farmer, an old woman, and an army sergeant are murdered in the same fashion. There throats were slit with a knife. Ben, with the help of Leon McMannigle, search for a connection among the victims. Time is of the essence because the next victim will be someone very close to Ben. There is a subplot involving Ben's wife Fay. She is a school teacher, and one of her student's father drinks and doesn't want his daughter to go to school. As one reviewer has already written, this novel is more mystery that Western, but I think it is a very good and entertaining book."},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"The Penguin production of Richard II is full length and well done. The other version(s) are abridged and not so good. I find it increases understanding and satisfaction of Shakespeare to listen to the tapes while reading."},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"My only complaint about this play is that Shakespeare should have had some dialogues where the characters discussed crucial history before the play opens. Gloucester (murdered or dead before the play but mentioned several times) had tried to usurp Richard's crown too many times. History itself is not sure if Gloucester died or was murdered. Bolingbroke for a while conspired with Gloucester and now sees another oppurtunity to usurp the crown.The virtuous John of Gaunt served Richard with honor and integrity and eventually moved parliament into arresting Gloucester for treason. This would of made John of Gaunt's rages all the more valid. Otherwise this play is outstanding! Richard shows himself to be capable of ruling at times, but gains our contempt when he seizes his the honorable John of Gaunt's wealth. John of Gaunt's final rage in 2.1 is a passage of immense rageful beauty. Also, Shakespeare moves us into strongly suspecting that Richard had Gloucester murdered. However, despite Richard's crime, Shakespeare masterfully reverses our feelings and moves us into having deep pity for Richard when he is deposed. The Bishop of Carlisle (Richard's true friend) provides some powerful passages of his own. I can not overestimate the grace in which Shakespeare increases our new won pity for Richard when Bolingbroke (Gaunt's rightful heir) regains his wealth and the death of Gloucester is left ambiguous. 5.1, when Richard sadly leaves his queen and can see that Henry IV and his followers will eventually divide is a scene of sorrowful beauty. 5.4 is chilling when Exton plots Richard's murder. 5.5 is chilling and captivating when Richard dies but manages to take two of the thugs down with him. The icing on the cake is that Bolingbroke (Henry IV) can only regret his actions and realize that he has gotten himself into a troublesome situation. But that will be covered in &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; and &quot;2 Henry IV.&quot; We can easily argue that it is in &quot;Richard II&quot; where we see Shakespeare's mastery of the language at its finest."},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"This is a review of the Arden Second Series edition of King Richard II -- an edition edited by Peter Ure and now superseded by the Third Series, but still available on Amazon and lots of other places.(Why there are people on this site giving their opinions of the play itself is beyond me. Of course it is masterful.)I love Arden's editions of Shakespeare because the notes are excellent, the introductions thorough, and the quality of the books themselves -- that is, their sturdiness -- extremely high.But this one falls short. Ure is so fascinated by Shakespeare's sources and his various departures from those sources that the notes are essentially worthless for any other purpose. It is so rare that a note has anything to say other than a remark about the sources that after a while I stopped going to them. The introduction is the same way. I am sure that the question of the sources is very interesting, it just isn't interesting to me, and certainly not in the detail provided here. I would have liked to read about other features of the play too (they are there, just buried in endless discussion of how Shakespeare did or did not use Holingshed for some particular detail).Lastly, if this review is showing up on the page for the Penguin or Folger or Signet or any other of the fine editions of Shakespeare -- my apologies. Amazon does this, not me. I've posted this where it belongs, on the Arden 2d Series Richard II page!"},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"I'm not terribly fond of this publisher's edition. The first thing I noticed was that the book is bulky and cumbersome; it is far too thick for a book of its size, rendering one-handed reading highly difficult. The notes and supplemental material cover as thick a section as the text itself--which isn't inherently a bad thing--but it makes keeping the book open wide enough to read without cracking the spine almost impossible.In addition to the book's width being too short to comfortably hold, it also means numerous lines must carry over into the next line. While this is annoying, it would not be an issue, except the line numberings appear to be done automatically and so include these one- or two-word spillovers as a separate line. This means that when my professor references a certain line number from his edition, I have to hunt around to find the corresponding section. I feel that a work such as this, with distinctive, predetermined lines, should not undergo different numbering conventions.Finally, I believe the annotations are poorly done. I have read many different publishers' versions of Shakespeare, and I have to say this is one of the few times I've ever wished more information were provided. Often I feel books annotate more than necessary with commonly recognized definitions or explaining easily understood syntax. However, I have found myself repeatedly looking to the annotations for a definition to some archaic word or unclear usage only to be disappointed. Also, --and this is more just a pet peeve-- the annotated words do not have any sort of textual indication, such as a number or bubble. I used to think that was distracting and wished it gone; well, now I have an edition without it and it is even more inconvenient, as I have to check the annotations page to see whether a word even has an explanation. The annotations also often spill over onto the next page, causing the reader to have to flip back and forth.Overall, I feel the text and annotations of this edition were poorly organized, resulting in difficulty for the reader."},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"This is a very poor quality audio which has been abridged to leave out some of the best parts of the play.

I don't know why that is. The histories that are read are either Henry V (largely due to Branagh's movie), Richard III (because the hunchback king is so over-the-top evil), or the gargantuan trilogy of Henry VI, with the nearly saintly king (at least by Part III) who much prefers contemplating religion and ethics to ruling and dealing with the cabals among his nobles.So why read a relatively obscure history about a relatively obscure king? Aside from the obvious (it's Shakespeare, stupid), it is a wonderful piece of writing - intense, lyrical, and subtle. Richard II is morally ambiguous, initially an arrogant, callous figure who heeds no warnings against his behavior. Of course, his behavior, which includes seizing the property of nobles without regard for their heirs, leads to his downfall. Nothing in his character or behavior inspires his subjects so he has no passionate defenders when one of the wronged heirs leads a rebellion to depose Richard II. But Richard now becomes a much more sympathetic figure -especially in the scene where he confronts the usurper, Richard acknowledges his mistakes, but eloquently wonders what happens when the wronged subjects can depose the leader when they are wronged. What then of the monarchy, what then of England?On top of the profound political musings, you get some extraordinarily lyrical Shakespeare (and that is truly extraordinary). Most well known may be the description of England that was used in the airline commercial a few years back... &quot;This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, ...&quot;If you like Shakespeare and haven't read this play, you've missed a gem."},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"Richard II was incompetent, wastefully extravagant, overtaxed his nobles and peasants, ignored his senior advisors, and lavished dukedoms on his favorites. His rival, Henry of Bolingbroke (later Henry IV), was popular with the common man and undeservingly suffered banishment and loss of all his property. And yet two centuries later Elizabethans viewed the overthrow of Richard II as fundamentally wrong and ultimately responsible for 100 years of crisis and civil war. Queen Elizabeth's government even censored Shakespeare's play.Shakespeare masterfully manipulates our feelings and attitude toward Richard II and Bolingbroke. We initially watch Richard II try to reconcile differences between two apparently loyal subjects each challenging the other's loyalty to the king. He seemingly reluctantly approves a trial by combat. But a month later, only minutes before combat begins, he banishes both form England. We begin to question Richard's motivation.Richard's subsequent behavior, especially his illegal seizure of Bolingbroke's land and title, persuades us that his overthrow is justified. But as King Richard's position declines, a more kingly, more contemplative ruler emerges. He faces overthrow and eventual death with dignity and courage. Meanwhile we see Bolingbroke, now Henry IV, beset with unease, uncertainty, and eventually guilt for his action.Shakespeare also leaves us in in a state of uncertainty. What is the role of a subject? What are the limits of passive obedience? How do we reconcile the overthrow of an incompetent ruler with the divine right of kings? Will Henry IV, his children, or England itself suffer retribution?Richard II has elements of a tragedy, but is fundamentally a historical play. I was late coming to Shakespeare's English histories and despite my familiarity with many of his works I found myself somewhat disoriented. I did not appreciate the complex relationships between the aristocratic families, nor what had happened before. Fortunately I was rescued by Peter Saccio, the author of &quot;Shakespeare's English Kings&quot;. Saccio's delightful book explores how Shakespeare's imagination and actual history are intertwined.I hope you enjoy Richard II as much as I have. It is the gateway to Henry IV (Parts 1 and 2) and Henry V, all exceptional plays."},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"This is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, but in the Kindle edition the footnotes are not activated.

I have bought many products from Amazon with no problems."},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"While many of Shakespeare's works play on English pride, we can say patriotism sets two of his plays apart from the others. Obviously there's Henry V with its depiction of the king who delivered England's greatest military victory and that's a winner-take-all heroic epic. The other play is this one, Richard II.Both plays belong to the same cycle of four histories that also includes Henry IV parts 1 and 2. In Richard II, Shakespeare launches the cycle with a tragedy.The play starts with Richard presiding over a trial by combat. Henry Bolingbroke (who later becomes King Henry IV) and Thomas Mowbray each accuses the other of treason and are going to fight it out. In a trial by combat, God himself decides the issue by lending strength to the righteous. Whoever wins, though, will put Richard in a delicate position, so he stops the combat and exiles both men; Bolingbroke to a few years of banishment but Mowbray forever.This is wrong. King though he may be, Richard is not God and by stopping the duel, he usurps divine providence.Why? Bolingbroke's father and Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, is a rich man and Richard needs money. In exiling the son from his old and frail father, he hastens the man's end. This gives Richard the opportunity to seize Bolingbroke's inheritance. Bolingbroke returns to reclaim his birthright and wars upon Richard, using as a pretext that his courtiers have given him evil counsel. Bolingbroke wins, seizes the crown and becomes Henry IV. Richard is deposed, imprisoned, and dies.Shakespeare offers two remarkable soliloquies by dying characters. As he dies, John of Gaunt extols the virtues of England.\\"This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle,This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,This other Eden, demi-paradiseThis fortress built by nature for herselfAgainst infection and the hand of war.This happy breed of men, this little world.This precious stone set in the silver sea...\\"Patriotic stuff! The whole play is about how a king for reasons of personal ambition, through negligence and incompetence, betrayed his duty towards his holy realm. By the end of the play, we witness Richard reaching this conclusion. But thinking it through pains him.\\"I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,My soul the father; and these two begetA generation of still-breeding thoughts...\\"Where John of Gaunt dies full of worries over England's fate yet still conscious of her glory, Richard dies in despair.

King Richard is a hopelessly deluded and inept monarch who believes supremely in the divine ordination of kings. He leans on this belief to the exclusion of all of the other king's responsibilities. He makes one poor decision after another, and never reflects on the choice or its consequences before he makes them. However, we still feel a tug at the heart when this monarch is murdered, and this is attributable only to his glorious poetry. Richard speaks in some of Shakespeare's finest verse, and he has the mind for metaphor. I would recommend reading Shakespeare's History plays in order of the king's reign, and one comes to appreciate the complexities and strength of Shakespeare's storytelling.There really are no exceptional characters in this play other than Richard. His antagonist Henry Bolingbroke is a cold hearted dud (and master politician) who plays to the common man and ruthlessly kills those who oppose him. All the while, telling us, and himself, that all his actions are justified and are the results of other's choices. Really he is no different from Richard, except he lacks the King's sense of poetry and theater. There are also some good speeches from secondary characters in this text, especially John of Gaunt. Shakespeare's genius is too large to be contained to only the main characters.\\"Richard II\\" is worthy of a read, if only for the extraordinary experience of feeling revulsion AND pity for the title character."},{"Title":"Richard II (Shakespeare: The Critical Tradition)","review":"Shakespeare's age was the high renaissance in England.

John of Gaunt is sick and England is sick. England is subject to misrule by Richard, Gaunt asserts.Following the death of John of Gaunt, traitors, so-called, appear. Many of the nobles in the kingdom go over to the side of Bolingbroke, (Gaunt's son, also known as Henry IV).It is Act III and Richard lands in Wales. His rule still shows outward splendor. When he learns of Bolingbroke's advance, he loses his air of authority. Richard learns that his uncle, the Duke of York, has joined with Bolingbroke's forces.Bolingbroke seeks to have his banishment reversed and his lands restored.

A section on what to do seven days before the test, student stress... also incldues an excellent section on note taking with visual examples of before and after using his techniques during the different types of classes that college students take.Best of all none of this is lengthly - all very concise and straight to the point without a lot of the garbage anecdotes and BS situations that the other books used that don't work in the real college world but that usualy fill up other books.

In the last chapter, this book showed a map of fiber links in the US and another around the globe. It really caught my eyes. That was what I needed and no other books I have read showed any thing close to that. ISP's do research about unused, over built, fiber cables and use those to increase our capacity due to the FiOS competition. That map gave me a good sense of what the whole world's backbone fiber links look like. Then I came home and googled some key words and, boom, I found companies, such as NEF, providing database services about unused fibers for broadband ISP's.The only comment I have is that the 2 fiber maps in the book were provided by KMI, a company located in Nashua, NH, years ago before the dot-com bust in year 2001. The company went down with the bust. And, I started working in Nashua in the midst of the bust for a company near KMI's address.

Augustine welcomed criticism - that kind of reflection and pushing at the boundaries of experience and ideas that would help refine and shape his own theological development. This book is very much in keeping with that desire and tradition.While it is not yet in the database, the book Augustine & His Critics, edited by Robert Dodaro and George Lawless is now available in an affordable paperback edition. This is a very scholarly and interesting work on Augustine of Hippo, one of the major figures of western Christian theology. All theology in Catholic and Protestant development has in some way responded to or reacted to Augustinian ideas. That makes this book, part of the Routledge Press' Christian Origins series, a particularly worthwhile text, given its emphasis on all sides of the developments out of Augustinian beginnings.There are four main sections to this book:IntroductionPart I: If Plato were alivePart II: The order of lovePart III: We are the timesThe list of contributors to this volume is impressive, including historians, theologians and philosophers from all over Europe and North America, Catholic and Protestant, clergy and academics. For the sake of reference, I shall list the contributors; scholars in the field of church history, particularly Augustinian studies, will recognise many names and appreciate this list:Lewis Ayres, Duke UniversityRobert Crouse, Dalhousie University and University of King's College, HalifaxRobert Dodaro, Patristic Institute, the Augustinianum, RomeHubertus R. Drobner,, Catholic Theological Faculty of PaderbornDaniel W. Hardy, Cambridge University, also the Centre of Theological Inquiry, PrincetonCarol Harrison, University of DurhamMathijs Lamberigts, Catholic University of LeuvenGeorge Lawless, Patristic Institute, The Augustinianum, Rome, and the Pontifical Gregorian University, RomeRobert A. Markus, University of NottinghamE. Ann Matter, University of PennsylvaniaJohn Milbank, University of VirginiaJames Wetzel, Colgate UniversityRowan Williams, University of OxfordFor those of you who follow my reviews in Christian theological studies, you may recognise a few of these names, too. Rowan Williams is a prolific author who is just about to the consecrated the next Archbishop of Canterbury. John Millbank is part of a movement of theology termed Radical Orthodoxy. This is a worthy collection of scholars.IntroductionThis book is to a certain extent a festschrift for Professor Gerald Bonner, Daniel Hardy prepares the dedication of this volume to Bonner in the introduction by discussing his life and work, one that fits admirably the pattern of professional British scholarship. Included with this tribute to Bonner is a select bibliography of Bonner's work, and one can readily see the breadth of Bonner's scholarly product in the seven-page listing. Following this, Drobner sets the stage with an article on trends in Augustinian scholarship over the past decade. The 1600th anniversary of the Confessions, perhaps Augustine's best-known work, occurred during the mid 1980s, and sparked a great deal of scholarly reflection in attempts to glean new insights and new information about the Confessions. Much like the Bible, the Confessions continue to spawn more questions than answers.Further researches into The City of God, new discoveries of hitherto forgotten letters and writings, and further work into areas of biblical exegesis, Christian doctrines and the theology of grace show the vitality of Augustinian scholarship after more than one and a half millennia.ConclusionsIt is obvious that a great many other issues could have been addressed; the introduction speaks to this shortfall, but fortunately there is no shortage of scholars addressing the issues of war, church authority and statecraft, relationships with Jews and those of other religions, and many other pressing issues on which Augustine's thought still impacts the world today.For Augustinian scholars, this book is a necessity. The hardback edition was very expensive, such that libraries would be almost the only purchasers; Routledge has done the average Augustinian scholar a favour by producing an affordable paperback edition (which is still nearly [$$] in most places). For church historians and theologians, this book is a valuable resource, but probably less necessary for the library if your nearby seminary or university library carries the book.For the casual reader, this book will provide an overview of many diverse views on Augustine. However, the book is not for beginners. A good primer on Augustine, together with at least an introductory knowledge of philosophy and the history of the time would be in order for the reader who wishes to tackle this book."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"If you want a beautiful 're-set' to your hectic life, this is a must.

The poetry speaks of Walt Whitman's connection to his fellow man, nature, and to God. It is not to be missed.Leaves of Grass speaks to the turbulent times in which Whitman lived, being the Civil War era. He speaks out against the horror of war and he embraces the spirit of compassion for his comrades. Yet the book is also a reflection on matters relating largely to uplifting themes. His poetry has evoked thoughts about what is of value within my life. Even though it is the product of another era, it speaks to the timeless values of humankind.As the author of a spiritually-themed novel entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I look for books that provide food for my soul. This is one that certainly hit home for me. It is also a book written by a gay man. Since I am gay myself, I appreciated the affirming nature of Whitman who embraced his sexuality with little judgment. This was a remarkable example which reflected his inner peace during a time when being a homosexual was not accepted.Whether or not you are a man, woman, gay, or otherwise, this book will speak to you.

This is a classic and like Whitman, it covers every aspect of life, including his patriotism."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"This thick soft-backed \\"pocket\\" book has 490 pages. It could be called The Complete Whitman. It contains hundreds of poems.I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers. He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist. He truly believed in equality and democracy. He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment.Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish. Whitman was a man ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"While I agree with most of the reviews written here, I must take issue with them somewhat. First, I also believe that Walt Whitman is one of the finest poets that ever lived and certainly the finest when it comes to being a proud American. Although, he comes from a time in America that was like that of Socrates and Plato in the past, a time when the most important thing in life was not work, or success or career, but the exploration of one's inner thoughts. Were we living in a time when such a thing was permitable rather than the constant search for the almighty dollar, we might see more such poets. But he and his era are long gone. The art of the word is certainly Walt's. I ask you to also purchase a dictionary when you purchase this or any of his volumes, not because it is difficult to read, but because Whitman doesn't always use a word for it's main meaning, often burying a meaning of a word or line in the third or fourth meaning, completely changing the meaning of the poem. It is such fun and exactly what I believe Walt Whitman is meant to be, a journey and a trip to the celebration of life. A celebration that also includes a look at the worst that is us and the best that is us. When the reviewer wrote that his work is a study of a narcissist, I have to disagree. Yes, it begins his work with Song of Myself and it is an epic poem. But while he celebrates Walt, he is truly celebrating all of us as amazing creatures in nature. He celebrates every molecule of us, the amazing capabilities, perfumes and evilness of us. He studies us as though someone would study the amazing ability of a tree to grow or a flower to bloom. We are nature and he recognizes that and it is amazing to him. Clearly, he had bravado and self-love, but in the most non-imposing way. We wishes all of us to realize the miracle that is us. To believe that he is only about himself is to miss the point of Walt. Also, it is important to read the various editions of this volume. He wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass continuously throughout his life adding and deleting poems as he saw them. The best way to see his journey is to read the first edition (complete with his swaggering picture), where he was not listed as the author to the final \\"deathbed edition\\" that is truly a masterpiece and you can see what he learns, what he tries to teach you and how deeply you will be moved by him. One last hint - read \\"Song of Myself\\" outloud. It becomes truly a song about life and read outloud can certainly stir your soul."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"What more can be said about Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;? This 19th century work is more than just a poetic masterpiece; it is a pivotal landmark in the history of world literature. Read &quot;Leaves&quot; and you will understand why Whitman is hailed as a poetic ancestor by poets, both male and female, of many different ethnic and national backgrounds. His is truly a universal voice.Whitman published the first edition of &quot;Leaves&quot; in 1855, and continued to revise and expand the book until it had grown into the monumental final version. While the &quot;deathbed&quot; edition is an essential text, I'd like to put in a plug for the much smaller 1855 edition, which has been reprinted with an introduction by Malcolm Cowley. The &quot;deathbed&quot; edition may be too large and intimidating a literary tapestry for Whitman &quot;virgins&quot;; the reprinted 1855 edition may thus be a good way to begin exploring the bounteous poetic talent and vision of this giant.The Cowley-introduced edition also includes Whitman's original prose introduction, which is itself a remarkable piece of literature. While the 1855 &quot;Leaves&quot; is missing vast sections of the deathbed version, it is still a stunning work of art that succeeds as a self-sufficient piece of literature and philosophy. In this &quot;embryonic&quot; version of the soon-to-evolve masterpiece, we already discover Whitman's pungent eroticism, his embrace of paradox, and his playful theological exploration. His language is sensuous, outrageous, tender, and amazing, and is full of compassion for all living beings.Whitman is more than just a great poet; his work is a sort of prophecy for both the secular and multifaith worlds. So read &quot;Leaves&quot; in either the embryonic version or the ultimate version, and embark on an unforgettable poetic journey."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Is this FREE edition abridged?

No rhymes to bore anyone, no meter, simply a transfer of pure mental energy. It took me a while to get into Whitman because I knew him thru a lot of boring teachers who tried to squeeze the very life out of these works and inject them with artificial, completely sanitized \\"meaning\\". This is poetry at its most raw. It does for the written word what Stravinsky did with music. It doesn't need dressing up and it utterly rejects the falsity of good manners. As Whitman joyfully tells us of himself: \\"I am not the least bit civilized!\\" This is wild stuff and it'll kick you sideways if you give it half a chance. Read it and then choose the right moment to sound your own barbaric yawp!"},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"What a lover?! I have fallen in love with Walt Whitman. One such as this writing such passionate things in those times or these...and with such candor. I am so thankful to have read this book. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"If you care for literature at all, even if your interest in it exceeds no further than reading the morning paper, Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass,&quot; is a must read. He is truly one of the greatest poets, revolutionaries, historians, and Americans to ever live. As a poet, Whitman lures his reader in with work exploding with passion and inexhaustable energy. As a revolutionist, he baisically tore up any rule book to writing, stripping away any limitations, and paving the path for further free, independent thinkers. He was unaffraid to rebel against the narrow-mindedness of his time, making himself a leader as one of the very first poets to ever use &quot;free verse,&quot; a technique rellious on its own. In doing so, this great leader was criticized and looked on disapprovingly for his work during much of his life time, and like many other artists who dare to be unique, his true genius was never fully recognized until after his death. As a historian and as an American, Whitman has taken these works of his and has combined them into the nations most patriotic yet brutally honest text book.It is in writing of himself and his own personal experiences that Whitman imbeds the history of this country, both dark and nationalistic. Through his time working as a volunteer nurse to the wounded and dying soldiers during the Civil War, Whitman writes often of the terror of war, making it one of his most recognizable themes throughout much of his work. He also brings us back to a time in history in which those who believed in equal rights for all, including persons of every race a gender, was considered rebellious; for in such beliefs, Whitman took religions that placed severe restrictions over such things as sexuality, and attacked them. The reason I am so confident in recommending this book to any reader, is that you are given a selection of editions to choose from; the edition you choose for yourself, fitted to your familiarity with the poet. I cannot promise that will fall absolutely in love with this book, every person has their own tastes, however, I can promise that if nothing else, you will walk away from this book with appreciation and understanding the value in reading it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass is an exemplary representation of both transcendentalism and realism. Walt Whitman was one of the few writers to bridge the gap between these literary movements and Leaves of Grass was, in essence, his opus. It represented the author himself and was often condemned in Whitman's time for it's blatant descriptions and incorporations of sexuality and homosexuality. However, years later it came to be appreciated for what it is truly worth as an exquisite culmination of people, emotions, and the democratic spirit.Of the many themes covered throughout the 438 pages in the ninth edition of Whitman's masterpiece, symbolism was often used to represent allegory ideas and situations. In \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\" the captain symbolizes Abraham Lincoln and America is ship. In the captain's death, Whitman is alluding to the fact that in the absence of strong leadership guiding the \\"ship,\\" there will be a lack of order and chaos. \\"Song of Myself\\" was, on the other hand, explicit in the ideal it depicted. All fifty-two sections discuss intricacies of semi-specific people or types of people; they come together as one poem and are all part of something larger. Whitman believed not only in the individual being but also in a larger being that everyone and everything was a part of, in other words the oversoul. \\"Song of Myself\\" is truly filler in the gap between the literary movements because it is so thoroughly transcendental in meaning, yet so precise in describing reality.Emerson's was completely justified in praising Walt Whitman's work because it is still today very profound and extremely important in respect American literature overall. Unfortunately a fairly high mentality is required to take in his poetry for all its meaning and worth. Maturity and openness is key because often criticism of Leaves of Grass spurns from prudish and thoroughly conservative readers."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Since there was some confusion in the comments section as to what volumes were or were not truly the \\"First Edition,\\" I though I'd confirm that the Penguin Classics version entitled \\"Leaves of Grass: The First (1855) Edition\\" is in fact the first, slim, volume of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" published in 1855.

Whitman didn't title the poems in the original 1855 edition, though he did in subsequent editions, but a table of contents could show the first line of each poem.

America in the same way that the ancient Greek and Roman poets wrote about their own time and world.

He wrote about life. He wrote about the mundane world, and made it look so beautiful. He admired the human form, and praised the wonderful design of the body. His comments on life in America during the middle of the 19th century really carry a romantic outlook. He was passionate about himself, life, and the world around him.

Up to 1892, he added poems and revised the original twelve poems -- books also published under the same title, \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" In 1892, Whitman published (by then, recognized, not self-published) its final version, the edition he wanted to be thought the definitive \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" This is the commonly called \\"Deathbed Edition.\\" It contains over 300 poems. It does contain the original twelve, though not in their original or other previously-published forms. By then, they'd been many-times revised over the years, and released within other publications between the first and the last. In essence, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" was a nearly 40-year evolving work, under the same title, each edition containing the prior editions' poems further revised, plus additional poems.I wanted to read the original poems. I also wanted to see their final versions, and was curious to see their evolution. I noticed that some books include so many evolutions of the poems/book, they fill at least two volumes. I wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass\\" but I didn't need to become a scholar of it; I wanted to read the book. However, I didn't want only the Deathbed Edition -- I was both curious about the original and wanted to see more than 12 poems.I decided to buy an edition of the book that contains the entire Deathbed Edition, plus a few of the poems in their original form, and some commentary. I believe, after researching, I found the best I could. That would be my recommendation: if this is your first purchase of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" make sure to see some poetry from 1855, some poetry from the Deathbed Edition, and some poetry in between. That is, if what you want to read is the poetry and not own a collector's item or only the \\"definitive edition,\\" as Whitman viewed it (Deathbed). To me, seeing only the final version detracts something from its core -- and after reading the poems and comparing them, I feel this even more -- so in that sense I disagree with Whitman; he chose to make public many books over 40 years, yet wanted only the last to be considered the true version.As a reader, I find it unfortunate that this is a work that evolved over a lifetime under the same title; it renders each addition of poems to the book not books of their own, and also difficult to find on their own. So, for me, the compromise was to choose a book that includes the Deathbed Edition and part of the original, without having to read multiple books, or 1,000 pages, or a scholarly journal (though I would love to see the full original 12 poems).I understand a book will be released soon that includes both the full original (12 poems) and the full Deathbed Editions. I don't have it, so I don't know what else will be included."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I carry a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass with me where ever I go.

I particularly enjoy his frequent usage of listing without commas, which I find livens his excitement for life even more.

Here, Whitman keeps no points in reserve, but spends 52 sections \\"celebrating\\" himself. He feels he, as man, is the great panacea. He suckles at its mercy until it fills not only his subject matter, but influences his technique and his structure as well. His intriguing mind leads the reader along, until disappointment is found in another laborious passage expounding god status and the call to ascend to his level of distorted thinking.

Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the \\"Manifest Destiny\\" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.The poems are diverse and upbeat. The language, for the most part, is clear and easy. Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines. Very few poetic devises are used.One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry. But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.Although a classic, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology. None of his poems are memorable. Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation. Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, \\"Dead Poet's Society\\"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"This stuff is out of the stratosphere, and I don't think that is too strong a statement.

I can testify that there is much still there; although my tastes in poetry have matured quite a bit. I don't find Whitman quite as \\"shocking\\" in light of the social changes that I've seen since my youth.Still, there is a certain nostalgia that makes Whitman eminantly readable. I imagine that if IBM's Watson composed poetry, it would be a lot like this in form and content.

Outward from his home on Brooklyn, Whitman soars out over our great nation, painting a sweeping portrait of mid-nineteenth century America and its diverse inhabitants. Whitman covers a panorama of ideas and themes, from lofty, aloof musings on the nature of man, to piercing depictions of the horrors of war. Gems of wisdom hang from Whitman's web of of verse like dew drops - easy to see but hard to grasp. This is a powerful work, and a never-ending source of beauty. Unfortunately for me, I am not a big fan of free verse, making this work harder for me to enjoy than I had hoped.Which edition do I recommend? That really depends on what you are looking for. If you are just interested in getting a taste of Whitman, I would recommend some of the abridged versions. I don't feel that reading all 700+ pages of Whitman's poetry is necessary for anyone but his biggest fans and students. For a complete version, I found the Modern Library edition acceptable, but nothing spectacular. This work has a multitude of editions, and I would recommend actually holding them in your hand before making a decision on which best suits your needs."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the \\"strongest/purest\\" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 \\"perfect\\" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with \\"the deathbed edition\\" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for.

I am constantly amazed at how well Walt Whitman holds it all together, keeping is hand on one object while amorously praising another. Everything works in perfect cohesion...An unabashed love of self, of nature, of all that is divine and not divine. Leaves of Grass is a truly inspired work...its words are boundless and fluent, rising in an intoxicating crescendo of naked emotion. \\"I am the poet of the Body; and I am the poet of the Soul.&quot; Throughout Leaves of Grass there is an overwhelming theme of unity...unity of man and nature, of man and man, of man and God. Excitable sputterings of ageless wisdom become scattered, but somehow stay anchored to the intricate framework of the book. This sounds contradicting, and it is reminiscent of a line from the book --&quot;Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; (I am large-I contain multitudes.) After reading this book, you will delight in how large Walt Whitman is."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"It's difficult to think of something appropriate to say about a man who spent his life trying to express the panorama of humanity through the lense of his own heart. From a drop of blood to the grandeur of a shipyard or a continent, he takes all readers on a journey wild with raving, raging, sorrow, longing, humbleness and pride. At once he is totally modern and yet rife with history.For readers new to poetry, Walt Whitman is wonderfully accessible. One can pick up Leaves of Grass and virtually start and stop anywhere and pick up something wonderful every time.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"The original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' published in 1855 contained twelve poems only. The subsequent editions beginning in 1856 were to greatly expand the work. Thus I would recommed that anyone who wishes to know the true range of Whitman's work find another selection of his work of which there is a larger share of his great work.Whitman is the poet who Emerson prophesied, the American visionary poet who sang of the complex greatness of the society, and connected his own soul with its expansive facts of life."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"The 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass was the first and the best.When I was young I bought the big deathbed edition, not knowing about the 1855 one. I became a Whitman disciple. Either version is a good place to start, but the 1855 is the best version of the early poems and a fine introduction to W.W.The 1855 version was ignored for quite a long time in Whitman studies, but started recieving critical attention after Malcolm Cowley worked to revive it in the 1950's. It was his version that used to be available, until recently, as a Penguin Classic.So whats the difference between 1855 and the Deathbed one?Throughout his lifetime, Whitman not only expanded LOG, his only book, with gobs of inferior-- and sometimes truly awful-- poems (especially when he was older) but he also revised many of his early poems for later editions-- revising them almost always for the worse.The 1855 edition is realtively short and reflects the diminutive, obscure quality of the original. The poems are full of Whitman's original fire before he tinkered with them.Bloom, the author of the introduction, is in the estimation of many America's best living literary critic. He profoundly knows and adores Walt Whitman.If you have the slightest interest in reading American Poetry,drop whatever you are reading (unless it is perhaps Dickinson or Emerson) and get this book. It's still America's best. Nothing since has been (and nothing will ever be) better. The only American poets after Whitman who mattered were deep readers of LOG: Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens, TS Eliot, John Ashbury. (A Ginsberg, C. Sandberg, and O. Paz resemble him superficially but they are are wonks.)If you are interested later in getting all of Whitman's poems, skip all the in-between editions and get the 'Deathbed' Version, which has many good and important poems like 'When Lilacs Last in The Dooryard Bloomed' and 'As I Ebbed with the Ocean of Life'-- as well as many bad ones, to go with your 1855.The Deathbed Version (Whitman approved it as the final Version of his one book as he lay dying) is probably close to ten times as long as the 1855 edition.But Whitman got it right in 1855."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Giving Walt Whitman only five stars out of five does him an injustice. Walt Whitman is perhaps the finest American poet ever as well as the most quintessentially American poet. His poetry never dates itself. It is as contemporary as if he just wrote it last week. Walt Whitman's poems overflow with life and energy, pulsate with excitement, and contain deep though simply-told truths that rival those of any wise man in history. Much maligned during life and after for the eroticism of his writing, he never let his inhibitions hold back his writing and thus it sparkles with honesty. Walt Whitman was also a great patriot, who loved America in a way modern Americans would do well to emulate. He sought it out on its own terms and recorded what he saw in his poetry. His war poems, written during the American Civil War, are some of the best war poems existing in literature. Whitman knew his subject, having spent much time caring for the wounded soldiers in the hospitals and visiting battlefields. His poems create vivid pictures, richly textured, as real as you read them as if you were seeing the scene yourself. And the dialog he carries on with the reader makes the reader feel that Whitman, if he were still alive, would like nothing more than to sit down and discuss life. He is one of the few poets who manages to establish a rapport with his reader, to anticipate his reader's reactions and talk to each one through the poem. Walt Whitman should be read by any and every literate American. 'Leaves of Grass' will change anyone who dares to read it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"The best way to appreciate Whitman is to read him aloud as you walk down a street or the country side.You'd feel electricity stirring within you and all else would change too.Even the inanimate would seeth with life and vitality amidst the gentle choreography of nature.Thats what happens to me when I read &quot;The Song Of the Open Road&quot;.It's amazing that Whitman could capture the deep inherent things we feel inside,things that stir us inside out and yet find it difficult to express.A timeless clasic that will stir people from generation to generation.Nothing like it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy this book. As soon as you do open it and read O Captain, My Captain. Try to feel the emotions and the meaning behind this poem and finally read the rest of the poems. They are all pure gold.Buy this book and let yourself get caught up in it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman is the father of free verse and his main work, Leaves of Grass, is perhaps one of the greatest works by an American poet ever written.He was born on Long Island and grew up in Brooklyn. Being a native of Brooklyn myself I feel a deep connection to him. When I read his work I am instantly transported into his universe, a universe which is the domain of every man. For Walt Whitman was possibly the greatest democrat who ever lived.In his great poem, Song of Myself, his opening lines are: &quot;I celebrate myself, and what I assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&quot; This is not only good old American horse sense, it's good science. For everything comes forth from that great source of life the sun, and none can be better for it, only different.Walt was a born visionary. And I surmise that he must have had quite a few mystical experiences before he set out to write his great poems. You can really get a sense of his mystical connection when you read poems like When I Heard The Learned Astronomer or even in Song of Myself when he proclaims: &quot;There was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now; and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.&quot; Notice the emphasis on the word now. Mystics through the ages have said that God is beyond time, that God is the eternal presence, and that he exists in a timeless eternity sometimes referred to as the eternal now. I believe that's what Walt Whitman is telling us.I could go on and on singing the praises of Walt Whitman. His work is inexhaustable and profound and wise beyond measure. But there are innumerable books written about him. However, I believe to catch the essence of the man you have to read his poems. And if you let him in he will lead you to yourself and you will see the world through fresh eyes .... and you will see how the perennial grass covers only the outer layer of this our miraculous universe."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"He mixes politics, sociology, and sexuality in a single prose.

I very much would like to read the work as Whitman presented it, without interjections from an editor or some other new person whose voice for me is an interruption.This editor presents this work as a means for writers to find inspiration for their own work, and attempts to guide or at least aid the reader in that project. For someone like me, for whom writing (and reading) is intensely personal, and who prefers to work directly with the text, without intervention, this is just not the right book."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman is one of the most famous, widely read, and influential poets - one of the few who can truly be said to have revolutionized poetry. Free verse's true originator, he broke free of formal shackles way back in 1855, nearly three quarters of a century before it became standard. He proved that great poetry could be written without traditional trappings - and it has never been the same. Many, including me, think it has gone too far in the other direction, but this is not Whitman's fault; his work is undeniably great, and we have in many was long since suffered weak imitations. There is simply no equaling him, much less replacing him; his work is as essential a part of American literature as Mark Twain's. He is indeed the Twain of verse, to be anachronistic - as monumental, all-important, and epoch-forming as Twain was in prose. Technicalities aside, this had almost as much to do with subject matter; Whitman famously self-proclaimed \\"America has a bard at last!\\" - and so it did. He freed American poetry from European heritage, making truly national art that both defined its era and instantly became timeless, speaking to the heart of all that America and Americans stood and stand for. The great poet of democracy, he preached the gospel of westward expansion, celebrated America's natural beauty, extolled its unique history and exciting new status, championed its values, chronicled the Civil War, dramatized the struggle over slavery and other national debates, and generally held forth about the country's unmatched cosmopolitanism in all areas from ethnicity to landscapes. He also somehow managed to write about sexuality with unprecedented openness and vigor, striking a blow against Victorian prudery that would eventually prove fatal and even laying the foundations for non-heterosexual identity. Accomplishing even one of these deeds would have been truly remarkable; Whitman did them all.Yet he published only one poetry book - 1855's Leaves of Grass, which went through several updates through his 1892 death. He not only continuously added poems but extensively revised older ones, sometimes dropping some and moving others. For example, the original and final versions of his masterpiece Song of Myself are substantially different. Many key poems were there from the start, but some of the most famous and best - including the Civil War and associated Abraham Lincoln ones - came later. None of the many poems added late in life were nearly on par with prior masterpieces, but nearly all were worthwhile. Whitman wanted the 1892 edition to supersede the rest, and editors have nearly always complied; it is by far the most popular and widely available and the one that nearly all readers will want.And what a version it is! - hundreds of poems plus several prose prefaces and a prose afterword over nearly five hundred pages. To have so much greatness in one book - especially from one person - is near-unbelievable; the depth of Whitman's achievement simply staggers. Nearly all the poems are worthy, and many are great; quite a few are pure masterpieces. Included are some of the all-time great poems like \\"Song of Myself,\\" \\"I Sing the Body Electric,\\" \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\\" \\"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,\\" \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,\\" \\"By Blue Ontario's Shore,\\" and \\"Passage to India,\\" plus many superb short poems. Anyone even remotely interested in poetry must be familiar with these; there have always been some for whom Whitman just does not click, but even they must be prepared to deal with him, so great is his influence.Great as the 1892 Edition is, it is possible for both hard-cores and casuals to complain. Many of the latter will say that it is simply too imposing - too many poems, too many pages. I certainly would not advise anyone who has read very little or no Whitman to jump right in; it is definitely a lot to take in at once, and the poems are by no means of equal quality or importance. One would be far better off reading a selected edition first, but everyone should come here eventually; indeed, nearly all will want to after the first tantalizing taste. Conversely, diehards have always complained about various aspects, from poems it leaves out to various changes made to included ones. The most important omission in my view is Whitman's original prose introduction, which served as his poetic manifesto. The dedicated will of course want to seek out this and every version of every poem, but their complaints are of interest to very few. The 1892 Edition will satisfy nearly everyone.This is not the most deluxe version; one can find various critical editions with extensive commentary, notes, etc. as well as variorum versions. However, this is one of the most widely available and is very affordable. Taking this into account, it has fairly generous supplemental material: a good basic Introduction, a short glossary and bibliography, and an index of titles and first lines with original and final publication dates. This is the ideal Leaves of Grass for most, but everyone should have it in some form. It is one of very few books truly essential for all. Even those who do not like poetry may well like Whitman, and anyone even remotely interested in American literature, history, or culture must be acquainted Leaves, so thoroughly has it penetrated popular culture and entered the American consciousness. Bookshelves missing this might almost as well be empty."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Choosing the fullest, most complete version of Whitman's text, before the final editing of the deathbed edition, but following the additions made after the Civil War, the Norton Critical is a must have for students of poetry, or literature, and of nature.

He takes what seems like existential ramblings, and turns them into beautiful and self-reflective pieces of art. This is not just poetry, it's literally a thesis on life, a philosophical treasure, a song that celebrates being alive, a picture depicting the cycles of life, an ode to the SOUL - simple thoughts, taken to extraordinary levels by an extraordinary man.Although to some, the poems may be too open-ended, long, tedious or verbose to appear enjoyable - but, when you lay bare the meaning behind Whitman's words, you cannot help but feel empowered, aware, introspective, a believer in life, the lover of a human body, and a worshiper of the human soul.

The 1855 has a small number of pretty consistently excellent poems which are highly original and loosely but definitely connected. Reading it is a very different experience from wading through the bloated, inconsistent final version - there's something Whitmanesque (i.e., at it's best) about the original collection as a unit.

I don't really enjoy his poetry that much. I value it as important. This specific edition (ISBN: 0140421998) is a recreation of the very first edition of Leaves of Grass. Over the years Whitman added poems and changed some of these so you'd be reading the first draft of some things, so to speak. This is the best edition, in my opinion. It shows Whitman at his freshest and I think he second-guessed himself too much with some of the revisions.

It is, alongside the poems of Hart Crane, Rimbaud, Lautreamont, Blake, Lawrence, Emily Dickinson and St John Perse, a totally singular experience. I have never read anything like \\"Song Of Myself\\" and \\"The Sleepers\\", and I am certain that you will love them just as much.I do, however, have certain reservations about Malcolm Cowley's introduction. It is well-intentioned enough, but I would like to issue a few words of warning, as it is certainly a very confused affair, one that will no doubt perplex many Whitman neophytes. For Cowley, the task of Whitman interpretation couldn't be simpler, one need only look towards Indian Vedic philosophy and Buddhist scripture for an all-purpose key. While this certainly seems attractive and convenient- a lazy expedient for phlegmatic types- Cowley himself realizes that it is totally incongruous with certain aspects of Whitman:\\"Most of Whitman's doctrines, though by no means all of them, belong to the mainstream of Indian philosophy. In some respects he went against the stream. Unlike most of the Indian sages, for example, he was not a thoroughgoing idealist. He did not believe that the whole world of the senses, of desires, of birth and death, was only maya, illusion, nor did he hold that it was a sort of purgatory; instead he praised the world as real and joyful. He did not despise the body, but proclaimed that it was as miraculous as the soul.\\"Having meandered into a cul-de-sac, Cowley's attempt at escape is characteristically sloppy:\\"...it must be remembered that Indian philosophy or theology is not such a unified structure as it appears to us from a distance. Whitman might have found Indian sages or gurus and even whole sects that agreed with one or another of his heterodoxies (perhaps excepting his belief in material progress). One is tempted to say that instead of being a Christian heretic, he was an Indian rebel and sectarian. Sometimes he seems to be a Mahayana Buddhist...\\"Pedants are like spiders- they love cocooning themselves in their own contradictions. All of the difficulties that Cowley encounters here stem from his insufferable compulsion to categorise, and hence domesticate, Whitman. I take issue with this preposterous statement:\\"One is tempted to say...\\"No, Mr Cowley, YOU are tempted to make these conclusions, any sober reader is willing to meet Whitman on his own terms, to delight in his incomparable vigor. Further on, we find the following:\\"Since the Indian mystical philosophies are elaborate structures, based on conceptions that have been shaped and defined by centuries of discussion, they help to explain Whitman's ideas at points in the first edition whre he seems at first glance to be vague or self-contradictory. There is, for example, his UNUSUAL combination of realism- sometimes brutal realism- and serene optimism.\\"Unusual, perhaps, if you insist on translating the poem into Vedic terms. It is a little depressing that scholars are so blind to the revelatory miracles of Leaves Of Grass. Here was a poet attempting to forge new forms of expression commensurate to his time, a capacious, all-enveloping style that would sing the songs of democracy. To thank him for his troubles, scholars do the only thing they are capable of, dragging Whitman into the malodorous mire of comparison. This line is redolent of Plato, this one reeks of Vimalakirti, this shadowy section can be illuminated with the torch of the Gita, all of it is regurgitated thought, relics coated in new varnish.What makes matters worse is Cowley's admission that Whitman had read none of the cited works in 1852. Yet, the empirical evidence admits no contestation- the symptoms of Whitman's mystical paroxysm are largely identical with prior examples. \\"Leaves Of Grass\\", we are told, is another manifestation of the 'perennial philosophy'- for all of its ornate embellishments and flourishes, it is, in fact, not very revolutionary at all. Once you master the rudiments of said philosophy, the swelling surge of Whitman's writing is easily navigable. Here we see Cowley defeated by his own epistemological suppositions. Cowley's method, after all, is that of a good Platonist. Poetry, for him, marks a poet's gradual emergence from anamnesia, a rapturous remembrance of eternal truths.In actuality, the introduction is not really about \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" at all. It is about the scholar's will to power, his inexorable urge to subordinate every literary text to precedent. In reducing \\"Song Of Myself\\" to yet another incarnation of Hindu absorption, Cowley does a severe injustice to a great American poem. He would have us believe that \\"Song Of Myself\\" is little better than a journal entry in verse, a haphazard approximation of a subjective mystical experience that has been repeated throughout history. To further substantiate his claim, Cowley compares a stanza in \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" to a Vedic text, noting their thematic and stylistic similarities. Does this not consolidate Whitman's unflinching faith in metempsychosis? In \\"Song Of Myself\\", Whitman effects the transmigration of souls, channelling the voice of the Vedas. The complacence and self-contentment of Cowley is, for this reader at least, truly vulgar.I am not disputing the notion that Whitman has a consistent doctrine beneath all of his creative output, but the system must be sought WITHIN his texts and NOT without. This is the thought that courses throughout all of Whitman's writing, that of pure immanence. To those approaching Whitman for the first time, I hope you have the good sense to treat Cowley's introduction with the bemusement that it deserves."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"One of the greatest pieces of work from the Heritage Press and, arguably, one of the more important reprints of the 20th century.The famous pairing of Rockwell Kent illustrations with Walt Whitman's poetry was first released by Heritage in 1937.

Heritage followed the design preferences of Kent who chose a grass-green linen binding stamped with gold. (The grass emblem also serves as the initials WW.) Typography was executed by William A. Kittredge who collaborated with the illustrator on all aspects of the book's design.The lore surrounding the book states that Kent was so excited about the prospect of illustrating Whitman that he produced 120 pen-and-ink drawings in black and white, 50 more than his contract required.

Walt Whitman opened my eyes and my mind to the posibilities of what could be put onto paper. I had never really liked reading until I opened this book and have not stopped reading since. Walt was a true American. It is incredible that Walt Whitman can make accurate references in his poems to just about every facit of American life. It doesn't take very many pages before you feel as if Walt has been in your shoes, seen things through your eyes, thought the things you have thought and felt the feelings you have felt. I was amazed that he knew technical terms and proper methods for everything from building houses to sail a boat. He really does seem like he has been everywhere and done everything and that made it very easy to open up and accept his ideas for internal discussion.A must read."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Please forgive the presumptuous title of my review. But Walt Whitman was and still is one of the most influential poets I have ever read. He began life on a farm on Long Island, but times got bad and his family uprooted itself and moved to Brooklyn. Brooklyn at that time was a growing city unto itself and trades were needed. Thus Whitman learned the trade of printer. But his soul led him to a higher calling. He became a jounrnalist and wrote poetry. His early efforts did not amount to anything major. Yet sometimes the unimaginable happens in a man's life. A sudden thrust of inspiration strikes one like a bolt of lightning. Then something new and unique is born out of this inception - a new form of poetry - what is today referred to as free verse. Yes, Whitman is the father of the form, and perhaps one of its greatest practitioners. The beat poets who were to follow in his footsteps never really rose to his great height of mystic revelation. I think that's what the other reviewers are talking about when they refer to Whitman's religiosity. For Whitman was the poet of a new world, a new nation, a growing entity that would go on to fulfill an old dream of mankind. That is, the dream of a thoroughly new man, a man who was free from the past, a man who could find his soul was one with the fathomless cosmos. Hence, &quot;Walt Whitman, a cosmos&quot; is a very telling way Whitman has of describing himself to his reader.My favorite poem by Walt Whitman is his &quot;Song of Myself.&quot; It contains the seed of everything he had lived as a human being and every vision he would realize as a mystic of epic proportions. After that, I believe his next great poem was &quot;I Sing The Body Electric.&quot; &quot;Drum Taps&quot; was also quite an interesting addition to &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot; Also, &quot;When Lilacs Last In The Dooryard Bloomed&quot; is Whitman at his poetic best.So it is without any reservation that I am highly recommending &quot;Leaves Of Grass&quot; to all and sundry as a must read. Especially now, in the wake of 9/11 we need to reaffirm what it means to be American, and I know of no better American Visionary to help in this cause then Walt Whitman."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I love poetry and Walt Whitman is one of my all time favorites.

He picked me out as someone many years hence from his perspective, in order to share his world in sufficient detail for me to insert myself into his skin. Through what he put down he came forward more than a hundred years. He is sauntering, noticing the sounds, sights, smells, how he lit up with joy, bittersweetness, fear, self doubt and at times loneliness. He carried me along the river bank at any pace I wanted to go. He would not miss a stride as he adapted to my pace. He taught me how to recline in the summer grass in the cemetery not much more than a stone's throw from where I live, and meditate on his leaf of green summer grass, inviting my soul to enter our picture. I am writing this as a message, an invitation for you, my reader, to get to know Walt Whitman. Don't join the crowd of hate and be put off by the fact that he was gay.I am learning much about making healthy connections, being myself one of the dots I am connecting. I do a little Lazarus raising activity in the cemetery two or three times a week, as I bring back to life my parents, my mother's parents, and her mother's mothers parents.

The photos concentrate more on sociological occurrences and events of city's history than on its architecture. One could only wish bigger format of the book and more photos in it."},{"Title":"Estate Planning For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"I already owned several books about estate planning when I bought Estate Planning For Dummies. The books I had were pretty comprehensive, but they went into far more detail than I really needed, and I wound up not doing as much as I should have since I was more confused than anything trying to digest all the different kinds of trusts, etc. However, this book gets right to the heart of the various topics it covers (and is pretty funny in some places, too!). It doesn't try to be an encyclopedia or a book for estate planning lawyers. But it succeeds at what it does apparently intend to do, which is help the average person like me understand just what I need to concentrate on for my estate planning and what I don't need to worry about. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett wouldn't get much out of reading it (though they might find it entertaining) but for the other 99% of us it's the perfect book to help figure out where we are in estate planning and what else we need to do. I definitely recommend it, it's very easy to read."},{"Title":"Estate Planning For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"I read a lot of Dummies books, and one thing I really like about them is that they are usually well organized. Estate Planning for Dummies is no exception. The authors start with relatively simple concepts like just what is your estate and how to figure out how much it's worth, and then move on to wills. There is lots I didn't know about wills, such as what they discuss about probate. Then they move into trusts, and do a good job since they get right to the heart of the matter and help you figure out whether or not trusts even make sense, depending on your particular situation. I also thought the chapters on estate taxes were well done, too. I knew about the federal estate tax, which doesn't apply to me, but I was unaware of gift taxes, state inheritance taxes, and the estate recovery act.All in all, I now have a much better idea of estate planning and even picked up a few hints to talk to my lawyer about for adjusting my will, which I already had but hadn't updated in a long time. That's another thing the authors do well, which is mention over and over how you need to regularly update your will, your insurance, and everything else that's part of your estate planning."},{"Title":"Estate Planning For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"Just the information alone about the federal estate tax trap on how my life insurance policy was set up, and the estate taxes that would have unnecessarily been owed, made this book the best thing I could have found for my estate planning. I was also getting overwhelmed with all of the ads I'd hear about on the radio and see in the newspaper about living trusts and was nervous that people were just trying to sell me something. After reading this book, I have a much better idea of living trusts and all kinds of other trusts, and feel much more confident deciding what makes sense for me.Another thing I really liked is that the authors very clearly describe what you can and should do yourself, and what you should work on with (as they put it) your estate planning team (lawyer, accountant, etc.).The good news is that after reading this book, I now have a much better idea of what my estate planning needs to include. The bad news is that I also realize how much I still have to do! Fortunately, I have a pretty good roadmap now. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a handle on everything that estate planning includes (which I didn't realize was nearly as much as the authors cover)."},{"Title":"Estate Planning For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"I didn't find this book helpful at all. It just barely skims the surface, and usually concludes with \\"make sure you talk to your accountant/attorney/estate planner.\\" If I intended to talk to all those folks, I wouldn't waste my time reading this book in the first place. Most of what this book covers could be learned by snooping around the web - and in many cases you can learn more that way. It defines the terminology, but even that is often inadequate. I suggest you check this book out from the local library, and then if you find it to be a useful resource go ahead and buy it. I wish I had done that - I don't feel this book has enough information to really qualify as a reference book."},{"Title":"Estate Planning For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"I thought the tone of this book was really patronizing (okay yeah I know it's for 'dummies' but does it need to keep reminding you of that fact constantly?). It's repetitive and ultimately tells you to consult an estate planner anyway--so forget using it to save money to plan your own estate. For a much more directly useful guide to estate planning (with forms you can fill out on a cd-rom), I highly recommend Quicken's Willmaker Plus. You get all the same information as in this book, plus more, and in a much less annoying style. And since it includes the forms for the key documents you need to prepare (e.g., simple will, durable power of attorney, etc.), you may be able to plan your own estate yourself (dummy or not)."},{"Title":"Estate Planning For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"Published back in 2003, with referances of mostly 2002.

Although I see the lawyer point, if I was meeting with a lawyer I would have not wasted 20 dollars and change to read the book.Many who read books like Dummies want to avoid paying thousands of dollars to a lawyer or as I mention , and if you want me to ask my lawyer at least give me very specific checklist of questions.If you could, buy it at a discount or borrow it from the library.

I don't see authentic details like his in today's novels."},{"Title":"Heidegger Through Phenomenology to Thought","review":"I am surprised this book only has two reviews so far. It has been awhile since I read the first half of this book (a few years) so my review will be fairly general (I am currently re-reading some of the later sections for a graduate seminar I am taking on Heidegger which is why I decided to offer my review now despite the fact that I do not have the time to go back and re-read the first half of the book so I apologize for not going into more detail about Richardson's coverage of Being and Time which, as I recall, was quite good).This book is a classic work on Heidegger and one of the most cited. The preface was written by Heidegger himself and it takes in the full scope of Heidegger's project all the way from Being and Time, through the turn, and up until Heidegger's late essays. It is really an indispensable book for anyone looking for a summary of Heidegger's entire project from beginning to end. It has chapters on Being and Time and Heidegger's Kant book (which most books on Heidegger do not devote an entire chapter to despite the fact that it is a very important book) as well as chapters on nearly every important essay Heidegger ever wrote. For breadth of coverage you simply cannot find another book that equals Richardson's at least to my knowledge. If you are working your way through Heidegger's essays this book makes a truly excellent companion.The level of exposition is advanced. This is not an introductory book. I have been studying Heidegger for five years or so and I still have a great deal of difficulty understanding Richardson in places. Richardson does not seem to me to always be the clearest of writers. Perhaps part of that is that the breadth of Richardson's coverage requires that he be succinct rather than offering long explanations when long explanations would be helpful. Whatever the case may be you should be prepared to struggle with this one unless you are already an expert in Heidegger (in which case you have probably already read this book - most likely more than once). But the struggle is worth it.I should point out that Richardson's understanding of Heidegger as divided between Heidegger I (before the turn) and Heidegger II (after the turn) is apparently no longer the preferred way of reading Heidegger. It has become clear since this book was published that there was much more continuity to Heidegger's thought than originally assumed. Despite that minor flaw this book is still a book that every serious student of Heidegger will eventually have to read and come to terms with."},{"Title":"Heidegger Through Phenomenology to Thought","review":"1.

The philosopher himself wrote the introduction to this very complete treatise."},{"Title":"Fire in the Soul: A New Psychology of Spiritual Optimism","review":"Joan Borysenko's book, Fire in the Soul, is a fairly decent book, but on which I feel is redundant of some of her previous books.There's more meditations in this one, and even more psychological background and information. What's more, she tries to expand a bit on the spiritual theme. I like the fact that she mixes psychology with spirituality, and this would be a fine book if she didn't write it already. This book is more or less, Guilt Is The Teacher, Love Is The Lesson, all over again. She restates many stories and themes from that book in this one, and she even touches upon her other book, Minding the Body, Mending the Mind. She goes a bit further in the spiritual vein by exploring the idea of reincarnation, and her own personal experiences with this subject. Besides that, much of this was read before if you have read her other books.If you haven't read her other books, you may very well enjoy this one. However, for me, one of the shining points in this book was the sections titled: Night Lights. This is a section on some ancient sayings and lyrical prose, and I found many of these saying quite inspirational."},{"Title":"Fire in the Soul: A New Psychology of Spiritual Optimism","review":"Friends have been telling me for years that I am entirely too pessimistic. With an eye toward changing, I searched the local bookstore shelves a book that presents a balanced spiritual optimism. FIRE IN THE SOUL by Joan Borysenko, Ph.D seemed to meet my needs exactly. Certainly the concept that every difficult experience provides an opportunity for soul growth is not new to me. But Borysenko has a gift for presenting familiar material in a way that is refreshing and revitalizing as she points to the paths that allow the pain of soul making to lead to deep healing.One of the most profound concepts of FIRE IN THE SOUL is that it is the stories that we tell ourselves that determine how we recover from painful experiences. Pessimism, believing that we have done bad things for bad things to happen, leads to depression and powerlessness. Optimism, accepting that bad things happen to good people but present an opportunity for growth, leads to deep healing. Like one woman in the book states, \\"This is the role I've been given to play. I'm going to do it as consciously and gracefully as I can.\\"Personal anecdotes, case histories, and various spiritual readings combine in a powerful tool for healing in FIRE IN THE SOUL. I began working my way through the book several months ago as I underwent a terrible spiritual crisis. As the fires of transformation have burned their ways through my life, Borysenko's confirmation of spiritual truths that I have long held has provided the lifeline needed to endure and even flourish despite profound challenges. Certainly it is an imperfect book, with an over abundance of references aimed to encourage the reader to buy Borysenko's previous book. And many of the concepts are quite familiar. Yet Borysenko's gift for weaving text that speaks to the soul and inspires transformation makes FIRE IN THE SOUL a powerful spiritual tool. FIRE IN THE SOUL comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fire in the Soul: A New Psychology of Spiritual Optimism","review":"I read this book during the recent hospitalization and subsequent passing of my wife. In the course of dealing with death and dying, I experienced what I would call a spiritual awakening.

I'm in the process of re-reading this book now &amp; again find it helpful and affirming for the spiritual path I now find myself to be on."},{"Title":"Fire in the Soul: A New Psychology of Spiritual Optimism","review":"Joan's extensive spiritual studies pour out on every page, and not once does she promote or condem one type of spiritual choice or another. She offers options, opinions, facts, and reality to lead her readers to answering their own questions of spirituality and artfully guiding them to a higher awareness for themselves and of themselves. I've had the book nearly 7 years, and I still refer to it on occasion. She outdid herself with this one!"},{"Title":"Fire in the Soul: A New Psychology of Spiritual Optimism","review":"Finally, a book that addresses spirituality, without trying to force it into a particular religion! This book stresses that anyone can find optimism in their religion/spirituality. Many powerful stories are relayed, as well as actual techniques for becoming a happier, more accepting person. Every time I started to think the author was getting a little too &quot;out there&quot; for me, she brought me back to something I could relate to. My only criticism of the book is there were a few too many references to her other books, which I found distracting. I think this information could have been left to the reference section"},{"Title":"Fire in the Soul: A New Psychology of Spiritual Optimism","review":"Insightful book which does an excellent job of teaching spiritual optimism.

It is an eye opener showing us how the bad choices we make actually influence us to make future bad choices by setting up a chemical imbalance in our brains. We actually become addicted to the chemical high of that bad choice, thereby, repeating the behavior over and over again. The wonderful thing about this book is it reveals that the misunderstandings we have come to accept with past erroneous choices can be corrected through transpersonal psychology and spiritual awareness of \\"the Self\\". The negative events that shape us from childhood can be challenged and transformed in adulthood through an innate desire to improve one's outlook on life. This is the literal interpretation of that old saying, \\"change your thoughts and change your reality\\" but with instructions you can actually use in your day to day life."},{"Title":"Fire in the Soul: A New Psychology of Spiritual Optimism","review":"One of the best books of it's kind.

Why not use her for the cover then instead of tricking Macaw owners with a hollow promise. The book has charts (p. 18-22) that are filled with opinion represented as fact. The photos indicate that the author is fond of cheap as most of the cages portrayed are offensively so. She even recommends that Birds be allowed to play with Screws and Bolts for toys. And to add insult to the injustice done to Macaws, there on the back cover is .... a Macaw. False advertisement lady! The books only answer to the posed question &quot;Why does my bird do that?&quot; is that it's suppose to.

Young Richard was so daring and gifted, he refused to let his dreams stay dreams. His wealth and sense of entitlement led him to undertake every adventure he could think of...giving airplane rides to a REAL princess! ... living in the most notorious prisons!... sneaking in to the Foreign Legion! Swimming in the fountains at the Taj Mahal!Not only was Halliburton a great explorer, he was also a gifted adventure writer &amp; photographer, bringing true thrills to those of us who travel in our armchairs.I'm so glad to see some of these books have been reprinted. They are an absolute &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who dreams of faraway lands!"},{"Title":"The Flying carpet,","review":"As one who has had the privilege to fly open cockpit biplanes across many far flung places, I understand the difficulty in sharing the view, the emotion and the experience that is unique to this mode of travel. Thus it was with incredible pleasure that I happened upon RIchard Haliburton's &quot;Flying Carpet&quot;, a tale of travel around the globe. Haliburton accomplished this feat with a hired pilot just shortly after the first solo crossing of the Atlantic by Lindbergh. For Haliburton, the biplane was far less a technical wonder of it's time, than a magical key to enter new and unexplored kindoms. What makes his tale so rich in the telling is the lack of technical jargon. Instead Haliburton, ever the Romantic, regales the reader with the human interest side of his adventures. This makes for far more interesting reading than relentless descriptions of how one actually flew the plane from place to place - yet with enough sense of the daring aviation side of the adventure to leave me breathless.Evident at all times as well is Haliburton's Princeton education, and extensive knowlege of ancient history. Although the style, some of the references, and socio/religious commentary may be a bit dated or slanted for some readers, there is much to be learned from this wonderful tale of daring-do."},{"Title":"The Flying carpet,","review":"In his first book, on page one He states his happiness would be to sail off into the sunset.. and that was exactly what he did .He sailed of on a chinese junk (ship) and was never heard from again.

This is my first Amazon book review, on a book I didn't even order from Amazon! I got it from the local library, an original edition bundled with 7 League Boots and Halliburton's biography. Quite frankly, I was swept away by this story. This is the second selection of Halliburton's works I have read, the first was A Glorious Adventure (which I think is the best book title of all time!) The only negative I feel is not discovering this earlier. Why the hell are Halliburton's works so relatively unknown? I am a lifelong literature fan, and I feel at the same time I was being introduced to Mark Twain and Jack London my education should have included Halliburton! I mean, my god, The Flying Carpet as a story is so amazing, so brilliant, the energy of the author just propels one HELLUVA narrative. Reading this book gave me the feeling that I had when I first saw \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". What I mean to say is that you encounter a narrative that goes beyond just a story about travel into this legendary, epic adventure that was just a kick to read. Everything this man wrote you should read, he is just that great. This is one man who lived as full of a life as he possibly could, and died adventuring. He was a hell of a fellow."},{"Title":"The Flying carpet,","review":"The Flying Carpet is an account of Richard Halliburton's astonishing travels in a biplane to some of the world's most exotic places. One of the things which makes this trip - one of his many - so daring is that it was completed during a time when air travel was extremely rare and required no little bravado.On this celestial voyage, he flew a biplane from Paris all the way to the Manila Islands; in between, he landed in Morocco then flew across the Gobi Desert of North Africa where he touched down in Timbuctoo. Next he flew back to Paris then to Switzerland where he tightly circled the peak of the Matterhorn then flew across Europe to Turkey, to Egypt, and to Persia.It was in Tehran, Persia where he met the person who, in my opinion, was the most fascinating character within the pages of The Flying Carpet: a pretty German aviatrix! She introduced herself by saying, \\"I'm a German pilot on my way from Berlin to Australia. I'm alone. My name's Elly Beinhorn.\\" For a young girl to fly from Berlin to Australia in those times was - and is - utterly breathtaking.One of the several dramatic photographs in The Flying Carpet is one of Elly flying her miniature Klemm biplane over the Taj Mahal - and upside down - so she could take the best picture. It is no surprise that Richard fell in love with Elly. But you must read the book to know how that romance turned out!This is the best way to fly round the world without leaving your living room! A stunning page turner!"},{"Title":"The Flying carpet,","review":"Just browsed,bought the book my mother wanted for mother's day, by the best bang for the buck theory.

Frontenac ed)","review":"This is one of the foundational documents about the American experience. It reports on a trip to the American Northwest in the mid-1840s. It is Parkman's first book, written in his mid-twenties. I first read it in my mid-twenties when I was living abroad, and it made me homesick for places in the States I'd not yet been to. Now I'm seventy-one, and it remains just as good. It describes the Indians as a native and potent force, without condescension or romanticism. I suspect much of the Western (cowboy and Indian) movie tradition depends on this one book, with a lot of added malarky. To put it simply: the book is a masterpiece, and a great read."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life (Francis Parkman's works.

Great descriptive writing; blood, guts, wildflowers, horses, sunsets, and the beautiful, healthy forms of our Native Americans while they were still free."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life (Francis Parkman's works. Frontenac ed)","review":"Since getting a Kindle for Christmas, I can't stop reading this sort of thing! Extremely well-written account of life on the plains and mountains among the Dakotas (named \\"Sioux\\" by the French, we learn), mountain men, and an amazing assortment of characters, all described in intricate detail. I've rarely read a book, from any era, which conjures images as vivid as this one does. This account is a \\"can't put it down\\" narrative. Learned a lot of interesting annecdotes. For example, Parkman describes a scene of mourning in which the Indians, in their lamentations, sound like they are saying \\"hallelujah,\\" which apparently, along with other \\"coincidences,\\" lead the founders of the Mormon theology to conceive the \\"absurd notion\\" that the Indians were descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel. This is a fascinating, contemporaneous comment on the then-early Mormon church. Having read other accounts of life on the frontier and of the trappers/mountain men, I was also interested to read of the same locations, incidents and battles, told from different perspectives, but clearly referencing the same events, locations and people. True, verified history, unvarnished as it would be by later historians.If you like this genre, be sure to read William F. Drannan's \\"31 Years on the Plains and in the Mountains.\\" Another barn burner of a narrative filled with harrowing and touching scenes from one end of the country to the other, described by a scout raised as a step-son by Kit Carson."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life (Francis Parkman's works.

You get the sense that the author is not some distant, stuck up historical figure but rather that he is alive and speaking and joking directly with the reader across a 160 some year chasm. A little reading on the Francis Parkman will enhance the experience."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life (Francis Parkman's works. Frontenac ed)","review":"In April 1846 Francis Parkman, a 23 year old Harvard Law graduate from Boston, left Fort Leavenworth (now Kansas) with his \\"friend and relative\\" Quincy Adams Shaw on \\"a tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains\\".They had a small \\"French cart\\" known as a \\"mule killer\\", a team of mules, a tent, and a \\"miscellaneous assortment of boxes and barrels\\", some horses and guides and companions familiar with the territory they would be travelling through.Although he was the scion of a family of wealth and standing, and although he had entered Harvard at 16 and graduated with honors and had already taken the Grand Tour of Europe, he was no tenderfoot. He had always lived from time to time on the 3,000 acres of wilderness his maternal grandfather owned near Medford Massachusetts; and he was at home around the campfire in the woods.This experience would become invaluable. In the next five months Parkman and Shaw and their companions would sit around a hundred campfires as they traveled several thousand miles over the great High Plains using the rivers as their highway. They went up the Platte and crossed what is now Nebraska to North Platte where the river divides into to two extensive river systems - the North Platte which drains most of southeastern Wyoming - and the South Platte which drains the area of Wyoming around Cheyenne and virtually all of northeastern Colorado - Fort Collins, Denver, and Colorado Springs almost south to present day La Junta .Having gone up the North Platte as far as Ft. Laramie Parkman left the party and lived with the Ogallala Sioux for more than six weeks, traveling with them to the Black Hills of South Dakota and thence back to Ft. Laramie from whence the party went down the South Platte as far as La Junta where they met the Arkansas River flowing east and north and up which they traveled back to Ft. Leavenworth and then down the Missouri and the Mississippi to St. Louis; and then it was overland back to Boston where they arrived on or about the first of October 1946. It turned out to be much more than a trip of \\"curiosity and amusement\\". They were lucky to get back alive and unharmed. (There were hostile Indians. There were surly and dangerous travelers. They were thrown from their horses more than once. Parkman was so sick part of time he could hardly sit his horse.)Much more than \\"amusement\\" would meet the on the trip. They would meet the first immigrants to Oregon along the real Oregon Trail. (Not impressive, he writes.) They would meet the wagons of the Mormons westering from Nauvoo. (They were okay.) The would meet Mountain Men, trappers, mule skinners, soldiers (a \\"motley lot\\") on their way with General Kearny to the War with Mexico which had just been declared. The would meet factors, frontier storekeepers in Ft. Laramie and Bent's Fort east of La Junta on the Arkansas. And above Parkman would meet and live with the Indians - the Ogallala Sioux. He would live with them for more than six weeks, traveling, camping and hunting the buffalo; and his written descriptions would preserve for posterity their life, customs and appearance before they were affected by the white man's ways and alcohol and eventually penned up on their many Reservations This is not to say that they appeared to him as \\"noble savages\\". Not at all. He had little use for them and would write\\"For the most part a civilized white man can discover very few points of sympathy between his own nature and that of an Indian. With every disposition to do justice in their good qualities, he must be conscious that an impassable gulf goes between him and his red brethren Nay, so alien to himself do they appear that, after breathing the air of the prairie for a few months or weeks, he begins to look upon them as a troublesome and dangerous species of wild beast.\\"When he got back to Boston in early October 1846 he turned to his extensive journals and, with his memory refreshed, wrote up his experiences. The results were published the next year (1847) under the name \\"The Oregon Trail\\" and these experiences are now available to us with the same sense of \\"being there\\" and the same freshness that must have existed when he first put pen to paper 165 years ago. The book is a masterful verbal documentary on the Great Plains, their weather - for example the smell and quiet just before the sky blackens and the wind picks up and the thunderstorm breaks with indescribable violence, It's about the Indians and the way they lived, about the flowers in springtime on the Great Prairie, about the oppressive heat of summer, the flies and the mosquitoes, about the antelope and the prairie dog villages, the rivers, the hills and far away buttes, the long horizons, the big sky and the sense of great space. Had Ken Burns, the great documentary filmmaker, lived at that time we would see in his filmed documentary exactly the same things that Parkman saw and described so accurately in his book. Then there is Parkman's description of the buffalo hunt: Remember the great scenes of the buffalo hunt in Dances With Wolves? (It won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1990.) They are right out of Parkman's Chapter on The Buffalo Hunt. Same for the movie's scenes of the Sioux Camp where Lt Dunbar first meets the Sioux You don't have to read the book to see the world of 165 years ago. You can go to the movie. But the book covers more ground and is the more preferable.If I were to find any fault or faults with the book it would first be the fact that there is certain \\"sameness\\" in its many chapters. The next one is often much like the one you just read. So you can skip some. But, then it all comes with the territory. That's what the Great Prairie is - a lot of \\"sameness\\" for a thousand miles. Next I would fault the title. It's not about The Oregon Trail. The trail is at best a minor part of the book. The book is truly the account of a journey. It's really about how things were on the Great Plains in 1846.Parkman went on to become one of the most prominent American historians of the 19th century, writing particularly about the French in America. However, in this book and without any authorial or scrivener's pretense Parkman has written a beautiful readable even lyrical - but accurate - account of how things were there and then. You don't have to read it in a hurry. Take your time. Go to your computer and dial up a map and follow where they are - or were - with their cart and mules. Think about it. Look up some pictures. This is not a book for speed or controversy. It is not a book about problems or politics. It is a beautifully written book about our America, about our history, our people, our experience and about travel and our country and it sets the standard by which all other similar books should be compared. It is an American Elegy"},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life (Francis Parkman's works.

His adventures were quite amazing, but the best thing about the book is that all his adventures are true.

My family were pioneers who came to Oregon later, leaving Ohio but going to Colorado to mine. When the gold ran out, they started to Oregon in 1870. My ggg grandmother died on the trail and is buried in an unknown grave in Colorado. I loved marching along with these folks as the maps and renditions take the reader mile after mile on their weary way.Although they did leave out a bit about coming down the snake river and into Baker valley, skipping over that to reach the next valley which is La Grande and the Grand Ronde valley. There is a beautiful historical center at Baker which is all about the history of the Oregon Trail.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the migration. All school children should read it.

Whichever stories you believe are missing are either not short stories or mis-attributed to him. There are other editions of Maupassant's \\"complete\\" stories but these other editions often include dozens, if not over a hundred stories which were written by other people. Artine Artinian, the editor of the correct (this) edition is an excellent Maupassant scholar. I'm left with wondering what exactly was a waste of money - that you didn't care for the writing or that you feel the book was incomplete? And why buy it if you felt you could get them online for free?If you enjoy short stories and have not read Maupassant, shame on you. Maupassant, along with Hemingway, is the father of the short story and defines exactly what a short story ought to be. The richness and economy of his writing speaks even through the translation.

Most of them just tell about how she goes into the woods and meets the wolf and all, but this talked about how she got her red hood and how she went into town and all. I kind of liked the extra details because it helped me to visualize the story better in my head, but it just made the story longer."},{"Title":"Little Red Riding Hood (A Hardee's little little golden book)","review":"ISBN 0307001342 - With so many re-tellings of this wonderful, classic story, I thought it best to try to keep the editions straight. This edition is retold by Mabel Watts, illustrated by Joe Ewers. It's hard to imagine anyone going wrong with Little Red Riding Hood; Watts cleaned up the violence in the original, a negative for fans of the classic tale, but maybe a positive for parents who worry about these things. Ewers' illustrations are nice, they vaguely remind me of the Saturday morning cartoons of the 1970s.Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother isn't feeling well, so she and her mother pack a basket of goodies that Little Red Riding Hood will take to her. Cautioned to stay on the path and go directly to Grandmother's without talking to strangers, Little Red Riding Hood tries to do as she's told. The wolf, however, distracts her and convinces her to pick flowers for Grandmother, giving him time to get to Grandmother's house first. Grandmother is scared off by his arrival - will help arrive before Little Red Riding Hood is eaten up by the wolf posing as Grandmother?I'm a fan of the original tale. I know there are parents who, wanting to keep their child from ever reading, seeing or hearing anything scary, have influenced storytellers to re-write them, and that's great - for them. If you're one of them, this is a better edition for you. Grandmother, Little Red Riding Hood and even the wolf, all go unharmed. It's just not quite the same. To nitpick, I'm not overly familiar with life in a cottage in the woods, but I did find Little Red Riding Hood's addition of colored jelly beans to the basket for her grandmother a bit odd. They don't seem to be the sort of thing one would pick in the wild, and I think the stores are severely limited in the woods. An all right re-telling, geared toward over-protective parents, but not the story you remember.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Sing, Stranger: A Century of American Yiddish Poetry-A Historical Anthology","review":"Thank you, Harshav and Harshav, for your work!

This is an author that deserves awards, accolades, and a place on every bookshelf in America. He's wonderful. A midwesterner to the core, a lover of the great outdoors and literature, a man's man, a dying breed. I recommend Jerry Dennis to everyone. He has a wonderful sense of drama, of place, of struggle and character, of peace and discovery. He's concise. He's observant. He's direct. I wish he was single. His book on the Great Lakes is an absolute favorite (the Great Lakes are one of my big passions) but this little gem on fishing made even this die hard city girl want to take up rod and reel. Read Jerry Dennis. Tell your friends to read Jerry Dennis. I wish I could read him again for the first time. Five glorious stars."},{"Title":"A Place on the Water: An Angler's Reflections on Home","review":"Jerry Dennis' A PLACE ON THE WATER is a quiet treasure of memories early and late. The writing is spare and pristine. Good essay requires truth and no rush to judgment, a healthy restraint from embellishment and, above all, brevity. Dennis succeeds on all fronts. Like a diamond among rubies, the piece entitled \\"Brook Trout in Traver Country\\" stands out as an enduring portrayal of time, place, and one truly unforgettable character. Though from Illinois, I have fished and paddled the waters of Michigan for over twenty years now, and as Jerry Dennis suggests, it would take more than one puny life to really know any one piece of it. Think of this book as an elegant, almost hushed, primer on that road.

Yes, this is an anthology with a definite progressive perspective (though there are some pieces by people who do not share that view). But Stevenson conveniently forgets to mention that much of the writing was done by American veterans of the Viet Nam war--writers, poets, journalists, university professors, working people, fathers and sons. There is also writing by non-veterans, including peace movement activists, authors, artists, scholars, ranchers, mothers, sisters, daughters, sons, fathers, brothers, and friends. Most of the writers came of age in the 1960s, and many of the veterans published in this book joined the peace movement after they returned from the war in Viet Nam.The book is an antidote to the ever-more-popular fiction that the peace movement practiced cruelty to veterans. Vets, in fact, comprised a very active, visible and vocal part of the peace movement, particularly through the work of Vietnam Vets Against the War and Veterans for Peace. These are voices that have been silenced in this country since the Reagan era when the Republicans succeeded in revising history and erasing memory, turning an American shame into a \\"noble effort.\\" You will find Viet Nam vets in the leadership of peace efforts to this very day. Reviewers like Dan Stevenson continue to silence their voices with ridicule; whether we listen or not, these veterans will continue working to make the world a better place for all of us.The size and variety of progressive perspectives in NOBODY GETS OFF THE BUS reflects the diverse make-up of the community of Americans seriously reflecting on the war. Though Stevenson emphasizes the poetry published in the text, most of the book is made up of a combination of essays, fiction, memoir, and scholarly (but quite readable) articles by quite a few established writers and academics. And don't forget that many of these academics are themselves Viet Nam veterans--giving them an authenticity that conservative critics attempt to obscure by always talking about \\"academics\\" and \\"veterans\\" as if one had to be one or the other.Is there bad poetry in NOBODY GETS OFF THE BUS? I don't think so (although any reviewer can make virtually any poem look bad by taking a line or two out of context and surrounding it with ridicule). As a long-time editor of poetry written by Viet Nam veterans, I can tell you that the left doesn't have an armlock on lamentably bad verse. My reject pile contained so many examples of barely literate and lachrymose patriotic homages to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC that I often contemplated publishing them all under one cover and establishing a new genre: awful poems about the Wall. Doubtless, given its scope, there is enough material in NOBODY GETS OFF THE BUS to both please and displease any reader.Those who wish to browse NOBODY GETS OFF THE BUS before buying a copy can find the bulk of it online at the Sixties Project web site at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities. (Can't put the URL in a review, but you can find it with virtually any search engine.)"},{"Title":"Nobody Gets Off the Bus: Viet Nam Generation Big Book","review":"There are a few good things in this otherwise bloated compendium of lefty gibberish-poetry by the always reliable W.D. Ehrhart; an article by John Baky that explores-and debunks-some of the more familiar legends of the Vietnam war; a thoughtful and witty examination of the Green Berets by Alan Farrell; several articles about Khe Sanh and its aftermath by Peter Brush; and a book review of Wayne Karlin's overlooked gem \\"Us\\".That's about it, and since this monstrosity stretches to over four hundred pages of very small type, it's not much. For the most part it's the same, tired marriage of left-over 60's radicalism (\\"Political Prisoner Alan Berkman is free at last!\\") and Vietnam veteran as victim and dupe, with many, many bad poems and short stories thrown in for leavening. There are so many bad poems that it's impossible to give all of them their just due, so here's special mention to the worst of the lot-\\"Anthem\\", an untentionally laugh out loud funny ode to the virtues of remaining seated while the Star Spangled Banner is played in public, by \\"Antler\\", and \\"Burning the Flag\\", by Jeff Poniewaz, which contains this immortal line-\\"Better we burn the dollar & yen-the flags that command our true allegiance-and declare world-wide Debt Amnesty so we can stop killing the Earth to pay our debts and start anew with an economy in harmony with the Ecology\\". Sheer music. The text informs us that Antler and Jeff are friends.There are several articles about \\"learning\\" from the Winter Soldier Investigation, that Jane Fonda and Mark Lane concoction held in a Howard Johnson's motel in Detroit in 1970, and Bertrand Russell's Oslo War Crimes Tribunal.

White's The Sword in the Stone is a story that must be read. Nowhere in the movie do you get delicious bits like:\\"The cottage had a brass plate screwed on the garden gate. It said: Madame Mim, B.A. (Dom-Daniel) Pianoforte, Needlework, Necromancy.\\"Or how about the casual mention of Merlin in running shorts ... Merlin knitting his beard into the nightcap he's making ... Merlin's dishes washing themselves up, shouting, \\"Hey! Let's dunk the tea pot!\\"Or a falcon who's been mewed up too long and cannot keep from quoting all the bloody passages of Macbeth? (My personal favorite bit of deliciousness, since I have a similar character in my story.)Most people pick up the story of King Arthur from the day in the churchyard, when young Art pulls the sword from the stone and is hailed by all of Merry Old England as their sovereign lord. T.H. White, however, looks back to the innocent childhood of England's once and future king, the days when outlaws like Robin Wood (read: Hood) roamed the Forest Sauvage and knights spent their entire lives questing mysterious beasts.While certain passages did drag on and I felt like someone should remind White that young readers aren't interested in philosophy, and he harped about evolution more than once, this would make a wonderful read-aloud ... Ay say, the dialogue is absolutely lovely, what?"},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"This is my first T.H. White book, and WOW I love it! The story was written in the 1930s, published in 1938. Around the time of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkein. I would say this book is unique and outstanding of the Narnia and The Lord of the Rings series. It is not comparable to any other books I've read. The Disney motion picture version of the book does not give away anything. I have the DVD and I find every detail of the plot is surprising. It is a great read for both children and the adults. I strongly recommanded it for readers of all age."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"I didn't really want to read this book at first, because it was for an English class of mine. When I started reading it I was pleasently suprised! I ended up enjoyng this book very much! I would recomend reading it to anyone looking for a humorous adventure story.My favorite character would have to to Merlin. Merlin is a good wizard. He plays a huge roll in this book. Merlin made this book funny and much more interesting. Why wouldn't T.H White put him in more of the story? My only complaint of this book would have to be Merlin not being even more invloved and humorous!This story has evry interesting character development also. Kay, Wart's best friend, future knight, and Sir Ecotr's son, is the character I enjoyed watching develop the most. Kay came across to me as a snob at the start of the book. Later in the book he shows his true colors when he crys to Wart. At the end I didn't like him again when he lied about pulling the sword from the stone, but then when he confessed that it truely was Wart I liked him again.I really enjolyed this book. It turned an unwanted English project into something I can look back and love. I would definately recomend this book. Thank you T.H White for the amazing read!"},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The book was perfect as if it had never been used.The shipment was fast.I recommande this produce ;) ."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"In a discussion with a friend about fantasy books, he recommended The Sword in the Stone by T.H. White. He said it was a classic piece of fantasy and that I needed to read it. Obviously, I had heard the title before, but aside from that, I knew basically nothing about the book. I was hoping to read something great - and in White's defense, maybe the book is great, but it's not at all what I was expecting and because of that I was sorely disappointed. T.H. White's \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" is a children's book. Despite that, it's a tough read both because it takes place in a medieval time period, and because the book itself was written (I'm assuming based on its first copyright date) back in 1939. For my tastes, the book is slow, uninteresting, and a chore to read. I suspect that this exact telling of the story is the basis for Disney's children's movie by the same title.If you're looking for a child's story and don't mind the antiquated language, then you may enjoy the book. If you're a fan of current fantasy and are looking for something to read, I don't know that I could recommend the book."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"T. H. White wrote The Sword in the Stone. He was one of President Kennedy's best and brightest. The Sword in the Stone is a fantasy novel, intended for adults, mostly due to the difficult working. It's purpose is to tell a story and to entertain. The title is self explanatory for anyone who has heard Arthurian legends before, but if not, it becomes obvious towards the end of the book.The Sword in the Stone tells the story of a young boy called the Wart who's adventures with the wizard Merlyn helped prepare him for his last adventure as the Wart and his first as Arthur. Wart is raised on a manor with his adopted father Sir Ector and stepbrother Kay. Kay gains an increasingly important role in the end. He and Wart slowly grow apart to the extent that he serves as one of the few antagonists. The language used in the book is one of the few challenges that I had with the book. I had a hard time with the way the book switched back and forth from Modern English to Old English. One of the main arguments in the book is \\"Might versus Right, or Strength vs. Justice.\\"I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historic fiction or fantasy. Despite the confusing grammar, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author did a great job of creating three dimensional characters and a complex but not confusing plot. I especially enjoyed how the author could shift from a serious dialogue between William Twyti and Robin Wood to a comical scene with Sir Grummore and King Pellinore."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"If you like books about King Arthur and all his adventures then you'll like this book. It is filled with magic and strange creatures a plenty. It is not just fun for children, but the whole family!

Having not read a children's classic in awhile, I had to get used to the vernacular all over again. Once I was able to follow it, the stories unfolded and I couldn't get enough. Mr. White truly knows how to get you to step into another world with ease. He takes all different kinds of characters and historical people to make this story work. I was truly pleased.The Young Wart, Arthur, was shy at first. He knew what his station in life would always be due to the fact that he didn't know who his parents were. Sir Ector was kind enough to take him under his wing. Yet there were certain things Wart knew he'd never do. Or so he thought. Merlyn was a fantastic character! I loved seeing a new take on Merlyn. The other characters of King Pelinore, Sir Ector, Madam Mim and others brought the cast to a completion. The range of their personalities were fun to watch unfold.The adventures were so much more fun than the Disney movie. I was truly impressed with how much was followed yet the things that were left out were my favorites. The beginning dragged for me but by the end, I was sad to see it end. This was a fun romp in period fiction and I am curious to see what else was written by this author. I wouldn't read this to anyone under the age of 10 only since there is some coarse language used. There were times I was surprised I didn't burst out into song with all the bits of songs that were part of the story!"},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is about a young boy called the Wart and all the interesting things he learns. His tutor, a magician named Merlyn, changes the Wart into many different animals. While he is an animal he learns there are many ways to look at life. He realizes life beyond castle walls is different and harder than most would think. The Wart becomes a well-educated young man who is very gentle but not afraid to stand up for what he believes. The book was very enjoyable because it always kept me guessing and had a good plot. The book kept me interested becasue the chapters never started slow and climaxed toward the end; for the most part the entire chapter was fun to read. I wanted to keep reading because the plot was never dull. In one chapter the Wart is on an adventure with Robin Wood; then in the next chapter he is watching an exciting jousting match. If you like a strong plot and exciting chapters, you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; by: T.H White, is about a young boy named wart along with many friends going on long journeys during the Middle Ages, through out royal land and castles, getting lost in the woods, and meeting strange mystical people along with meeting Merlin the magical magician. I really liked the book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; because I found it very exiting and extremely interesting because once you get into it, it's very hard to put the book down. It's a book for all people because it has action, science/fiction, and comedy. Even though it is a short 288 page book, there is still a lot of action and there is definitely a lot of Medieval people, events, etc. The best part of reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is that there is a lot of things to learn about and there is a lot of interesting parts in the book. If you really like a book with character and exiting action, comedy, and interesting facts, you should read &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;. I really think that the author &quot;T.H White&quot; did a very well job with keeping myself and everybody interested in the book and making it an extremely lovable book. In conclusion, I think &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is one of the best Middle Ages books to read, it's an educational book, and especially, I think that more people should read it and get other books written by T.H White, because he writes the best medieval books."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a fantastic book to read for several reasons.The first reason is the title, which sounds like an exciting adventure story. As soon as I looked at the cover with a magician and a young boy on it, I knew it wouild be something I would be interested in. The short summary on the inside of the cover told me enough about the story to know that I would read this from end to end. The other thind the summary told me was that the book was about King Arthur, who I've always wanted to read about. I picked out the book and immediately decided that this was something I would read.The main character is young Arthur. He is a young boy who is typical of young people in his time. He is brave, thoughful of others, and very respectful to his elders. When his tutor, the Magician Merlyn, begins his education, Arthur's curiosity and talent for learning become apparent. Even so, Arthur and his brother, Kay, run and play as normal kids would. Not too much is made of the fact that Arthur is adopted.It would be fair to say that Arthur is shown to be somebody who will grow into greatness but will be perfectly normal getting there.I really like this book because it is a fast-moving story with a great deal of adventure and magic. Arthur's adventures put him into all kinds of circumstances and problems. In fact, each adventure is a unique hapenning. The way the author weaves adventure and magic into his tales makes the book hard to put down. I especially liked the time when Merlyn turned Arthur into a bird. When Arthur was locked in a box and almost cooked by a witch, I enjoyed how Arthur used a goat as a messenger. This kind of descriptive writing made me feel like I was inside the book. I wouild have to say that this book is an exciting, magical adventure story, which I enjoy greatly."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"We got this book for my son's assigned summer reading from his school.

And, my son would recommend the book to others for a good read."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"I'm only in the middle of the book, but it is fantasic! My school teacher is reading the same book and can't put it down. She even reads in the middle of class! This is an amazing book to read and I am so wanting to read more and more every day. It's wonderful and an adventure with every new page. If you are most enterested in King Arthur then read it. It will tell you more then enough info about King Arthur. It is one of T.H.White's most fantasic and fanous story. It was amazing!"},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"Young Arthur, (known to everyone else as &quot;Wart&quot;,) learns from his tutor, Merlin, stuff that he could only dream about before, coming to life before his eyes. Like watching Jousts, turning in to fish, birds, and other animals, and going on adventures with Robin Wood,(commonly known as Robin Hood.) but makes mistakes, gets injured, and learns from them. And all of this only helps in his future life, and his quest, which is his destiny. I rated the sword in the stone a 5 because It was a extremely good book, and the only things that might affect my judgment is the fact that sometimes they use old English. It is sometimes hard to understand because some of the wording is a little old, and, and stuff like that. But T.H. White is able to incorporate a story of king Arthur, and a story full of distinct, funny and odd people, (basically, a comedy,) in to one great book. Another reason that I think that it is a good book because T.H.White gets really in depth throughout the whole book, he can describe every detail, in other words, he can really &quot;Paint a perfect picture.&quot; So all in all I say that if you are interested in King Arthur at all, you should definitely read this book! It does not matter if you are twelve or twenty-one, thirty or seventy, you will truly enjoy The Sword in The Stone. It is definitely a top ten on my list! If you like The Sword in the stone as much as I do, then I recommend reading The Once and Future King, also by T.H.White."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"I must admit, at first I wasn't keen on the idea of reading a novel based on Arthurian legend for English. Despite my love of the Disney cartoon, I felt certain that the book would be dull and slow-moving, with little or no comic relief, and cardboard characters. I was sure that knights and swordplay would hold no interest for me. Yet, as soon as I picked up The Sword in the Stone by T.H. White, I changed my mind. This well-written book was engrossing, lively, and humorous, three qualities which, based on my preconceived notions of the book, I never would have expected a novel on Arthurian legend to have.I grew up watching Walt Disney's cartoon version of the book, and it was always one of my favorites. But can you trust a Disney cartoon to be the same as the book? Because they always change the story so that it will appeal to younger audiences, it is difficult for Disney to stay accurate. To my surprse, the movie is actually rather true to the book.T.H. White's vivid characters really bring this fabulous story to life with lovable, animated personalities. As you follow Arthur (affectionately nicknamed &quot;Wart&quot;)on a series of wonderful, wild events under the tutelage of Merlyn, you grow to enjoy spending time with this eager character who is anxious to learn and is always up for an adventure. Merlyn, the slightly eccentric old magician who lives life backwards, and who has come to the Castle Savauge to tutor Arthur and Kay, is lovely, as well. Then there is the crazy, fun-loving King Pellinore, who spends his life on the trail of the Questin' Beast. With his many excellent portrayals. T.H. White makes you feel as though you've made some new friends.The unique plot of this book is one of the things that keeps you constantly wrapped up in it. From becoming a fish, to rescuing friends with Robin Wood (NOT Hood) and Maid Marian, to going on a possibly deadly boar hunt with the whole village, Arthur does it all. You are sure to be enthralled as Arthur sees what it's like to be an ant, an owl, and many other creatures. The fun, frolicking plot is like no other, so it always keeps you interested and waiting for more. And, of course, there is always the happy ending, which I won't give away for those of you who do not already know what it is. The plot is different in that it has several small dilemmas, rather than one major obstacle for Arthur to overcome. So, if you are looking for a suspenseful book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is not the book for you. But if you are looking for a comical book with a playful, whimsical plot, energetic, delightful characters, and an all-in-all happy mood, The Sword in the Stone is your book of choice."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"It has been many years since I read the works of T.H.

I found this edition for two dollars (and in very good condition), and decided to purchase it so that I could share it with my young daughter. The book brought back fond memories of summers spent at my grandparents' home, and of reading the numerous works of children's literature in their home library.The Sword and the Stone is a wonderful work of fantasy, of Arthur's childhood and tutelage under the great wizard, Merlyn. It is full of fun and adventurous exploits, giving readers and anyone interested in Arthur a fantastical glimpse into Arthur's life during childhood. The Philomel edition is especially recommended for the beautiful, detailed, full color illustrations by artist Dennis Nolan. There are seventeen full-page color illustrations which enhance one's reading pleasure. A captivating read indeed."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read.

He met a wizard who became his tutor but not any ordinary tutor. This tutor, Merlyn, turned The Wart into different animals and what-not to give Wart the greatest adventure of his life. I really liked this book because it was really exciting and kept you on your toes. The adventures that Wart was faced with were exciting, fun, and entertaining. One of the adventures that I liked the most was the first one The Wart was sent on. He was turned into a fish and seemed so vulnerable then because he needed to learn how to swim and to get used to the water. It was exciting! Even when the book started to get a little bleak the author would always come back with a new, fun adventure to keep you on your toes. There was only one point that I didn't like. The author would spend one out of about every five chapters just describing the scenery and the place they were in. That got rather monotonous to read.I would recommend this book to a skilled reader but no one under the age of ten.

We hold a lot of power within us, but not enough to fight our fates. Fascinating theories and themes such as these are presented and strongly portrayed in T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone. The inexorable power of destiny is beautifully illustrated in this book, which takes us through many adventures of the boyhood of legendary King Arthur.Readers gain a respect for young King Arthur (identified in this story as \\"the Wart\\") from the very start. Though the Wart is treated somewhat unkindly by his guardians, Sir Ector and Kay, he does what he knows is right in all situations. These situations include the first main incident of the story, in which the Wart bravely stays a whole night alone in a dark forest, simply to retrieve a servant's loose bird. He also keeps his head and his priorities straight despite his older brother Kay's naggings and his envy for Kay's station in society. The Wart is somewhat confused and unsure of his purpose in life, but soon his main guardian Sir Ector hires a wizard named Merlyn to tutor and educate the boy. Thus marks the beginning of the future king's great adventures and learning experiences. Putting to use his magical powers, the wizard educates the Wart by transforming him into several different creatures so that the boy can see life from various points of view. One day, as Arthur is trying to find a sword for Kay to use in a jousting match, he comes across a sword in a stone (which is the title's derivation). He struggles to pull it out for quite some time, then senses that something strange and unusual is in the air around him, something magical, and the sword easily slips out. His family and all the townspeople are shocked and somewhat dismayed when they hear the news, but nevertheless the meek, submissive, experienced Arthur inherits the throne. The ending ties up many loose ends and brings the whole story together in one great, triumphant, fulfilling close.Strange and contradicting as it may seem, I both dislike and love this detailed book. I dislike it because I feel that many parts are too long and drawn-out, especially descriptions of places and the Wart's out-of-body experiences. I love the story because it is very creative and poses thought-provoking theories and pieces of advice about life. I enjoy the humorous parts of this book, which are sporadically sprinkled within both casual and serious situations. I think that the young king's experiences are relevant and can be beneficial to many who seek different viewpoints of life.I personally recommend The Sword in the Stone to people who read at about the junior-high or high-school level, roughly age twelve and up, who are interested in Arthurian legend. I especially recommend it to males, as I feel that it is generally a male-directed book. I state this because there are very few female characters involved in the story, and those are very minor (yet not inferior) characters. It is possible that this is due to the fact that the author himself is a male. Nonetheless, The Sword in the Stone contains many important themes which will be beneficial to all types of people who choose to read the book."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times.

Kay and the wart are somewhat good friends and live sometime during the 1300-1500's. One day the wart ventures into the woods nearby looking for his friends lost hawk and finds a friendly wizard named Merlyn. Meryln comes back to the manor and teaches the wart about magic and turns him into many different animals to talk to ohters. However, Kay isn't being taught with the wart and becomes jelous. The wart asks Merlyn to change both of them for at least one time, but he can't. So they go on their own adventure with Robin Wood rescuing several lost members of the group of forest bandits. in a castle the two boys find that the queen owning the castle is evil and captured their friends. They get caught in the castle by a giant but get saved by Merlyn. When the boys got to the manor Sir Ector, Kays father tells them that the King has died and the person to pull the sword excalibur from its anvil will be king. They journy to Central England and the two boys try to pull out the sword alone. The wart pulls out the sword when Kay isn't looking and Kay takes the credit. Sir Ector isn't convinced and has both boys try again, and the Wart pulls it out and becomes king.My opinionon on this book is that this a good book overall, I especially like the twists it made to the more commonly known legend and the characters in the book. However, the people repeat words or speak in wierd sentences and sometimes doesn't make sense, but it is still a good book .-Carlo Gangan"},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Swrod in the Stone is the first in a mini-series, and by far the best. The others are really flat in comparison.I just love this book, it describes all the magic of being young and exploring the fields and rivers around your home, and talks of fights between rather nasty witches and pleasant wizards. The writing is so good I felt like I was actually lying in the grass on a summery day watching people joust! Young Wart gets up to some crazy adventures, and the book has a nice happy ending. The author certainly introduces some interesting characters, and overall, I found it a joy to read, and one of the few books I reread regularly."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"T.H.White must have published at least three slightly different versions of this story.When I read the full Once And Future King book a few years ago, there was no Madame Mim episode, there was a buttery version of the fairy castle (Robin Hood) episode, there was an Archimedes/Wild Geese episode, and some other minor changes/additions.When I read a paperback Sword In The Stone twenty years ago, there was a much nicer non-buttery version of the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode, and I don't think the Giant Galapas episode was there, etc.Now I've just read the illustrated hardcover Sword In The Stone edition, and the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode is replaced by an Anthropophagi/RobinHood episode, Giant Galapas is there, and the Archimedes/WildGeese isn't (its been replaced by an Archimedes/Athena episode).Anyone else notice these differences and have an explanation for them?"},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Wart is a young boy from an unknown parentage who is raised by Sir Ector in The Sword in the Stone. Wart calls Sir Ector father, but it is Sir Ector's real son, Kay, who is destined to be knighted and Wart his squire. The Magician Merlyn is the tutor of both Wart and Kay, but he puts most of his efforts on Wart.The Sword in the Stone is book 1 of a 4 book series, The Once and Future King, by T.H. White (Terence Hanbury White) about King Arthur. There actually is no direct refernce to this story being about King Arthur until the end except for a few name drops here and there which one wouldn't even suspect if they weren't familiar with King Arthur's tales. It was pretty obvious who would eventually get named King Arthur.This book was written in the 1930s like Lord of the Rings, but reads very differently. The Sword in the Stone is basically written for the younger fantasy readers. First off it's rather short and secondly there isn't the character development or plot developments that you expect to see in adult epic fantasies.Wart's education from Merlyn consists mostly of observing the world from different animals like owls, badgers, ants, etc. They all play a part in the end in helping the true sword owner pull the unnamed sword (at this point at least) out of the stone.Well I can't say this was one of my favourites, but I did buy the entire The Once and Future King series on my e-book and I am a sucker for mythology, so I'll definitely finish it. It's an easy enough read that I don't really need to force myself to read it. I'm sure a younger audience (the target audience of this book) who aren't as familiar with King Arthur would get more out of this book than adult readers."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"So much fun. I love the Disney movie and there is a lot of the book that has been put in the movie. Merlin is a hoot and the Wart is a sensitive boy who likes learning. Most of the chapters are able to stand on their own, and it's like reading a collection of very short stories involving the same cast of characters. Merlin turns the Wart into a seriers of different animals as part of his education. Very inventive and fun to read."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"This is the first part of the Once and Future King series of novels.Wart, a young boy, initially has no idea who he really is. This is thestory of this young lad, and the events and lessons and trials thatlead to him becoming a leader. Of course, it details the bumbling andaccidents that lead him to drawing The Sword in the Stone."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"This is an interesting little book.

As well I didn't appreciate the mixing of Robin Hood (Wood) in the 12th Century with Arthur of the 6th Century.Yet all in all it was a fun book - easy to read."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is about King Arthur, as a boy called Wart, between the ages 10 to 16. Wart grew up in the castle of Sir Ector, with Sir Ector himself, and his son Kay. Wart is taught by the famous wizard known as Merlyn, how to be a man. Merlyn sends Wart on many magnificent and magical adventures, transforming him from one creature to the next and sending him on spectacular journeys and quests all through the land.The Sword in the Stone was a book that was easy to pick up and get right into, but also easy to put down and feel like you could almost fall asleep if you read one more page. It would change from interesting to dull consistently throughout the book. There were parts that were very detailed, and exciting, but other parts that were very boring, and hard to understand.The detail was so incredible that as you read you feel as though you are right there with the characters. The details help you to imagine things like Merlyn's blue and gold-starred robe to the exact movement of the sneaky snake as he approaches Wart. The exciting parts of the book tell fantastic fantasy stories that let your imagination run wild. The &quot;Wizard Duel&quot; between Madame Mim and Merlyn goes on for page after page as the two struggle to defeat one another. They use their enchantedpowers and fight for hours on end, until Merlyn thinks of a despising plan, and takes care of Madame Mim once and for all.There are parts in the book that start to get boring and can lose your attention quickly, but as soon as you are about to put the book down,Merlyn has once again performed his magic, and Wart is experiencing yet another splendid adventure. There was a part where Wart and Robin Hood travel with their army to fight against the Anthropophagi (a wild variety of ferocious beasts). They walk throught the woods for days before reaching their destination. This really bores an interested reader. There were many sections of the books that seemed confusing to me. I didn't understand the part where Merlyn transforms Wart into a bird and Wart flys down to the barn to talk with the other birds and hawks. The birds were talking nonsense words that were very hard to catch on to. I must say though that The Sword in the Stone was very appealing to me, despite the parts that I struggled to understand and read through."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book very much as a child but \\"get\\" much more of it now.--Funny, funny, funny, and not the least realistic or representative of the Dark Ages in which Arthur must have (may have) lived.-- White's jokes at the expense of the British upper class of the thirties is first-rate; and there are a few hints of the European conflict building at the time of publication. It is a little silly to try to find anything very profound in this one; for a wonderful and more serious treatment of the Arthurian legend, start with The Crystal Cave by Mary Stewart."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"\\"Sword in the Stone\\" is the must-read book of Arthuriana, an imaginative fantasy romp that has inspired all our ideas about the venerable Merlin and about King Arthur's boyhood. White infuses the book with whimsy, poignancy, and a mixture of early 20th-century England and medieval times.Sir Ector's ward Arthur (known as \\"Wart\\") has no idea what he's in for when he accompanies Ector's son Kay out on a hunt. When a bad-tempered hawk escapes and refuses to come out of a tree, Wart ends up staying behind all night in the hopes of recapturing it. But he's interrupted by an odd old man called Merlin and his talking owl Archimedes. Merlin captures the hawk -- and then comes home with Wart. Soon he is firmly established as tutor to the two boys.But they soon discover that nobody is quite like Merlin, and the lessons he has to teach Wart are more than just math and Latin. Merlin transforms Arthur into a fish, an owl, a hawk, and sends him on bizarre journeys with Robin Wood (Wood, not Hood -- a common mistake) and his band of Merry Men, a duel with an evil witch, a gathering of trees, a fumbling King and the Questing Beast, and capture in a sinister giant's castle.T.H. White was a wonderful author, and an even better comic author. His characters are fully fleshed and endearing (even the nasty ones), but at the same time there is a delightful lightness to them. There isn't a speck of realism in the entire book -- chronology is bent and spindled, magic and realism are twisted together, and readers won't care at all. In a sense, \\"Sword\\" seems almost to exist in a parallel universe where animals talk, Robin Hood chit-chats with the once and future king, and carnivorous humanoids roam through Britain.\\"Wart\\" is a good hero -- quiet, unassuming, thoughtful, and occasionally puts his foot in his mouth. His foster brother Kay is also good -- Kay is hot-tempered and a little loud-mouthed, but he is a nice person at heart. Merlin is the perfect crabby gray wizard, eccentric and unashamed to use his magic in a perfectly casual manner, and constantly a little befuddled due to his ability to live backwards in time. He'll endear himself to readers from the first page onward. There are dozens of equally funny characters: The always-questing King Pellinore and his Beast, the worried Sir Ector, the walking mustard-pot, the crabby but kindly owl Archimedes, and many, many more.White's writing goes at a slightly uneven clip: Sometimes it zips along quickly, at other times it crawls. He displays plenty of knowledge about medieval times, and seems a little too eager to reveal it to the readers. But his descriptions and dialogue are delightful, a mix of the modern and the medieval. There are some extremely frightening scenes, and some (such as the having to put down a fatally-injured dog) that will make you cry.Readers will come out of this book feeling like they have made a number of memorable, kindly friends. It's a must-read for anyone who loves the legends of Arthur."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"Finding a COMPLETE version of this book is difficult. When the Sword and the Stone was grafted onto the rest of the series to form the Once and Future King, T.H. White removed several scenes from the book. Growing up enjoying the Walt Disney version of the film, I was disappointed when I read the Once and Future King. Where was the wizard's duel between Merlyn and Madam Mim? Surely, Disney didn't come up with that on their own.Well, the truth is these lost parts are still out there if you wish to find them. Some of the lost episodes include: Kay and Wart taken captive by Madam Mim, a wizard's duel between Merlyn and Mim, Wart and Kay battle a giant who has taken King Pellinore captive, Wart becomes a snake, and Archimedes takes the Wart in bird form to meet his mother Athene and hear a song from the trees. The version I found that still contained these passages was published in 1963 and features Disney illustrations on the cover. I do not know if other versions include these chapters, but the Once and Future King does not.Some speculate that White thought these episodes to be too childish and light-hearted, but I think they are wonderful. The Sword in the Stone is a very difficult book for children. I believe it needs these light-hearted moments to offset the preachy life lessons. Don't get me wrong, I think the lessons that can be learned from the book are innumerable, but everyone needs a little fun with their learning.If you are looking to read the Sword in the Stone, I encourage you to seek out the oldest version with the chapters still in tact. They're worth it."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a truly wonderful book. It is the classic story of young King Arthur, but told in greater depth and detail, and filled with wonderful, humorous characters. The tale so many times retold suddenly becomes fresh and original, as T.H. White's stunning narrative sweeps the reader into the world of Midieval England, and makes the old story come alive in a new and delightful way. Never before has anyone been able to make the old characters of Arthur and Merlyn, Sir Ector and King Pellinore come alive in such a real and fantastic way. The story is brought to life, and is better by far then the traditional telling of the tale. White does not only tell the simple story of the sword in the stone- here he tells the story of the boy who pulled it out. He goes back and tells us about the growing up of this boy, that we might better understand why it was he that was meant for this destiny, and what it was that shaped him for this task. And throughout the entire story, the book sparkles with humour, wit and charm, which is all the better because it is told in Old English. There are too many books these days written in modern language, using slang and twentieth century dialect, so the Sword in the Stone is a delightful change of pace. And while the Old English sounds perfectly authentic, it is not overly used, and is never difficult to understand. My nine year old sister understood it perfectly, when I read it to her. All in all, this story is the best retelling of any Arthurian legend that I have ever read. I would encourage anyone who has an interest in King Arthur to read this book."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Once and Future King, which is built upon and uses text from the Sword in the Stone, is one of my favorite books. Much like the Hobbit is a sometimes silly preamble to the Lord of the Rings, The Sword in the Stone is the less serious story of King Arthur as a boy that sets the stage for the novel, The Once and Future King. And like the Hobbit, while it can be occassionally silly- a deadly serious and powerful story is just below the surface.White was clearly impacted by the struggle to hold views of evolution and a God-centered world view, and was also clearly impacted by the tensions of war torn Europe. He weaves some fun stories of Robin Hood, life in a hawk mew, and light-hearted jousting in with all his explaining and metaphorizing, though. I can't imagine not liking the vivid imagery and exotic story-telling, and if you are a fan of any of the other initialed British writers you'll certainly feel at home with T.H. White. Read the Sword in the Stone- it won't take much time, but then by all means read The Once and Future King one day for the real masterpiece."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"A boy named the Arthur, called Wart, livng during the Middle Ages, is taught by a magician about the past, present, and future, and about all creatures living on the Earth. When the opportunity arises for the Wart to become King, he must recall everything he has learned to pull the magic sword from the stone and become the new leader of England. I enjoyed this book because it had so many exciting battles and page turning adventures. Even a small bit about Robin Hood! The plot really doesn't appear until the last few chapters, where you realized that every story within the book was connected all along. It is nice to know that there are fun and interesting books to read about the Medeival times. I think that if you are looking for a book with lots of adventure, this is truely one that you should read."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is set in the Middle Ages, in a time of knights and magicians. Actual historical details are presented in the context of a fictional story. It is about the upbringing of young King Arthur. With the help of his tutor, Merlyn, Arthur experiences adventures, which help him to see life from different points of view. These other perspectives of the world will help him when he becomes king. Merlyn is training Arthur with quests, and a little magic. The quests Arthur accomplishes help him to be a more understanding person. Merlyn subjects Arthur to many different situations, some of which include; being turned into animals, meeting new people, and seeing different people living different lives. A key revelation about the magic of Merlyn occurs the first time that Arthur is introduced to his future tutor. While eating a meal, a mustard-pot gets up and walks to Arthur's plate, adds some mustard, and returns to its place. Later, Merlyn explains the order in which he lives his life, which is different from most people. As most people live time forwards, Merlyn lives it backwards. The significance of this is that it open's Arthur's eyes to a completely different way of looking at life. This is an example of one of the many perspectives Arthur will gain from Merlyn's influence. This slightly whimsical way to introduce lessons for Arthur's life is part of what makes this story so popular. Merlyn explains his perception of time in one sentence, stating, &quot;If you know what's going to happen to people, and not what has happened to them, it makes it so difficult to prevent it happening, if you don't want to have it happen,&quot; (39). This quote is essentially the reason Merlyn is tutoring Arthur. Merlyn's goal is to prepare Arthur for what is going to happen in the future. This gift of Merlyn's came in handy later in the story when Kay, Arthur's brother, and Arthur leave without telling their father. Sir Ector searches for them until he thinks of consulting Merlyn. &quot;The magician for the sake of peace and quietness to go with his nap in, had used his insight to tell Sir Ector exactly what the boys were doing, where they were, and when they might be expected to come back. He had prophesied their return to a minute,&quot; (162). Part of what makes this book so fun is the fantasy that someone can be looking out for us and protecting us while we are impetuous youngsters.While this was an entertaining and educational story, there were many unnecessary details. These frivolous details made for long stretches between the action sequences. I would recommend this book to those readers who prefer careful attention paid to details. For me, the stage setting tended to drag the story down a little. I would have enjoyed a little more action and frivolous and magical events. I like the way the character of the Wart was developed. I was able to notice his leadership ability and maturity level early on, and follow them as they progressed through the story. If knights in shining armor, castles, and mysticism fascinate you, this is the book for you. The Sword in the Stone is the most well known re-creation of Medieval England for young adults. It is a classic story that has been enjoyed by many generations and no doubt will be enjoyed by many, many more."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"\\"The Once and Future King\\" is a delightful series of stories, but this is by far the superior, and first off the rank. It is the story of Wart, a hapless orphan boy, and his adventures once his new tutor Merlin arrives on the scene (some of you may be aware of the Walt Disney animated movie of the same name).This is real adventure stuff and is appealing to both young readers and grown ups alike. Wat and his friends have all manner of exciting escapades as birds, as fish, and as combatants with witches, and in the background there is all the fanciful goings on of a very disorganised medieval castle.There are many novels which deal with the Arthurian legend, some well, most tastefully, and some take themselves entirely too seriously. This is just plain good fun and well written too. Enjoy yourself!"},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"&quot;The sword in the stone&quot;I would definitely recommend T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; to anyone faintly interested in The Dark Ages or The Arthurian legends, althought I think someone between the ages 12-25 would appreciate the book more. I say this because I don't think a young child or an adult would enjoy reading, or care for T.H. White's ideas on the simple subjects about some of the parts of everyday life that aren't usually thought about out loud. Some other people I know who are reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; think it is boring, but I think you just need to be in a reading mood to comprehend what you've read so you may enjoy this exquisite book.This is the first time I have absorbed any of the Arthurian legends. In my history classes studying The Dark Ages we never really spent any time on the legends or similiar thoughts about that time, because we were pressed for time. So, now, since I liked T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much, I have a good impression on all the legends about this mysterious era.Don't be fooled if you have seen the Disney movie &quot;The Sword in the Stone.&quot; It has the same general plot, but the book is mucher better (like most movies that come from a novel). The book is not just directed toawrds the taste of children, and there is much more of the story that the movie didn't present to it's audience.&quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is a particular tale about King Arthur of England as a young boy. He is not the king in this story, though. Young Arthur has the nickname Wart(not as a mean gesture, but because it rhymes with Art, which is short for Arthur). This legend tells about the Wart, with his wizard tutor, Merlyn, who turns the Wart into animals to teach him about life lessons. He learns a lot from the animals he converses with. He learns things about the history of the world, the theory of life and education, courage, and respect for all types of living creatures. I think that it is quite interesting what these animals tell him. The Wart also teams up with Robin Wood (probably kwown to you as Robin Hood) and his clan and has an adventure that helped make him valiant. This lessons will help him become a magnificent king.I have always enojoyed historical fiction by authors like John Steinbeck and James Mitchner. I consider this book more of a historical fiction than a legend. I say this because during the story, it tells many historical facts about The Dark Ages, an era that I am not too familiar with. What I mean by historical facts, are not dates or names of battles and wars, or anything along those lines, but of such things that were part of the everyday life back in those days. Such things like castle structures and purposes, archery and jousting techniques, and all sorts of similar parts of their life. Mr White's reseach about this time has paid off greatly. His novel seems very complete because of the wonderful correct details about all aspects involved in the Wart's life.I love how T.H. White tries to explain the simple things that just happen without any thought involved. He explains things like how a human would fly like a bird, swim like a fish, or slither like a snake. The Wart doesn't have the instinct to do any of these tasks, so Merlyn teaches him. Someone would think it would be easy to fly, because the birds make it look easy, but I bet it would be very hard and weird. To the animals the skill comes naturally, and without thought, but it wouldn't come easily at all to a human being.Mr. White also tells the reader his theories on how some things came to be. For example he tells why all embryos look alike with their feeble hands and heavy, large heads. It doesn't matter if they are going to become a tadpole, an elephant, a peacock, or a human; they all are identical. He says that God told the embryos (in the 5-6 day of creation) to choose their specialties, and when alive they all would transform into that thing. I enjoy seeing these types of theories, true or not, about all sorts of the little and big things in life.If any of the ideas I have put across seems of interest of you, I recommend &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"In The Sword in the Stone by Terence Hanbury White, fantasy and adventure are woven together to create a picturesque and suspenseful story set in Medieval England. The Sword in the Stone recreates the life of young King Arthur as he is taught how to be a gentleman by Merlyn, the powerful but absent-minded magician who lives life backwards. Young Arthur, who is commonly know as the &quot;Wart,&quot; finds himself entwined in many adventures, such as being magically transformed into a fish, a hawk, and a badger. He also meets the likes of Robin Wood, Maid Marian, and Little John on a dangerous adventure he goes on with Kay, his brother. All of the adventures he experiences in the book are part of his training. Merlyn wants him to view life from all different perspectives so that he will be prepared to become the king of England.While Arthur's older brother Kay is preparing for knighthood, it is discovered that King Uther Pendragon, the ruler of England, has died. There is word that there is a sword stuck in a stone which bears an inscription saying that whoever pulls out the sword is the &quot;rightwise king born of all England.&quot; Arthur stumbles upon this, not knowing it is the sword, and manages to pull it out, using everything Merlyn taught him.Merlyn is the key to The Sword in the Stone. If you removed his character from the book, you wouldn't have a story anymore; just a vague picture of a boy named Arthur. Merlyn personifies both humor and wisdom. The fact that he lives life backwards instead of forwards- knowing what will happen next as opposed to knowing about the past- makes him all the more important in this novel. He already knows in advance what the future holds for Arthur, and his training of the boy is really to prepare him for ruling England.Although The Sword in the Stone centers around a young boy's coming-of-age and story elements normally considered juvenile, this novel would be more appreciated by a mature audience, due to the wordiness. Those interested in Arthurian legend will love this book's twists on tradition. The novel starts at a crawl and then suddenly picks up pace, hurling one adventure after another at the reader. This sudden change is difficult to adjust to at first, but slowly you see that it is all part of T.H. White's genius. Arthur's life progressed in this same way, beginning slowly and then picking up speed, as he became tangled in Merlyn's world of magic and whimsy.I found The Sword in the Stone to be quite an engaging book once I got past all the fancy vocabulary and focused on the story. I admire how T.H. White took a historical legend and incorporated so many humorous fables. He was obviously a well-educated man who had a deep passion for Arthurian legend. The novel held some personal meaning for me, since I can relate to Arthur's never-ending need for knowledge, intellect and maturity.Give T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone a try. If you cannot swallow a mixture of imagination, satire and realism all in once shot, you might not want to attempt it. If you do happen to enjoy it, though, I promise you will want to read it repeatedly over time."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is the first part of The Once and Future King pentalogy (followed by The Witch in the Wood, The Ill-Made Knight, The Candle in the Wind and The Book of Merlyn).The Wart is a young orphan boy who lives in the castle of Sir Ector, his foster father.

It had a plot line that was uneventful and I lost interest constantly. The book had a good idea behind it but the final result was rushed and in need of detail. The book started out nice and slow describing life in the middle ages but as the middle to the end comes along, the best parts seem to leave as fast as they come. Wart, the main character, was seemed to be too childish for his age and his upbringing. He is constantly making choices that cause the book to loose its charm and originality. Merlin has a certain appeal to him and does not and is not getting the attention and time he disserves. Through out the plot line there was description (a little bit here a little bit there) and they were very good. But you can't make a good book on a couple of good parts. The middle ages theme was great and I thought it gave it some spunk, The author tells mindlessly of every thing of a young boys life in the middle ages. During the book there was some parts that were not rushed -and almost dragged out- but otherwise were not in enough detail for you to get the picture and understand it fully. In conclusion I think that The Sword in the Stone had the right though but was too rushed to its point across."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one. The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"This book was a WASTE OF MY SUMMER VACATION! I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously). He even stole some lines from Shakespeare! All he did was write it, and the writing was unbearable. Unless you enjoy mind-numbing boredom, don't waste your time on the Sword in the Stone."},{"Title":"the Sword and the Stone","review":"i thought this was the most boring uninteresting book i was ever fourced to read in enlish class, if it were up to me it wouldnt even get one star!!!!!!! If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it"},{"Title":"The Great Mogul","review":"Terrific and exciting adventure tale, written in the early 1900's but set hundreds of years ago. Well researched, lots of yummy archaic language (woot woot for the handy-and thorough-electronic dictionary incorporated into the iPhone Kindle app). Two close friends, \\"up from the country\\" for their first visit to London, are falsely imprisoned by King James in The Tower of London, and handed over to a villainous member of the Spanish Inquisition, who has his own reasons for hating one of the unwitting pair . Making a hairs breadth escape, they wind up on an exciting adventure in India. Are they manipulated or aided by a stunning Persian beauty?Lots of gentle humor and courteous talk, and, again, really well researched. The first few chapters gave a very interesting, and apparently reasonably accurate, picture of rowdy London in the early 1600's. A very fun read. Many thanks to those who made it available for free. Check out also \\"The Stowaway Girl\\" by the same author,I am off to download a few more Louis Tracy novels. ;-)"},{"Title":"Fundamentalism: Hazards and Heartbreaks","review":"Mr. Evans is a philosopher and Mr. Berent is an historian. Together they wrote this book a decade and a half ago to address hazards inherent in Christian \\"fundamentalism.\\" More specifically to address the issue of biblical inerrancy. A fundamentalist is described as someone who maintains \\"that respect for the Bible requires the belief that it is inerrant, that is, free from error of every sort. Holding that belief, most but not all people who call themselves \`fundamentalists' often view the Bible as representing the very Word of God, dictated to writers who were Divinely preserved from error.... Doubts about the truth of any Biblical claim are seen as immoral if not Satanic\\" (p. xviii). The authors do not clearly distinguish between those who would consider the Bible as inerrant within the confines of each text's literary type and intended purpose and those who would hold all texts inerrant in a literalist dictation fashion. Either group, however, would find this book challenging their view of the Bible.The major focus of this book is to show that the Bible is not infallible but affected by historical and cultural limitations in wisdom and knowledge. The authors maintain that \\"this book is written not to discourage either faith in God or reverence for the Bible.\\" In fact the authors claim, \\"we are not \`secular humanists', nor are we \`fanatical liberals.' We believe in God and love the Bible. Our chief purpose in writing this book is to further the pursuit of truth...\\" (xviii). Later they maintain that \\"God has, indeed, provided mankind with an excellent source of inspiration and guidance in the form of the Bible\\" (p.30). Yet, what exactly they believe about God is never clarified nor what they consider excellent about the Bible. In fact their pursuit of truth is such that two noted atheists, Steve Allen and Isaac Asimov, can compliment the book with a forward and introduction respectively.The book is divided into twelve chapters, an appendix, and some suggested readings. The chapters include: a presentation of the claims of some former fundamentalists (members of Fundamentalists Anonymous) that their religious instruction led to views that caused psychological trauma; a presentation of relevant teachings from evangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell; five chapters pointing out \\"particular implausibilities or inconsistencies\\" in Scripture that arise when approached as inerrant; a chapter on conjectured historical influences on biblical authors; and finally a chapter (at four pages, tied for shortest with the first on what is a fundamentalist?) on \\"Unlocking the Wisdom of the Bible.\\" The latter, by the way, gives no insights from Scripture but is simply a concluding call for \\"genuine questioning\\" of the Bible so as to recognize the misguided nature of viewing \\"the Bible as \`perfect' or \`inerrant'...\\"in order to make the wisest possible use\\" of it.For the authors the Bible is very much a fallible book. It contains a pre-scientific cosmology and endorses some archaic moral positions that violate justice and decency. Even Jesus, while having some admirable traits, is portrayed in the Gospels \\"at times as narrow-minded, vindictive, discourteous, ethnocentric, and even hypocritical\\" (p.60). What, then, is the value of this book? Well, for those with an axe to grind against Judaism or Christianity it can supply lots of ammunition and leave them feeling intellectually and morally superior. For the \\"fundamentalist,\\" for whom the book is intended, it might instigate a serious reappraisal of any smug or simplistic view of biblical inerrancy and interpretation. The authors' comparatively polite manner can have the effect of being hit by a mace under a crocheted wool cover. Sadly, I think the book's readership more likely to be of the former type rather than the latter. People tend to read according to their predilection. I would definitely not recommend it for those of fragile faith. But for those open to critical inquiry it is a very good critique of Scripture from a rationalist perspective."},{"Title":"Mission from Mount Yoda (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 4)","review":"I really liked this sci fi book. I'm a Star Wars lover. The best part was when grand Moff Hisa sunk in toxic goop. The underground tunnels archeologists hid in were neat. And the trouble-making of Ken was funny."},{"Title":"Mission from Mount Yoda (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 4)","review":"Although most of the Star Wars novels and other literary spinoffs (graphic novels, reference works, and screenplays) are primarily written for general audiences that include adult fans, the sextet of Bantam Skylark books written by Paul and Hollace Davis is targeted squarely at a specific audience, namely, young readers between the ages of 10 and 13.The first three novels in the series (The Glove of Darth Vader, The Lost City of the Jedi, and Zorba the Hutt's Revenge) purport to be a continuation of the Star Wars saga set in a nebulous time period between the events in &lt;Return of the Jedi and Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire. With the second Death Star's destruction and the deaths of both Emperor Palpatine and Lord Darth Vader at the Battle of Endor, rival factions vie for control of the crumbling Galactic Empire.One faction, led by the surviving Grand Moffs, has temporarily installed the former Slave Lord of Kessel, Trioculous, as the new Emperor, proclaiming him to be Palpatine's long-rumored (but never confirmed) three-eyed mutant son. In order to achieve legitimacy, Trioculous acquires the almost mystical relic that is Darth Vader's indestructible glove and receives the grudging \\"dark blessing\\" of Supreme Prophet Kadann, head of the secretive Prophets of the Dark Side. With the aid of Grand Moff Hissa, Trioculous then sets out on a multi-pronged campaign to secure his power...a campaign that has these three main goals:* The destruction of Luke Skywalker, the galaxy's sole Jedi Knight* The capture of Luke's twin sister, Leia Organa, not only because she's a leader of the Rebel Alliance, but because Trioculous wants to marry her and install her as his Queen of the Empire* The capture of Ken, the Jedi Prince who was found by Luke Skywalker in the Lost City of the Jedi on Yavin 4By the end of Zorba the Hutt's Revenge, Trioculus had made far too many enemies and lost even the grudging support of Kadann, and as a result of a falling out between the three-eyed mutant pretender to the throne and the elderly but still vicious Zorba (Jabba the Hutt's father), he ended up frozen in carbonite and placed as a trophy in the Cloud City museum. Now the Empire is temporarily in the hands of Kadann and the Prophets of the Dark Side...and they are now unwilling to give the reins of power to anyone else.As Mission From Mount Yoda begins, the prophets -- really part of a vast Imperial network of spies and operatives who lurk behind the shadows and use bribery, sabotage, and even murder to make Kadann's \\"prophecies\\" come true -- have come to the conclusion that they will not give up the rule of the Empire, and Kadann, a dwarfish, bearded man dressed in a glittering black cloak, issues a Nostradamus-like quatrain:\\"When the Dragon's Pack,Perched upon Yoda's stony back,Receives a visitor pierced by gold,Then come the last days of the Rebel Alliance.\\"Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, and Ken are enjoying a much needed respite on the balmy planet Z'trop, \\"one of the most scenic planets in the galaxy.\\" With nothing more dangerous than a plant-eating septapus nearby, the small group of Rebels is in paradise, relaxing and generally having a good time away from the war against the Empire.But when R2-D2 discovers an abandoned Imperial Compact Assault Vehicle on a cliff nearby, the vacationing heroes of the Rebellion find themselves starting off on a perilous mission to figure out what Kadann's quatrain means, starting off from the secret Alliance outpost on Mount Yoda on the planet Dagobah and including a destiny-changing search for a relic on the planet Duros, where the Rebels meet Triclops, the Emperor's true son, who has been long hidden in an asylum by the Empire.Triclops, whose third eye is on the back of his head, appears to be a man of peace and rejects his late father's tyrannical ways, but Luke Skywalker and the leaders of the Alliance sense there's something oddly wrong with him. They agree to take him to Rebel-held space, but do they dare trust him?Mission From Mount Yoda isn't exactly the best of books for older Star Wars fans who are curious about this story arc because the characters and situations are mentioned in Lucasfilm-vetted references such as Stephen Sansweet's The Star Wars Encyclopedia, but they are all right for younger readers who like George Lucas's space fantasy trilogies set \\"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.\\" The storyline may be somewhat apocryphal (since none of the other Expanded Universe novels seems to be linked to it), and some of the Davids' little running gags (such as the constant references to \\"zoochberries\\") are grating to adults, but the overall tale is entertaining -- think of it as Star Wars-Lite. There is plenty of action and mayhem, including a harrowing encounter between Grand Moff Hissa and the Rebel heroes in a dark cave on Duros, and the characters, particularly the established icons from the film trilogy, are nicely done; there is the charming banter between Leia and Han, the earnest and compassionate heroism of Luke, the nervous prissiness of C-3PO and the usual eccentric bravery of R2-D2, albeit watered down somewhat for younger readers.Each of the three books in the second batch of Star Wars novels for young readers includes:* An illustrated list of the cast of characters, divided into Rebel and Imperial camps* Pencil and ink drawings by June Brigman and Dark Horse Comics' illustrator Karl Kesel, with cover art by Drew Struzan.* A glossary of characters and terms related to the book's narrative and Star Wars universe"},{"Title":"Mission from Mount Yoda (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 4)","review":"This is actually one of the better books in this series, which is not very good. This book had a bit of a darker feel to it, and thus felt more like Star Wars than the other books in the series. However, this book may have been somewhat entertaining, but that can not take away the fact that the writing is cheesy, the characters undeveloped and not like themselves, most especially Luke, and the intire plot is somewhat silly. Kids too young or to lazy to read Young Jedi Knights, or Heir to the Empire, but would still like to see the Star Wars story continued would probably like this series. Fans older than twelve would probably get more enjoyment out of just about anything else."},{"Title":"Mission from Mount Yoda (Star Wars: Jedi Prince, Book 4)","review":"Mission from Mount Yoda By Paul Davids and Hollace Davids Review by Flyn' Ryan\\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.\\" The battle against the evil empire goes on long after the death of Senator Palpatine from the original series.

The Supreme Prophet Kadann plots to steal the now carbonated body of Trioculus, the imposter son of the late Senator Palpatine.

They are simple stories and come illustrated in simple pen and ink. They are not relavent to the EU, but they are nice little stories about the star wars characters for younf listeners and readers. When reading to the young you need help holding their attention especially my ADHD son. Pictures help. That is also why I have turned to buying and reading the dark horse comics about star wars.Which is better? I like the comics better, but sometimes, with all those beautifully colored and inked pictures and the varying panels, it is hard for the kids to follow.

The elderly lady keeps giving her heirlooms to the woman, knowing the woman is a collector of antiques and an armchair historian. One of the things she passes along is her grandmother's diary -- a journal kept when the grandmother, Mattie, travelled West with her husband to set up a homestead in the Colorado Territory. The rest of the novel is the diary itself -- a marvelous story that made me think constantly of the &quot;Little House&quot; books. I really enjoyed this novel a lot and look forward to reading Dallas's other books. Highly recommended to anyone who misses the Ingalls or loves stories about strong women pioneers."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"What a hard and frightening time Mattie had!

It reminds me of the Laura Ingalls books I enjoyed so much as a child, only with a rougher edge. I find Mattie to be an inspiraton, as she valiantly chops the heads off of rattlesnakes to save her baby boy. It's not &quot;great literature&quot; for whatever that means, but its entertaining and engrossing, and isn't that what a book is supposed to be? I can't wait to read more of Sandra Dallas' work."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"While the &quot;Diary of Mattie Spenser&quot; paints a true-sounding, not-very-pretty picture of frontier life, it fairly shouts &quot;This is historical fiction&quot;. I never fully believed in the characters; except for Mattie they're not really brought to life. I agree with the reviewer who felt the author had a list of characters and plot devices that she &quot;ticked off&quot; to a not-very-surprising conclusion. But I must admit I've been spoiled. I read the magical, lyrical, clever and delightful &quot;These is My Words&quot; first."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Although I enjoyed this book a great deal in the beginning , as it went on I began to weary of the 1990's touches the author had thrown in for the amusement of the readers, such as the lady pioneers, who &quot;wink, wink&quot; don't need a husband. Although the book was entertaining I would have enjoyed it more had the narrator viewed things in manner more in line with times. The ending was also a bit of a disappointment, for I had hoped for something else for Mattie."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Mattie, a newlywed, goes west to settle in Colorado. She soon discovers the hardships of the frontier and of marriage. She chronicles the first few years, as the diary is her only friend.

A great book, which I will no doubt re-read."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Sometimes your lucky day strikes and you come upon a novel that meets all your favorite topics and interests. This book was recommended to me by another Amazon.com reviewer that understood my passion for this era and took advantage of what this site has to offer to get in touch with me.Ever since my mother passed along _Jubilee Trail_ by Gwen Bristow, I have been fascinated by the 1850's and the journey and homesteading of the western lands. While the stories of many books I have read were well done, I still wished to learn more of the everyday issues and how they managed to make do in such difficult settings. It is very evident that the author, Sandra Dallas, researched her work, for you will be delighted to learn specifics of how these men and women lived, loved, made their home and raised their children.It is a difficult time, the end of the civil war has taken it's toll on the north and south. Men are looking to making a livelihood and forget the horrors of the war. The story centers around Mattie, a young woman who marries Luke and moves to Colorado. There, Luke challenges the land hoping to farm, and Mattie works hard to make a home in their sod house. She becomes pregnant immediately and must deliver her first child in the company of men. Mattie and Luke's marriage is stable, but Luke has some secrets and over the years Mattie discovers them. Other men see the beauty and strength in Mattie, for she is a fine lady and well respected. She easily fits in the group of men, as they discuss the issues of farming, indian revolts and homesteading. It is a very difficult life as the indians are a constant threat, alternating the kidnapping of women and children with outright murdur. Food and provisions are scarce and the risks of disease are a constant fear. Their days are long and the work is hard. There are few luxuries. A long forgotten piece of chocolate fallen into the corner of their traveling trunk serves as a treat to be scavenged and eaten. The reader is astonished at the strength these people had to have to survive in such stark and barren land. You will be pleased with the details and even more so with the plot of the story. Travel to the big city, Denver City and learn what it was like to stay in the hotel and explore the city. It is a wonderful book and I hated to come to the last page. You will, too."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I bought this book from a thrift store; after reading Alice's Tulips, I knew I did not want to spend any real money on a book by Sandra Dallas. She has a good story here (and subject matter I really enjoy), but the characters seem to jump around from the 19th century to the 21st century. All this blatant talk about \\"sex.\\" I just don't believe it happened - I remember my grandmother's way of talking ... and believe me ... that woman never used that word in her whole life! And she was a nurse. I also wish the author would pay a little closer attention to historical cultural facts; at one point, Mattie talks about having a Christmas tree (or not as in this case); I doubt any Christian was thinking about having (or not having) a Christmas tree at this time as they were considered a pagan icon in the mid-1800s. As I entered the story, I knew I was in for a sticky ride ... she mentions (Page 3) how her 94-year-old neighbor \\"runs up and down the stairs.\\" What?!? No 94-year-old (even if she does act \\"twenty years younger than her age\\") is running up and down stairs. And finally while portraying her characters, she sometimes forgets her descriptions; on one page she says Mr. Bondurant \\"is not much of an agrarian, because he told me he can recognize only two trees.\\" Then just a few pages later she writes \\"... the prairie is thick with many grasses. Mr. Bondurant is teaching me their names ...\\" Well either he knows the local flora or he doesn't ... which is it? Once again, we have a good story, but frankly, Sandra needs to slow down and process what she is writing ... and, for heaven's sake, get a new editor."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This book is not deep, but of course it doesn't have to be to make enjoyable reading. I thought it was a bit too modern in sensibilities to be believable, but it's easy to forgive Ms. Dallas for that since she created a heroine in Mattie who is so easy to like. Everyone in our reading circle gave &quot;Mattie&quot; thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"While I would not consider this book a classic work of fiction, it was so entertaining and wonderful that I did not put it down until I was done. (Reading while I was cooking dinner.) Sandra Dallas has an ability to express the inner thoughts and feelings of women in such a way that they become your friends. You begin to care about them and it's almost as if you're having a conversation with a friend. That's the feeling I got when I read both this book and The Persian Pickle Club. They are both wonderful reads and give you a real sense of the different times and places in which the books are set."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I got this book from my local library after reading Alice's Tulips. Being a quilter, I am familiar with Dallas' love of quilts and history. I found this book very well written. A masterpiece of historical fiction. I was gripped and found it difficult to put the book down. I really enjoyed the format, it helped to anchor the book and draw you into Mattie's world. Definitely has its heart wrenching moments, so have a box of tissues near by. At first I was disappointed with the ending but upon reflection of the book I realize that it has the perfect ending. Maybe not what you would be hoping for but it follows the tone of the book regarding women's hardships and the tough selfless decisions women have to make, a suitable and understandable conclusion to a wonderfully written novel. I have decided to add this book to my library as I truly enjoyed reading it and would like to read it again."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I really got into this book and I had read alot of the other reviews before purchasing it.

It's not a waste of time, just not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"\\"The Diary of Mattie Spenser\\" is an exceptional book! If you're looking for a sugarcoated tale of a woman's life in the West, then look for another book. Dallas' book illustrates the nitty-gritty things women endured while traveling west and once settling. The standards women needed to abide by were treacherous and merciless. I felt an array of emotions while reading this: pity and strength for Mattie, repugnance and detestation towards Luke, ardor and fondness for Tom, etc. Women may have been the \\"lesser\\" sex, but men could not endure what the women had. I recommend."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This was the first Sandra Dallas book that I read &amp; I immediately searched out her others. This was a beautiful story and not one soon forgotten. Matty is a beautiful heroine. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Being a diary writer for more than 30 years, I am drawn to books written in diary format. This book portrayed a woman reaching spinster status, who was suddenly asked to wed and travel west to the Colorado frontier by a man she never expected was &quot;interested&quot; in courting her. The book continues through the travails of cross country travel, including an Indian attach, to settling on the plains where life is hard for anyone to survive, but particularly for her female acquaintenances.I disagree with a previous reviewer who indicated that author never developed the other characters. In defense of the author, and from my own journalling experiences, I must state that that reviewer must never have kept a journal. This format is definitely not for everyone. But it is a true, one sided, narrative that is very typical of journal writing. Everything is seen through the eyes (writing) of the main character. Being in the first person, it is going to be prejudice at times. But there is also a frankness that cannot be gained from other forms of writing. I could feel what she was feeling.My only regret was that Mattie took so long to find out why she was chosen a bride to Luke Spencer. Some reviewers called her a forward thinker, ahead of her times. But I found her to be completely naive to the the ways of a man and woman.I don't want to give too much away, but if you like diary style writing, and history of the frontier, read this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I picked up this book on a whim, always interested to read a Diary-type format as they read quickly and yet you feel &quot;sneaky&quot; and intrusive somehow reading what you would normally view as personal text. Mattie Spenser was really a rebel in her own day, questioning why women had to constantly submit to every whim and demand of a man. The book is interesting throughout - yet as a woman living in the 90's - I sure woulda changed the ending! Thank God women have come as far as they have. Great read Sandra Dallas.....keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I felt like this was more of a writer's exercise in historical diary keeping than an actual diary. I liked Mattie herself but I kept thinking that the author had made a list of required elements that appear in authentic historical diaries that she checked off as she worked each into her book. Worst of all, however, was the ending. Mattie falters and loses sight of her true self and the story gets buried in a Hollywood ending."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Set in post-civil war times, Mattie Spenser arrives by wagon in the eastern part of Colorado with a brand new husband. The author portrays the hardships they encounter through a diary of Maddie Spencer, recently unearthed. Hardship, infant mortality, betrayal, frugality, drought and loss give a lot of competition to the rag tag Indian threats. Maddie's strong spirit meets the obstacles and moves on, accepting the dictates of her husband in a very sobering attitude of submission. Very Cather-ish, the author hits the right notes for the austerity and characterization. Anyone unfamiliar with the eastern portion of Colorado, should put away visions of a mountainous land, and think instead of Kansas. Brutally cold or brutally hot, with no trees for shade or shelter - truly an inhospitable landscape. The reader is shown that marriage was quite a different institution during these times - from Mattie to the Indian bride to the wife used for breeding and labor. Or...is it? Somethings do stay very much the same. This story is not just a tale of the pioneering spirit, but a celebration of women and the sacrifices all have made. I would never call it a romance novel. Well researched and beautifully written, strikes a very honest tone."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Sometimes your lucky day strikes and you come upon a novel that meets all your favorite topics and interests.

There, Luke challenges the land hoping to farm, and Mattie works hard to make a home in their sod house. She becomes pregnant immediately and must deliver her first child in the company of men. Mattie and Luke's marriage is stable, but Luke has some secrets and over the years Mattie discovers them. Other men see the beauty and strength in Mattie, for she is a fine lady and well respected. She easily fits in the group of men, as they discuss the issues of farming, indian revolts and homesteading. It is a very difficult life as the indians are a constant threat, alternating the kidnapping of women and children with outright murdur. Food and provisions are scarce and the risks of disease are a constant fear. Their days are long and the work is hard. There are few luxuries. A long forgotten piece of chocolate fallen into the corner of their traveling trunk serves as a treat to be scavenged and eaten. The reader is astonished at the strength these people had to have to survive in such stark and barren land. You will be pleased with the details and even more so with the plot of the story. Travel to the big city, Denver City and learn what it was like to stay in the hotel and explore the city. It is a wonderful book and I hated to come to the last page. You will, too."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"After reading &quot;These Is My Words&quot; I found &quot;The Diary of Mattie Spenser&quot;, another book in diary format. How lucky I was to take a chance and order this from Amazon! It was a very good read and made me stop all my other projects and read this book! I only hope Sandra Dallas has more books to come. The &quot;Persian Pickle Club&quot; by Sandra Dallas was also a good book."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Sandra Dallas can number me among her devoted fans. I haven't read anything yet from her that I haven't admired. And I delighted in THE DIARY OF MATTIE SPENSER; couldn't put it down.As always with a book by Ms. Dallas, she has researched thoroughly so that her readers can truly understand the time and the place in which she sets her story.MATTIE opens with the pioneers on the wagon train to what was then the Colorado Territory. Most of the story then unfolds on the prairie where this new bride and her husband settle. This was a place so isolated and so bleak that we now know it drove many women, and a few men, to madness.Certainly, we understand these hardships as we sit in our warm homes, reading under the light of a good lamp. But seeing the hardships spelled out, as Dallas does here, reminds us of the extent of the woes that these people endured, and the stoicism with which they accepted their realities. Indian attacks, isolation, no plumbing, heat, light, medicine, plus childbirth fever...well, we now have a lot for which to be thankful. And the distance that, as a population, we have moved in just a century is highlighted by this diary.Part of Dallas' skill is that she always inhabits her characters so perfectly, giving them their voices. Mattie, as Dallas writes her, is a woman of extraordinary virtues. Decent, educated, kind and capable, she accepts her bridegroom's choices and defines the old-fashioned concept of &quot;helpmate.&quot;Like all of Ms. Dallas' novels, this story pivots on a terrible secret, the worst secret she has written to date. I must admit that I was upset with the outcome here, though I cannot see how the diary could have ended in any other way. Still, Mattie's decision is thought-provoking in terms of today's women, and it highlights how far women have come in terms of both our rights and our freedoms within society.I admired the concept of writing this story in the form of diary entries. Since Ms. Dallas apparently is a leading expert on Colorado frontier history, I cannot help wondering how much of MATTIE may be fact-based.Truth or fiction, it doesn't matter. THE DIARY OF MATTIE SPENSER is a wonderful book that will stay with its admirers for years after it first is read."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"It has been five years since I picked up this book in the library on a whim and the story has stayed with me ever since - so much so that I finally decided to look it up here and see what others had to say. It's certainly not great literature but there is something about Dallas's straight forward manner and story presentation that is compelling and very believable. I'm amazed that I can still remember most of the book. Mattie's attempt to make a go of life in the wilderness and all the obstacles - both emotional and physical - that she encounters are page turners. A few years later I discovered an even better book along the same lines: Angle of Repose by Wallace Stegner."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I enjoyed this book , but would not consider it a &quot;great read&quot;. I found the content to be very interesting, but I generally do not enjoy the Diary format, and I ws a bit bored with Mattie's style. In addition, I felt as if the adventures and misadventures of Mattie Spenser were too numerous to be believable. I think that the major obstacle, besides the hard work of settling a new land, and the dangers of doing that, would have been unbelievable boredom and loneliness . I just finished Willa Cather's My Antonia, which is a classic written in 1918, dealing with the same subject, and the difference in styles is very dramatic. Cather writes literature. Dallas writes a good story."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I have now read three of Sandra Dallas' four books and have loved all three. This book is about a young woman who heads west to Colorado, married to a man she hardly knows. I kept forgetting at times that it was not a true story. The book details the hard life on the Colorado plains, her husband's wandering eye and heart and her heartbreaks and triumphs. This is NOT a romance novel but more like a history of one pioneer woman, her friends and her life. After reading Ms. Dallas' first two books, I e-mailed the author to tell her how much I have enjoyed her novels and she actually answered the e-mail back herself! I was really surprised at that. She is currently working on another book to be out sometime next spring and I am anxiously awaiting its publication. This is just a good solid read, hard to put down..."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Once I began to read The Diary of Matty Spencer I bonded with her and my heart went out to her. She seemed to be a bit undesirable in her home town but then comes the day when the man of her dreams comes and wants to court her. He wants a short courtship as he has plans to move west to Iowa. So she must make up her mind and it is not easy in those days without phones or even quick mail. But she makes her choice and then the sorrows that follow.Mattie turns out to be a very real person and not without fault and you wonder all thru the book if she will ever find happiness.I enjoyed getting to know her and also reading other Sandra Dallas books that will mention her in her home town.If you want to read a book that is true to the era Mattie lived in this is the one as Sandra Dallas does her homework to bring in the times, struggles etc..they dealt with in the days of moving westward. I suggest you read it if you like pioneer stories that are true to the times, realistic and you will get absorbed into her life while you read. It was hard to put down.I also read The Chili Queen by Sandra Dallas where it was a good read I hated the ending. I also read Alice's Tulips and enjoyed it very much. I tried to get into The Persian Pickle Club but just never was able to get beyond chapter one or two. If it is a good book I would love to hear a review on it. And Buster Midnight's Cafe was so stupid I had to put it down and never did finish it either."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This is the second time I've read this book and enjoyed it so much! I even ordered two extra copies for friends and they loved it and have passed it on to friends. A true adventure and I didn't want it to end!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This book was an enjoyable experience. I enjoyed getting inside Mattie's thoughts and feelings. I felt she was a very realistic character and someone I would like to know. This is not a story of love at first sight, or a honeymoon and happily ever after. This is a story of how love grows in the difficult times. Mattie realizes she had fantisized a life that wasn't real. She evolves and discovers what real, lasting love is and the sacrifices it entails."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"The story was intriguing until the last 20% or so. The tragedy, loss, and betrayal experienced by Mattie surely warranted a more pioneering ending. The story would have been far better served by having her make a complete break with her upbringing and embracing the lifestyle that she has come to know, which cares little for convention and more for survival.Johnnie deserved better than to be swept aside and forgotten for nothing. Luke is detestable and did not deserve to get just what he wanted. Instead of creating a satisfying resolution, the ending made me sorry I'd read the book."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"When asked for a book I would recommend, this is my first suggestion every time. I enjoy every book Sandra Dallas writes, this it the my all time favorite. Her surprise endings sneak up on you, and leave you in a state of shock."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Life in the untamed west was difficult for everyone, but especially for women. Their hardships often led to death or madness. Isolation, Indians, harsh conditions for child-bearing, back-breaking work, and, many times, an inconsiderate husband made these women age beyond their years and die before their time. Such was the life of Mattie Spenser, a young woman forging west with her new husband to build a life on a homestead in Colorado in the 1860's. We follow Mattie's most private thoughts as she enters all she experiences in this, her journal.The story Mattie writes is filled with patience, compassion, discouragement, and fear as she struggles not only with a new marriage, but also with taming the wild land. She loses three children and discovers the secrets of her husband, all of which almost shatter her life. Some people don't survive on the feral land, and there were times Mattie had doubts of her own survival.Ms Dallas tells her story in a realistic, heart-warming manner, filling it with the fear, strength, sadness, loss and humor of the amazing women who settled the west. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"When I plucked this one off the shelf I was iffy. But it wasn't a daunting book, and looked like it would be a breeze to finish off even if it didn't entirely hold my interest. You know those books - the kind that aren't page turners but are good enough to keep going, unless they're 400 pages and not worth it.I became wrapped up in this one quickly, and it's not just the author's writing style as Mattie, but Mattie's personality. I don't know how authentic it is - this era isn't really my thing - but it certainly has the feel of authenticity.The critical review (\\"Trite and Formulaic\\") baffled me. I don't know that a book using a checked off list of required elements would have this much substance and life to it. And the ending didn't strike me as Hollywood at all, but entirely in keeping with the ways of the world at that time. In fact, had it ended the way it might otherwise have, I'd have said THAT would be a Hollywood ending.And why that reviewer feels the written ending reflects Mattie faltering and losing sight of her true self really puzzles me. She's just going to do it anyway? I don't think so. Maybe in 2008, but not then. I don't want to go into this more - it will give too much away."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I started this book because my DIL wanted to read it together. Well, she forgot but I kept reading it and became totally engrossed in this fascinating account of a young woman on the frontier. I love Sandra Dallas' historical fiction, and this one was up to her same standards. I was really surprised to see it has been 10 years since she wrote it. I am sorry that I didn't get around to reading this book sooner! It has suspense, and yearning, motherhood, grief, recovery... it was just an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This book gave a clear description on what prairie life was like for woman. They were isolated and worked like an animal on a farm. It just proves that prairie life for women was a lot harder than for men. I loved the book so much I gave it to my husband to read. He could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. I FELT MATTIE'S PAIN AND HARDSHIPS.SUCH A STRONG WOMAN. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"It's impossible not to feel part of Mattie's life, as she records her journey to Colorado Territory in a diary in 1865. Just married, she adores her husband, Luke -- who may not love her as much as the girl he left behind. Nonetheless, Mattie is determined to be the best wife and mother she can be. But Luke's secrets come close to destroying any happiness either of them may have.In addition to the Spensers' story, there are many colorful sideplots, pertaining to the folks they've left behind and those they've met in their new settlement. Dallas does a great job in creating memorable characters that remain in readers' minds."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I read 40 to 50 books a year. My sister loaned this title to me. It sat among my load of &quot;to read&quot; books for weeks. When I picked it up, I could barely put it down. It's a strong story of pioneers, of the fortitude of women, of the endurance of friendship. I really enjoyed the journal format of writing. Cannot wait to read Ms. Dallas' other books. This story will stay with me for a long time. Not for a minute would I want her to tell me less about life on the prairie. And the marriage ups and downs are true to modern relationships. A GOOD READ!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I cried at the end of this book, was surprised and gladdened by its ending. I took pleasure in reading Mattie's words in her diary. But I also wanted to take a swift kick at foolish Luke. Even knowing that Mattie was being played a fool, I still kept reading.In truth, I was not thrilled to read of Mattie's devotion to her cad of a spouse. I tired of her imprisonment in this marriage where her &quot;dear boy&quot; really loved another woman and trifled on her. But I admired her determination to survive their primitive, pioneer life and its heartbreaks. I guess I was just too determined to finish it anyway. And it was worth it!Once again, Sandra Dallas has created a fine retrospective novel that is framed in the discovery of a very elderly woman's grandmother's diary. With all the emphasis on women telling their history, I can see where Dallas found her lure for this tale. I especially liked the characters on the frontier who surrounded Mattie, however, and was fearful for her in her left-alone state. The horrors she faced sometimes reminded me of another Mattie in Charles Portis' True Grit.This touching story is a historical romance, something that I thought I no longer wanted to read. But I did read it and am glad. I want to read the next Sandra Dallas book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I could not put this book down! During the day (at work,etc) I found myself wondering what would happen to Mattie. I couldn't wait to get home and find out. This was the first book of Sandra Dallas' that I read. I am loking forward to another soon! ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"THIS BOOK WAS AN EASY READ. I LEARNED SOME MORE ABOUT THE HARDSHIPS OF THE PEOPLE \\"MOVING WEST\\". SOME OF THE DIARY WAS VERY SAD BUT TRUE TO THOSE TIMES. I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN AS \\"TOUGH\\" AS SHE WAS BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This is my first book I've read by Sandra Dallas and it won't be my last!! Am looking forward to reading Tall Grass. AWESOME book."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This story is so interesting; I feel as though I am reading an actual old diary written by bright young early American woman. So descriptive, and the characters are all completely real to me. I will look forward to other books by Sandra Dallas."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"A very good book. Sad in places,but the kind of book you can't put down."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I almost didn't download this to my kindle after reading some of the reviews. That would have been a big mistake. I could not put it down. I have been a great fan of Sandra Dalles for years."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"If your in the mood for a pioneering/love story look no further! What a difficult life Mattie had yet she continued on (although I'm not sure she had much choice). It was a fantastic read, if you enjoyed the Little house on the prairie series you'll probably like this as an adult."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This was just a grrrrreat book & story line too! I loved it & am now looking forward to reading her other books too. I read ALOT, like several books a week, but this caused me to stay up all night reading to the end!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I loved this story,I have read two of the books that Ms Dallas has written and enjoyed both very much.I will be reading more of her books."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This book truly paints the picture and gives the feel of what it was like for the women who moved to Colorado to homestead. As it is written in Diary form, it can be read for just a few minutes each day. I read it to one of my Hospice patients who was unable to communicate. The diary entries gave natural breaks for 30 minutes of reading. When she passed away, we had not completed the book, so I bought it so I could finish it. The end of the book was filled with surprise and left me amazed over Mattie's courage and strength. Amazing Book!!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This was a very engrossing, interesting American pioneer story. In our pampered modern times, I enjoy reading about our tough forefathers and foremothers, and this book is a great example of that genre.
