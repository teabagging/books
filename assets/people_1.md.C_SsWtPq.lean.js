They are both fine books, especially because they have caught the rabid fascination of kids and inspired them to read. However,the magic in both books is so ubiquitous that it comes across as mundane. Rowling is one of those writers who actually overdoes it in the imagination department. She really lets her imagination run rough-shod over the story itself. She seems to have an obsession with making every doorknob, photo, stack of cards, candle, teapot, cup, article of clothing, utensil, and SPECK OF DUST into some magical entity. Instead of using good writing and clever metaphor to create atmosphere or detail, Rowling simply makes everything into a magical object.Instead of letting the magic &quot;pop up&quot; in strategic, choice places (adding to the sense of mystery and wonder), we are bombarded with it at every turn until it becomes ho-hum. I wouldn't be surprised if the kitchen sink ends up being enchanted in one of these books, or if Harry sits down on a talking toilet seat one day (Moaning Myrtle notwithstanding).While Rowling is a decent story-teller, she is a bit of a hack as a writer. Either that or she has editorial problems. There are a number of misspellings and grammatical errors in this work. The episodes in Chamber lack cohesion and often seem arbitrary, as if Rowling is letting her indulgent imagination lead her off into pointless detours rather than allowing a harmonious progression of the story. Some scenes end abruptly, or seem altogether pointless and plotless. Harry is a good character, but he is one-dimensional, like almost everyone in the book. I think Rowling fills her story with so much gratuitous magic to cover up the fact that her characters are really not very developed or interesting. It's just like a blockbuster movie filled with non-stop, pointless special effects in the hope that no one will notice that the script stinks and the characters are made out of cardboard.The book also lacks the sort of &quot;pure in heart&quot; hallmark of all the great children's books (Narnia, Oz, etc. etc.) and the characters don't appear to stand for anything greater than themselves.For example, all poor Hermione does is roll her eyes and complain. Harry runs from one scene to the next never really revealing much about himself--just reacting (or overreacting) to everyone in this Magically-Overloaded world. He has about as much depth as a kiddie pool. Draco Malfoy is capable only of smug smirking and run-of-the mill pot-shots. The adult teachers at the Hogwart's school are also somewhat lacking in warmth, personality, or teaching value--which is usually a good thing to have in a child's book. I'm convinced that the Potter series is pretty much what happens when an entire book is based upon rampant, aimless imagination. Keep in mind that I'm writing this review of Chamber of Secrets from an adult perspective. I heard that a great many adults were becoming groupies of this series so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I give this book(and the 1st) 4 stars for their value for kids 8-12, but I can't see why any adult past the age of 20 would want to read the whole series. Two were more than enough for me.I had no sense of wonder when reading this book, and that was disappointing. However, it's fantastic that so many young people are reading because of this fabulous series of stories and this will translate into kids reading even more (and even better)books besides. I also think it's pretty wonderful that Rowling overcame financial hardships to make her tales a success. That's pretty inspiring. But I feel Rowling's writing in Chamber of Secrets is still too amateurish to please serious adult fans of great children's literature. For adults, I would give it one star and suggest rediscovering CS Lewis or Tolkien."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Asked for a new book, paid a new book price, but received something far from it. The book has clearly been read a few times. Dirty, Torn binding, creases in the outer cover, and what looks like Kool-aid stains on the pages. Delivery was slow as well. I am not happy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book I chose was Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling. This type of book was fictional fantasy. The setting takes place on Privet Drive in London, England. It's not there for very long though. It soon get's changed to the Weasely's house which they call \\"The Burrell.\\" Soon they would leave to go to Hogwarts School. I felt this book is the worst one yet. I felt this way because for a lot of the story I found myself dosing off. Yes, there were some points when I was slightly interested. I thought the first book was much better. The main idea on the story was that the Chamber of Secrets was opened and because of that there were attacks happeing on the students at the school. If they couldnt't be stopped then Hogwarts would have to be closed down. It was a very unique style of writing and I found myself struggling to understand certain names and parts as to what they were saying. You might just say it was a bit confusing. Yet interesting. The main character is Harry Potter. He is a wizard in the story. He is not the smartest person but is very intellegent. Harry plays on the Quddich team. Harry gets along with pretty much everbody except Draco Malfoy. There is a lot of dialogue in this book, there was a lot of conversation going on. I feel the intended age for this book was from age 15 and up only I have some trouble getting into these kinds of books so there is an exception to me. I feel it was kind of a bad book so I didn't particularly like it, but I would gladly recommend if to anyone with an immagination out of this world. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a book about a young boy who finds out he is a famous wizard.Harry and his freind Ginny go deeper into the underground &quot;maze&quot; beneath his school Hogwarts than in book one.Harry and Ginny go down the drain to get to the Chamber of Secrets and finds out that thats where the evil lord Voldamort is hiding.Voldamort tries to kill Harry and Ginny but fails.

I have fallen in love with Harry Potter after years of refusing to read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was a little afraid that this book would not live up to the high standards set in the first. Sequels often disappoint by their very nature. If a book was monumental enough to spawn a follow-up, then that follow-up has got to be equally brilliant. As with movies, few authors succeed. Those that have - Tolkein, C. S. Lewis, Terry Brooks, Stephen King - do it because they try harder than some and, consequently, their skills sharpen and become second nature. Sometimes even first.Such is the case with J.K. Rowling. If you thought that the first book lucked its way onto the bestseller lists and the bookshelves of nearly ever kid in the world, this book will throw some serious doubts your way. Equally intricate and broader in scope, Rowling pulls out all the stops. We learn that there is more than one way for evil to return. It might just never leave.Once again we find the loveable characters we've grown to love and hate in Harry Potter's world. We worry about his adventurous nature and incessant refusal to confide in his headmaster. We feel the beginnings of a cute crush. We gain more backstory and are left in awe at how masterfully she weaves story threads from book to book.In short, this book continues our love affair with Harry Potter and his world and that is the most we could ask for from a sequel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is my favorite Potter volume, it seems appropriate to note in this space the tremendous contribution Jim Dale has made to the art of audiobooks. Mr. Dale's far-reaching career as actor, singer, and comedian has now burst into the field of narration. His Potter reads are both touching and hillarious, and he keeps the unabridged texts moving at a steady clip, barely giving the listener a chance to breath as he leaps from character voice to character voice. Very few audiobooks offer such an inspired blending of reader and material."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My children and I read these wondeful books together. It makes for great family time with one to two chapters read aloud each night. They would rather hear this than watch T.V.

Rawling for creating some real magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a great book for people who like problems to solve and mysteries to answer.

Not only does it make a smooth transition but the plot thickens. Harry comes home for the summer to the Dursley's (his aunt and uncle) house who are mean and nasty to him. One night while locked in his room a tiny creature visits him to warn Harry of danger if he returns to Hogwarts (his school). He ignores the warning and goes back after Ron Weasley and his brothers come and rescue Harry from the Dursley's. The Weasley's and Harry go to buy their new school books and this is where Gilderoy Lockhart is introduced, he is the new professor at Hogwarts. Upon Harry's arrival back, trouble starts almost immediately including a flying car accident, Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy (who is always looking to start trouble), and Gilderoy Lockhart who seems very suspicious). I could not put this book down, it is loaded with event after event, no room to breate btween them. I highly reccomend this and all the other Harry Potter books to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling returns with her second book in the Harry Potter series. Once again, I found myself amused and amazed by her storytelling abilities. She continues to appeal to both adults and children while remaining true to the spirit of the first book in the series. Rowling takes us deeper into the minds of her characters as she continues their fascinating development. Readers young and old will be captivated by the story, in which a mysterious old evil begins attacking the students around Harry, before finally getting to those closest to him. A few secrets to the unsolved mysteries left from Book One are revealed as the story progresses, which begins to show that this series is not simply a collection of stand-alone adventures, but one epic story as well. As a 23-year-old fan of the series, I recommend that whether you are young or old, you pick up this series and lose yourself in it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a very good book.Once I started reading it, I could not put it down.

Harry Potter is a 12 year old wizard who lives with his Aunt and Uncle who love their son but hate Harry. He goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in London. He stays with Ron and Hermoine, his best friends, on the train to Hogwarts each year. This year at Hogwarts, something very strange is going on. People are getting preserved...they look into the eyes of some strange creature and become petrefied with fear. What is this creature and how do they stop it? If you just have to find out, you'll HAVE to read the series.Review by Ash"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What a great story, for adults too. The great mix of mystery and wizardry made this book a page turner for me. I kept reading because I wanted to know what the Chamber of Secrets was all about. All the adventures Harry, Ron and Hermione were amusing as well. Since the book was written for pre-teens, most of the themes, such as belong to a group and having a school bully, are easily relatable to that age group. However, as an adult, I found the book to be a wonderful light hearted story with a feel-good ending. Besides, all of us (even adults) can relate to belonging to a group and being around a bully. I'll just to have to keep reading to see what Harry does next!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry potter an dthe chamber of secrets is the best one yet.

Who opened the Chamber of Secrets indeed? Of course I won't tell you! Found it out yourself.

It was therefore a waste of money for me."},{"Title":"Country Living Crafting Vintage Style: Charming Projects for Home & Garden","review":"A few pretty pictures and little substance. I purchased this book and her &quot;Decorating Vintage Style&quot;. Very few ideas in either book - pretty cover, a few pictures, very little text. Neither are worth the purchase price. If you are looking for a vintage decorating or craft book, any other than these would be a better investment. For example, in the craft book, she shows, with very limited instructions and a picture or two, how to make a duvet cover. Then you use the exact same technique to make a pillow cover. For your next craft, you use the exact same technique to make an herbal slumber pillow. At 92 pages and just a few &quot;crafts&quot;, you really are loosing when she spends a quarter of the book &quot;teaching&quot; (very loose definition here) you to use the same technique over and over. I think she was just using filler to get a book out. I was extremely disappointed in both of her books.You are also given &quot;instructions&quot; on how to make a celebration skirt. Later in the book you find the exact same instructions on how to make a summer skirt. She did the same thing with a few blankets, too. You will not glean any new ideas from this book, I'm quite sure. And if you are a complete beginner at sewing, her instructions are not sufficient. If you are an experienced sewist or crafts person, you've probably already made everything in the book.The book contains &quot;30 stunning projects that will make a room loving and warm&quot;. They are:Scalloped shelf edging, simple slipcovers, summer curtain, basin skirt (using velcro hang gathered fabric from sink), heart shape cushion (cut a heart shape - stuff), beaded pot cover (trim a piece of fabric with lace and beads - hang over a pot), storage boxes (purchased boxes covered with your fabric), fabric covered basket, greeting cards (fold a piece of cardstock - decorate - my children do this all the time), cozy cushions (instructions repeated throughout book on different projects), clothespin board (nail clothespins to a board), dog blanket, dog bowl mat (cover board with some oilcloth), herbal slumber pillow (same techniques as cushions), duvet cover (basically same technique as cushions), summer skirt, scented sachets - sew a tube, tie with a ribbon, laundry bags (sew a sack - insert a cord)), plaid teddy bear (cut out teddy bear shape - stuff - my children thought it was kind of ugly), celebration skirt (same as summer skirt but embroider with running stitches Merry Christmas (or something else) along hem), tab headed curtains (same as summer curtains basically), fabric roses (strips of unhemmed fabrics gathered into a &quot;rose&quot;, gardener's apron (you make your own pattern from looking at her picture), linen-covered journal, frayed napkins (edge stitch pieces of linen and fray. She does not tell you to pull a thread to get these on grain as it will not turn out if you don't), lined picnic basket (using your own pattern cut fabric to line your wire or wicker basket), child's play tent (edge finish some fabric and hang over a clothesline), beach rug (edge finish some fabric). That's it. The same techniques repeated.Any of my children's crafts books are cheaper and contain much more in the way of ideas and instructions.Good points:The photos are nice, as the author used to be a stylist for magazines. Her fabrics are pretty too. She owns Cabbages and Roses and uses her products throughout the book."},{"Title":"Country Living Crafting Vintage Style: Charming Projects for Home & Garden","review":"I do a lot of crafting so don't need a lot of directions, just incredible thought provoking, inspiring, make you feel like you are there breathing the country air, romantic.

Do not be misled by the blurb on the jacket.Bush's writing doesn't have the zing of Evanovich's stories, and the first-person narrative from the heroine is full of long descriptive passages detailing how someone's yard looks or what kind of food is being eaten. The dialogue is fine, but there's simply not enough of it to make up for the long descriptive passages detailing what kind of room the narrator is in and what things are hanging up in it. The long passages made it hard for me to stay interested in the pedestrian plot (sorely lacking in action and dialogue), and I ended up skipping the last 100 pages to get to the ending.I will not read another book in this series, but will read the next Evanocich book.

The Jane Kelly character is nowhere near as funny, likable or enjoyable to read about. The character feels contrived and forced. She's more annoying than quirky and likeable. Seriously, anyone who is so hungry she's thought about eating her dogs kibble ought to go grocery shopping. Ten bucks will at least buy 5 cans of chili and a six-pack of diet coke! But where Nancy Bush really lost me was when Jane wakes up one morning and is \\"seriously pissed off\\" that her dog is sleeping in her bed. Come on, it's so obvious that dead great Aunt Eugiene's dog, The Binkster, (left to Jane) is supposed to be Jane's K-9 sidekick. So why Nancy Bush makes her \\"heroine\\" pissed is beyond me. If you've never read a Janet Evanovich novel put this one-day and pick up One for the Money right now!! If you are a fan of Stephanie Plum and are hoping for another fun female heroine, go ahead pick this book up. I'd be shocked if you think Jane is a likeable character."},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"Look out, Patricia Cornwell! The competition just got a little tougher with new author Nancy Bush entering the mystery book market.Nancy Bush's lovable character, Jane Kelly, an information specialist, makes it hard to stop reading with her down-to-earth personality, quirky friends and relatives--and undercover investigative techniques. Her natural curious tendencies keep her on the complex murder case even after her ungrateful client has fired her, and this lands her between a rock and a hard place, literally.In addition to Jane Kelly, Nancy Bush brings many colorful characters to life with memorable details and a diverse set of personalities. There's:-- Tess, the rich, old divorcee with questionable ethics.-- Cotton, Tess' ex and the richest man in town who parades around with his much younger bride and owner of the \\"island.\\" a much-sought-after piece of real estate.-- Dwayne, Jane's boss and not so obvious admirer, teaching Jane Kelly the ropes of the PI business.-- Murphey the on-again, off-again lover we don't want to forget about.I really enjoyed this book and am glad to have been introduced to such a wonderful first-time author.Armchair Interviews says: This is a book that keeps you guessing, \\"who done it\\" to the very end--the real test of a good mystery read."},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"I just read this and couldn't put it down.

Highly recommend these books!"},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"If you're looking for a very light read with minimal tension, almost no action, and more description than dialogue, then this book is just for you.Nancy Bush's first book is written in the first person from the point of view of Jane Kelley, a sometimes process server/private eye who seems to spend more time obsessing about her empty refrigerator and how to cadge a free drink than actually doing any investigating.She is hired by Tess, the ex-wife of Lake Chinook's richest man, Cotton Reynolds, to find out what happened to their son, Bobby - who allegedly killed his wife and children, then disappeared. Add in Bobby's best friend, Murphy, who just happens to be Jane's ex, and you have the formula for a good murder mystery. Unfortunately, the set-up doesn't follow through. When the body finally shows up, it is obvious - at least to this reader - who the killer is. But the author continues with another hundred pages before revealing the answer, and even then, it's a bit of a letdown.Bush spends so much time on description of the broken-down cottage, empty larder, and lakeside bar that the mystery is lost in the details. There is a lot of promise here, but it hasn't quite reached the top of the murder mystery pack as of yet.Reviewed by Vicky Burkholder9/4/2006"},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"This was an amusing and entertaining read that will offer a little something for everyone. Humor, mystery, and a dash of romance.Jane Kelly is single, in her early thirties, and living in a small town where fashion and what have you are not the important thing. She followed a boyfriend to this small town, and than he left, taking her broken heart with him. It's small, quiet, and...dead bodies are being found! To add to Jane's full plate her mom keeps saying she's moving there as well! On top of that she's been asked to interview a person who's son mysteriously disappeared after murdering his own family. Did he kill his family, and if so why? If he didn't than where was he, and who did kill them? Oh, and Murphy is back. So now Jane has taken on the job despite her inner voice saying not to, and Dwayne her boss is becoming a little more yummy as time goes on...not that she'll admit this even to herself. And she's knee deep into a mystery that begs to be solved.Well, questions are leading to more questions, and answers are not what they seem. Jane has her work cut out for her but some how she'll manage to land on her feet and solve the mystery of what on earth happened to Bobby.This was a very entertaining read. Characters are plentiful and colorful. I loved \\"Binkster\\" and although this story is in first person, it did not detract from the tale. Ms. Bush has created a fun character with Jane and I look forward to visiting with Jane again in the future.Official Reviewer for Romance Designs"},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"the curious case of the dog that barked in the night. Four years earlier, Bobby Reynolds wife and three children were murdered in cold blood. Bobby was charged with the crime but he disappeared. His father, the wealthy Cotton Reynolds, lives on a private island in Lake Chinook. A number of things happen. Cotton's ex-wife hires Jane Kelly to investigate and see what she can find because she thinks Cotton may be in contact with their son Bobby, and there is a question about Cotton's will. A teenager who was trespassing on the island is injured and has a memory loss about what happened. Then Bobby's body is found in the lake.A number of characters enter into the plot including Jane's ex-boyfriend who had been Bobby's best friend, Cotton's new trophy wife, Cotton's ex-paramour from between his marriages, Cotton's step-son from his first marriage, real estate agents who want the island, various spear carriers, and several dogs including one that Jane seems to inherit.As Jane becomes involved, the plot thickens. There are a number of surprises, and various twists, and Jane is injured along the way. My main complaint is the number of digressions including a side plot about a teenager chasing after the jailbait niece of Jane's boss. Too many digressions can make a story drag. I would also note that the cover of the paperback edition is unrelated to story, i.e., Jane does not carry a gun and does not wear spike heels. The title is the color of the convertible that her ex-boyfriend used to drive.Overall, it is a very good first effort by the author, and introduces a new female PI. A sequel has been published."},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"I am an avid reader (and collector) of all books by Janet Evanovich, Sue Grafton, Lisa Scottoline, and Susan Wittig Albert.

I found the descriptive narrative \\"put\\" me along side Jane and her surroundings, seeing, hearing and feeling what Jane did.This book offers humor, mystery and some romance, and anyone who has ever had a pet will easily relate to the progression of Jane's affection for Binky.

After killing his wife and children, Bobby vanished--and has been gone for four years. So why now is Bobby's mother asking process server and almost-a-private-detective Jane Kelly to look into the mystery? Certainly it has something to do with the rumors that Bobby's father, Cotton, is sick and may not be around much longer--that and the fact that if Cotton dies, there's a lot of money that's going to change hands.Jane is reluctant to get involved with the mystery. After all, four years before, her boyfriend, Murphy, broke up with her and headed out of town when he couldn't deal with the reality that his best friend had become a killer. With both Cotton and Bobby's mother in denial, trying to believe good things about their son, Jane knows she's going to be uncomfortable. Still, five hundred dollars for a single meeting is impossible to turn down. And Jane really does want to prove to her sometimes boss, Dwayne, that she can handle the job on her own.Jane spends a lot of time thinking about exactly what to wear (generally Nikes, but sometimes flip-flops or \\"strappy sandals,\\" caging free drinks at the exclusive lakeside restaurant, and obsessing about her long-lost but possibly restarting relationship with Murphy, but can't seem to let go of the mystery even when her client tells her to drop it.Author Nancy Bush fills her story with slightly shady characters--from Cotton and his fleet of wives and lovers, to the three men who circle Jane like hawks (Murphy, Dwaine, and Booth), to the dogs, both dangerous and not-so-much who play a critical role in establishing both the mystery and the resolution.If you're looking for a light beach-time read, you'll find CANDY APPLE RED to be just the thing."},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"Although Jane Kelly is thirty, she has yet to settle on a permanent career valuing her freedom that a nine to five career would stifle. At the moment she is working for information specialist (a fancy title for private eye) Dwayne Durbin handing out eviction notices and working as a process server. She agrees to work for Tess Bradbury who wants her to find out what her ex-husband Cotton Reynolds knows about their son Bobby.Four years ago, Bobby put a bullet in the head of his wife and three children before vanishing into thin air. A massive manhunt by several state and federal agencies turned up nothing. Jane thinks Cotton won't talk to her because he only knew her through Tim Murphy, Bobby's best friend and her ex-lover. After the murders Murphy left town, refusing to believe Bobby could commit such a heinous crime. Now he's back and he wants Jane to join him in Santa Fe but she is obsessed with learning the truth about what happened to Bobby. There are many people who want her to stop her investigation and one will go to any lengths to see that she does.Nancy Bush has written a delightfully witty and charming crime caper starring a charmingly original heroine who knows herself only too well and accepts her flaws because she refuses to change. She's feisty and funny and connects with the audience in a way most characters rarely do. The mystery is well thought out and totally entertaining so that readers will be eager to read the next tale in this series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"I am new to the mystery arena and bought this book on a recommendation and I am sure glad I did. Splashed with humor and suspense, it was interesting from start to finsh."},{"Title":"Candy Apple Red (Jane Kelly Mysteries)","review":"REVIEWER'S OPINION:This is a humorous mystery series using the same formula used in the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. A comment on the cover of Candy Apple Red states \\"Move over Stephanie Plum, Jane Kelly has arrived.\\" In Candy Apple Red, Jane Kelly is a process server and a beginner-level private investigator. She has very little money and not many clothes. There is some sexual tension between Jane and her sometimes boss private investigator Dwayne. I laughed out loud many times while reading the first Stephanie Plum book, but I only laughed twice while reading Candy Apple Red. For readers who love the Plum series and want to read something similar, they might enjoy this more than I did. To date, there are two Jane Kelly sequels: Electric Blue and Ultra Violet. Generally, I'm not a fan of mysteries, but I enjoy them if there is a lot of comedy or romance. However, that is not the case in this book, which was mostly mystery.STORY BRIEF:Four years ago Bobby Reynolds allegedly killed his wife and three children and disappeared. Bobby's parents, Tess and Cotton are divorced. Tess believes Cotton may have been in contact with Bobby recently. Tess hires Jane to talk to Cotton to see what she can learn about Bobby. Jane was in love with Murphy who broke up with Jane four years ago and left town. All of a sudden, Murphy comes back to town and is interested in Jane again.DATA:Story length: 334 pages.

So refreshing to have a new mystery series to love!"},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"I have to admit, I read this book primarily so that I could selfishly affirm what I thought of as my theory: that in two dimensions, gravity would be proportional to the inverse of distance, as opposed to the inverse square law we know and love. I was surprised and overwhelmed that Dewdney includes this observation as one among many, of which others are much more important. Dewdney crafts this discussion of two-dimensions by setting up a fictional university scenario and aside from addressing the implications of a 2D world, also adds the implications and disbelief that a discovery of this kind might cause on earth. The story is one for anyone who has thought about differences in dimension, and truly made me think about how simple, yet complex our world would seem to a four dimensional being. Dewdney even includes an appendix of distinct ramifications of two-dimensions on different fields of science. (Maybe the fact that every reviewer so far has given this book five stars means something... GO READ IT!)"},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"When I was in high-school I had a very intelligent and immensely helpful English teacher, who taught me much of what writing skill I possess today. He came in highly excited one morning, to share with us about a new book he'd come across. Evidently, they had, through a computer, discovered an entirely new reality, that was two-dimensional! And this was an actual event, cutting edge stuff.Well, a few days later, he came in, quite chagrined, to tell us that, as he read further through the book, he realized it was a work of fiction. But his description had been interesting enough to motivate me to read the book.The Planiverse's reality is that real, and supported by that much scientific and mathematical principle- Dewdney has done his research, to bring us one of the most delightful what-ifs I've found. Imagine reality just like ours, but take out the third dimension. Everything is well supported, every area of life covered, and the drawings immensely helpful. You truly begin to feel for all the characters in the book. But it's not just an exercise in mathematical possibility. It is a rich story, telling of spiritual journey and insight, as Yendred travels to find his answers. And I still remember the ending as grippingly and eerily numinous, as we realize how closely the Planiverse and our Universe are connected, and how limited we are in comparison to the Eternal."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"Once every hundred years or so, a new reality is discovered. In 1884 Edwin Abbott's classic, Flatland, captured readers' imaginations with and ingenious excursion into a two-dimensional society. Now, a century later, Dr. Alexander Keewatin Dewdney, a theoretical computer scientist, takes us on an exciting journey through and an amazingly complex, self-consistent two-dimensional universe. The Planiverse combines science and speculation, technology and metaphysics, in an astonishing work of the imagination that is elegant, witty, and wonderful. Dr. Dewdney created a hypothetical two-dimensional universe as an exercise for his computer science students. They developed a program called 2DWORLD to model a detailed, although somewhat primitive, planet. then one day in May 1980, something extraordinaty happened. One of the creatures began to use a word not in the computer's vocabulary--YNDRD. And as the simple graphics generated by the program grew more detailed, a strange four-armed creature appeared, surrounded by a bizarre alien landscape. Somehow, the 2DWORLD program had conected with a real two-dimensional world. the creature who appeared became known as yendred, a youthful inhabitant of Arde, a planet somewhere inside the planiverse. And so began a fantstic odyssey into a two-dimensional world--as Dr. Dewdney and his students followed Yendred on a journey across Arde, sharing his adventures, learning his history, and discussing his philosophy. With over 125 illustrations and diagrams generated from Arde, The Planiverse is a record of that contact period--the computer-aided exploration of a new reality--complete with its own physics, chemisty, biology, philosophy, and civilization. Join Yendred and Dr. Dewdney and discover new possibilities and concepts that will change the way you look at your own world. (This is one of the best books I have ever read. I stayed up late many a night reading it, totally engrossed. I became attached to the characters, I saw the whole world that is The Planiverse through the illustrations. I was dissapointed when the book had to end, I wish it could have gone on longer.)"},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"This book is simply amazing. It tells the story ofYNDRD, a two-dimensional being who makes contact withpeople on Earth through a computer program based on ahypothetical 2-D world. The tale is written as a summary ofthe computer-aided correspondence between Prof. Dewdney andhis colleagues and the so-called &quot;planiverse&quot;, with excerptsof the dialogue as it was received on the computer print-out.Immense detail is given to the descriptions of the way oflife on the two-dimensional planet, including technology,government and law, music, sports, science, and even religion.Religion was, in fact, one of the aspects which gave meextra admiration for the book and its author, because itexplores not only the religion of the Nsana (as the flatpeople call themselves), but religion in general, giving insightinto a scientific and somewhat objective view of religion.The story and its forays into alien culture are heightenedin effect by the great illustrations, and the technicalsections which go into the most detail about 2-D life.I say again, this book is simply amazing, and concludewith a recommendation to all interested in bizarre creatures,science, or just really good books."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"One of the greatest books of all-time. I don't want to over-sell it, so judge for yourselves. (heh) Seriously, this is probably the most complete fictional universe ever created. It reads like a dream and when it first came out (and I was a kid) I often wondered whether the events in the book had REALLY happened. It is that well constructed.Before it originally went out of print I bought two extra copies so that I'd never be without it, I honestly suggest you read it, and if you like it at all - do the same. It will never leave your mind, and you'll be happy about that."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"I encourage others to pick this book up. It's great for an inquisitive high schooler (as I was) or an adult.Dewdney does an excellent job of pulling the reader into the story- one feels as if they are sitting there right next to the screen, waiting for the next contact.Difficult to put down, and difficult to go back to reality afterwards."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"I read the older paperback version (with black and green) and a picture of YNDRD on the cover. I assume it is not too different from the reprinted version.When I was a child, I used to draw Flatland style landscapes and imagine physical processes like erosion occurring. Only when I was halfway through this magical book did I recall this memory of my youth, some 33 years ago! I used to draw lots of 2-d drawings of fake biological creatures like sea anemones, so I was predisposed to like the book or at least its concept.Yet I was disconcerted till I got about halfway through the book. I guess I found the 2-d world stifling and crazy, and stupid. But the more I read the more I marveled at Dewdney's inventiveness and his skill at both story-telling and technical detail.DO READ THIS BOOK! It is truly spectacular science fiction. (At least I hope it is fiction! Ha ha ha)The business about computer science professors and students getting distracted from their work rings a bell.... I too teach CS at a college though I haven't had these adventures.Having praised the book deservedly, I want to point out a few things I didn't like. THough I liked the spiritual quest of YNDRD and thought that was truly neat, I felt Dewdney could have wrapped it up in a somewhat more satisfying manner. Also the intimations of Craine, the CS student who came back mysteriously to warn off the professor, were wasted. Why have that? It piqued curiosity to no purpose. My copy of the book must have missing pages or something.Otherwise a great book!"},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"I found this in the ECSU library, and had a wonderful time perusing it when I was supposed to be doing classwork. The only thing disappointing is that it's fiction. Other then that, it's a rather realistic portrayal of some startling events. Putting aside that the computer project come to life thing is pretty obvious, the rest of this stuff is just too original to pass up. Reading the account of two foreign cultures trying to communicate through a computer program, and having the participant on their side being rather of a mystic bent, makes for some very interesting stuff, as simple as kid's adventure, and as inspiring."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"Computer scientist, mathematician, and contributor to &quot;Scientific American&quot;, A. K. Dewdney's The Planiverse: Computer Contact With A Two-Dimensional World is a superbly crafted tale of discovery and community with the two-dimensional civilization of Arde, first published in 1984 and now brought back into print by Copernicus Books. The setting is 1981 and in the computer lab of a large university a group of graduate students and their professor are hard at work on the departmental mainframe, graphically modeling an imaginary two dimensional world. The project is proceeding very well when one student suddenly notices that the world they are building on-screen is inhabited! Although a work of pure fiction, it incorporates sound mathematics and principles of computer science. The Planiverse delights the reader's imagination while serving as a cautionary tale about the difficulties of communication between one totally alien world to another."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"I really enjoyed this novel! Along with an interesting story, Dewdney does a thorough job of explaining the culture and science of a two dimensional world. He really displays some great scientific insight, clearly explained in side figures. The novel has such a complete description of another world, I doubted it was fiction for a while.I apologize for the shameless plug, but a song is also included in the novel (on page 178 of my book).

In the framework of a creative fictional story. Includes physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, \\"earth\\" science, engineering, and technology. The variety and detail is amazing, from well thought-out two-dimensional creatures to steam engines to computers. The science/technology is developed slowly; a few details are left for the appendix.

And instead of social satire, the story focuses on \\"the search for truth\\", in which an Ardean young man (YNDRD) * is guided by a guru to a higher state of understanding. The end of the book leaves everyone (except the guru) startled, wondering what has happened and what it means.Rather than geometric forms, Dewdney's two-dimensional universe is populated with objects and organisms that are analogs of those in our 3D world. Much of the fun of \\"The Planiverse\\" is seeing how such things as an animal's digestive tract -- which seems to require a third dimension -- can be made to function in two dimensions. These are shown in detailed, slightly fussy illustrations that perfectly complement the story's strangeness.Unlike Abbott, Dewdney isn't interested in the geometry of two-dimensional space (which Abbott has already covered fairly well) but in its physics, and how that physics works in two dimensions. And unlike Abbott, Dewdny's story is linear, with clear dramatic movement (in both the 2D and 3D worlds) that would make a movie adaptation trivial. Why it hasn't been adapted is a mystery -- other than the fact that most Hollywood producers would consider it too \\"intellectual\\". (SyFy could do it for the price of one of their dreadful \\"mega-fill-in-the-name-of-a-repulsive-critter\\" movies.) I'd like to see Dan Haggerty as the instructor -- his looks suggest a burned-out hippie, which would be appropriate to the storyline -- but that's my taste.I've read \\"The Planiverse\\" three times (I rarely reread books), simply because it's a fun read. If nothing else, Dewdney knows how to keep you turning the pages. He's managed to write a book about mathematics that's appealing even to people with no interest in math, simply because he tells an engaging story.* YNDWED would have been too obvious, and I suspect the author was taking a poke at Barbara Walters. And though \\"A K\\" is short for \\"Alexander Keewatin\\" (!!!), I suspect that Mr. Dewdney is also aware it's short for \\"alte kocher\\", which I will not translate into English."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two Dimensional World by AK DewdneyThe setting is a graduate program in the early 1980's. Computers are mainframes, time and resources are precious, and programs are primitive at best.A group of students led by their professor decide to model a two dimensional world--with the deptyh and horizontal axis rather than the horizontal and vertical axes of Flatland. It starts as an exercise in pure physics, mathematics and computer science, until their model somehow connects to a real two-dimensional world, and an inhabitant, YNDRD, who can hear them in his mind.And with YNDRD as our guide, we begin to learn about himself and the two dimensional Planiverse that makes his home...Its a classic for good and many reasons. Dewdney's characters, with the exception of a little unnecessary and half-baked melodrama, are easily recognized academic types, jealous of their prize, and eager to learn more and more about the world they have inadvertently contacted. The Planiverse is a marvel of a gedankenexperiment--how could an inhabitable two-dimensional world exist and what would it be like? YNDRD goes on what is ultimately a spiritual quest (the novel can be thought of, really as a sufi story)--so there is a fair dollop of philosophy mixed in with the science.So we get to see a wide swath of his world, his beliefs and his life,and learn about it all as he makes his journey.Although the technology has changed over time, the novel can comfortably be thought of as taking place in the early 1980's rather than as a contemporary novel. Once upon a time, computers really were this primitive.There are lots of asides and text boxes exploring some of the concepts touched upon, as well as appendices that give the Planiverse even more depth. It's an amazing book and definitely suited to those who would want to think about the implications and puzzle of a two-dimensional world. The narrative itself is pretty basic and straightforward--but the universe, man, is where this novel shines. Dewdney's conceit in making the novel at first seem like a first hand account of a real event gives it verisimilitude, and the level of detail, as said above, sells it.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"This is a great book. By creating a 2D world Dewdney expands our 3D vision.In reading this book I was reminded of not only Abbott's Flatland (which was the original inspiration) I was also reminded of Charles Hinton's Fourth Dimension and Choas Coincidence and All That Math Jazz.In each work, the writers effectively used 2D analogies to give us an idea of what 4D space might be like.What Dewdney did however was to build detail into what has always been a simple model and thereby give greater detail to the potentialities of our vision.While others have said that this book would be great for mathematicians I would offer that this book is great for anyone seeking to expand their horizons.As Henry David Thoreau wrote in concluding his Walden: \\"There is more light to day than dawn. The sun is but a morningstar!\\"Read this book and others like it and bask in the light of that morningstar!"},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"This astonishing book manages to be both a brilliant work of science fiction and an allegory of the search for truth of Islamic mystics or Sufis. This deeper level is well hidden, and many readers get immense pleasure from the book without even knowing it is there. The clues are to be found in the many Arabic words in the language of the Planiverse and in the fact that Yendred's quest ends in a shrine that is a square (the 2-dimensional equivalent of the cubic shrine - the Kaaba - that is at the centre of Islam). As Yendred is Dewdney spelt backwards (with Alice's speech defect which causes her to confuse W and R), one may deduce that the author is himself a Sufi seeker."},{"Title":"The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","review":"This is a world of two dimensions.

Though they were best friends while serving in the jungle, it has been almost that long since they last talked. That is why San Francisco Bay resident Claude is stunned to hear a small child crying in his living room. Jesse has disappeared, leaving his son with Claude to protect him.Soon the security chief of Sentinel Microsystems, Barton Jones, arrives, demanding Claude reveal Jesse's whereabouts. The FBI, making the same demand follows Barton's aggressive visit. When danger hits home, Claude begins to search for his missing friend. Claude learns that Jesse went underground because he uncovered the dark secrets of what his Silicon Valley company was really doing and has a disk to prove it.CAUSES OF ACTION is an action-packed thriller that highlights the ambience and excitement of the Bay area. Claude is an interesting character and the support cast, especially the San Franciscans, add warmth and depth to a well-designed tale. The story line occasionally slows down, but John A. Miller continues to provide insight into the various mindsets of Viet Nam Veterans as he successfully did with CUTDOWN. An engrossing novel that will bring accolades to the author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Causes of Action","review":"I got my hands on an Advance Readers Copy of this book-which I understand will be available in December. Protagonist Claude McCutcheon is a very modern and yet traditional hard-boiled hero. A practicing lawyer and Vietnam veteran with deep shadows in his past that make the fast-moving action parts of the book highly believable. The action scenes read like verbal lightning. There is also a sense of ideas played out in real life, choices made and prices paid that is genuine in a way not every mystery novel attains. Speaking as a cat lover, I also have to say that in CAUSES OF ACTION, as in CUTDOWN (the first Claude McCutcheon), there is a very fully-realized cat, who plays an important role in the story. CUTDOWN introduced McCutcheon, his law practice in Albany, California, his network of friends in low places-some of them old Army buddies. Like Marlowe with his chess and Travis McGee with his crusades, Claude McCutcheon is true to a code older than Gunsmoke.CAUSES OF ACTION begins when Claude awakes in the pre-dawn hours to find a 4 year old child in his bedroom with a note pinned to his jacket. The little boy, Earl, is the son of Jesse Hamilton from Claude's old platoon. Although Claude has not seen him since the day 30 years earlier that Jesse was wounded on a battlefield in Vietnam, he feels an obligation to take care of the boy for a few days. Clearly Jesse is in trouble and Claude cannot help attempting to dig him out. This tortuous journey then takes Claude into the minefields of the Silicon Valley business wars, close encounters with a beautiful FBI agent who may or may not be an ally, and a confrontation with old enemies and deep-rooted corruption that threatens his carefully balanced existence and his very life. Miller's first book sparked some controversy among a few people I know who disagreed with the hero's less than politically correct ideas. Having known a few Vietnam veterans, I found McCutcheon's views to be an accurate portrayal of the opinions of many from that particular \\"lost generation.\\" I personally found both CUTDOWN and CAUSES OF ACTION well worth reading for the story and reading again for the writing."},{"Title":"Mountain Style","review":"While cabins can be a year-round fascination, I have a fondness for log cabins in the winter.

Many altering factors lead to the girls' entry in the foster system, including the imprisonment of their father, the abandonment by their mom, and the incapability of their grandma to take care of them for long. The girls deal with many different obstacles in their foster homes including strict rules, sexual exploitation, and deprivation of water! The life-altering events are written in extremely descriptive and graphic detail that capture the reader's attention and don't let go. I'm not normally a reader of non-fiction novels; I generally find more interest in fiction books. However, as soon as I opened this book to the first page, I discovered that even non-fiction books could be entertaining and enjoyable. I couldn't put the book down, from start to finish. It was a dramatic, funny, emotional book that I would recommend to any girl or woman (Guys wouldn't like it much, I'm sure!)."},{"Title":"Like Family","review":"A couple of months after their feckless, volatile father lands in jail, Mom drops the three girls off at Granny's one evening and doesn't come back for 16 years. Paula, age 4, and her sisters, Teresa, 6, and Penny, 3, prove too much for the old lady and enter into a long and rocky relationship with the Fresno, CA, foster care system.Paula McLain's harrowing memoir of growing up among strangers who may or may not become family teems with complex, shifting emotions. Chief among them, especially in the early years, is fear, and the yearning to belong to a family, any family. But that was not to be. Not quite anyway. McLain's fluid prose captures the reader with its immediacy; its sense of urgency and its intimacy. This is a page-turner with real orphan children to root for.It never seems to occur to the girls, as it does to the reader, that they could be separated. But they never are, which is the saving grace of stability that runs through their Dickensian childhood. Their first brief placement ends with a charge of thievery, but their second is a mystery. The Clapps are wealthy and their children are grown. Mrs. Clapp has no humor and no affection. Her rules and routines are rigid and she is fanatically house proud.One rainy day after school, the girls slosh through puddles to the car. \\"Just as we got to the Cadillac, the sky started to drop hail like frozen BBs. Mrs. Clapp sat behind the wheel in her lavender rabbit-fur coat, her dry fingers toying with the door lock as though it were a chess piece, deciding whether she would let us into the car. We'd ruin it, we would.\\"So what does she want with three little girls? This is not McLain's question; it's the reader's, and McLain never comes out with the horrifying answer, either. She simply takes you there and lets you see for yourself how things are. The third placement, also brief, is the most heartbreaking. These people want children, delight in their new girls, and yet suddenly, mysteriously, it's over and the sisters find themselves with their fourth family in three years.\\"If we felt any hope that this new situation would be different, then it was the stowaway version, small and pinching as pea gravel in a shoe.\\" The Lindberghs make no secret of their reason for taking in three foster girls. Their daughter, Tina, is an only child and wants siblings. It's that simple. Bub Lindbergh is a big bear of a man, \\"easy to love,\\" who teaches the girls to ride and gets each of them a pony, while his wife, Hilde, a German immigrant, is prickly and unpredictable. She spoils her \\"real\\" daughter and delights in telling perfect strangers the sad history of her foster daughters.McLain's anger comes through in shock waves of description - hilarious bizarre incidents perpetrated by blotchy, oversize, cartoon character Lindberghs. Interspersed with moments of tenderness, even joy. McLain (her first book of poems, \\"Less of Her\\" was published in 1999) is a visual, visceral writer unafraid to mix brutal honesty and laughter. She and her sisters are not easy children and never lose sight of the fact that, unlike other children, they can be cast off at any time, their worldly possessions lumped in a trash bag in the back of the social worker's car. It's a scary way for a child to live.McLain's memoir is many things: a gut-wrenching portrayal of growing up insecure and longing for love, a celebration of sibling solidarity, a catharsis and a satisfying revenge on people who once had the power, and will recognize themselves as they read. Funny, bleak, angry and winsome, McLain's debut is beautifully written and compulsively readable."},{"Title":"Like Family","review":"Poet Paula McLain's memoir of growing up among foster families because of her ex-con unreliable father, and a mother who took off for the movies for sixteen years, is an American tragedy with a bittersweet ending.McLain's characters, the people she meets during her harrowing journey through a foster-care system increasingly gone mad, are both abusive and pitiable, criminally unfit to be their own children's parents, and yet as adrift as Paula and her two sisters, Penny and Teresa. McLain's prose is a long-overdue love letter to her wry, spunky, strong personality, the children and families rebelliously proud of their differences in mainstream America, the love coming from real parenting such as McLain's father's ex-wife Donna, McLain's churchgoing Granny, and the kindly Fredericksons, a foster family for the McLain girls, the forgotten Americana of the 1960's and 1970's, the heartbreak of teenage girls looking for love in sexual embraces, and most of all, the unbreakable bond between McLain and her sisters, Penny and Teresa, who are as fascinating as she is.Even McLain's absent mother, who returns miraculously out of the blue, as often happens in real life, gets sympathetic treatment. A brilliant, complex memoir."},{"Title":"Like Family","review":"Paula McLain has a way with words. And a way with sentences, paragraphs, ideas and pictures.

A lovely, touching book."},{"Title":"Like Family","review":"Paula McLain's account of her childhood is compelling reading. I am deeply concerned with the dismal state of the foster care system and the impact of it on our community's children. I have also been a foster parent. Ms. McLain's writing is powerful and personal, a beautiful and touching memoir allowing the rest of us to experience the abysmal consequences of parenting taken too lightly (by biological parents or misguided fosters or officials entrusted with responsibility). The reader does not have to have a specific interest in this topic to be moved and gain value and insight. Ms. McLain takes full responsibility as an adult to have her own life work, even with the vestiges of her childhood forever present. No whining here, which makes it all the more powerful. A quick read, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Like Family","review":"Having entered the foster system at age 4 with her two small sisters, Paula McLain spent the next 14 years bouncing from family to family -- never quite fitting in, or feeling like she was \\"home.\\"With Teresa, a year and a half older, and Penny, not quite a year younger, Paula suffered emotional, physical and sexual abuse in the various houses she stayed throughout the '70s and '80s. She also struggled to understand precisely why her biological parents had given her and her sisters up -- her father, in between jail stints and remarriages, would mysteriously resurface time to time; although her mother would vanish for nearly 16 years after dropping the girls at their grandmother's to go on a date. Similarly, Paula wondered, why would strangers want the girls -- they weren't perfect. Could they possibly hope to one day find parents who would really love them? Or were people just taking them for the money?McLain utilizes a strong mix of evocative language, combined with plain language -- unlike others in her position might, she conveys no self-pity, only a statement of facts. Her story is like that of countless other foster children, yet unique and gripping."},{"Title":"Like Family","review":"This woman got through her grinding childhood with something!She sure can write!Like Family is at once witty and poetic, and it rings true at many levels.

This compelling tale may break your heart or inspire you to become a GOOD foster parent; what it won't do is leave you unmoved. Read this beautifully written book and weep."},{"Title":"Like Family","review":"Like Family is a beautifully written story of a childhood shorn of the protections and comforts that family ought to offer. McLain's finely rendered prose captures her experience vividly and paints rather than explains the hard, fragmented life she and her sisters were forced to lead in the California foster care system after her father left them and then her mother went to the movies and never came back. It reminds us how the idiotic passions and tragic weaknesses of adults can cause a train wreck of a childhood--and how a brilliant young girl with a sense of humor and a resiliant spirit can nonetheless survive, hold onto her sisters, and write a magnificent book. I read it without stopping, gobbling it down like stolen chocolate cake, and then turned around and read the whole book again,just for the joy of the language. Even though it is a hard-edged story, and sometimes I even wept a little, McLain is really very funny, too. And the soundtrack for the movie is going to be great. This book is destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"Like Family","review":"Paula McLain's book is excellent.

Daston wants to change the unquestioned neo-Kantian conviction that 'scientific objects' have a timeless 'reality.'Daston has collected 11 essays on temporary 'scientific' objects. Daston contributes an introduction and shortened version of her earlier paper on 'preternatural' science. The rest are new.Daston is convinced that scientific objects are created by inquiring minds rather than 'discovered' in the environment. Many would disagree, but I think the arguments are of great interest. For example, 'ether' was an object of 'scientific research' for much of the 18th and early 19th century. 'Ether' was as real as water molecules are today. 'Ether' has now slipped out of the scientific conversation.Was 'ether' ever a 'scientific object'? Was it ever real? If it was never 'real', could the 'object' contribute to something we now think is 'real,' something like the 'quantum' particle. One of the essays goes into great detail on this and the simple neo-Kantian answer suffers from the examination.The following is a list of the essay titles:'Preternatural Philosophy': The scientific study of singularly rare objects such as comets, two-headed babies, and sea-monstersl'Mathematical Entities in Scientific Discourse': the birth and development of 'symbolic objects' such as the earth's center of gravity.'Dreams and Self-consciousness': scientific study of 'dreams.' Something that was an object of science in the 18th century and 20th centuries, but ignored in the 19th.'Mutations of the Self in Old Regime and Postrevolutionary France': How the term 'ame' became the scientific object 'le moi.''The coming into Being and Passing Away of Value Theories in Economics (1776-1976): 'Value' as scientific object.'...Society as a Scientific Object.''..Why Culture is not a Disappearing 'Object.' ''How the Ether Spawned the Microworld': A failed scientific object, ether, provides the theoretical foundations for contemporary quantum 'objects.''Life Insurance, Medical Testing and the Management of Mortality': Non-scientists of the insurance business create the object 'high blood pressure' and medical science catches on later.'On the Partial Existence of Existing and Nonexisting Objects': Are diseases 'scientific objects' or only a collections of symptoms?'Cytoplasmic Particles': The mutation of 'mitocondria' objects into DNA objects.As Daston points out, the essays hold no single philosophical perspective. As such, the book does a good job of covering a variety of views and hopefully contributing to discussion.For me, it is a real treasure."},{"Title":"Westbound, Warbound","review":"The first in a series of novels featuring Andy Holt, a merchant navy officer caught up in the early stages of the Battle of the Atlantic.To date there is one sequel, \\"Noncombatants.\\" As he served in Royal Navy ships and submarines throughout the second half of World War II, Fullerton must be over eighty, but he is still turning out novels as good as anything he has ever written, and he apparently intends to write at least one more in this series: he writes in the afterward to \\"Noncombatants\\" that \\"we haven't finished yet with Andy Holt.\\"The vast majority of novels about war at sea are told from the viewpoint of men serving on British or US warships, and where merchantman feature at all they are the helpless targets who the heroes are escorting. For example, four of the best and most famous WWII seafaring novels, Montsarrat's \\"The Cruel Sea\\", Forester's \\"The Ship\\" and \\"The Good Shepherd\\" and MacLean's \\"HMS Ulysses\\" are all about convoy escorts.But there have been a few brilliant works by writers such as Brian Callison (\\"The Bone Collectors\\" & \\"The Judas Ship\\") and Jan de Hartog (\\"Stella\\" & \\"The Commodore\\") which told the story of the merchant seaman who were just as vital to the lifelines of the free world during the war. With this highly entertaining book and its sequel, Fullerton adds to that cannon.The hero, Andy Holt, who turns 21 during the book, is third mate in the tramp cargo ship Pollyanna, which sailed from England in late summer 1939. While she is heading south, and through the Suez canal, war breaks out. And as Pollyanna heads from South Africa towards the River Plate, her crew become uneasily aware through distress calls from other ships that the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee is also in the South Atlantic, and that Graf Spee too may be heading for the River Plate ...Andy is also the son of a merchant navy captain, Charlie Holt, who had joined the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR)in the first world war and remained a member ever since: he had been heavily involved in defence planning and at the time of \\"Westbound, Warbound\\" was appointed second in command of an Armed Merchant Cruiser. Charlie Holt is himself the hero of one of Fullerton's recent novels, \\"Flight to Mons\\" in which he takes an airship behind German lines to rescue a lady in distress during the First World War.Indeed, both the men in the Holt family seem to make a habit of rescuing damsels in distress, but we'd better not say more than that for fear of spoiling the book.The biggest disagreement between Andy Holt and his father had been that Charlie wanted Andy to follow him into the RNR and spend World War II on serving on warships.Listening to his dad's arguments, Andy had asked \\"You're saying I'd have a better chance of survival in a fighting ship than in a merchantman?\\" Though Charlie was not willing to openly agree that this was what he was saying, they both knew that this was a major part of it. And further, these novels so vividly bring to life the dangers of serving in merchant ships at sea during the early days of World War II as to leave the reader suspecting that Andy's father might well have been right to make that point.Not having served in either the British Royal Navy or the merchant navy, I am not able to comment on the minor points of detail about the minutiae of life on board a tramp steamer which have been criticised by some reviewers. I do know enough about the history of the war at sea to recognise the general setting as containing a lot of authentic details, particularly about the enormous heroism of the Royal Navy cruisers who took on and defeated a far more powerful ship at the Battle of the River Plate.I can strongly recommend these engrossing and very entertaining novels which make you feel like you'd been there. I also strongly recommend that you read \\"Westbound, Warbound\\" before \\"Noncombatants\\", because some of the events in the second book are serious spoilers for this first one."},{"Title":"Westbound, Warbound","review":"I stopped reading after about 150 pages. For me, if a book hasn't moved me in 150 pages it's time to cut my losses. The book reeked with promise when I bought it. I thought there would be a lot of action, a lot of good description of life aboard a merchant, not military, vessel during wartime, interesting characters, etc. But the book contained little of things. I give the author a third star for his detailed desriptions of the routine at sea, which created some interest, but beyond that,the book just dragged and I decided to call it a day."},{"Title":"Westbound, Warbound","review":"The usual British plot of a son who does not agree with his father that the Royal Navy is the be all and end all of professions. The protagonist serves as an officer in the Merchant Marine whose father is part of the Royal Naval Reserve as a merchant officer and moves to serve in the Navy. His son disagrees and remains in the Merchant Marine. Good plot dealing with South America and German Naval Presence and Auxillaries during the early days of the war. A good read, but not truely unexpected in its plot and the results. More of a light reading recreation book than one for the serious reader looking for a compulsie page turner.

In fact, the crew of SS Pollyanna only realize after they arrive at Montevideo how close they have come to being among the victims of the German pocket battleship, the demise of which is all set forth in reported action.What makes the novel really tick is the way that Fullerton slowly and deliberately creates the world and immerses the reader in it. He builds the tension with such sure and careful pacing that when Pollyanna and her crew are thrust into action the impact is sudden, shocking, and visceral.As a portrait of men in action in extreme circumstances, the novel is highly successful. A subplot involving a romance between the protagonist and a rescued female prisoner feels contrived, but a protracted scene in which the ship seems likely to founder in an Atlantic gale is riveting. Fullerton does not insist on thrusting his characters into a central role in the war, but when the war comes calling for them on two occasions, he delivers action-filled passages of the absolute highest quality, the more so for the care and precision with which he has created the world in which they unfold."},{"Title":"The country wife (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"Far from being a silly comedy, The Country Wife is a work aimed at lashing Seventeenth Century loose morals. We laugh, of course, but through the alluring yet disturbing character of Horner, we perceive that something must be done if Restoration society wants to survive.Wicherley presents us with unhappy wives and brutal or indifferent husbands who are utlimately fooled by Horner, the man who knows how to exploit the misery produced by mercenary unions. Poor Margery Pinchwife, the heroine of the piece, eventually brings tears in our eyes when we realize that she shall never be free from a violent man that considers marriage a cheaper substitute for keeping a mistress. Margery is the victim of both her husband and her careless lover. She is looking for love, but she keeps on coming across men who are interested in sex only. They can see her body; they can't see her delicate, naif soul.However, Whycherley (who, we must remember, was the spiritual son of the great moralists Graci&agrave;n, Larochefoucault and so on, whose maxims are easily detected in the whole bulk of Wycherley's works) is able to see a way out in the honest, disintrested love between Alithea, Margery's brilliant sister-in-law, and Harcourt, Horner's dashing best friend. (these characters' names symbolize the perfection of their union: her name means &quot;truth&quot;, while his name is significantly &quot;Frank&quot;.)This comedy is at its best when performed; however, it is well worth reading, especially if you have a lively imagination. don't miss the notorious &quot;china scene&quot;: fifteen minutes of laughter that will make your sides ache.Be careful: The Country Wife merely &quot;looks&quot; like a stupid, shallow comedy, but it is in fact a deep reflection on society, marriage and, why not?, even the situation of Seventeenth-Century English women."},{"Title":"The country wife (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"I recently reread this play for the third time and taught it in a British Literature survey at the University of Texas. Not only do I find it more entertaining and more brilliant with every reading, but I was shocked to find that the vast majority of my students really enjoyed it and preferred Wycherley to Shakespeare. If you want a smart, hilarious, and dark comedy that plumbs the depths of jealousy and sexual possession, this is a must-read play. If you're easily offended or have a hard time following complicated plots and catching bawdy puns, you'll certainly want to avoid it."},{"Title":"The country wife (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"The eighteen-year closure of the English stage under the Puritans ended in 1660 with the Restoration of the monarchy. The restored theatre was controversial from the beginning for its sexual content. William Wycherley's comedy, The Country Wife (1675), involves two intertwined plots: 1) Mr. Horner, a noted rake, pretends impotence to gain access more easily to married women and 2) a young, inexperienced wife from a rural area is immediately fascinated by London life, especially its more lewd aspects.Wycherley's plot is further complicated by another romance, one that is more conventional. Horner's friend, Harcourt, becomes enamored with a young woman engaged to a foppish, self-centered character. This romance is more virtuous, and perhaps functions as a counterbalance to the lewd and bawdy activities centered about Mr. Horner, the ladies of London, and the \\"inexperienced\\" country wife.As social attitudes again became more conservative, The Country Wife gradually lost favor. It disappeared from the stage in 1753, and was not again seen until 1924. It was first produced in the US in 1931. In recent decades The Country Wife has gained considerable popularity, and is now among the best known play from the Restoration period.Interestingly, women appeared on the English stage (rather than young boys dressed as women) for the first time in the Restoration period. When Mr. Pinchwife disguised his young country wife as a boy, the audience was treated to the scandalous view of a woman in tight fitting breeches. This, in addition to the offstage implied sexual activity, must have made The Country Wife a memorable event.The Country Wife compares favorably with the best comedies of the next hundred years, including The Man of Mode, The Way of the World, and The School for Scandal. All four plays \\"are comedies of about men and women who live in London, care for sex and money, and make fools of one another if not of themselves\\". This quote is from the Norton Critical edition, Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Comedy.The Country Wife is available in a New Mermaids edition as well as in various anthologies such as the Norton edition and the Oxford World Classics edition titled The Country Wife and Other Plays (all by Wycherley)."},{"Title":"The country wife (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"Many accused THE COUNTRY WIFE of gross obscenity when it debuted in 1675; nonetheless, it remained an audience favorite for more than seventy five years. In 1753, however, bluenose killjoys at last convinced the public that the play was completely unacceptable and successfully banned it from the stage. It was not staged again until 1924--and when it was, the play became an audience favorite all over again.Author William Wycherley (1640-1715) drew upon sources that included French comedy and Shakespearean structure, but the end result was of his own creation: an outrageously bawdy type of sex farce in which few, if any, of the characters can be described as innocent of evil intent. In THE COUNTRY WIFE, Horner allows society to believe he is impotent, and as such husbands entrust him with their wives. But Horner is anything but impotent, and before long he is bedding a host of bored, foolish, and incredibly horny women--including the young, silly Margery, an ignorant country girl recently wed to an elderly man.THE COUNTRY WIFE is particularly famous, or infamous, for the so-called \\"China Scene.\\" Horner claims to have extensive knowledge of the china collected by fashionable ladies, and this provides them with an excuse to visit his rooms to discuss china. And discuss it they do indeed, so much so that the very word \\"china\\" becomes funnier with every repetition. But this is far from the only notable moment the play has to offer; from carousing housewives to hysterical husbands, THE COUNTRY WIFE is lewd, lacivious, and almost unbearably funny.Like many early Restoration plays, THE COUNTRY WIFE has been accused of being \\"cold,\\" for does not really provide the viewer/reader with a sympathetic hero or heroine, nor does it punish the wrong-doers at the end, a fact which later censors found particularly outrageous. Well, let the killjoys china themselves; this is a play that simply goes on and on, and although it may not be most artful comedy the Restoration produced, it is certainly the most popular. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The country wife (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"TCW is worth your effort, particularly if you enjoy a good laugh"},{"Title":"The country wife (Chandler editions in drama)","review":"No, I haven't read the book.

A note at the beginning of the book explains that the author first heard a version of this tale from an exchange student from China.The book tells the story of Hai Li Bu, a hunter whose village is facing a drought and food shortage. But things change for the better after a magical encounter. Ultimately. Hai Li Bu faces a serious ethical challenge.&quot;The Hunter&quot; is a well told story featuring a compelling hero. Kids who were turned on to Chinese culture by the film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; will, I believe, really appreciate this book.Ed Young's artwork is certainly striking: mainly shades of brown and black, with a splotchy quality. But I think the illustrations may be a bit too &quot;arty&quot; and impressionistic; I had the feeling that the art was meant to appeal more to adults than to kids. Still, I recommend &quot;the Hunter&quot; for those seeking to develop a multicultural library of children's books."},{"Title":"The hunter: A Chinese folktale","review":"It is said that the stone statue of Hai Li Bu continues to be seen atop a mountain in China. Given the gift of listening to animals to become a better hunter and feed his starving village, Hai Li Bu is sworn to secrecy by the Dragon King of the Sea about his powerful gift. However, in order to save his village he risks his own life and becomes forever, a part of Chinese traditional folklore. Mary Casanova does a fascinating job of writing a simple folktale in a detailed and interesting manner. She uses descriptive word combinations to convey rich colors and exciting characters. Casanova's text reads like a poem, such as when the Dragon King of the Sea shows Hai Li Bu, &quot;sparkling red rubbies, ocean blue sapphires, and shimmering pink pearls.&quot; The illustrations further, compliment the story, with their abstract style and earth tone coloration.

This is a great book for readers who like mysteries with unsuspected killers and hidden motives."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"This was my second Mary Higgins Clark novel. The two that I have read are the same in some ways. You never know what could happen next and you do not know what all the characters know one or the other in some form. In the two novels that I have read I noticed that until you get to the end of the book you do not know how all the characters will meet up. Her novels are the same style of writing but you can never put the novel down. Mary Higgins Clark novel I'll Be Seeing You is a suspense that will keep you guessing until the end. The novel is set in the area around New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Philadelphia. The novel takes place in modern times. The novel is about a reporter named Meghan Collins whose father just died but they can not find his body. Meghan and mother need to find the body of Meghan father. If they do not find his body then Meghan's mother inn will go under. Meghan one sees the body of a dead girl who looks just like her. The novel is about Meghan trying to find answers to her father's death and why this girl looks so much like her. On Meghan's quest to find answer the story comes more and more unbelievable. With everything that Meghan finds it seems the less she knows about her father and the people around her. The more Meghan finds out about people the less she feels she trusts them and in the end the betrayal that Meghan never saw coming. In the novel you will feel for Meghan and her mother. You will see the heart ship that they go threw and you will ask yourself why. The novel will keep you guess till the end. In the novel Meghan has a conflict with her dead father. Meghan does not know what to think of him after she found some things about her. Meghan has conflicts with the people that she can trust and can not trust. I liked the novel. The reasons I liked the novel are that you never know what is going to happen next. You will be thinking one thing and then something else will come up and you will change your mind. In the novel you can never be sure of one thing or the other. The novel does fallow the style of Mary Higgins Clark. Where you never know quite what is going till you get to the end of the novel. You never know what will come next, with each new discover that the characters find. Then at the end the story makes sense why everything happens. The novel just like the other one I read. You will keep guessing what will come next and be surprised at what does end up happening."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"I found this to be an excellent novel with well-developed characters and an great plot. The plot began to thicken right from the beginning when the protagonist sees a stabbing victim that bears a striking resemblence to herself, while on assignment as a reporter. Every detail was carefully thought out, and every detail was connected in the final outcome. This book has everything: some science/medical jargon, an action-packed chase scene, a lot of suspense, and a love story. If you want to read a good detective story and love to try and figure out the ending, this book is for you. If you pay attention to the little things you may be able to put the puzzle together, but there's always a twist at the end. It keeps on the edge of your seat until the very end.

She doesn't tell her mother about the woman, or the late-night fax she gets at home, claiming the woman's death was a mistake, because Catherine Collins has enough on her mind. Ten months earlier her husband disappeared, supposedly a victim in a bridge accident. The authorities did not find any remains of Ed Collins or his car, however, so the insurance company is refusing to pay and her bills are piling up. Catherine collapses and winds up in the hospital when someone calls, claiming to be her missing husband.Meghan had been interviewing personnel at a fertility clinic for a feature story, but when one of the clinic's doctors is murdered and it is found she falsified her credentials, evidence points at Ed Collins, who got the woman hired at the clinic through his professional placement business. Because of the scandal, Meg is placed on leave, so she uses the time to investigate her father, who had a lot of secrets. In addition to the double life Meg and her mother begin to suspect Ed Collins had, it is possible he had even more to hide. The burning question is...is Ed Collins alive or dead?Meanwhile, Meghan is being stalked by a parking attendant who took a liking to her, and he's hanging around her mother's house and place of business hoping for glimpses of Meg. Meg's feelings for her mother's neighbor, Mac, rekindle as she spends time with him and his small son, looking into discrepancies at her father's business and at the fertility clinic.Since the last couple of Clark books I read introduced a multitude of characters I couldn't keep straight, I decided to make myself a cheat sheet. I was glad I did, since there were at least a dozen recurring characters introduced within the first 50 pages. I didn't seem to need to refer to it very often, though. This was an intriguing story with several components all tied into one answer. In all, a very entertaining read that kept me turning the pages.

I went back and forth between suspecting who the real murderer was and the ending surprised me.I also like how Higgins-Clark developed the characters.

Meghan's life is filled with tragedy when her father, Edwin Collins, is believed to have died in an accident which occurred on Tappan Zee bridge.

Meghan discovers that her search, in ways, is tied to a story she is covering at the Manning Clinic. A clinic where virtro fertalization is performed. After almost hopelesss searching and a lot of wondering, what Meghan comes to find will change her life forever."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"An overwhelmed woman living between New York and Connecticut in the present day, Mary Higgins Clark's I'll Be Seeing You is an interesting, fictional mystery. Meghan Collins, a young, ambitious reporter, finds herself struggling to keep her job while trying to unlock her father's past. Meghan is recieving phone calls thet sound exactly like her father, Edwin Collins, who supposedly died in the Tappan Zee Bridge disaster. No one found any remains of him or his car so the authorities could not declare his death. In another scene, the police found Edwin's car parked in front of Meghan's apartment. She didn't know what to believe. Throughout the book, Meghan comes to face fears and feelings that she's held inside for years. We would recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense. There are many hardships and tragedies and you'll be on the edge of your seat. You won't put the book down."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"I have read a few of Mary Higgin Clark's books beforehand, but this book is one of the best I have read. It is very suspenseful and keeps you on your toes throughout the whole novel. The descriptions of the characters and places are very vivid so the reader is able to visualize what exactly is going on. This book kept me wondering what is going to happen next and I didn't want to stop reading. This book is a must read. You never know what's going to happen next in this book."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"I am 16 years old and I selected this book for a high school summer reading book. I usually hate reading books but I got into this book and like it. I heard nothing but great remarks about Mary Higgins Clark. The fact about she lives in New Jersey(by me) and usually has a setting in the books around that area really intrigues me. It is great reading something that I can get a feel for the environment that it takes place in. Mary Higgins Clark has a unique way of writing...she has different thoughts and feelings the characters are displaying. Throughout the book, there is an unsettling excitement feeling about being the detective and finding out the mystery. ...Is Edwin Collins really dead?"},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"Mary Higgins Clark has done it again with this suspenseful novel which focuses on Meghan Collins and her desperate search to find the truth about her father while at the same time she's trying to solve the murder of someone who looks like her. At the same time, she uncovers the secrets of the Manning Clinic, which specializes in invitro fertilization. She is a reporter who is searching for the truth while a stalker is constantly watching her. However, I believe that the author should have added at least one more chapter at the end so that we know what happens to some of the main characters. Overall, if you're a fan or just like to play detective, this is definitely an interesting story."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"DYNAMITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is a readunderthecoverslongafterdark book.

It has a great plot that moves along at just the right pace and enough characters to make it suspenseful. The in vitro fertilization storyline made this book very interesting. I admired the fact that MHC did so much research on this topic to present it in a tasteful way. I loved the way she brought the medical and ethical aspects of in vitro to this book. I believe MHC wrote about in vitro in a way that didn't seem too technical and overwhelming. It added just the right touch to this book.This book, unlike some of her newer ones, is superb. If you've read some of her current works and didn't like them, give this book a try. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"This is one of my favorite Clark books. The multi-layered mystery kept me fascinated all throughout the book. Unlike some of Clark's main characters, the protagonist in the book, Meghan, actually gets out there and does something to try and solve the murder instead of moping around the house all day. There were two things I did not like about the book, however. First, I didn't like who the murderer was. I realize Clark gives a twist at the end of her books and I appreciate that, but I just didn't like the way this one ended. Secondly, we do not find out what happens to one of the characters."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"I read the novel I'll Be Seeing You by Mary Higgins Clark. The book went into detail about how a man named Edwin Collins led a secret life for over twenty years. Mary Higgins Clark did an excellent job of describing the details of why he did this and how his family coped with his dissappearance. While all this was happening, she wrote about someone getting murdered and a fraud in a doctors file. This added a great thrill to the story and made it a page turner from the start. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes a murder mystery from The Queen of Suspense. It was a wonderful novel in which Mary Higgins Clark showed her exquisite writing style while including an enteresting flare to a murder mystery."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"A suspenful mystery filled with twists and turns. It all centers around a younger girl named Meghan Collins. After losing her father to an accident which everyone else (but her and her mom) thinks that her dad planned and just wanted to hide out and collect money. Meghan is faced with a story of a girl who was stabbed to death in New York City. But this was no normal homicide. Staring down into the face of the victim Meghan see's the striking resemblance between her and the girl. It is so remarkable that they could pass as twins. Through the months Meghan uncovers things about her father that she never thought were possible. How could her father have had another family in a different town? Is her father still alive? Soon Meghan is covering a story about an in vitro clinic. The fingers start to point at her father when a women ends up dead who her father placed in the Clinic. Or did he? Will Meghan live to see the outcome. Or will she be the next victim."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"This is not my first Mary Higgins Clark book,and nor will it be my last. She consistently writes mystery books that I find I cannot put down til I am finished. This book is definitely no exception.I'LL BE SEEING YOU centers around Meghan Collins, a television news reporter who in the beginning of the novel is covering the story of a stabbing victim, a woman that happens to look very much like her! Pure coincidence? Or is there a connection?At the same time, Meghan is dealing with the disappearnce of her father, Edward Collins, and because of the circumstances, no one knows whether Edward was murdered, or had just plain disappeared along with a huge sum of money. Both Meghan and her mother cannot move on with their lives because there is no body recovered from his supposed drowning off the Tappan Zee Bridge. At the same time, Edward is accused of murdering a woman that all had thought was a reputable scientist at a in-vitro fertilization center.Between the death of the mystery woman and Meghan's father's disappearance, there unravels a complex story of a man with a double life, a newstory about the in-vitro fertilization center, and the facts that tie all of them together. And eventually, Meghan learns the mystery behind the stabbing victim.This is a definite must-read for all Mary Clark Higgins fans!"},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"This is the best book I have read!!!

There are many unexpected twists and turns. The story revolves around Meghan Collins which includes scenarios such as a stabbing victim who looks just like her, is her father dead or alive and what is happening at the fertility clinic. There is a lot going on in this novel but the transistion between events is done well and therefore it not confusing. Mary Higgins Clark at her best."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite authors. Like her other books that I have read, she leaves you guessing.

She is so talented. Having also read 2 of her other books, i liked this one the best. Perhaps, it is because this is the only one i understood thoroughly. The suspense present in those pages make you want to pursue your reading to see what happens afterwards. Like many of this author's other books, we can see that she makes us suspect the one person that is not the murderer or the criminal. Therefore, she puts us on the wrong path. At the end, you figure out that the bad guy in the story is the one you would have least expected. For example, I would have never thought that Hefferman was that important in the story. I thought he was just there to mislead us. But i sort of suspected Carter near the end. Clark's way of narrating is great. An advice to people whose eye is out for an adventure: read this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"This is my most favorite Mary Higgin Clark book.

I highly recommend this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"Mistress of suspense Mary Higgins Clark churned out another of her well-crafted if somewhat predictable and implausible thrillers with I'LL BE SEEING YOU. Reporter Meghan Collins is stunned while covering a hospital incident when a dying victim brought in is her identical double! In trying to identify this mysterious doppelganger, Meghan investigates an in vitro fertilization clinic and tries to piece together the events surrounding the mysterious death/disappearance of her father. Clark's narrative is terse and she's reminiscent of James Patterson in her choppy style. I'LL BE SEEING YOU will set no standards for suspense literature, but it's professional work from a smart and prolific novelist."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"This is a great book, one of those that you cant stop reading.

The reporter starts doing her own investigation and as she finds out more and more about her father's life, things start going wrong and the reporter's interest is turned elsewhere, leaving her with the knowing thought that her father had another family out of state and that something is terribly wrong where her father worked.You know MHC will pull it all together for you and it really is an outstanding ending. All of your questions will be answered."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"Mary Higgins Clark is one of those contemporary writers who can deliver a great story without graphic sexuality, violence or language. This particular book is one of my favorite Mary Higgins Clark books as it deals with the business of reproductive technologies. Over the last 10 years, I have read it over and over again."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"A typical (and dependable) offering from MHC. Although her books are formulaic (beautiful woman in danger has to use her brains and a little outside help to figure out how to save herself and close friends or family members), they are still enjoyable. Although there is the added challenge of figuring out if I've read this particular book before or if it's just because it's all so familiar because of MHC's [tried and true] formula. But then, that's part of the reason that I enjoy her books . . . they ARE dependable. I have almost always enjoyed her books. When I am traveling and need something to fall asleep to in the evenings, I can count on MHC to deliver --- and I can recommend her books to friends and not be concerned about which one they pick up or that they have to be read in order."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"An awesome mystery/suspense novel from Mary Higgins Clark.

Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"Mary Higgins Clark writes a pretty good mystery, and all her heroines wear GREAT clothes. What more does a teenage girl need to captivate her? Add in short chapter lengths, a handsome male suitor that is devoted to the protagonist, and a few harrowing twists and turns, and this book is almost irresistable for a young reader.No, it doesn't qualify as a literary masterpiece, but it definitely can prove to a kid why reading CAN be enjoyable. And for adults, I can think of worst ways to \\"escape\\" than with a good, easy mystery."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"I liked this book because I love mysteries. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. The book takes place in many different settings and there are also many different important characters.

This book how alot to do with bonding and learning who you can trust and who not to trust."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"This was my second Mary Higgins Clark novel. The two that I have read are the same in some ways. You never know what could happen next and you do not know what all the characters know one or the other in some form. In the two novels that I have read I noticed that until you get to the end of the book you do not know how all the characters will meet up. Her novels are the same style of writing but you can never put the novel down. Mary Higgins Clark novel I'll Be Seeing You is a suspense that will keep you guessing until the end. The novel is set in the area around New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Philadelphia. The novel takes place in modern times. The novel is about a reporter named Meghan Collins whose father just died but they can not find his body. Meghan and mother need to find the body of Meghan father. If they do not find his body then Meghan's mother inn will go under. Meghan one sees the body of a dead girl who looks just like her. The novel is about Meghan trying to find answers to her father's death and why this girl looks so much like her. On Meghan's quest to find answer the story comes more and more unbelievable. With everything that Meghan finds it seems the less she knows about her father and the people around her. The more Meghan finds out about people the less she feels she trusts them and in the end the betrayal that Meghan never saw coming. In the novel you will feel for Meghan and her mother. You will see the heart ship that they go threw and you will ask yourself why. The novel will keep you guess till the end. In the novel Meghan has a conflict with her dead father. Meghan does not know what to think of him after she found some things about her. Meghan has conflicts with the people that she can trust and can not trust. I liked the novel. The reasons I liked the novel are that you never know what is going to happen next. You will be thinking one thing and then something else will come up and you will change your mind. In the novel you can never be sure of one thing or the other. The novel does fallow the style of Mary Higgins Clark. Where you never know quite what is going till you get to the end of the novel. You never know what will come next, with each new discover that the characters find. Then at the end the story makes sense why everything happens. The novel just like the other one I read. You will keep guessing what will come next and be surprised at what does end up happening."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"I'll Be Seeing Youis one of Mary Higgens Clark best books.

Many illustrations, both drawings and photographs; glossary and index and, tucked into the back, some - perhaps relatively modern - embroidery transfers. A relevant book for any student of textiles.\\"See photos of the table of contents uploaded"},{"Title":"The Silent War","review":"This is a surprisingly good story about a young woman that loses her hearing in a bomb blast in World War 2. I have to admit I almost tossed it aside during the first hundred pages as I didn't much like the heroine, Sunday, very much. She is a bit of a brat. A prime example of her personality is when she gets upset that her best friend (who happens to be a bit chunky) has an admirer. Apparently, out of all the men that fall at Sunday's feet, this one fellow wants her chunky friend instead and she gets her knickers in a wad. She is also very \\"loose\\" with her body. Besides Sunday's attitude, the people's speech takes some getting used to. Example: \\"Ow many times do I 'ave ter tell these people ter keep that bleedin' door shut downstairs!\\"After page one hundred and the life changing bomb blast, it gets better. As Sunday learns to deal with deafness and comes to terms with the fact that her life is forever different and she must adjust accordingly, her attitude towards other people changes for the better. She even goes so far as to help children afflicted like herself.Meanwhile, she has a romance with an American Airman. (Who is stationed on an airbase nearby the farm she is helping on... in 1944.. and interesting fact I have to throw in here.. The United States Air Force did not exist till 1947...Rather than having the USAF flying around in the book, it should have been the USAAF, United States Army Air Force.) In between bouts of love and bombs dropping and friends dying, Sunday also has a stalker from her past. This is where the book gets ridiculous. All men fall at Sunday's feet and want to marry her and they even go so far as to fight over her. The farmer's son, the airman, the stalker.. come on!There is a surprise in the ending as Sunday discovers her true parentage and also another surprise I didn't much like but won't give away because it is rather crucial to the story. A decent read, however."},{"Title":"Life Can Definitely Kick Your Ass: Here Comes AIDS and HIV","review":"After reading the book, I found myself taking a common ground. It really depends on who reads the book. Obviously someone who has lost a loved one to this dreaded virus will probably have trouble reading this book. On the flip, someone who has not dealt with this virus first hand will be afraid and warned while reading the book. I have to say the author gave a horrid view of living and dying with AIDS. The book is worth reading. I have read all three of this authors books, and I like her style."},{"Title":"Life Can Definitely Kick Your Ass: Here Comes AIDS and HIV","review":"This book changed my life.

The author did a darn good job."},{"Title":"Life Can Definitely Kick Your Ass: Here Comes AIDS and HIV","review":"This book may be depressing to some readers, still, living and dying from AIDS can be depressing. It was not my intent to upset any reader. I strive to be real and that's my whole point in writing."},{"Title":"Life Can Definitely Kick Your Ass: Here Comes AIDS and HIV","review":"Life Can Definetly Kick Your Ass: Here Comes AIDS and HIV, by Victoria Warren. It was good book, but kind of depressing, especially after having a brother die of AIDS. I could definetly relate to the character, Shanna and how she felt about her sister Desiree having HIV/AIDS. You feel helpless and hopeless. There's nothing that you can do about the situation but try to comfort and be there for the person that's infected with it. I think that women need to be extremely careful and cautious when it comes to dealing with men and sex, that holds the same for men as well when dealing with women; even though the book is fiction, the story that it's telling happens everyday, someone is infected with and dying from AIDS/HIV.The only thing that I didn't like about the writing is that the author tended to give every detail about every movement that the character made. That got on my nerves.Sharon--Sophisticated Souls of Learning Book club"},{"Title":"Empires","review":"A brilliant book by a brilliant man who just happens to be my uncle."},{"Title":"Conflict and Identity in Romans","review":"Philip Esler used social-identity theory to explain Galatians (1998), and he now uses recategorization theory to account for Romans, Paul's most famous letter in which he addresses a church torn over ethnic conflict and pride. In the earlier letter, Paul was opposing Judean outsiders; in this letter he attempts to reconcile both Judean and Gentile insiders. Social theorists tell us that such recategorization can be successful only when the different ethnic groups have equal status in different ways -- since if they were equal in the same way, they would continue to compete in a fashion destructive of unity.So, for instance, Paul claims that just as Gentiles are under the domain of sin without the Torah (1:18-2:5), Judeans are under its power with the Torah (2:17-3:20) -- and the transition passage stresses the impartiality of God in punishing members of each ethnic group at the judgment, &quot;the Judean and the Greek&quot;, those under the law and those not under the law (2:6-16). Likewise, just as Gentile believers have been liberated from the power of sin which ruled them as immoral pagans (6:15-23), Judean believers have been liberated from the power of sin which ruled them through the law (7:1-25). Judeans need to recognize that Gentiles are God's elect and heirs to the promises of Abraham (9:1-11:12), but Gentiles need (even more) to understand that their benefits are a means to an end -- to provoke Judeans to reacquire what is really theirs (11:13-32). The point here is that Paul's success depends on careful attention to both ethnic groups, taking them down in different ways, but without erasing their ethnic identities in the process. That's why the last thing he wants to say is, &quot;In Christ there is neither Judean nor Greek&quot;, as he did in Galatians.This also accounts for Paul's treatment of Abraham in Rom 4 and the Torah's purpose in Rom 7. Abraham is a prototype for Judeans and Gentiles who have faith, against the polarizing implication of Gal 3:6-9 that Judeans have been disinherited. He became circumcised in order to seal his faith-righteousness, precisely in order to become the ancestor of two different ethnic groups (4:11-12). And the Torah is holy and passive in its relationship to sin, against the perverse claim in Gal 3:19-26 that it actively confined people under sin. Sin used the law to its advantage, and the Torah, though given for the promise of life, was unable to do the job God gave it (7:10-11). This may raise questions about God's competency, but it exonerates him of perversity.This is the book on Romans I've been waiting for, even if I still like Mark Nanos' particular treatment of Rom 14:1-15:13 better than anyone else's. Thanks to Esler, we can now appreciate Paul's most famous letter through the eyes of those who inhabited the strange and distant world of the ancient Mediterranean. We see Paul's eschatology as forthcoming-present more than future (Rom 8:18-39). We catch a glimpse of Paul as the victim of slander and gossip (Rom 3:8), the malicious &quot;weapon of the weak&quot; which crippled people's honor on a daily basis. We appreciate the dual occasion of the letter -- Paul's impending missions to Jerusalem and Spain, intersecting the ethnic crisis in Rome -- and how the two are truly inseparable. And we see Paul the Middle-Eastern all too familiar with the hostile nature of gift-giving, whose collection for the poor (Rom 15:28) was a slap in the face to his colleagues in Jerusalem, who really did &quot;feed the hungry in order to heap burning coals upon the heads of others&quot; (Rom 12:20).Paul was on a battleground when he wrote his letters, reinterpreting scripture in legitimately offensive ways, in line with the canons of honor-shame. Esler has explained these battles (for both Galatians and Romans) with especially insightful uses of anthropological and social theory, which serve us better than thought-pattern theology or literary intertextual approaches. There's a wide chasm separating us from the biblical world, and only when we acknowledge it can we begin to build bridges. Esler's epilogue reminds us that there is a strong need for such bridges in today's world: &quot;Romans reveals its connection with the taproot of human experience in relation to violent ethnic conflict in the world.&quot; This is a far cry from the way Augustine or Luther read the letter. Time to put theology of grace vs merit behind us once and for all."},{"Title":"Secret Cities of Old South America: Atlantis Unveiled","review":"If you like (read= love) adventures with the strong scent of old times, this is for you.

Ok, we get it, you wrote another one). A fascinating collection of lost cities, giants, eternal lights, strange beasts and other mysteries and lost subject matter. Yes, there is much conjecture and speculation in this book as the author strings together legends, whispers and hearsay to buttress his Atlantis theories. Sometimes fast with his dates and vague on his sources, one still finds hints of truth. One wonders when someone new will update us on the wilds of the southern continent these decades later. Sometimes his entertaining prose and postulating stretches belief. He tells us it is evident that Noah was copied from Egypt by the Hebrews, but never tells us why its evident. Tales of fruitless searches for Noah's Ark seem irrelevant (seeThe Genesis Question: Scientific Advances and the Accuracy of Genesisfor more on Noah, the Ark and the Flood) to this book. Focus on the catastrophe. In fact, there were many in ancient times as history has been revealing. Natives were in South America longer than previously thought. So some things here have found more truth decades after this book first appeared. Though one wonders how does retelling every account of \\"Amazon\\" women in the world relate to those actually in the Amazon? And the traditions similar to Christian ones, it doesn't occur to Wilkins that maybe some ancient visitors to the region were actually from the Old World and not Atlantis.

The information is not only presented in a very coherent fashion that is extremely user friendly (lots of pictures, tables, graphs, margin highlights, et al), but it is also supplemented with many hands on activities, such as projects and mini-labs, in addition to end-of-subchapter and chapter review questions. And, although the answers to these are not proffered in the back of the text, they are easily discernable if one has thoroughly read the course material, which I habitually do before preparing an assignment for my son.Moreover, upon comparing this edition with its more recent counterpart via Glencoe's website, I found them to be very similar. Sure, many of the chapters are rearranged and regrouped, and two additional chapters were added (Chapter 12: Electromagnetic Waves and Chapter 25: New Materials Through Chemistry) in the latest edition, but the information contained did not alter (and I can always supplement any missing information, which I already do anyway).All in all, this was QUITE an exceptional find particulary given its content along with its $7.24 price tag, and I have no qualms in recommending it to others."},{"Title":"Glencoe Physical Science","review":"My daughter likes this book.

After all, explaining C++ in anything less than 500 or 600 pages seemed impossible.I was very pleasantly surprised when I started reading though. This is very down-to-earth and crystal-clear reading. Easy to understand and, most importantly, you won't get overwhelmed by the sheer size of the mountain ahead of you. Naturally, you can't expect this book to turn you into a C++ guru. But that isn't its purpose. (Besides, there are *no* books that will turn you into a guru, only books that are more complete, including Stan's own C++ Primer.)This book is excellent for *learning* C++ and getting off the ground. It achieves this goal better than any other C++ book I've read. Once you've read this book, you can graduate to more advanced material, such as the C++ Primer (which is didactically very good) or Stroustrup's book (which is didactically nowhere near as good, but works better as a reference due to its terseness). \\"Essential C++\\" provides very solid C++ grounding without neglecting any of the important parts of the language.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Essential C++","review":"Finally we have a short, concise introduction to C++. As Stan himself mentioned, it follows the &quot;Learning Perl&quot; approach. Thus this book is not meant to be an exhaustive treatise of the language, but should give a working programmer a chance to start using this complex language. It takes the Perl approach in saying: use as much as you feel comfortable with to start, and as your knowledge progresses expend on your technique. I have seen some complains about number of errors in this book. For an errata please go to http://www.develop.com/hp/slip/Errata_1st.pdf. Also http://www.develop.com/hp/slip/windows.zip contains the source code for this book. In short (literally) we have a great book, which does a great job introducing C++ and at the same time, it is small enough to be carried around. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Essential C++","review":"This isn't greatest book to *learn* C++. I bought it largely on the strength of the other reviews and my experiences coding successfully in other languages but (e.g., perl, python, java, php, shell scripts, etc.). My experience with this book (even in comparison to other books I'e browsed on C/C++), it that it is written to be useful more for someone who already knows C++ or is a dedicated C programmer and wants to pick up C++.A great author usually writes in such a way as to not be misunderstood, but I found myself hae to reread passages frequently to answer questions which went unaddressed. Some typos were also evident, even in critical places--e.g., when he introduces references and relates them to pointers (page 46). At other times he'll introduce concepts without much expalanation at all. For example, the keyword extern shows up in the sample answer to problem 2.1 without being inroduced yet. The eventual discussion of extern on 64 is only useful if you already know what it means. He also likes to inject new concepts or syntax in the main text and footnote them with comments like \\"I'm certainly not going to explain this guy!\\" on page 33, referring you instead to some other book if you happen to have it nearby. Maybe this won't appear in subsequent editions. If you already have significant C/C++ experience, then you can esily oerlook these matters; but, if you are just trying to learn C++ (especially without a dedicated C background), then the compact nature of this exposition will be a two-edged sword.That said, I did like the sample problems and answers. I wasn't a big fan of the subject matter for the running example (a game based on sequences), but it serves as a framework for exposition. If you already know C/C++ but want to brush up on you techniques, then this may be a good purchase. Otherwise, keep looking."},{"Title":"Essential C++","review":"THIS BOOK ALONG WITH LIPPMANS' C++ PRIMER ARE ALL THAT IS NEEDED TO LEARN C++. BOTH BOOKS ARE EXTREMELY GOOD, IMHO! P. S.

However, the content of this book is not easy to follow if you are a \\"pure\\" novice. It's more suitable for \\"a little\\" experienced programmers rather than just a C++ beginner.It put more emphases on the \\"object-based, object-oriented, and generic\\" programming with function template, class template and some basic STL those had been used widely through this book.Even if the last chapter of this book covered the \\"Exception Handling\\", it is just a glance (14 pages for basic concepts). It's the most disappointing part. Other chapters are better and mentioned the key of their subjects.Again, just as I said, if you do NOT have ANY experience about C++, try a easier book. If you want to start C++ with this one, you'd better also have a great reference (such like \\"C++ Primer\\" by the same author, or \\"The C++ Programming Language by the the \\"father\\" of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup) and someone who can help you clear some important concepts.The author offered a very useful examples for generic algorithms and the solutions to the exercises in the appendix."},{"Title":"Essential C++","review":"The nice thing about this book is that it can be used for both learning the C++ language as well as for having a handy reference. The book covers C++ with a supprisingly good level of details even though it's meant to be concise. The author wrote valuable comments about the execution efficiency issue when using different coding options.A general comment on the author's approach is that he starts with the basics of C without making a distinction between C and C++ related instructions as the book moves further ahead. The C++ coverage does not suffer from that approach, the emphasis being put clearly on C++. Consequently, I recommend this book but a reader having a good knowledge of regular C will of course feel more comfortable."},{"Title":"Essential C++","review":"This book takes you from C++ ground zero up to writing some fairly complicated and interesting programs in a short time.

The whole language is very well written by K&R; in the classic book. Every sentence in that book is precise yet complete. For novice, the learning curve of C++ is steep because it is not as simple as C. At least, at first, software developers are afraid of the huge number of features and the inter-connections it offers.I have been waiting (and wondering) why pioneers of the C++ language didn't provide a simple book (at the same size of K&R; C) for the developer community? Here is the answer I found with this book \\"Essential C++\\". I bought C++ Primer long time ago. But I couldn't finish reading that book - just because the book is huge and better serves as a reference. With the same attractive/readable font and formatting as C++ Primer, Essential C++ offers a very good introduction to C++ in a step-by-step fashion - Procedural, Generic, Object-Based, Object-Oriented and STL programming.I sincerely suggest that every C++ programmer will be benefited by reading this book first.

For example, the chapter about exception handling gave me a quick and sufficient overview about concepts and syntax. Then when I read the book by Stroustrup, I caught up quicker and easier.However, this book will not serve as the one and only book in a professional or student's bookshelf. One will need one or both of the textbooks mentioned above to have more involving discussion.As long as we don't intend to use the book as a quick and dirty &quot;Teach yourself C++ in 7 days&quot;, the book serves it purpose as a concise priming and refreshing text."},{"Title":"Essential C++","review":"I think this is a terrific book.

(I'm a Java hack used to the Collection API, so the chapter on STL containers quite adequately answered the &quot;what do I do for a HashMap?&quot; question that popped up.)This certainly isn't a comprehensive C++ reference, and novices to programming are most likely not well served by this book, but I think _Essential C++_ is a great way for the experienced OOPer (but maybe not C++ guru) to dive in at the middling depth part of the C++ pool and start picking up the important idioms of the language in a short number of pages.Concise but in-depth.

A shape. Angles. Measurements. Relation of lines and points to x and y coordinates. The student reads the text and is provided information about the relationships between components in the diagram. A good student visualizes the relationships. They re-create the diagram in their imagination. It is the building of that internal map, that working, evolving, fluid picture in their own imagination - it is that that we call \\"learning.\\" It is to that diagram inside their head (which they ponder in their sleep) to which the student refers when asked questions on a test, or when they apply the knowledge in life.Learning is what happens naturally when information is presented to a human brain in an organized and respectful conveyance. The gifted teacher considers the student where they are and provides enough information for them to build a complete diagram within their mind. At the direction of such a competent teacher, the student returns again and again to their own diagram, embellishing and re-defining it to include and integrate new information. When the student can think through the most complex of tasks by creatively combining and drawing from their internal map, then that student will have \\"learned.\\"Can that process be measured? Does it matter whether the information is presented via multimedia or some other method?One essay in the book - \\"The Modality Principle in Multimedia Learning\\" suggests that learning is a function of dendrites and h-channels forming new protein connections, and that this happens best when information is presented in dual auditory and visual streams.If this internal map building business can be reduced to forming synoptic pathways, flexing fluid dendrites, forming new protein connections between brain cells, then maybe dual streams of sensory inputs will yield a greater mass of synoptic cytoplasm then mono streams, and is therefore a superior mode of conveyance. It bears consideration for the teacher who is story-boarding and architecting a video presentation. But is it really a superior form of learning? Does it build the best internal map? If two input streams are better than one, maybe vibrating a human brain with all five senses blazing at full volume would yield up the greatest quantity of new synoptic protein connections. But even if it does, so what? Is optimal learning a function of wiring up a human brain to the maximal mix of sensory inputs? That takes care of the quantity of learning. What about the quality? There is a massive intersection of highways just outside Atlanta that the locals call \\"Spaghetti Junction.\\" It is a swirl of roads all intersecting in a mind-numbing conflagration of streaming cars. But is it a better route, or just a bigger mess?There is a simple, profound experience to learning. The \\"I get it\\" experience. The moment when the material just gels. The instant of eureka! What was hard is suddenly easy. What was difficult a moment before now makes sense! That moment seems to have been entirely left out of the essays in this book. Never the less, if that experience can be brought more rapidly to groups of students through the use of multimedia content, then this book may usher in something significant.As far as I can tell, it does not.But time and trend will tell. There is a reason why chalk on slate has flourished since Aristotle. Is video merely a medium to enlarge the lecture hall? Is video's contribution to the learning process to merely aim a camera at a lecturer in front of a white board?

But it is far more than a sea story or an adventure story. It is a splendid examination of the abuse of power and of the necessity for society to maintain support for authority, no matter how greatly that authority may at times by misused.Different people tend to view the novel from faulty subjective viewpoints. Some see Capt. Bligh as a gross tyrant who got exactly what he deserved. But at no time does the narrator of the story attempt to justify the mutiny. Others see Fletcher Christian as a romantic hero, but the narrator makes it abundantly clear that his actions in seizing the ship and endangering the entire crew were misguided, to say the least. Always there is a sound balance and a mature evaluation of the actions of all characters, including the officers of the naval court who try those accused of the mutiny.The novel also presents a beautiful balance of scenes, from the harsh punishments on board the Bounty to the idyllic interlude of life in Tahiti to the appalling existence of prisoners chained hand and foot for months at a time, and from the depths of despair at a sentence of death by hanging to the dazzling strangeness of sudden freedom. Whether it is description of scene or action or feeling, the authors capture the essence of every element of the story with perfect clarity and depth. In short, this is an exceedingly well plotted and well written work of literature, which can be enjoyed by a wide range of readers, not just those who love adventure yarns."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"Mutiny on the Bounty is a stunning work of historical fiction that is a pleasure to read.The novel chronicles the events of the HMS Bounty as seen through the eyes of Roger Byam, a midshipman on the infamous Bounty. Through his eyes, the reader sees the terrible events unfold aboard the ship--the cruelty of Capt. Bligh that ultimately leads Fletcher Christian and much of the crew to mutiny against the captain. With Bligh left at sea, the crew returns to the South Pacific, seeking to make a new life for themselves and hoping to avoid capture and court martial by the British authorities. The conclusion of the novel is heart-wrenching and simply superb (and will be left as a surprise).This novel relies a good deal on historical fact, though the authors clearly fill in the gaps with literary license. The characters are superbly developed and the story is riveting throughout. There is much nautical vocabulary, but this shouldn't distract readers as it can be glossed over without losing any significant content. I am not a historian and can make no statements about the veracity of the portrayals in this book. I do know that readers will find this novel difficult to put down. It is simply a classic story."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"I finally got a copy of this book after a lifetime of seeing the story altered and parodied in cinema and television.

Otherwise you would think that Bligh returns to tahiti to capture Christian personally, which isn't in the book. You would think that Byam got to confront Bligh after being wrongly accused, which isn't in the book. And you would think that people were being keel-hauled from the bounty, which was explicitely stated in the book as being a practice banned years before.

One of the most amazing things about the book is that it has the excitement of a fiction book while staying fairly true to its historical roots. It is a harsh demonstration of seagoing life in the late 1700's (the voyage takes place in 1788-1789) and a beautiful description of life on primitive Tahiti. Nordhoff and Hall use imagery on par with the best authors of our times to bring a view of 18th century Tahiti to our minds where we can imagine the peacefull life of the Indians and sailors there. It also does a great job of creating a theme so emotional that it is difficult to put to words. Another reviewer on this site accurately described it as something along the lines of \\"a story of misuse of power and the necessity of men to support authority figures to keep order even if they abuse their power\\" (not an exact quote). This is especially relevant to life at sea where without strict discipline a ship and her crew would be in constant peril. The narrator, Rodger Byam (a fictional character based very strongly on a real midshipman on Bounty named Peter Heywood), tells of his life on Tahiti with his adopted family, his wife and daughter, and his trip in irons back to Mother England, where he discovers that he is to be tried for a mutiny which he had no part in. In several amazing plot twists however his case goes from death to freedom when a man thought to be dead surfaces from a tragedy at sea. I give the book five stars as it is not only on of the most well written books I have ever read, with simply dazzling imagery, but also conveys very emotional theme. It is a must read for anyone of any age capable of reading it."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"I've read \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" more times than I can count since I was a teenager and I've read just about everything I have been able to find about the Bounty since then. \\"Mutiny\\" is not a history but a romantic novel about the ship and crew. In that regard it paints Bligh as the villain and Christian as the hero. The reality was that Bligh's biggest problem was with his harsh tongue and that Christian's act of mutiny was impulsive.Nevertheless, the saga of the Bounty is perhaps the most famous and enduring sea story. A small ship, about 90 feet long and 20 feet wide leave in 1787 on what should've been an obscure expedition to deliver breadfruit from Tahiti to the Caribbean and instead the crew sailed off into immortality.\\"Mutiny\\" is a very romantic telling of the story through the eyes of the young midshipman, Roger Byam (in reality, Peter Heywood). Byam is befriended by and admires Fletcher Christian and he witnesses the abuses of Bligh towards the crew. The ship sojourns in Tahiti which is almost Eden-like to the English sailors. Soon into the homeward journey Christian leads a revolt and throws Bligh and his loyalists off the ship, he returns to Tahiti where the crewmen who couldn't go with Bligh are abandoned along with some of the mutineers who want to take their chances and Christian and 8 others of the crew sail off into oblivion. Byam and the others are caught by a British frigate sent off to avenge the taking of the Bounty and after an ordeal of their own Byam and the others stand trial for mutiny and face the hangman's noose.While not historically accurate it \\"Mutiny\\" is still a very enjoyable book and a deeper book than it is given credit for. The clash of cultures, men rebelling against oppression is what \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" is about. Part III of the Bounty Trilogy, \\"Pitcairn's Island\\" is even better than \\"Mutiny\\"."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"This is a wonderful book about the taking of the ship Bountyby its crew. It is well written much in the character of aromance novel. The work teaches the futility of managingsmall groups via coercion and excess force. Captain Blighis nowhere near the equal of Fletcher Christian in managingthe crew and handling daily ministerial decisions.In almost every instance, Captain Bligh resolves conflictwith excessive punishment and flippant directives.With every moment, the crew resents his presence even more.The readers can appreciate the easy contrast between CaptainBligh and Fletcher Christian. Further into the novel,a military court procedure leaves the judges perplexedand ultimately disappointed in the disproportionatepunishments administered by Captain Bligh. Near the end ofthe novel, his judgment is questioned and the audiencedevelops more sympathy for the person of Fletcher Christianand his crew.

The historical acurasy of the voyage as well as the ship is incredable. It definatly keeps the readers interest no matter how many times he/she has read it."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"If the pleasure that you derive from reading books about turn of the 19th century British Navy is based mainly upon the recounting of broadsides and boarding in the smoke (a la Aubrey/Maturin, Hornblower, et al), then the Bounty Trilogy (Mutiny on the Bounty, Men Against the Sea, and Pitcairn's Island) should probably not rank high on your list of things to read. However, if what you enjoy about the genre is the period itself, British Naval culture of the era, and intense if non-martial conflict between men, these three books should be high on your reading list indeed. For not only is the period well depicted and the history well laid out in a non-obtrusive fictional account, but the even-handed characterization of the primary actors is a joy to read. There is neither the sermonizing about Bligh nor hagiography of Christian that would be the approach expected of most most modern writers as they view bygone times through the moral squint of contemporary sensibilities. If written along such lines, the Bounty Trilogy would be a vapid depiction of Bligh as a purely bourgeois-imperialist ogre and Christian as a singular paradigm of revolutionary goodness. Instead, Nordhoff and Hall have given us complex characters that fully and deeply engage the reader and make the books a joy to read in-spite of the reader's knowledge of the ultimate outcomes of each volume. Highly recommended to anyone who feels they fit into the above described category of likely-to-be-pleased reader. 5 stars for the entire trilogy."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"The target audience for this book is not limited to naval buffs or adventure readers. This is good writing, a compelling story, and historically insightful - something for everyone.

The central issues raised in the first book are resolved implicitly and at length in \\"Men Against the Sea\\" and \\"Pitcairn's Island,\\" where the authors flesh out the denouement. Yes, they are novels, and entertaining in their own right, but on a deeper level they provide moral lessons that make the conclusions inescapable and unforgettable. This was required reading in my high school class and it wasn't until years later that I came to appreciate the full meaning and broad scope of this story, which addresses timeless issues central to the human condition, providing a greater understanding of people, society, and their relationship with the cruel indifference of nature. Although they are novels, I have done some further research on the story, read the trial transcripts, and have found that the facts of the story only bear out more strongly the implicit thesis of the authors. These works are some of the most memorable and useful literature I have ever read. To paraphrased a great philosopher: Read me now, and believe me later. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"I have read many books in my life but none had touched me so as Mutiny on the Bounty. This literary piece was one of the best books I have ever read. I read it for the first time when I was 12 years old and I still fell excited every time I read the book. This is a superb book that you won't want to miss."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"Before reviewing Mutiny on the Bounty, let me observe that it contains scenes of extreme violence against sailors in the form of corporal punishment that will nauseate sensitive readers. The violence in this book exceeds what would earn a movie an R rating. Captain Bligh's name will go down in infamy, and this novel deserves more than its share of the credit for making that be the case.H.M.S. Bounty was under assignment to go to Tahiti to secure breadfruit trees. It was hoped that these trees would grow well in the West Indies and could become a cheap source of food for slaves working there on the sugar plantations. Breadfruit trees do not have seeds, so had to be transported and transplanted to perform this experiment.On the way to Tahiti, Captain Bligh turns out to have several weaknesses as a leader. First, he seems to have stolen food from his men in order to increase his personal income. Second, he chose to think the worst of people rather than the best, so he favored the stick over the carrot. Third, he was incautious in his speech and constantly humiliated the men under his command. No one who reads this book would want to have served under Captain Bligh. In fact, many would rename him as Captain Blight.The weakness of the Bligh characterization is that we are given no comparison to what other British naval captains did at the same time. Was Bligh just a little worse, or twice as worse? I still don't know, and I have read a lot about this era. My impression is that what most of us would condemn was pretty typical except for the stealing from the crew's stores.The best part of the book contains a look at Tahitian culture during this time, and the psychological experience of being falsely accused of a capital crime. Fans of trials will also enjoy the way that the court martial is portrayed. You are given even detail to appreciate the nuances of what the issues were that the various accused were dealing with.I found that the book could have used more editing. Much of the novel could have been eliminated with no significant loss to the story. As a result, many modern readers will find that the book is very slow to get started. In a sense, the real appeal of the book begins with the mutiny about a third of the way through the book. In fact, a better structure might have been to have told most of the story of the voyage through flashback interspersed within the trip back to England and the court martial.The sailing descriptions assume a level of knowledge about masts, sails, and wind that are well beyond my awareness of sailing. The novel would have benefited from either explaining more about these points, or eliminating most of them.The book's final weakness is that the authors chose to use a fictional character with a unique role and no experience at sea as the narrator, rather than taking on the voice and perspective of one of the actual sailors. That choice caused the story to have a bit of a &quot;fairy tale&quot; quality that reduced its appeal to me.After you have read and enjoyed this well-known book, think about where your words could wound as much or more than a whipping. Learn to measure those words carefully before you release them. In many cases, you would be better not to say them at all.Appeal to the best in all you meet!"},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"We will probably never know exactly what occurred aboard HMS Bounty to cause a piratical Fletcher Christian to cast off Lt. Bligh and 18 other men in a 23 foot lauch to face near certain death either at the hand of savage islanders or the brutal open sea. But let me hazard a guess that events most certainly did not unfold as presented by Messrs. Nordhoff &amp; Hall.The authors' attempts to cast Christian as Melville's Handsome Sailor and Bligh as Forester's crazed Captain Sawyer are at best laughable and at worst slanderous to the name of an officer whose only faults appear to be a salty tongue and a tendency to coddle his men. It is axiomatic that pirates and mutineers are not noble men, and it is difficult to present a captain who promotes sailors to avoid putting his officers on watch and watch, who allows his friends on board (including Fletcher) free and full access to his grog, and who took great pains to return those who remained loyal to civilization (losing only a single man to island savages) as an unrepentant tyrant.It appears that Bligh is an imperfect leader, perhaps evidenced most strongly by the fact that the Bounty was not the only mutiny the man suffered, nevertheless, historical documents related to the events described in N&amp;H's work suggest that their presentation of these events is one-sided in the extreme. Bligh's problem, it appears, is that he would give an inch, his men would take a mile, and then eventually Bligh would berate his men to return the ship to order. I recommend to the reader The Bounty Muntiny, which consists of a number of documents written or released by Bligh and Fletcher's brother Edward in the years following the mutiny. Although these documents raise more questions than they answer, they suggest &quot;blame&quot; for the historical events cannot so easily be laid at Bligh's door.That book also reveals the interesting choices N&amp;H made in editing the courtmartial proceedings they present. Notably failing to mention that Heywood (the mutineer on which Byam's character is likely based) was seen with a cutlass close at hand during the mutiny and fabricating testimony to shore-up the fairy-tales invented by the mutineers. If I were to hazard a guess, I would suggest that the dissipation resulting from a crew spending months at leisure in the tropics among libidinous women and food and drink far superior to a ship's stores was a much larger motivation for the mutiny than Bligh's foul language.But, then again, maybe one's view of the mutiny depends much less upon the actual facts of the matter than upon whether one values ordered liberty or Godless, Freemasonic, French Revolutionary-esque hedonism."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"I was forced to choose a &quot;classic&quot; book to read over the summer. Reluctant, I chose Mutiny on a whim. It is a classic that most people have not expirienced.

The survival aspect of the book and the strength of these men's convictions makes this a wonderful story. The trial seems so unfair and upsetting.

After borrowing it, I read it for the first time as an adult and enjoyed it enough to read the remaining two books in the trilogy. Several years later, when I wanted to reread the series and found that my father had gotten rid of them, I added them to my Christmas wish list.I find myself carried along into the time period, caught up in the stories of the various participants. There is a reason this book is something of a classic. Though I cannot name what exactly draws me into this book and back to it, it's very definitely there. I do think that the writing is very good, and the story quite engagingly told.However, this is fiction. William Bligh's name has been unfairly blackened for the majority of people due to this book and the sequels that follow. When going back to the source materials from the general timeframe of the mutiny, we discover that much of what the book says is patently untrue. Bligh is portrayed to have flogged his sailors frequently at the least provocation. In reality, Bligh believed that floggings were to be avoided if at all possible. He ordered maybe seven floggings in seventeen months, a rate much much *much* lower than that of the average sea captain. This is just one example. The problem was that two of the mutineers came from prominent families that several years after the mutiny did everything they could to blacken Bligh's name to make the crime of their family members seem justifiable. And this was a time period when the story of a crew standing up to their unfairly tyrannical captain and going off to live on a tropical island was very appealing and romantic. For more information, I would recommendThe Bounty : The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty.I would rate this story a 5-star for story-telling, but because it engages in inadvertant character assassination, I'd bump it down to a 4-star. The authors probably didn't know any better having read many of the popular history materials of their day. But, the end result is still that Bligh has been to a large extent denied the praise and acclamation that he deserves for his open-sea boat voyage and other accomplishments, as well as having his name become synonymous with cruel tyranny."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"From Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall comes a timeless saga of the men who served aboard the H.M.S. Bounty. Fated to never return to England again, the Bounty would be set adrift in the stormy seas crewed by mutineers and her men across the globe with some reaching tragic fates. Mutiny on the Bounty, the first of the Bounty trilogy follows a young midshipman by the name of Roger Byam. During his voyage, many events happen that cause Byam to question his view on honor, courage, and loyalty. Even as events happen around him, Byam finds a deeper meaning to each of those traits. He realizes that honor, courage, and loyalty are the greatest traits that any sailor could possess, but that it is the man he is loyal to that really determines his nature.

The enduring story, and concequently myth, of the &quot;Bounty&quot; has only grown in prominence since the 18th century, and this American novel is its finest narration.

Better still, it is based on actual events! I think you'll agree with me that Captain Bligh makes a most agregious villian-his parts were almost difficult to read. Still, Roger Byam's heartfelt account made this a fascinating read. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"The story of the Mutiny on the Bounty is actually a trilogy of three books. \\"Mutiny on the Bounty,\\" is the first, detailing the mutiny itself and the fate of several of the mutineers (and some innocent bystanders) when they are eventually caught. \\"Men Against the Sea\\" follows the men who were kicked off the ship when the mutineers took control, and \\"Pitcairn's Island\\" is the story of 9 of the mutineers who were never caught because they went to live on the remote and difficult-to-access titular island.The captain of the Bounty, one William Bligh, is painted as an embezzeler who is also harsh on discipline. He bullies the quatermaster into signing false consumption reports (and then sells what isn't eaten at port), threatening to hang anyone who disagrees with him. Similarly, he is a harsh disciplinarian who orders flogging for the least offenses, regularly insults his first mate (Christian), and is quick to invoke the Law of the Sea to keep the men in line, rather than trying to win their affection and respect. Eventually, he pushes Christian too far, which precipitates the mutiny.This book is probably the least interesting of the trilogy. It follows a standard narrative structure, being narrated by one (fictional) young officer that Bligh believed to be part of the mutiny. Because of Bligh's testimony, all those left aboard the Bounty (however unwilling) were guilty of mutiny, which sets up the situation where the narrator must depend on the testimony of mutineers to prove his innocence. But overall, there is something meandering about the story that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the book. The most interesting aspect of the book is how well it relives the golden days of British seapower and how it demonstrates the difficulty of the average seaman when faced with a petty tyrant for a captain."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (The Modern library)","review":"\\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" is the first entry of a very interesting trilogy that includes \\"Men Against the Sea\\" and \\"Pitcairn's Island\\". What makes the trilogy unique is that after the events of the famous mutiny the second half of this book and the next two novels all happen simultaneously as the crew members of The Bounty split up into three groups. The primary novel follows Roger Byam, the stories narrator, who departs with the mutineers but was not in fact involved in the taking of the ship. \\"Men Against the Sea\\" is the story of Captain Bligh and 18 members of the Bounty crew who were set adrift and their voyage back to England. The story of Fletcher Christian who led the mutiny and his group is chronicled in \\"Pitcairn's Island\\".\\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" is a first person account of the true life taking of the Bounty by Lieutenant Fletcher Christian after an intolerable amount of verbal abuse heaped on him and the rest of the crew by Captain Bligh. This is the only classic novel I can ever recall reading that has two authors; those being Charles Nordhoff and James Normal Hall. In fact the two collaborated on around a dozen different books none of which I had ever heard of besides Botany Bay and that was only because of the usage of the name in Star Trek. The writing is very similar to the style of the times which uses a formal, sober third person account of mutiny. Sometimes these older books can feel a bit dry but Mutiny on the Bounty is anything but. Nordoff and Hall don't demonstrate the poetic skills of a Rudyard Kipling but this is a magnificently well written book. This is one of those books where there authors make writing seem effortless. The pacing is well done dividing the book into three parts. First is the lead up to the mutiny and the mutiny itself, then we have Roger Byam's time in Tahiti and finally Byam's capture and return to England to stand trial.If you ever want to know how treacherous the life of a sailor is this is the book to read. Ironically Captain Bligh manages to return to England in a 23 foot launch with just one lost life while the fully stocked ship transporting Byam manages to wreck itself near Australia and lose a good portion of its crew. Bligh is written as a rather detestable character but not cartoonishly so and given the extreme dangers of sailing in the late 1700's, keeping discipline, even in the midst of a tyrannical Captain is not such an absurd notion. This is a book that fully earns the title \\"classic novel\\".

There was so much I didn't know about older people -- what is important to them, how they think, what their needs are, how they approach death. Simone de Beauvoir, the celebrated French thinker and writer offers an in-depth study of older people as individuals and older people in society. She also looks at the treatment and psychology of older people across time in western civilization. Anyone who is a caretaker of an older family member or friend, or cares about understanding older people will find this book remarkable and thoughtful."},{"Title":"The coming of age","review":"Simone de Beauvoir places the subject quote, from the \\"searcher for lost time, himself,\\" Marcel Proust, most fittingly, at the beginning of this seminal work. De Beauvoir was one of the most outstanding French intellectuals of the 20th Century, famous for her novels, \\"The Mandarins,\\" and \\"She Came to Stay\\", as well as one of the longest autobiographies ever, a total of four volumes. She was also, for better or worse, the lifetime companion of Jean-Paul Sartre. Rare is the person who writes one seminal (double-entendres are not intentional, and would hopefully be forgiven) work on a field, and she is most famous for \\"The Second Sex,\\" originally published in 1949, an extraordinary examination of the role of women in the world's society; a work which was a precursor to the feminist movements in the \`60's. Rarer still is the person who can write two seminal works, and despite the fact it never has gained as much \\"traction\\" with the reading public, I consider \\"The Coming of Age,\\" published in 1970, when De Beauvoir was just over 60, to be the equal of \\"The Second Sex\\" in terms of its comprehensive, and original examination of a subject that society, as well as many individuals, prefer to, well, as Proust said, retain as an abstract notion. Speaking of an abstract notion, I first read this work when I was under 30, in part since that is what I did; work with the elderly. I decided to re-read it now, since it is far less abstract, being around the age De Beauvoir was when the book was published. It has lost none of its power; now I understand, and have read more of her references.In the introduction De Beauvoir says that she intends to \\"break the conspiracy of silence\\" on what she has been told is a \\"dismal subject.\\" And indeed she does. As she did in \\"The Second Sex,\\" she used her phenomenal erudition to cover how old age is perceived in different societies, for example, the Koryak, a northern Siberian people. She also examines the historical record of how societies dealt with aging, from the ancient Greek, Chinese and Jewish societies. Her observation about the power of the elderly in these societies remains fresh. Consider: \\"Sometimes they had real power, sometime they played the part that, in certain mathematical operations, is played by imaginary numbers-they are necessary for the working out of the problem, but once the answer has been reached, they are eliminated.\\" Concerning the present day, she notes the seeming paradox of how society shuffles the handicapped and the orphans to the sidelines, not to be thought of much, but the same is done to the elderly, though that is the most likely fate for all of us, unlike the other sub-categories. From her voluminous reading she relates the experiences of numerous individuals to aging, and I found the trials and tribulations of Juliette Drouet, who tolerated the infidelities of Victor Hugo, as well as Sophia Tolstoy, who experienced the same with her husband, illuminating.There is melancholy, and its antidote. She quotes the poet Mallarm&eacute;: \\"This scent of melancholy that the realizing of a dream for who has realized it, even when there is neither failure nor regret.\\" The antidote, she quotes from the ethnologist Georges Condaminas, author of \\"We Have Eaten the Forest,\\" about the Montagnards in the highland of Vietnam: \\"It must be understood that when a day is spent traveling is transposed to memory it takes up a far greater \\"space\\" than one spent at home.... The play-back time is a magnification of real time.\\"There is much in the book that is a cause for optimism, and among others, she cites Goya's masterpieces on \\"The Disasters of War,\\" which he began at 66, and reports in an appendix on numerous centenarians, living fulfilling lives in Brittany.De Beauvoir concludes though with the rather unrealistic statement that: \\"Once we have understood what the state of the aged really is, we cannot satisfy ourselves with calling for a more generous \`old age' policy, higher pensions, decent housing and organized leisure. It is the whole system that is at issue and our claim cannot be otherwise than radical--change life itself.\\" Well, not much progress has been made on that front over the last 30 years. Whether you're 30, and the notion is still quite abstract, or 60, and the \\"coming\\" part is less theoretical, or even 90, this is an essential work on the inevitable process of life."},{"Title":"The coming of age","review":"Are old people real people? That is de Beauvoir's question.When I first read this book 30 years ago, I thought it was so great I assigned it to my students in a course on gerontology. Now that I am older than the author was when she wrote it, I realize how little she really knew about old people.de Beauvoir is not a sociologist or a gerontologist, but a professor of philosophy and leftist French writer. She (and her partner Jean Paul Sartre) often took official positions on certain topics as a matter of principle, but with little understanding coming from the heart. She has a clear philosopher's gaze and is utterly pitiless. She doesn't cut people any slack.Her great contribution in this book is that she brings a wider attention to what it's like being old in terms of how societies conceptualize old age and in terms of old age as a subjective experience. She does this by quoting from the lives and works of famous authors and artists who lived to a ripe old age. She defines a ripe old age as anything over 60! How times have changed. Currently the average life expectancy in the US is over 75! It's over 83 in Kansas.I now live in a town of 15,000 whose founding mayor was elected when he was past the age of 80. He died in office, suddenly, at 86, in the middle of a development planning project.Many of my neighbors are pushing 90 or 100. There are several centenarians. All keep active, walking for miles and swimming for hours every day. Are they real people? You bet! Are some of my neighbors with canes, walkers, hearing aids, cataract surgery, and nurse's aides or companions real people? You bet!The amazing thing about old age is people just want to keep on doing what they are used to doing for as long as they can.Many of the peculiarities of age that de Beauvoir describes are now known to be due to physical medical problems, which are treatable. However, her work is still valid for those last few weeks or months of severe impairment, just before death. You just won't feel good after reading this book."},{"Title":"Escape from the Holocaust (Roseman, Kenneth.

I have not shown this book to anyone who didn't consider it to be a sick exercise and totally inappropriate.

On every page the young reader confronts the kinds of real life choices that once meant the difference between freedom or slavery, survival or death for thousands of other young people and their elders. The protagonist is a young medical student in Berlin during the 1930s who is confronted by the rise of Hitler and the Nazi's with a choice of returning to his native Poland or remaining to finish his studies. When the holocaust begins, the choices offered are to flee south to Italy or west to Holland. When escape isn't possible any longer, the alternatives are to go into hiding or to obtain false identity papers. Every decision embodies risks in an attempt to survive what is happening around him.

Once a franchise viably captures the public's imagination, readers demand sophisticated, exciting innovations on a familiar theme. However, as the bar gets raised higher and higher, and as readers become de-sensitized, most series inevitably go stale or become far-fetched. Think, for example, of the sagging work of Canadian author Michael Slade, who like Thomas Harris, writes about brilliant serial killers with a flair for ingenious, over-the-top gorefests, replete with historical context and arcane erudition. The difference is, Thomas Harris takes a very long time between installments; and therefore, Harris fans are justified in believing they deserve better.The Hannibal Lecter series reached this &quot;what next&quot; juncture in the last decade, with The Silence Of The Lambs. At the end of that novel, readers were left with the impression that the series would follow a Hannibal Lecter let loose on the world, free to travel and kill in new and creative ways, in diverse and exotic locales, while staying one step ahead of the law - a cannibalistic version of Anne Rice's globetrotting vampire superstars.In writing Hannibal, Mr. Harris was clearly cognizant of the need to keep his series unpredictable. His choice of plot does accomplish that objective -- but in ways that may leave fans feeling disappointed.Instead of a dashing Scarlet Pimpernel of cannibalism, Hannibal Lecter 3.0 is a stuffy, academic type, ensconced in a low-key arts curator job in Italy, indulging his appetite for fine arts and foods, rather than for people. Indeed, one almost suspects that Lecter's violence is justified under a reluctant vigilante ethos -- that he'd gladly not bother a soul, as long as he's left alone under protective cover, free at last to pursue his arts research. Lecter's charisma is dim here (as an offbeat analogy, compare Harrison Ford's roles today with his Han Solo character in Star Wars).This plot judo gives Mr. Harris license to turn many tables on us. First, he dials down Lecter's threat quotient to purely reactive mode, morphing Lecter into an almost sympathetic character motivated by a desire for anonymity and a need to heal the scars of his own childhood.Having put Lecter in neutral, Mr. Harris stokes the fires of dementia in a Class A nemesis, Mason Verger - an abominable child abuser and clever manipulator of political power, whom Lecter had horribly (justly?) victimized in times past. Driven insane by a need for revenge, and suitably well financed, Verger insists on bringing Lecter out of his shell; but the author executes this plot strand too laboriously, telegraphs his intentions too obviously to be particularly disturbing. Third, the author reduces the FBI to Mason Verger's tool -- a bunch of infighting, incompetent bureaucrats, venal and corrupt, concerned more with media politics than with apprehending criminals. Allegorically, the real monster in Hannibal is not Lecter, but &quot;the system&quot; -- wealthy bad guys and the goverment that colludes with them.As if all this were not enough, Mr. Harris puts Clarice Starling on an emotional intersection course with Hannibal Lecter. The results of that strange alliance will strain the credulity of even the most flexible-minded reader. Even the author's elegant prose and stylized horror scenography backfire, lending an aura of John Cleese-style formal absurdity to a final dinner episode that was supposed to horrify.All in all, at this point in the series, fans of Thomas Harris probably deserved an outrageously wild and energetic novel. Instead, the author decided to give us the literary equivalent of an Adagio. Therefore, Hannibal leaves open some questions that may be more interesting than the novel itself. Is Hannibal the beginning of the decline in the Cannibal series? Did Thomas Harris &quot;go Hollywood&quot;? Or is he transitioning into fresh, creative new territory? Let's hope we don't have to wait ten more years to find out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A bizarre attempt to portray Hannibal as a kinder, gentlerpsychopath: sure, he still savagely kills folks just for the hell of it, but he has a good excuse: during WWII, his beloved baby sister was eaten by deserters. ......................................................This was just a gawd-awful book. No wonder Jodie Foster wouldn't touch the movie version with a ten-foot-pole. Save your money, folks."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As soon as I heard that Hannibal was released I rushed to the bookshop in a cliched manner. I couldn't put the book down for the two days that I spent reading it, and when I did, I was breathless. However..... The scenes are atmospheric, and gripping, but I get the feeling that Harris is playing too much on the success of the Silence of the Lambs film. In hindsight, Harris seems to be too over-concerned with portraying Hannibal as a nice chappie with a small &quot;canibalistic&quot; problem. I guarantee that the film will be a stunner though..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yes, some beautiful prose! Yes, some interesting new characters! But why did we have to resort to horror and gore? The beauty of the previous novels was that blood was only &quot;local colour&quot; so to speak. Here, it screams for attention in itself. Overall, I was very disappointed - horror fans and students of Italian art will both find enjoyable bits (not the same ones) but crime fans like me will probably want to go back to the previous books (although they get a bit spoiled by the character development in this one)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In this sequel to Silence of the Lambs, the focus has been shifted to Hannibal himself. The first two thirds of the book are well written and quickly capture the reader's attention and curiosity regarding the thinking processes of the obviously intelligent Hannibal. However, the last third of the book rapidly descends to a psychotic mish-mash of brainwashing, drugs, and bizarre cannibalistic rituals. The ending is disappointing and unbelievable. It seems that Hannibal's psyche is explored to its very depths, and beyond the *reality* he has created there is nothing of any substance."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Poorly written. Shallow. Too much detail on the peripherals, too little detail where it might have helped. Convoluted, impossible plot. An ending that can only be the product of a short-timer. Gratuitous grossness, where I was expecting the exquisite craft and subtlety of SotL and Red Dragon. The characters were, for the most part, formulaic caricatures - Harris really skimped when he was creating or elaborating on them. As for Starling and Lecter, Harris took them out of themselves and made them each into something particularly disappointing. He took a cheap out in defining why Lecter is the way he is, and removed all intrigue from the man - made him a mealy-minded sentimental idiot. And what he did to Starling dismayed me to no end. After the first few chapters, I really came to despise her in her weakness and shallowness. Harris owes much more to the characters that he so superbly brought to life in his previous two books. He owes a lot more to his loyal readers, as well, and turning out mindless, off-the-wall, unbelievable drivel like this will, at the least, decimate the legions of his loyal readers if he does not find some way to make amends.The book started out all right - but after the first couple of chapters, well - let's just say I could have had a better quality read curling up with Olivia Goldsmith or Jackie Collins or even Louis L'Amour. I was shocked and saddened by Harris' selling out as he obviously did. I regret to say that I finished the book, hoping with the turn of every page that Harris would redeem himself. He did not. If you loved SotL or Red Dragon, do yourself a favor and skip this cookie cutter refuse. If you insist upon reading it despite the ample warnings from hundreds of readers who, like me, felt cheated, at least borrow it from the library, rather than wasting money in addition to time.There are plenty of other bad things I could say about this most unsatisfying book - but at the moment (I just finished it an hour ago), I am so dumbfounded by its ineptitude and sheer badness that words fail me. That seems to be a trend - words most obviously failed Harris in the writing of this unbelievably poor excuse for a novel.In sum, &quot;YUCK!&quot; What a rip off. The only novel that underwhelmed me more was Patricia Cornwell's &quot;Hornet's Nest.&quot; Avoid them both at all costs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With ample anticipation, I purchased Thomas Harris' novel with the impression that my grasp of Hannibal Lecter and other characters would become more lucid through the author's usual penetrating eye and style. However, as I turned from page to page, it became evident that something was awry. The clever repartee that I awaited was not extant. The characters, although fully fleshed, remain feeble and superficial. Mason Verger, the novel's antagonist (and I use this term loosely) is more annoying than sinister, and his henchmen loiter around the perimeter of the work, never seeming to join in (which is perhaps wise on their part). Both Mason and his sister Margot are not much more than &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;-esque individuals who canker the types of characterizations that Jame Gumb and Francis Dolorhyde made sacrosanct in the previous works. Verger's grand scheme to take vengeance on Lecter is nothing more than the puerile devises of an imbecile plotting against a genius. I found myself guffawing at his ideas. I pray that Harris intended Verger to be the fool that he is. Clarice Starling endures as a strong-willed FBI agent; however, she seems to flounder as second banana. Finally, there is Dr. Hannibal Lecter: psychiatrist, connoisseur, and cannibal. When I undertook the challenge of reading the novel, it was the insights into Lecter's personality and peculiar history that I eagerly awaited. What I discovered was a frightened little boy grown up, exercising frightening abilities all for the sake of finding his lost little sister. Pardon me, but big woo! As far as plot, it falls back on itself, unable to stand confidently in the face of extreme absurdities such as Verger's breeding of vicious man-eating swine and Paul Krendler's gourmet lobotomy, not to mention the &quot;possession&quot; of Clarice Starling at the end of the work. To put it simply, it became increasingly difficult to suspend willingly my disbelief as I progressed through the murky echoes of flashbacks and inane disclosures. Winding around the corners, it became apparent that I was lost within a labyrinth of my own creation. That is to say, I was bound to Harris' previous novels by invisible and velvet chains, while this essay seemed to imprison me within the confines of some medieval torture device. Although I could not put the novel down-mainly in hopes that it would improve and come to its senses-something about the rhythm of the text seduces the reader, hypnotizes him, deludes him into believing that arcane mysteries will be unveiled. I for one found myself muttering and grumbling at the fact that something was simply not right and that it never was going to be. In any event, I must commend Harris on his detailed research. Every particular is polished-each fragment brilliant. His work is reminiscent of Eco or Borges in its permeating gaze and de Sade in its brutality. However, even these perquisites are not enough to liberate Hannibal from the ominous death knell that critics will ring. Hannibal will be remembered (and most likely forgotten) as the novel whose reach extended beyond its grasp. Nonetheless, Hannibal, taken on its own is a striking, if often graphic expos&eacute; of the deviant and preternatural. It is the answer to the rhetorical question that readers often ask at the end of a novel: what happens next? Unfortunately, this question is one that no one really wants answered; it ultimately dispels the illusion the reader has carefully crafted in his mind. The novel is a good example of when too much is not a good thing. Hannibal is an inferior addition to an otherwise sterling set."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I simply can't take any more whining about this book. It is NOT a movie, these are NOT your characters, Mr. Harris created them and can do whatever he likes. He didn't force you to wait around for 11 years. To me, Hannibal is wonderfully written (but in need of some skillful editing) and gripping from beginning to end. Ah yes, the ending: love it or hate it, it is impossible to tear your eyes away from the page. In concocting the closing scenes of Hannibal, Mr. Harris has written some of the most vivid and indelible lines in recent American fiction. The complaining and criticizing of this book amazes and amuses me. Stephen King -- who knows just a little bit more about writing than the rest of us -- gave Hannibal a rave review. That review aptly describes most of what is great about this book but does gloss over the weaknesses such as the uneven writing and the drawn-out Italy scenes. Ignore the grammatically incorrect, misspelling-laden, complaining reviews you see below (including the one from the &quot;Mensa&quot; member -- impressive!). Read Mr. King's review of Hannibal, and then read the book itself. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ouch. Although I think fans of the series should read this book if they're interested, I would *seriously* recommend borrowing it or waiting for the paperback. What I've loved about Harris's previous work is that he's an extremely intelligent, always surprising writer; I had no expectations for this novel as far as plot goes, but silly me, I *was* expecting it to be competently written.Instead, I got ridiculous character inconsistency, and I'm not even talking about the idiotic ending, which I can only assume had to be a joke. (To a much lesser degree, I had the same problem with the screenplay for &quot;Silence&quot;: They changed details about the characters that made certain lines nonsensical, but left those lines in.) While everyone discusses in tones of awe how Lecter's genius at hiding himself will make him near impossible to catch, the genius himself is busy being instantly found by everyone, everywhere he goes, by doing every single thing people think he will do.I got pathetic Psych 101 rationales: Lecter is evil because of his traumatic childhood (awww...); Starling figures all black people (her best friend included) will hate her because, in the line of duty, she shot a homicidal drug dealer who shot her first (because as we all know, every African-American alive holds homicidal drug dealers in near-holy reverence).When my friend lent me this book, he said, &quot;Don't get too excited.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, it couldn't be that bad!&quot; I chuckle bitterly now, looking back at my innocence. I could go on for pages, but most of it has been said before. If you, as a reader, expect more than over-the-top gore and pretty descriptions of art and truffles from a book, you need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not having read any of Harris's other books, I had no preconceptions when I picked this one up. But the novel never seems sure where it wants to go, and after drifting around a bit, ends up as a string of setups whose purpose is to seduce us into agreeing that the victim of each inflated atrocity gets what he deserves--kind of a mixture of Marvel comics and pornographic sadism. It becomes essentially a series of disconnected revenge fantasies perpetrated by the wicked and powerful for the pleasure of us, the meek and powerless. Completing the condescension with multiple references to the icons of haut bourgeois consumption, a la &quot;Lives of the Rich and Famous&quot;, Harris dangles before us scenes of Lecter buying perfumed soaps in Florence, sipping Chateau Petrus (fabulously expensive red wine), Chateau d'Yquem (fabulously rare and expensive sweet white wine}, and Montrachet (the most expensive white burgundy--easily several hundred a bottle). It's only too easy to imagine Harris calling his local wine merchant and saying, &quot;Say, what are the world's three most famous and expensive wines?&quot; And surely, Lecter must realize, with his exquisite sense of smell, that the dominant perfume in all of these treats is the musk of self-congratulation.By the end of the book, ones senses Harris's fatigue and loss of control, as Starling is reduced to a gleaming wet dream surrounded by candles and flowers no interior decorator could have arranged more artfully.Akways, in the background, one hears the clanking machinery of the library research teams, generating esoterica about hog breeding, medieval Florentine architecture, various fetish automobiles--all stuff Ian Fleming did years ago, and better. I'd say give this one a pass."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is the fourth novel (third featuring Hannibal Lecter) from Thomas Harris, who takes his time writing (he's written four novels since 1975, with eleven years passing since &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was published). I didn't read &quot;Silience&quot; until last year, but I can imagine the frustration over having to wait 11 years to find out what happens. It opens on a positive note with a shootout practically written for the screen, and stays rather steady from there with the pleasant exception of a few surprisingly gory parts (even for Harris) which are excellently told with a deadpan demeanor. A few of the descriptions of Florence are so unnecessarily extensive that they make one think that Harris is simply showing off how much he knows about the city. The novel picks up after it leaves Florence and hurries toward a repulsively good climax. As others have said, the ending of the book is ridiculous, poorly thought out, and hugely disappointing. It leaves room for yet another sequel (expected in about 20 years), and demonstrates again Harris' annoying lack of feeling for any of his characters. The ending is so awful, it makes the otherwise above-average book worth reading only for closure."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a major disappointment. I should have known better than to buy and read it especially after perusing the plotline revelations online, but when I read Silence of the Lambs curiosity got the better of me so I went into Hannibal with low expectations and it was even worse than what I had expected.First problem, the entire plotline involving Mason Verger is insipid and uninspired. I refuse to believe it took Thomas Harris 10 years to come up with it. It transcends willing suspension of disbelief and lands squarely in the c'mon-get-real-this-is-just-way-too-dumb category of fiction. It borders on insulting the reader's intelligence.Second, the conclusion involving Clarice and Hannibal is jaw-dropping only in the sense that it too is completely unbelievable and contrary to everything that Clarice said, did and stood for in Silence of the Lambs.Third, the supposedly chilling scenes were comical rather than scary. While Lambs was full of scenes containing genuine suspense and horror, Hannibal lacks all of that. Some examples include the dinner scene with Krendler, the final scene with Mason and his sister, and anything involving the Sardinians.Hannibal fails in too many ways to enumerate here. It's unworthy as a novel let alone a sequel to a brilliant book and movie. I pray this never gets turned into a screenplay with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins signing on. Thomas Harris can surely do better than this it's just a shame that this is how it all turned out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book starts off wonderfully with Harris's visualization; you can see everything you read. There are complex characters introduced and of course a wicked weave between them. He shows the master insanity of Hannibal with his elaborate set-ups for escape from not only Starling but from a vile creature named Verger who sets out to seek revenge on the good doctor. And you are eating this up the whole time, because it seems that Harris is once again quite the masterful story teller. But then you get to the last few chapters.The best way I can describe it is it seems like he took his time and thought out every little detail like it was the master term paper. But then all of a sudden he realizes he doesn't have the time needed to finish it so he rushes it and throws an ending together. It was almost like to different authors. And of the ending! And what he does with Clarice! I was put off by the whole book in a matter of a few thousand words.James A.

He is haunted by the memories of his sister and we see in depth how he became what he is. But Hannibal also keeps his power to turn even the bloodiest of deaths into an almost poetic precision.I loved how every character had another working against them and all were caught up in the search for Hannibal. The final chapters where they all collide is wonderful, and the ending is nothing short of beautiful. Clarise goes from being just an annoying detective with nothing else to live for to becomming a romantic figure who can match the depth and passion of even Hannibal himself.In short this book is great, not just for people who love Hannibal, but for anyone who knows how to appreciate the beauty of the written art."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Isn't it amusing to notice that the reviewers who downgrade the book don't spell the characters' names right? I've seen Lectors, Lechters, and even Lectures. This can only mean that they haven't touched the book, but just watched that lame Hollywood adaptation.First of all, any knowledgeable reader is bound to notice that Harris is preparing you for the ending all along the course of the book. Starling becomes an outcast, Lecter is chased by an alliance of powerful enemies, and justice can be only served ... by Lecter.A couple of problematic spots:Mason is unrealistically evil and thus becomes more of a caricature of a moneybag tycoon. However, the short overview of how his father manipulated the lawmakers rings true.His fascination with - well - pork and how it can be used for torture is overboard and cartoon-ish.The physics and calculus mentioned are not substantial enough to actually support any theory.Just a couple of false notes in the last paragraphs. I would prefer them to be a little more mysterious rather than so \\"picture-perfect\\".Too much gore. As \\"Silence\\" has ably demonstrated, horror can be conceived with scarce gore, but ample character portrayals.Other than these relatively small faults, the book is quite good, it has a sense of finality (meaning no more sequels) and it might be best to leave Dr. Lecter be, for there are certainly more monsters out there, even if they don't serve brain pate and enjoy Dante."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book isn't in the same league as Red Dragon or Silence Of The Lambs. I mean, let's get real here: Hannibal Lecter kidnaps Clarice Starling and she ends up falling in love with him??? It's no wonder Jodie Foster refused to reprise the role she made famous in Silence Of The Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This novel takes large leaps into the ironic and the absurd, this novel takes risks. Instead of simply writing another installment to the Red Dragon, Silence series, he's pulled the carpet out from under those books and has really jabbed somthing deep and cold into the reader's eye."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Incredible...and the movie does follow quite well. Could not put the book down. The reader tends to become as entralled with Lechter as much as Starling. Harris is a genious in continuing the saga of Dr. Lechter...more to come? I hope so. Harris is able to keep the reader held hostage from page to page. Viewed the movie also...and was pleased with the transition from book to film ...well done Ridley Scott, etc."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Knocked my socks off! Reading some of the negative reviews of this book (especially re the ending) I can only assume some of the detractors have never found themselves &quot;losing their religion&quot;, as we watch Starling do throughout the book. She had devoted her heart and soul to the FBI, and got it trampled due to inner politics. Her disillusionment, while not really dwelt upon intimately, is real and plausible; considering the fact that Lecter uses hypnosis on her, who knows how much of the new Starling came from him? Perhaps she is a savage deep down; but again, what are her choices? Slaving thanklessly for a pittance &amp; risking death for ridicule &amp; public censure - or traveling the world with a rich, intelligent, fascinating man? Their connection of both being orphans with nothing left to lose gives them both everything to gain; one hopes they enjoy together the pleasures of the world and one another and forego the horrors of each of their pasts."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have just finished &quot;Hannibal&quot; and I loved it. I don't understand the whining of many other reviewers. This is a book about, among other things, some serious disordered maniacs. If you expect Clarice and Hannibal to remain static, as you remembered them from &quot;Lamb&quot; (book, not movie)than you will certainly be disappointed. Hannibal isn't even the nuttiest person in the book! Part of the brilliance of this novel is Harris' ability to make you root for Dr. Lecter. The last 30 pages are bizarre, but not totally unbelievable (any more than the 430 pages proceeding) and the ending was awesome. The &quot;ride into the sunset together&quot; knocked me right out of my chair-but I liked it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was one of the finest movies of our time. And although I never read the book, I was immediately drawn to its sequel, &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I saved it for vacation, which is the only time I get to read a novel. Therefore, I try to pick one that stands a chance of capturing my interest and imagination. From the outset, I knew that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a major disappointment. It is gore for the sake of gore. None of the characters are believable, and most of the situations described are ludicrous, even for fiction! Word has it that they are filming this one, too. I can't imagine that even the genius of Jody Foster and Anthony Hopkins can save this pointless bloodbath. I only kept reading it because I kept telling myself &quot;this has to get better.&quot; And then I got to the end...which was a complete letdown. A perfect example of how more is not always better!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't WAIT for this book to come out, and while I read it voraciously (and had nightmares about it), the ending was really disapointing. I kept waiting for Clarice to step out of the shower and say to Ardelia, &quot;I just had the strangest dream.&quot; The story is deliciously horrifying (okay bad word choice) but the twist it takes at the end is just so out of character for Clarice. I actually had to reread the last chapter a couple of times to be sure I didn't miss something. I didn't. As horrifying as the first two in the series were, they were believable. This is horrifying and just plain weird."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book brought back the wonderful characters I loved in Silence of the Lambs. The story line was exciting and I could absolutely picture these same characters, who performed as I would have expected. But, the ending really disgusted me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I wonder what the author was thinking of. He had such a great opportunity to create a great thriller.What a bizzare mess he cooked up. I think there is a really good movie in this, if a clever sceenplay author can cut out all the B.S."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You would think that Harris would have read his previous book to know about the characters for the sequel. I can't give away the ending, only to say: &quot;Give me a break!&quot; In no conceivable way do any of these characters act this way in real life. And the protagonist, she's as nutty as the cannibal. There was not one believeable character in the whole book. Harris didn't have it for long, and he lost it quickly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After waiting so many years for the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, I was greatly disappointed when I read this book. I found it mundane and boring. I was hoping for a more in-depth study of the characters of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lechter and the things that made them such wonderful opponents. I was highly surprised to discover the fact that Harris just wanted to get rid of them. If he writes another book, I'll wait for the paperback or check it out from the library. The promise Harris showed in Red Dragon and Silence certainly isn't reflected in this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It was beautifully writen, with an engaging plot. Yes some parts of it are voilent but no more so than the previous two tales featuring Dr. Lechter.What is exceptional about this book is the variety of styles Harris makes use of. This book includes gothic, midevil, and trancesdental styles. By the end of the book I could not put it down.The reason I gave this book only four stars is I did find some inconsinetes regarding Dr. Lechter's charcter. In this book he commits murders he never would have commited in the previous book and he does so without explination. But on the whole it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I guess some authors only have one really, really good book in them. In Harris case it was The Red Dragon. Although I did enjoy The Silence of the Lambs, it wasn't as nearly as good as The Red Dragon, but still a good read. Then along comes Hannibal, and it turns out to be the worst piece of drivel I have ever had the misfortune to read!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a fan of Thomas Harris's books, I was anxious to read &quot;Hannibal.&quot; However, I was extremely disappointed with the plot and the ending was nothing short of unbelievable. So many things were wrong with this story that I cannot go into them. The dinner scene near the end was just gross. I kept waiting for the scary parts, but it was just babble. The characters were over-engineered and their motives didn't ring true. Too bad. Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs are among some of my favorite fun time reading."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only reason I give &quot;Hannibal&quot; a four instead of a five is because I did not like the part about Hannibal in Italy. It was too boring and I found myself craving Starling in her 5.0 Mustang. I agree with the reviewer who said the ending was a bit far-fetched. I can hardly wait to see this as a movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Leave your morals at the door, suspend not only belief, but forget how the sequence of thought works, forget what you know about friendship, forget what a reading a good book feels like, forget this guy Harris was ever able to string two sentences together and engage your interest, forget that you squander every minute you spend reading this dead on arrival piece of doggy doo, and forget it, you're not getting a refund unless you stop after the first sentence and send this mistake back! Why oh why did I read the whole thing?? The ending was unforgivable. This is required reading for sociopaths-in-training. One good thing--you can line your litter box or bird cage with the pages and maybe save some money there. Otherwise, I would recommend just setting cash totaling the purchase price on fire. At least Harris won't get it. Thumbs down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found the book very enjoyable. Harris' in depth depiction of a character as interesting as Hannibal is exhaustive and interesting. His mind palace was an excellent addition to the story, but at times Harris exploits it, feeding the reader too much information. In particular - Mischa. I thought the book as a whole was good - including the ending. I originally thought the ending warranted a better explanation in terms of reasoning (or maybe &quot;better&quot; reasoning) - but this goes against my opinion of Harris giving the reader too much. The success of Blair Witch reminds us that less could have made this story more."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you are looking for another Silence of the Lambs - this book isn't for you. I really liked it. I thought it was suspenseful and very imaginative. It definitely has a lot more horror than the proceeding installments, both in terms of gore and character development - but it also has a lot more elegance too. Mason Verger is one of the most disturbing characters I have ever read about in a mainstream book - and the ending is definitely a shocker to say the least. I can understand why some people didn't like the book - because it is a true sequel. Hannibal is not TSOTL rewritten. Yes - the characters are different but the book takes place seven years later - are you the same person you were seven years ago? Buy it now or wait for the paperback - either way - read it. Hollywood is not going to do a faithful adaptation of this book for the silverscreen - so this may be your only chance to enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For the most part the book was entertaining. I felt it dragged in the middle of the book, and picked up once the action went back to the US. The ending defiantly destroyed it for me. With an early climax and and ending that I just plan didn't like. While it may have been a protest against the movie industry did I, as a reader, have to suffer?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a masterpiece of style and mood, with the most shocking ending i have ever read. Truly brilliant."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I believe Mr. Harris spent too much time on ways to make the reader gag and not enough time on the story. The plot is mundane and the ending is so bizarre it makes no sense. I am sorry I read this book. I was a big fan of the other three novels. I guess if you write with a movie in mind the story suffers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I realize I am in the vast minority, but I thoroughly enjoyedthe ending. I haven't read either of the two previous books, but I didsee the movie version of SOTL, which prompted me to buy this book, and I was very impressed with Harris's writing style that compares favorably with Anne Rice's Vampire series. Both use vivid descriptions and elegant prose that provide a depth many are hard-pressed to achieve. Many others may not have liked this book because it clashed with pre-concieved notions of what the plotline should be, but as a newcomer to Harris's written works, I can tell you I enjoyed it immensely. If you are open-minded, and like psychologically horrifying works, then this is a first rate thriller I would recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris should have reconsidered the ending of this book. I was totally engrossed until the impossible ending. I hope that he does not continue with this story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Despite what some of the other people said, I found this book to be very entertaining and exciting. Harris does an exellent job of showing how gruesome and terrifying the bad guys are, such as Mason Verger."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal. Thomas Harris evolved Dr. Hannibal Lector from what was originally a fairly small character in Red Dragon. The Silence of the Lambs made Hannibal come to life; made us remember him. Hannibal has made us absolutely love this extremely intelligent serial killer. If you saw the movie, read the book! The book is 10 times better than the movie! I loved the movie, but left the theater unsatisfied, searching for more, so I read the book thinking that may cure my craving. I finished the book and I still want to know more about Dr. Lector. This book is one you will never want to put down. It's suspenseful, terrifying, and gory, but romantic. That's why I say it's the best love story of the year. It is more realistic than any fictional romance I have come across. The best part about Hannibal is you are on the serial killers side, which makes you feel very strange, like you are doing something wrong just by seeing through his eyes. I can't wait to read it again!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book seems to have raised many questions and complaints. I feel that way this books develops and is presented the way it ought to be. Clarice Starling seems old and tried due to constant abuse from Krendler, Hannibal is no longer mysterious, but that is the way the book is supposed to be. We finally get to see the why Hannibal does what he does, and why Clarice is so interesting to him. This book finally answers questions about Hannibal, and that I liked."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is rare that I would argue with a writer about a character in his or her book; after all, the writer did create the character. But I will in this instance. I was very disappointed in this book, for I don't feel that Harris was true to the character of Clarice. I just can't accept the ending as valid. My recommendation - see the movie instead."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Whether the main character of this genre of novels is called Dracula, Nosferatu, Charlie Manson or Hannibal Lecter the driver is similar: we seem to have a long history of lust for incredible gore and horror. Perhaps Thomas Harris understands this universal need as he has introduced an elegant yet smarmy character who is charismatic enough to survive three books. With the highly publicized film version of Hannibal about to be released the timing seems right to find out just how far the author could push our senses. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a grotesque film noir, but it had its redeeming charms - mainly in the guise of the highly intelligent and elegant persona of the mad main character. &quot;Hannibal&quot; picks up where &quot;Silence&quot; left off and for a long while this novel is a joy to read because of the beauty of Harris' description of Florence, Italy, the minute attention to detail that enhances the suspense, the bizarre turns of an unending chase, etc. But this novel seem to be saying &quot;no more sequels&quot; in the rather gauche ending. This is not the Clarice we have been following, nor can even the strangest mind condone the &quot;feast of living brains&quot; that brings this book to a tawdry conclusion. Now to see how Hollywood deals with this....... As for a book, it is only for the Hannibal-addicted."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This novel offers so much, weaving together mystery, thriller, tragey, and black comedy under the guises of such concepts as the past, the present, death, rebirth, obsession, and even apocalyptic absolution. Harris is a dense writer, meaning, each chapter is loaded with important info. It's terribly brave of Harris to take his character and situations in such an &quot;unexpected&quot; direction. This is a story about people haunted by events, each other. For me, the story tempers the waters of Marquis deSade (in Juliette &amp; 120 Days...), Miribeau(Torture Garden), even Dante (Inferno &amp; Purgatorio). While not for everyone, this exquisite novel is a must read for those interested in an artist who answers to no ones vision but his own.(A warning to those expecting Silence Of The Lambs: it pays tribute to the book/film but then goes 1000 miles in another direction. You are forewarned!)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The setting is seven years after Hannibal Lecter's famous escape, where he is living a very &quot;tasteful&quot; life in Florence, Italy. He has changed his looks and at first it seems some of his habits. Dr. Lecter has been abstaining from his cannibalistic tendencies of late. (But the reader knows it won't last.) He will be driven by evil forces to once again resume his bad habits.Clarice Starling is not doing well. She just has too much integrity for the good ole' boys club in Washington. They of course see her only as a sex object.This is a book where the forces of good and evil are somewhat confused and neither is the ultimate victor. This seems to leave many readers with a certain dissatisfaction and Thomas Harris with the ability to write a sequel.Do not read this book if you are alone on a dark and rainy night. It is not a good sedative. If you are into the warped and ghoulish this is a book for you. I enjoy Harris' style and for the most part enjoyed the book (not enough to avoid a certain sarcasm.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the excellent Silence Of the Lambs i found this a good book that should have ended 20 pages before it did. I was not happy at all with the way thomas Harris wrapped up this elegant thriller but hes a good writer and will rebound in the future i believe. Not worth reading unless your a diehard Harris fan."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What happened to Dr. Hannibal Lecter in this 7 years, better yet, what happened to Thomas Harris in this 10 years. I was expecting a great plot, with at least a few turning points, so I kept reading, never happened. Dont expect a great ending, better said, dont expect an ending. This book is not a thriller, and the suspense is DULL. Like many other people, I WASTED my time on this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like many reviewers, I found this final edition of the Hannibal trilogy somewhat disappointing. What has always made the Lecter character so fascinating has been Harris' unique presentation of an intellectual genius gone totally off the deep end. He's evil, he's nuts, but in an all so mesmerizing way. Now comes 'Hannibal', and we're asked to accept a kinder, gentler madman. But it's actually worse than that. Lecter goes through a transformation so complete that, by the last 50 pages, he becomes a sympathetic, nurturing, father figure. Oh, the horror!! Meanwhile, Starling goes through her own transformation, from clear-eyed, FBI-Semper Fi, do or die trooper to ... Madonna (both of them).Harris does throw us a bone (so to speak) by introducing Mason Verger, a former patient of Lecter's to whom the good doctor performed a face-lift with the minor error of forgetting to re-attach the face. Verger's money and power put him in a position to get revenge on Dr. L. but, truth be told, it's his ghoulish features and the conditions under which he exists that make his character interesting.But back to the Doctor. When last seen, he was riding off in the Buenos Aires sunset with the maiden Starling on his arm. Sorry, but that's not how I want to remember him. Give me the doctor that spoke about eating someone's liver with favre beans and a nice Chianti."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I started reading this book hoping that the publicity it received will match its substance. Boy, was I wrong! I just finished it today(after struggling to read it) and it is hogwash. Not enough characterization for me to relate to. The story was pulled in all directions---except where it would have been more entertaining. The only credit Mr Harris gets from me is for the beautiful descriptions of Florence. Other than that, this was a very big disappointment. Mr Harris, I want my money back."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An unimaginative and uninteresting sequel written in such a naive linear fashion that the author has insulted his readers. I am so disappointed that I am writing this with 30 pages left to be read, and am still waiting for a chill to travel up my spine. I was so looking forward to that morbid sense of the macabre that Harris so brilliantly executed in Silence of the Lambs. No such luck. Clarice is weak, Mason is too unbelievable and I think poorly researched (at least as far as his &quot;medical conditions&quot; are concerned), the pigs are RIDICULOUS, Lecter isn't hungry any longer and has lost his chilling edge, and Margot is filler. I am also extremely disappointed in the entire FBI subplot. The only thing I can hope for to get any satisfaction from this book is that the author will spare us another contrived sequel. Amazon rating of 1 star is too generous for this book. glad I got it for free!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and really liked it. By comparison, this book was very disappointing. The plot is choppy, the characters are one-dimensional, the pseudo-psychology is uncompelling, and the storyline not only departs from reality, but violates its own internal consistency as well. The denoument for characters Starling and Lecter is entirely devoid of believability. (And I won't even get *started* regarding moral compass.)The only sense I can make out of this book is as a deliberate effort by the author to destroy his own franchise. Or maybe he's just spent too much time trying to place himself in the mind of a deranged murderer?Sum: If you're purely interested in scenes of grotesque violence, cannibalistic murder, dismemberment, etc., then this novel is for you. Otherwise, it is at best a waste of time. At worst, it is a deeply reprehensible, anti-moralist story which derogates social norms and instead recommends a vision of ultraviolence as a legitimate response to institutionalized sociopathy, and moreover as a valid therapy technique for personal growth.Mr. Harris, you should be ashamed of yourself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It should have been great... The unabridged Hannibal and a long drive. Instead, we heard a mediocre story ruined by Daniel Gerroll, who was impossible to understand. Choosing to perform rather than read, we missed half of Mason Verger's tortured dialogue, got lost in all the Italian dialect and resented the accent he gave Clarice. Maybe the book is better, but I'll never know because I won't waste the time or money to read it. I promised the tapes to a friend for a transatlantic flight, but I'll do her a favor and loan her Certain Prey instead. What a disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; so when &quot;Hannibul&quot; came out I had to read it and it is worth the read. The whole book is great and very gripping, but the ending is really a kicker. I loved the ending between Clarice and Lector, it was wonderful. Just how I hoped it would end from the time I first read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. It was really better than I dreamed. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Simply put, I was disappointed with Hannibal. Harris fans waited too long, and got too little. By book's end, I thought I was reading another one of Anne Rice's gothic, semi-erotic tales. It just wasn't the Thomas Harris I admired in Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Give me Mr. Dollarhyde and Will Graham.Morose in Mississippi (havapeppa@aol.com)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Very Disappointed,Harris did not live up to his standards. I expected a scary, on edge of seat, page turner. Had to plod along just hoping it would improve. Never did, ending was very unreal, seems left it open so he could jot off another. I liked Hannibal Lector when he was not the main character, he should have stayed as a bit player, would be reluctant to purchase a Hannibal IV."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This one didn't do it. I was expecting a believable crime thriller, but was given a far-fetched fantasy. Further, Harris quoted from Silence of the Lambs way too much. I have to admit, though, the dinner scene towards the end of the book was memorable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Have read the other books, loved them, and started out thinkingI liked this one, too. Purchased it and held it, unread, for a monthso I could take it on vacation with me.Was very disappointed in the immediately obvious change in Starling's characterBut also decided it was quite funny, and Harris can sure write some image-evoking scenes, and just some really lovely descriptions when he chooses.Then I read the very brief blurb from the reader in Denver telling us all what dopes we are not to realize the intentional parody. I guess I'm slow, and would love to know what he (she?) is referring to.Anyway, guess we'll wait for the movie, and another 8 years or so for the next installment. (sigh)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yuck! After 150 pages, I was still terribly bored. If Iwanted a history lesson on FLorence I'd have been happier. But I waslooking for a thriller! The ending was profoundly hideous but told in such a way that it barely dented my psyche. I am usually horrified (I want to be horrified, that's not a bad comment) by the brutality and sickness of the evil characters in Mr Harris' books. I WILL NOT SEE THE MOVIE EITHER! I am so disappointed in this book - not what I expected from the author of Red Dragon and Silence, etc."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; had all the ingrediants to be a worthysuccesor of &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot;. The writng at timesmade you feel like you were there, including tension at key junctures that made it hard to put the book down. There did seem to be a bit too much of pyscobabble during the beginning and meat of the story, but the strength of the book overwhelmed that shortcoming. The ending was completely underwhelming. How could such a great author come up with such a ridiculous ending? I hope the movie version will change the ending. It would be a shame for such a great sequal to be-well cannibalized by psychobabble!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal picks the reader up where \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" drops them off. The novel starts out with Clarice in Wahington D.C. and Hanibal in Florence. Clarice is still on the hunt for Lecter after years of no contact or communication. She finds herself back on his case however and this time she isn't alone. A former friend/victim of Lecters', Mason Verger is also looking for Lecter in order to make him suffer as he once did. An Italian cop by the name of Ranaldo Potsi is also on the look out for Lecter for the hefty reward for his capture. As the story continues Clarice talks to both Potsi and Verger about their reasons for wanting Lecter and tries to stear them away. Their are many conflicts between Hannibal and the other three and different portions of the book that can send the readers heart accelerating. At the point somewhere in the middle of the story Potsi gets to Lecter first. Hannibal makes sure that Potsi has little to say about what kind of a man Lecter is as he silences him forever. At this point Clarice and Hannibal make contact for the first time over the cell phone of Inspector Potsi. This is when Lecter decides to come out of retierment and back to the states. When Lecter moves back to the states, Mason makes sure to find him before Clarice does in order to fulfill his ultimate revenge. While Lecter is toying with Clarice Masons henchmen capture Lecter and place him in a death pit surronded by flesh eating hogs. Clarice then tries to come to the rescue of Hannibal, but Hannibal ends up saving Clarice. Mason is then the meal for the hogs as Hannibal exists stage left. In the end of the book to what any reader will say is the most unexpected ending to this story the two fall in love together. They then go on to live a long, happy, and somewhat strange life together. The End? I hope this isn't the best Harris could do to end this trilogy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As thrilled as I was by Thomas Harris's \\"red Dragon\\", which interduces Dr.Hannibal Lecter, and by the even more thrilled with \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", I can not tell you how much better this is then the oher two!Harris has a amazing eye for detail, from the classical music to the even more beautifull detail to the bottles of wine Dr.Lecter loves, he captures it all with such perfection, its almost scary! the way in which this book is written, there can be no \\"slow parts\\". For there is always something happening. From the time Starling gets into the FBI undercover van, to the very last word!I've heard so many people tell me that this is a lame sequel to a great film, but its not! Think of it as the next part in a great story, the end not yet in sight.I love to think of this book as a Thriller/Romance/Horror, the first and last details need no other words, but I feel that, although the diffrent ages, Starling and Lecter are growing a lot closer, even if the movie is vastly diffrent. I shall not spoil the ending though!I pray for Harris to continue this wonderfull story soon, as my patice may not stand another 10 years!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved it personally. I think it is great when the ending is always something that isn't expected. I hate it that the movie people gave in and gave the people a more pleasant ending. Heaven forbid we shock the people. After reading this book, I was dissapointed in the movie. I think they made him more human like in this book. This book is not for someone who can't think outside the lines of normal behavior. I am usually a true crime reader so this book didn't shock me because some people are animals. There was one slow part in the book, but other than that, excellent piece of work. Much more details and characters that were left out by the movie. Not for the weak stomachs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A novel of excruciating brilliance; engrossing and relentless and all too plausible."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading most of the reviews on this page, I felt that a lot of the anger felt towards this book was based upon the previous success the series has earned itself. But let's forget Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. You must judge books individually, and only then will they deserve their rightfully earned praise.The key to a good book lies in the depth of the characters. In Hannibal, Thomas Harris has carefully sculptured each character to fit into the mysterious world of Hannibal. There's Starling, the cop who has lost just about everything, including her job. Crawford, who serves as Starling's guardian angel. Mason, the sicko minded millionaire who'll do just about anything to capture Hannibal. Pazzi, the Italian police officer who desperatly needs to find the Il Mostro in order to redeem his reputation. And finally, there's Dr. Hannibal Lector. The mastermind behind everything. The man who mutilates his victims in an almost artful display. The man, who the whole book revovles around. Each character is described to the core, and as you read, you actually begin to think like them. Connection between the reader and characters is just as important as a hot dog with a bun. Well done Harris.Good writers often do heaps of research before actually writing their piece of work. The knowledge and information gathered by Thomas Harris clearly shows in the text. Beautifully described art works, deliciously described meals, and ancient historical events are mentioned all throughout the book. From the elegant Givenchy, to the rusty old Mustang, Harris obviously did his load of research.Although one may argue that the ending is quite a shock, I believe Harris made it that way for a specific reason. Maybe the monster that has been roaming through the series isn't really a monster after all. Maybe it shows that when you've educated yourself to the brink, your on a whole different planet compared to normal people. Maybe he wanted us to believe that even mosters can be tamed. Whatever Harris intended, we may never know. But what we do know, is that he has once again written a masterpiece that will stay in our minds for quite some time. This is definatly worth buying, so elude yourself into the world of Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book &quot;Hannibal&quot; by the great author Thomas Harris is a suberb work of art. This #1 New York Times bestselling book was entertaining from start to finish. Not a moment was wasted. Being slightly better than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, Thomas Harris has certainly outdone himself. It took me about four weeks to read, and it was very hard to put it down. Even though it took ten years to get this wonderful book, it was really worth the wait. The great characters Clarice Starling, Jack Crawford, and new characters like Mason Verger, ... Pazzi, and of course, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal are back again, and better than ever. I cannot be more honest, this was one of the best books ever, and I have read a lot of books. If the book was over five-hundred dollars, I would buy it. It's that good! I would really like you to buy this book and enjoy it like I did. Thank you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal Lecter is a fascinating character but he surrounds him with very bad writing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris have done another great masterpiece . This book is even better than the novel, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was really dissapointed with this book. I read Silence of the lambs and expected the book Hannibal to be just as good or better. This book was so boring, it took me 2 months to finish it. The only creepy part in the book was with the detective. Hopefully if he ever writes another book about Hannibal it will be more interesting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You can decipher the psychology of Dr. Lecter if you read this book. First of all, is quite absorbing: I read it in less than a week. Second, it's deeper than the movie. Quite deeper.It has it's ups and downs, but it's a great book overall.If you like it... goodie, goodie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Warning: Some spoilers here.....I don't read many books. No time. Can never seem to get interested etc. etc. Nor do I get excited about paying for a hard cover book. But, I did buy this one and read the whole thing. Glad I did. I was thoroughly entertained. Loved the Florence section. Made me go to the Italian tour books on my shelf and pull out a map to help visualize all of the beautiful detail. I couldn't wait to see what happened after Carlo fed the pigs the first time. The instant that Hannibal and Clarice finally meet face to face with Lecter's line &quot;Good evening Clarice&quot;, I could just hear the roars in the movie theater. I did find the last few chapters a little confusing. I thought that Lecter was keeping Starling continually drugged and the whole dining scene with Krendler. Guess I'll have to go back over that part...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not as taut as SOTL, this is more of an exploration of the mind of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and his unique relationship with FBI Agent Clarice Starling as the &quot;good&quot; Doctor tries to evade those who would capture him.Hannibal is a more indulgent novel than SOTL, taking alot of time to explore the multi- dimensional aspects of Dr. Lecter's exceptional persona and his many equisite tastes(!)It is interesting to get some back-story on the making of Dr. Lecter and also to explore further the nature of the attraction between him and Starling, the two characters that made SOTL so memorable.I think Dr Lecter is one of the most astounding character creations of modern fiction, with all the wealth of his intellect and knowledge combined with the contradictions of his total lack of a &quot;normal&quot; morality. By the end of the book you almost start to see the world from his perverted but brilliant perspective. Maybe this brilliant portrait was one of the reasons that Starling did not come across as strongly as in SOTL.I personally didn't like the somewhat surreal ending although some of the climactic action sequences are breath-taking.Harris is very brave to structure the novel so that one of the heroes is a serial killer(however intelligent and refined he may be!) Here is where I found myself confused, because I found myself cheering for Lecter, but not wanting to! Harris achieves this by making Lecters'foes not only murderous but also petty and physically repugnent unlike the sleek and sophisticated Doctor! But Harris is a unique writer and his research is so detailed it always draws you into the world he creates. I can't wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought 'Hannibal' was a great extension of the previous Lecter novels. However, readers expecting a dramatic sequel to the film will probably be disappointed. Lecter's infamy was fuelled by the cinema and 'Hannibal' mainly serves to flesh out this intriguing character. Hannibal Lecter is a contemporary arch-villain and for many readers the extra context and his swing to anti-hero status will be worth the read. The scenes in Florence and the character of Pazzi were the dramatic highlights of the book - particularly the attempts to steal a fingerprint from the fiend and Pazzi's grizly demise.The problem is that the Pazzi subplot overshadows the anticipated main event: the reunion of Clarice Starling and Lecter. Harris' attempt to justify the motivations of the pair is the undoing of the novel. In 'Silence of the Lambs' the maxim of 'more is less' holds true. Lecter's lack of context adds to his credibilty but in the latest book the explanations, although oblique, serve to increase our disbelief; a bit like turning on the lights in a fairground Ghost Train.The story is littered with physical and moral monsters. The ambiguity of hero and villain prompts a truly unexpected climax but it takes some believing. Although in line with Harris' themes of relative good and evil the ending is hard to accept at an intuitive level.All that said, I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Okay, I admit it: I love Thomas Harris' work. Black Sunday, Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs, each has been better than the last. But Hannibal is a different novel altogether. It is better written, certainly. It has a deeper narrative, a much more character driven plot. It is a wonderful book.I have read many of the pervious reviews for this novel and get the impression that many people are basing their opinions on the movie and not the previous novel. Fact: Harris DID NOT view the acclaimed (and magnificent) film of his last novel because he did not wish to be unduly influenced by the movie in his next effort.This book is not so much a suspense novel as it is a dark probing of the psychological make-up of characters that have become mainstay's of American popular culture. There is also a subtle, bitter attack on the many lunatics that have made Hannibal Lecter some sort of patron saint and hero. Much of this book's subtext deals with the commercialization of psychopathic killers who have turned into figments of popular entertainment. Here within there is talk of how artifacts from these awful, evil indiviudals have become revered collecter's items. Think about this as you bitch and moan about how your precious images have somehow gone astray.Chapter 21 of Hannibel, pages 132-138, is one of the most beautifully written chapters in all of literature. Harris has pulled away from the story, involved us directly in the psychology of people we could never understand. The story falls away as the reader is taken on a ride inside the mind of a genius who also happens to be a madman. It is a wonderful example of atmospheric psychology, the surrounding and the mental make-up of a character even Harris must admit has become something more than he ever intended. It is almost satirical yet within the structure of the story he is presenting. There is almost nothing more fascinating than entering the mind of someone whom we can never understand. This brief fragment of the novel succeeds almost beyond comparison (check out most anything by James Ellroy for further examples.)Yes, the final section of the book gets a bit silly. Yes, it is a bit of a cartoonish ending for such a sustained and horrifying narrative. But by this point I was well past caring as Harris had given me much more than everything I had anticipated. Do not take these misunderstood attacks on this beautifully written literary effort to heart. Quite simply, they are wrong. They don't know what they are experiencing. They have never read anything that is truly about the characters. All they want is action. They are wrong. You are right for buying it and seeing for yourself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"From the gothic police procedural of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; Thomas Harris progresses to a haunted epicurianism in &quot;Hannibal.&quot; The sequel affirms the not-quite-end of the story but suggests that its dual protagonists - the supreme fiend Hannibal Lector and his hunter-protege Clarice Starling - can achieve a very certain closure. Harris blends the formulaic pleasure of his genre -- Clarice has a creepy early meeting with a uniquely asylumned Lecteresque figure, Mason Verger, much as she first met with the bad Doctor in &quot;Lambs&quot; -- with a heightened pulp-lit flourish that evokes Anne Rice at the peak of her vampire chronicling. Indeed, the intervening years since Harris penned &quot;Lambs&quot; and savored its mega-success via wealthy pursuits have deepened his alter-egoing with Lecter. Much of this book digs luxuriantly in the Italian Baedeker, referencing Florentine and Tuscan church architecture, Dante, and going to impressive extremes of oenophilism and connoisseurship in depicting Lecter's superiority in all matters of the senses. That said, one can only wonder at the plot pivots, which go awfully heavy on Verger's swinish revenge obsession. Give Harris credit for researching the feeding habits of wild boar as intensely as he does the frescoes of Florence. And an oddly tender lesbian subplot seasons the stew. At the same time, there's stock villainy in FBI deputy director Paul Krendler, who undermines Starling so viciously that his commeuppance becomes a matter of high reader anticipation (you won't be dissappointment in that Grand Guignol payoff, either). But Lecter's humanization -- via the motivating memory of a beloved sister lost in the war -- takes him down a peg in the annals of ineffable evil, even as it adds depth of character. Ultimatly,&quot;Hannibal&quot; seems wilfully eccentric, and veers into authorial decadence in a way that &quot;Lambs&quot; avoided, tightly rooted as it was in nuts-and-bolts criminology and the power of hard work and brave hearts to battle the deepest darkness. And it is hard to imagine how Hollywood will handle all this -- not that it's too shocking for film, but that Tuscan languor,swine frenzy and an Anne Ricey ending may not play too well. Still, who can denigrate Harris' erudition, the strange inevitability of his denouement, the bouquet and broadening of his reference frames, and his obsessive determination to weave the most arcane details into a tapestry that has no real equal in modern fiction?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, where do we start. You have probably read all the other reviews, some giving maximum stars and others not so kind.If it is one review you read, read mine.The book is sumptuous in feel and beckons the reader. It smells gourgous, it deserves a read you hear your mind say.Thomas Harris, if you are reading this apologies for any offence this review might cause, and this review has been written for you to read.Stop trying to pull the wool over our eyes (quaint English expression). This books reeks of movie script. Gone are the bleak and black storylines, the virginity of of literature. What you wrote was a crass attempt of a sequel to a mainstream movie picture.Oh Hannibal, you are so brave to be bringing your own packed lunch on an aeroplane, and then being upstaged by a little boy. Ha Ha, very funny, pass me the bucket someone.And the ending, oh dear, what were you thinking of. At risk of giving the storyline away, don't you think it was a bit riduculous. I mean, okay, I just about got over the bit in silence of the Lambs, the part where there are only two cops looking after Hannibal when he was caged up in that big hall and there were around two thousand other cops in the basement. What was the problem in putting a few more guys in the same room to look after the cops when they were serving Hannibal with dinner before he managed that stupid getaway, just about shows the competence of American police.You have made your millions and will go down the same road as that other poncy horror writer, Stephen King. Every book is a successful rip off purely designed for a 'Straight ti video' movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read 'Silence..' but not 'Red Dragon'. I am chiefly familiar with this Hannibal character from Anthony Hopkins awesome portrayal in the second film. It is impossible to imagine another actor taking on this role, Hopkins must do it for the much-rumored 'Hannibal' sequel. This book reminded me in parts of the old Hammer horror films with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. It is awesome and kept me up late into the wee hours of the morning. People: this is horror fantasy, OK?! Just sit back and enjoy a great scare with good, fleshed out characters and a classic anti-hero for the millenium. True, I understand it goes away from the &quot;form&quot; of the other novels in the trilogy but hey, this author writes awesome and I like that it's unpredictable. Go buy this book, a &quot;classic&quot; summer read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had very high expections for this book, and I must say that Harris did not disappoint. Bulging with gruesome baddies throughout, this is certainly his most disturbingly macabre work to date.Lecter is the sinister master of seduction. We are drawn to his intellect, aestheticism, and charm despite the horror we know awaits us. Indeed, the horror itself is part of the irresistable allure. I found myself cheering his every move; other than Starling, he's the most moral character in the book! If he is not killing in defense of himself, then the victim is so repugnant and despicable that we can't help but derive a certain satisfaction from their deserved demise. Lecter makes each killing dark poetry in motion; he has raised murder to a gruesome level of artistry that we admire in spite of ourselves.Pazzi's death after the slideshow and presentation to the Italian art scholars was astonishing. After Lecter's lecture referring to Dante's Inferno and the history of artistic depiction of hanging of the treacherous and greedy, we could certainly see where the plot was going to go, but we are still shocked and left out of breath with the techniqe, style, and grace with which he carries out his plan.As for the ending, all I can say is these characters have always belonged to Harris and as his property he has every right to take them where he wants them to go. You may not like it, but in the context of the ongoing story I found it unexpected yet deliciously satisfying.Dr. Lecter would do Nietzche proud. That he is transformed to a hero and savior is thrilling in the truest sense of the word."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"HANNIBAL ist das Best! Was ist besser als einen menschenfrenchner? ein FBI madchen? und alle das? Besser als RED DRAGON! Besser als THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS! Diese ist Thomas Harris's best! Ein GUTTTTTTTTTTTTT buch!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It takes a particularly twisted mind to think up the kind of deeds that abound in Hannibal. But aside from Thomas Harris' own dark mind palace, what meat is inside this tasty little thriller? The eating of human organs is much more predominant here than in either of Lecter's other appearances. The story is certainly more icky, but icky in the most bizarre ways. To be honest, I consider Silence Of The Lambs to be the better book. I think the main power of it was the &quot;close distance&quot; between Lecter and Starling, something along the lines of the relationship between Mulder and Scully, or Pinky and the Brain ;) But that disappears in Hannibal and although it's replaced by a similarly startling scenario I have had SOTL in my head for the last 4 years or so and change doesn't come easy to me. The continuous references to SOTL in this book stand out and kinda got on my nerves after a while, they seemed to me like gratuitous plugs for Harris' earlier book. On the other hand, I guess the two books are very much tied together. I find it quite strange that Lecter's personal obsession wasn't mentioned in earlier books. I realised it was probably invented only for this book, but IIRC (and I probably don't) Mason already knew the details of Lecter's youth. Why didn't he do something with that knowledge long ago? Oh well, he's completely loony too, I guess. :) Definitely the most commentable part of this book is the ending. I think Harris must have been on something when he wrote it. But, now I think about it, his dazed and confusing style was perfectly suitable for the events and the situation... I won't give anything away (you've probably heard the rumours anyway) but Clarice takes a very bizarre path... If SOTL was a favourite book of yours, Hannibal might taint the memory of it a little. But if you liked SOTL that much, I guess you won't be able to stop yourself reading this one. If you haven't read either of them, start with Red Dragon and read them in order. :)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book started out so great and then copped out. I thought the disintegration of Starling was so disappointing. She is one of the few strong female characters in fiction and she was defeated. I felt like I was reading a script. Obviously this was written so that it could be made into yet another movie. It was predictable and boring. It was difficult to make myself finish. It had such potential in the first half, that I got through it in hopes that the ending would be pleasing. No such luck. I will read the others over again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hey Thomas--stop trying to impress us with your arrested-adolescent gross-outs and the dull, half-baked psychoanalysis of your protaganists.If you think knowing what pate de foie gras is makes you a fascinating sophisticate, and that pointless amorality is 'deep', you'll be duly impressed by Hannibal.This book utterly fails both as thriller and as murder-mystery. The development of Hannibal and Starling is particularly lame. When characters in genre fiction stop being even remotely believable, there's no point in continuing.Harris phoned this one in--straight to the producers. Look for a film version ASAP, because Hollywood dictated this sorry story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a monstrous and disturbing book. Monstrous poorly written and disturbingly shoddy workmanship. I was quite horrified. Briefly, I entertained the possibility that my reaction was one intended by the author. After all, he succeeded in scaring me. Alas, I've weighed the evidence and am forced to conclude that he scared me entirely by accident.All my feelings of horror arose from the cheap ploys, the naked lunges to twang the reader's heartstrings, the rampant inconsistencies and, most telling, the author's unchecked self indulgence. So much is wrong with it that I used up all my energy on preliminaries and found myself spent long before I ever arrived at the ending. I would have been even more horrified had I spent money on this thing, thus inadvertently encouraging further work along the same lines.I can accept that Harris is laughing all the way to the bank. I bear in mind that nothing can rationalize and excuse such rotten work like heaps of money. He has had a great deal of credibility stored up with his wide readership. Now, he's traded it all for a large cash infusion - probably superfluous after his past success. It seems like the story behind the book is as banal as the story in the book. It's just boring that it would all boil down to appetite and greed in both tales.One thing makes me laugh. I can't believe what bad taste Hannibal has! I can't believe what bad taste Harris has! Too funny. It's almost as if he planned... no. Couldn't be."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Where SOTL was a suspenseful thriller, Hannibal is an over-obvious action/slasher book. So it seems as if was written for the big screen and panders to the &quot;more is more&quot; attitude towards violence in Hollywood. All the subtle &quot;scariness&quot; Lecter possessed in SOTL is replaced with over-the-top murders and gory action sequences that will have you thinking Bruce Willis will be better suited for the main role as opposed to a subdued Hopkins. True fear comes from knowing the situation is based in reality. Hannibal is so outlandish, it loses it's edge from the get-go. Harris took the low-road and replaced stellar storytelling with blood and gore. His thoughts must have been, &quot;Lecter can only be so evil, so we need more evil people&quot;. Yes, everyone says they end up cheering for Lecter, but it is only because Harris makes it so. In Hannibal, Lecter only eats bad people and Harris would have you believe Lecter is really an omnipotent superhero. The ending is a joke. It just comes out of left field with no basis. Obviously, Harris didn't want to kill off his meal ticket, but in writing Hannibal, I think he accomplished the same."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've read some bad over-hyped novels in my time, but this one really takes the cake.Harris' first 2 novels in the series, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, demonstrated a singular brilliance that upstaged the rest of the genre. I anticipated a great series evolving from the Lector storyline. Unfortunately, the publication of Hannibal invalidated that prediction and placed it within same strata of accuracy reserved for the National Enquirer psychics.Was Harris on serious medication when he wrote the ending? Hey, I ingested a lot of drugs in my misspent youth, but I could never conceive of something that twisted during my most altered states of consciousness. OK, for sheer gore factor alone, this book will appeal to the more sophomoric mindset. But if you demand plot, intriguing characters, and an ending that doesn't blow chunks, avoid this book. Should you see Hannibal on display at your local bookstore, give it a wide berth. Avoid associating with anyone who liked this novel. Cancel your subscriptions to any periodicals that gave this waste if ink and paper favorable reviews. Write letters to Harris and the publisher criticizing the book's release. Ask Congress to draft a resolution condeming Hannibal as the biggest piece of excrement to hit the book market since the latest Bret Easton Ellis novel. Convince the United Nations to do the same.And if Tom Harris publishes a sequel to Hannibal, be afraid. Be very afraid."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not only is it a terrible book in its own right, but it also manages to tear down everything that the author built in the first novel. It reminded me of seeing a really bad sequel, like Mission Impossible or Highlander 2. When authors like Mr. Harris write novels, they are building a mythology in their readers' minds. The reader natually expects characters to behave a certain way and for certain things to happen to them. Examples: Luke Skywalker would never turn to the dark side, Mad Max will always end up as roadkill at the end his movies, and Dirty Harry would never take a bribe. When the writers go against these basic rules that have been established (in this case by Mr. Harris himself), the reader ends up feeling betrayed. Thats exactly the feeling I got from reading Hannibal. Not to mention the fact that the novel was totally irresponsible, from a moral point of view. Mr. Harris seems to be telling us that wanton acts of psychotic cruelty are ok as long as the perpetrater is &quot;cool&quot; and compelling. Where's the accountability? In &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; I accepted the fact that Lecter got away because I naturally I expected a sequel. Sorry, if Mr. Harris writes another continuation, I'll skip that one. It took Mr. Harris 7 or 8 years to write Hannibal. I wonder how long it would have taken him to write a good book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Basic rule: Write for your audience. I have been reading reviews and it gets to me when people who loved this book say those who didn't lack the intelligence to understand it. I get it. I hate it. That simple. Now............. I don't know who Harris wrote this for but it was not for his readers or the fans or actors of SOTL who thrust him into literary stardom. It was strictly OK for the first few hundred pages then went completely to hell. The ending is ludicrous. I mean, were the characters of SOTL just a little inside joke for Harris and his crew at the publishing house? Like, &quot;Oh, we'll have millions buy into these characters and then in the next book which will sell even more copies we will screw them over! Yeah.&quot; please...I could go on forever but then I would ruin it for any of you who have the time to waste who plan on reading this. I recommend counting the cracks in the sidewalk outside your house. That would prove more productive."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What on earth was THIS all about? I was expecting -- eagerly expecting -- a sequel to the masterful &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, with Clarice Starling, a talented young woman of determination and principle, and Dr. Lector, her brilliant, esoteric, monstrously self-disciplined mentor. But the principal characters in this book resemble their former incarnations in little besides their names. This Starling, while surpassing the former in physical courage, is a moral and spiritual coward; Lector has evolved into an ostentatious moon-calf. Moreover, the atmosphere, so chilling in the original novel, is this time merely sordid -- if not downright sickening. I think Harris should give serious thought to writing &quot;Hannibal II, Another Option&quot;, this time at least keeping his characters in character."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"that this book was so bad. Mr. Harris apparently wanted to thank Dr. Lecter for making him a millionaire by giving him another forum. The ending was laughable. Stick with &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, which is one of the best of the genre."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I listened to the unabridged book-on-tape (Daniel Gerroll), and found it to be a nearly perfect narrative until the last couple of chapters. I could accept the surreal logic of Lecter and Starling's encounter following the action with Verger, and these were some of the most wickedly imaginative scenes. But I must agree with many other reviewers: the &quot;epilogue&quot; is an impossible proposition, and betrays the characters Harris created.Nonetheless, that was only 2 out of 100+ delicious chapters, and until then it was an exciting ride. Harris has a demented imagination and a gift for sensory and aesthetic detail. I enjoyed the descriptions of Lecter's exquisitely refined tastes, and also appreciated the free education in Renaissance culture during the Florence section. I didn't even mind the shifts from 3rd to 2nd person narrative, or past to present tense. These same devices bugged the hell out of me in Red Dragon, but somehow seemed more artful when delivered by a skilled actor. I'll anticipate the movie, but hope they can negotiate a better ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thanks to the popularity garnered by the Silence of the Lambs film, Hannibal became the literary equivalent of The Phantom Menace: an eagerly-anticipated sequel, a long time in coming, that has to not only satisfy as a novel in its own right, but also live up to ten years of nostalgia and anticipation.What Harris delivers is an exciting, suspenseful novel that is as bizarre and baroque compared to Silence of the Lambs as Silence was to Red Dragon. It starts off a little slow compared to the previous two books, but that's because, unlike the other two, it doesn't begin with a hunt for a serial killer in progress. That's one of it's strengths, that it doesn't duplicate past successes, but that's what will disappoint readers looking for more of the same.By the time you reach the climax, the book becomes un-put-downable. The finale is unpredictable and unsettling, but probably the only satisfying ending the story could possibly have had.To paraphrase James Ellroy, this book is hours of fun for the whole family, if your family name is Manson."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Too bad"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Poor old Thomas Harris ... he had backed himself into a corner with the Silence of the Lambs.Red Dragon was the best piece of popular fiction I think I ever read. Silence was an outstanding book. But setting Hannibal Lecter free sounded the death knell for the formula which made both of those books so successful.And no bad thing either. Just like Hitchcock with Psycho, Harris opened the floodgates for thousands of inferior copies. How many times do you read about a character which 'makes Hannibal Lecter look like Old Mother Hubbard'?Those police procedurals with a flawed hero facing an omnipotent character, the embodiment of evil, should be put to bed now. Thomas Harris, who never really wrote to that forumula anyway, has done his best to aid this noble cause and has brought us an entirely logical end to the Lecter story.By bringing Lecter out into the open, Harris immediately lost the fear of the unknown which added an extra pinch of spice to the central plot in the first two books. And to his credit he did not try to regain that element - instead he gave us an entirely logical story.It's a simple story, it has to be, there are no really diverting sub plots avilable. Instead it concentrates on the search for the man by a number of protagonists. I am not going to delve into the plot further - that is for the reader to do.I will merely say the ending took my breath away. It was so RIGHT. And to all the hypocrites who beat their pained breast at the 'depravity' of this story - Red Dragon brought us depravity and made it sexy; Silence took that sexiness to a new level; there are no redeeming qualities to either of these books, other than the fact that they are works of fiction, designed purely to horrify. To praise those two and condemn this hints at an inability to separate the relevant issues from society's current general attitude to violence.My only quibble? The typos!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Disappointing, beyond belief! I've liked all three of Harris' earlier books, including both with Lechter, and found them thoughtful, thrilling, and gritty. Better than &quot;genre fare.&quot; But great thrillers need great villians, and the Lechter victim seeking revenge here is lamely underwritten, and foolishly cartoonish -- a hideous, disfigured, crippled meat packing czar who agents are secretly breeding the Terror Pigs of Europe as his instrument of vengeance. This is like something out of Danger Mouse or Inspector Gadget; James Belushi, not James Ellroy. Pathetic. The ending (interesting in principle) is so poorly developed and prepared that it turns preposterous, unconvincing, and arbitrary. Stephen King's review in the New York Times is inexplicable, except as a mutual back-scratching blurb bouquet."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The quote above is taken from a book on Satan by Paul Carus. With &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Thomas Harris has proved that, like John Milton, he is of the devil's party. And having read the reviews of &quot;Hannibal&quot; in NY Times (not the one by Stephen King), and on Amazon, and Barnes and Noble, I can only think of the reviews that the film &quot;The Godfather&quot; received in 1972. Vogue wrote that the film was &quot;overblown, pretentious, slow and ultimately tedious&quot; and NY Post wrote &quot;The Godfather will be as quickly forgotten as it deserves to be&quot;. Look up the various lists for the &quot;greatest films ever made&quot; and you will find &quot;The Godfather&quot; among the top five. The point I'm trying to make here is that &quot;Hannibal&quot; has been misunderstood (yes, it has) and I am positive that it will be regarded as a classic in the future. I am a &quot;avid fan&quot; of Harris's novels and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; was probably my all-time favorite horror-novel until now. But before judging my taste in literature, take a look at how Harris has developed as an author. &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is written as a hard and fast-paced thriller, the style of the novel is not unlike the style of early Elmore Leonard. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is a more poetic novel, beautifully written and well-balanced. Only Stephen King writes horror as well as Harris. But with &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Harris has surpassed every writer of horror I can think of, past and present. The third novel on Hannibal Lecter is not only horrific, ambitious and poetic but it is philosophical as well - even more well-thought than the novels by Peter Hoeg. I know that I may be out of line here, but I believe Thomas Harris has written the greatest American horror-novel since Herman Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. Only Melville has treated subjects of horror with the same sense of poetry and philosophy as Harris. (JD Salinger used to claim that Melville was the last great American writer - I do not claim Harris is, but he sure comes close).&quot;Hannibal&quot; is truly original and I really look forward to reading it again, because something new will be discovered at every re-reading. By the way did I mention that it is one of the most romantic novels I have read?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Pure trash, seriously, listen to the other reviews, don't even bother....those bad reviews posted above and below this one will prove to be more interesting and intriguing than the actual novel which is a disgrace to the publisher, the reader, and ultimately the writer himself....."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A tedious, plodding, dissapointing read"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I love the anticipation of the arrival of my favorite novelists' new books. But, Harris's new novel disturbed me on several levels. Harris writes well, even if his ever-changing point of view is sometimes confusing, yet this type of confusion can be overcome. It is his character development which changes the remarkable, even admirable character of Clarice to amoral, and the monstrous character of Hannibal to understandable, even acceptable, which changes this from an interesting read to a disturbing read. If a novelist is going to write only for himself, there is no obligation to anyone but himself, but if he is writing for an audience who trusts him, then a novelist has some obligation not to take already well-developed characters and change them to such an extent they are then unrecognizable. It is even more abhorrent to become so in love with your characters that you try to excuse unexcusable behavior. Hannibal is a monster, even if he is a human monster. It is fine to expose his human side, but to use the human side to excuse the monster is unacceptable. I left this book hating it not so much for the horrid characterizations, but more for the attempt to take monstrous actions and ideas and humanize them. Violence, much less cannibalism is ugly, not beautiful. If Hannibal is a monster, do not try to make him anything else. And as terrible as life is to people sometimes, the terrible events can not be used to excuse the kind of violence of which Hannibal shows himself capable. This novel's characterizations attempt to prove otherwise and because of this, the novel fails."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reserving my copy in advance, devouring it the minute that it arrived, what can I say? Rarely have I ever been so disappointed. I agree with the other 1-star reviews and just want to add two points:1.The front page review in the Sunday NY Times by Steven King really threw me for a loop. I love suspense, mystery, horror and read them by the dozens. This one was just not engaging, not to mention far below Harris' other work. Even the worst King was far superior to Hannibal.2. As a professional writer and editor with over 20 years in the field, the errors in the book appalled me. In addition to the points mentioned by other reviewers here, I found that there were sentences that I had to read twice or three times to try to grasp their meaning. Sad, sad sad."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was the most disappointing book I have ever read. If the notoriously media-shy Thomas Harris was trying to slip into obscurity, this book will take him well on his way. The plot is stupid and slow. Even the peripheral characters behave in ways completely contrary to the characteristics established in the earlier books (Jack Crawford would not just roll over and die in bed!! Barney and his MASSIVE erection--is that because he's Black???), and the main characters are totally untrue to the selves Harris created for them in _Red Dragon_ and _Silence of the Lambs_. If Clarice Starling simply had a burning desire to f##k her daddy, she would have chosen Jack Crawford--not Hannibal Lecter. There are even errors of &quot;facts&quot; established in the earlier books: Frederica Bimmel was NEVER on a slab in a morturay in West Virginia, that was Kimberly Emberg. And what is this with the giant, man-eating PIGS!! After creating two of the most memorable (and sympathetic) villians of modern fiction in Francis Dolarhyde and Jame Gumb, Harris now gives us giant, man-eating pigs? What happened to the nuanced debate over Evil (with a capital E) and individuals driven to destructive acts? &quot;Don't try to reduce me to a set of influences,&quot; Dr. Lecter instructs Clarice in _Silence of the Lambs_, yet that is exactly what Harris does here. And the ending! It's ludicrous.My paranoid theory is that this book was not really written by Harris; it was slapped together by some hack to fulfill the publishing contract, and Harris's real work (maybe with completely new characters not suitable for a sequel) will be published under another name. I actually hope that's true because I might actually enjoy reading it. My advice: don't bother."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...but just barely. I borrowed a friend's copy and STILL felt ripped off at the end! If this thing ever makes it to film, count me out of its audience; what a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was one of the greatest books ever written. I read &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; and loved it. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is even better. Thomas Harris is an amazing writer period, all said and done. I can not wait until the &quot;Hannibal&quot; movie is released. I loved &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; and I thought that Sir Anthony Hopkins was amazing. I look for &quot;Hannibal&quot; to be just that, and hopefully more. Look for another Oscar win for Mr. Hopkins. I give this book 5 stars and 2 thumbs way up. It was a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dear Potential Reader,Please do not buy this book if you are interested in watching the Hannibal trilogy resolve in a plausible or satisfying way. After flying through an absorbing 100 chapters, the final 3 left me thinking that someone had played a joke on America and sabotaged the book at the printer. May I suggest borrowing this book from the library instead of buying it? There are definitely a lot of very terrific things about the book, but they all occur in the first 95% of the novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at how unpredictable the story was andthoroughly enjoyed it. Maybe some of you expect Mr. Harris to be thetype of author who gives you what you want like all the other best selling authors. Well, bravo Mr.Harris then!. Haunting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It has been years since a book has really surprised me with its end. I absolutly loved it and reccommend it to Harris and King fans alike. Hannibal is seductive and you hate yourself for loving him in his absolute evil! The one thing I can't see is Jodie Foster doing what Starling does in this excellent book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; Thomas Harris has Dr. Hannibal Lecter tell Clarice, &quot;The world is a more interesting place with you in it.&quot;Mr. Harris would do well to heed his character's advice. In &quot;Hannibal,&quot; he removes Clarice from his fictional world in the worst way imaginable - not by allowing her a hero's death, but rather by subverting her until she becomes as depraved as her nemesis.Mr. Harris's world is filled with monsters. That is to be expected by anyone who has read his previous novels or seen the movies that were made from them. But in &quot;Hannibal,&quot; unlike the other two novels, there is no heroism, no integrity, no justice. There is simply evil - everywhere, in everyone. And that, more than any monsters Mr. Harris can dream up, makes &quot;Hannibal&quot; a dull and disappointing read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't you see?Thomas Harris is talking to you throughout the novel. He wants the ending to be controversial, unsettling and unsatisfactory.History plays tricks. How many of you thought that Lecter's escape at the end of Silence was a little too pat? And the &quot;having an old friend over for dinner&quot; line a little too perfect? He compensates. This book is none of those things.Confusing, sordid, perverse, challenging, pulpish, alienating, wacked-out Grand Guignol."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't believe Harris kept his public waiting eleven years for *this*. The plot was inane, and instead of being gripping I found myself plodding through major portions of it. Lecter and Clarice were caricatures of their fascinating old selves. I'm really sorry I paid for this book and would urge anyone thinking about buying it not to -- if you feel compelled to read it, borrow it from your local library. (I'm sure they'll have *lots* of donated copies!)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For those of you who liked the other Hannibal books,you will greatfully enjoy this book. It does happen to appeal to the people who wanted to know more about Lecter. For those who feel Lecter should be left as almost a God like figure might be disappointed with this book. I feel that many people don't enjoy this book because of the truths told about Dr. Lecter because they would rather have him be an unexplainable person. The book was very good and I was always reading more and more because like the other Lecter books once you get started you get wrapped in the great web spun by Harris. All in all I recommend this book to every reader and even if you don't feel you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unlike its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a horror story straight through. Its intention appears to make the reader recoil in dread rather than to follow the psychological spins and games of Lecter. None of the major characters in the book appear to have a reasonable motivation for their perversities -- rather they seem to be perverse for the sake of perversity and are therefore mostly contemptible. The antihero Lecter also appears to have lost the gamemaster-like quality in Silence, transforming into some Phantomesque alien being capable of superhuman feats without qualification. Some of the descriptions of his actions bear notice, since they are given a precision and refinement simply through the execution of language; however, this in itself is not sufficient to solidify Hannibal. Neither are the lame attempts to create a psychological background from which a monster like Lecter could spring. Simply too much to be believed -- better off left to the imagination..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is laughing all the way to the bank.It seems to me that the whole point of this book was to systematically destroy every preconceived notion we might have had after reading the 2 previous Lecter outings, Red Dragon and SotL. Not a bad thing; I like surprises. But this book was inexcusable. By means of this over-long piece of drivel, he has expressed his contempt for us, the reading public. Here we were hoping for another thrill ride of extreme psychological terror, and here we received a story that was, frankly, boring, condescending, inconsistent, and filled with lifeless characters. Yes, the ending was quite stupid.But I guess this is what happens when an author suddenly becomes so famous that one of the provisions in his contract states that there will be no outside editing of the story at all (as is the case here). The author gets a little too full of himself and thinks he can churn out any old garbage and the faithful readers will suck it up. Well, I for one will never again purchase another book with the byline &quot;Thomas Harris&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was shocked to find a really horrible book by Thomas Harris. I was a big fan of all of his other books. This one, however, was BAD, BAD, BAD. The plot was not interesting, the characters wholly unlikeable, and the ending ridiculous. I can't believe that I wasted my time! Don't waste yours."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"To say that this book is the most captivating of all books I have ever read is just a slight understatement in all aspects of the word. With every ploy created by the emotionally closed and almost totally unmoved mind of Dr Hannibal Lector, gave my mind a week of utter intensivness which a novel has not sparked in a long while.The uraveling and insight into Lector's tumultuous childhood revealed not only motive behind his being but also enabled us to empathise and accept his horrific mutilations, Hannibal seemed this time not to mutilate the good and the innocent but only those who possesed an air of self absorbism, and evil intentions. Out to help see the demise of Dr Lector, the victims chose to do so not on grounds of human protection or the welfare of others but for thier own interest to see the fattening of thier own bank accounts. accounts. Poor Mason, being disfigured like he was, could not be described less than horrific, but the torture he made children endure was by far a worser crime! Good on you Dr Lector!All the same I am thanlkful that the character of Hannibal Lector is not living down at the end of my street!Thankyou Thomas Harris for yet another suberb, account of a criminal mind at its greatest."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, I didn't think I could wait for this to get here. I have read the other two books in the series and thoroughly enjoyed them, so in a way Hannibal is a bit of a disappointment. I kept picturing Jodie Foster continuing in her role from Silence of the Lambs and it just doesn't fit. Read the book, but don't look for a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A worthy companion to Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a haunting, visceral, unshakable vision of pure evil. You could fault it at times for being sadistic, but is still an incredible rollercoaster ride."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book took me from exteme highs and lows! It was fantastic! The turn around in Clarice Starling was completely unexptected, but I could totally relate. Having been through almost and identical career situation as her. The ending was completely unexpected, and beautifully written. I can't wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A fitting sequel to &quot;Silence.&quot; I enjoyed Harris' newest creation of horror. Very few novels are as ineptly described and thought out as Hannibal.After reading several review, I find that not all reviewers do not like the ending. I thought that the ending was the perfect ending to a perfect book. I think that most reviewers were hoping for a storybook ending, but obviously this was not. I think that this was the most realistic ending for the book. Clarice was rejected from every world she entered, except for Dr. Lecter's. She found comfort in Dr. Lecter and she brings out the good man in Dr. Lecter. I think that Clarice saved Dr. Lecter and he did likewise.Also, I thought that most reviewers seemed to be relating the book to the MOVIE &quot;Silence.&quot; One must remember that Mr. Harris did not and will not see the movie, and some people are subconsiously relating the book to the movie. To understand the book better, we all should put the movie out of our minds and treat Hannibal as it is, a sequel to the BOOK!! Both books were two of the best books I ever read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was a let down after the excellent work of Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. It seems Harris was going through the motions and writing a movie screenplay rather than a novel. Although the details of the story are compelling, Hannibal lacks the wonderful prose, the deep psychological probing, and the detailed forensic science of Harris's previous works. The exception is the section set in Florence, which I thought was very good. Although Hannibal gives us some explanation for Dr. Lecter's psychosis, it was not the in-depth look I've been waiting for over the past 11 years. And I hated the ending--it was a complete betrayal of the character of Clarice Starling who started so promisingly as a rich and interesting female lead in Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How exhilirating the first 400 pages were only to run head on into an ending that was very disappointing. The story was structured so well I was hoping it would never end but once it did disappointment &amp; disbelief set in."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Predictible plot, thin characters- why did it Take Mr. Harris 7 years to come up with this obvious sequel?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am a scientist so usually I only read non-fiction books. Intrigued by the character Dr. Lecter and interested to know Clarice Starling's life, I have been eagerly waiting for their return. Thomas Harris' Hannibal is the first novel I read from cover to cover in years. I was not disappointed. While reading it, I clearly felt that I was listening to one of the greatest story tellers of our time. With senses of history and culture, the writer connects people from the Renaissance to the Internet age, from Dante's Inferno to Washington's Presidential Impeachment. The readers' intelligence is constantly challenged by different but converging threads and numerous surprises. The development of characters and events is extremely suspenseful and realistic. If you liked Count of Mt. Christ you will love this one.I do however have some reservations with the pervasive descriptions of cannibalism and Part IV of the book. I found both, and I think many would agree with me, not credible and a stretch of the characters, especially Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling. These descriptions are not based on experience or knowledge. Part IV is really unnecessary. The book should have ended with Part III, and whatever happens next will be the subject of a future installment. Now the author seems to try to rush the exit and the reality and suspense completely disappeared. I feel that I don't want to know anything about Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling anymore. They have stopped intriguing me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book started out well and then slowed to the point where I just took an afternoon to just sit and finish the book to get it over with. It dragged for a while. I agree that alot of the gore was gratuitous; very unneccesary. Some of the chracter plots were strange (ie. Margot/Judy, what was that??) I did like how Hannibal wasn't the only bad guy (this book was full of monsters!)and I also liked reading about Hannibal's background. That was interesting. The climax was pretty good, but it was the last chapter that left my jaw hanging. I don't know how I feel about that ending. It definitely caught me off guard."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What tripe. I would have given Zero stars if allowed. I honestly could not finish this sorry excuse for a thriller. That's an exceptional action to take, as my nature is to finish a book no matter what.There's no art to the writing. Yeah, it's supposed to be a potboiler thriller, but that doesn't mean the writing can't be artful. And if Harris can't achieve that, at least he could come up with some new ideas. Hannibal is just a collection of &quot;here's something gross&quot; scenery. A few good pages set in Italy paid for an &quot;business travel&quot; tax deduction, so at least Harris got something for his efforts. There is no development of character, no imagination, and no thrill.There are so many other books to read and so little time in the world for us to read them. I urge you to hasten to another book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a big fan of Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon, I had eagerly awaited Harris' next voyage into the deliciously (pardon the pun) evil mind of Hannibal the Cannibal. Perhaps I should have realized how bitterly disappointed I would be based on how long it took me to finish the book. While I couldn't put down Silence of the Lambs and devoured it (sorry again) in a few short days, Hannibal took me three months. What a staggering waste of time: this book was so bad it was offensive. First, Harris launches into self-serving, artsy-fartsy descriptions of Italian culture that sound about as authentic as aspartame. Then, stealing a page from an X-files script, he creates villains so impossibly macabre they might as well have arrived during an alien visitation. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, Harris sells out Starling. She goes from being a fiercely independent, driven, talented, bright career woman to arm candy for a brain-eating serial killer. Female readers beware: there may be numerous olfactory references in this book, but the stench of sexism overpowers them all at the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Found it hard to put this one down. Character development throughout the book is masterful. If you liked &quot;Silence&quot;, read the book..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Bleah! I just finished this boook, and from having read some of the many reviews here, I knew it was either going to be terrific or terrible. Well, I must vote for the latter. I give this thing two stars only because it's a fast, easy read, and it does contain some creative bits from an obviously talented author. But, whereas his previous works were genuinely chilling and fear inspiring, this thing was more of a farce and had about as much impact as an old Wile E. Coyote cartoon, in which the principal form of entertainment is seeing all the different ways the coyote (Hannibal's victims) could be creatively done in. The characters are either ridiculous, revolting, or a mixture of both. Some parts were so over the top you half expected John Cleese to wander in and cheerfully announce &quot;This is ENTIRELY too silly!&quot;. The bottom line is we don't care about any of the characters, and the plot is simply too outlandish to take seriously enough to be frightening. Lecter might as well wear blue underwear with a big &quot;S&quot; emblazened on his chest, since apparently he can accomplish anything with the merest of effort or hesitation. The Lecter of the previous novels was indeed exceedingly clever, but not so smart as to avoid getting caught in the first place. In short, he had an aura of credibility which made his penetrating evil all the more frightening. Ditto for Clarice, but in this book, the two of them, along with everyone else, become little more than cartoon figures. All I can say is I'm glad I got this from my library (read it over the weekend, dropped it off the next day, having had little desire to go back and savor it again, as one does with any truly worthwhile read) and avoided paying the cover price. It will be interesting to see if it's made into a movie, it's hard to imagine any revision to the screenplay that won't be an improvement over the novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has the inimitable ability to fully engage the reader and create a visceral experience that keeps your eyes glued to the pages and has you checking underneath your bed before &quot;attempting&quot; to sleep. In Hannibal, Harris has obviously taken to the crack pipe.My true feeling is that Harris was fed up by the pressure from Hollywood to write a sequel to Silence of the Lambs-- and to get even, he wrote this book. At least I hope that's the reason. If not, call Bellvue, we've got an author who's lost it! I asked myself 150 pages into it &quot;Is this going anywhere?&quot; I should learn to be more specific with my questions because where it went was right down the crapper. In Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, Harris so masterfully creates his characters that we actually feel sympathy for the psychotic Dr. Lechter. In Hannibal, we learn that Harris is the real psycho and our sympathy goes out the door when you consider the price of this hardback monstrosity.The ending itself was so bad, I took out life insurance to get through the last ten pages. I pulled through but it was touch and go there for a while. In spite of the fact that I would never recommend picking up this book, I still can't reveal the details as to why the ending of Hannibal bites so badly... no pun intended.Harris is not a conventional writer so his formula for creating suspense and developing characters is anything but formulaic. Does this book just take a different path? Indeed, a path that leads right off a steep cliff."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What in the world Thomas Harris was thinking when he wrote this book is beyond me. I loved Silence of the Lambs and the Red Dragon, but I forced myself to finish this one. (It took me a month to read this book)I can not put into words what I disliked, there was so much. About the characters, Mason Verger..who ate his own face and survived (yeah right) to the cop in Italy, there was not one socially redeeming quality among them.Then at the end, Harrris further insults our intelligence by having Clarice Starling cohabitating with Dr. Lecter. I really hated this book!!!I am willing to bet the movie will be a long time coming. But it will have to be better than the book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yep, the ending was as bad as everybody said. Later I may regret saying that I enjoyed this story until the last--oh, we've all read it by now--until &quot;our heroine&quot; gets knocked out by the dart gun. 400 pages is a long climb before the bottom drops out. Here's why I think the ending is all wrong. If she's going along with him of her own volition, it's a complete sellout of her character. &quot;I couldn't break the glass ceiling, so why NOT learn about opera and fine wine from an expert? And damn Dad for dying anyway, P.S., thanks for helping me confront his WITHERED SKELETAL REMAINS. I needed that closure.&quot; On the other hand, and despite all the Hannibal sympathizers (!) who reviewed this book below, if she is brainwashed it's not true to Hannibal's character either. He's supposed to admire her, but tampering with her mind means she's not herself anymore. Wasn't the world supposed to be more interesting with her in it? The perfectionist Lecter couldn't be satisfied with the Stepford Wife version of Clarice Starling we're left with at the end.At times I found myself rationalizing that almost everyone killed in the book was unsympathetic. Unlike many other readers, I stopped myself in time to realize that the Gomez-and-Morticia-as-bon-vivants ending was still unacceptable. Mr. Harris wrongly tipped the scales by rendering Jack Crawford and Ardelia Mapp completely ineffective while Krendler, in all his misogynistic, homophobic, adulterous, nose-picking glory (by which I mean he's unsympathetic, too, you got it), has too much control.I should add that Mason Verger was a great villain, and I enjoyed watching his elaborate plans fall through. Barney was fleshed out--pun intended--quite well, and Margot was interesting. Will it be Demi Moore? Will it?Ultimately, the means don't justify the end. Someone should steal that for THEIR summary...Because I enjoyed nine-tenths of it, I won't give this the damning-with-faint-praise one or two stars. It gets three, but the world will be a better place if the movie ends with Jodie shooting Anthony in the...oh, and by the way, the &quot;it's just a book, people, lighten up&quot; attitude I'm challenging here ignores the reasons why many of us read fiction; be curious about the dark side, be aware of the dark side, even morbidly enjoy it once in a while (Hannibal writes some chillingly funny letters), but don't give in to it. &quot;Hannibal&quot; gives in to the darkness, and as expressed above, does so at the expense of its characters' credibility"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was easily the most disappointing read of the year, and this comes from a Harris fan whose been reading since Black Sunday.All the hallmarks: the precision of the plot, the minutae of detail, the authenticity: all gone.Instead we just rehash old characters, throw the antagonist into the lead role and on my God: the final section is just a Grand Guignol piece of puff.I so wanted to enjoy this book, instead it just casts doubts on his previous works. I understand David Mamet is drafting the screenplay: I hope he keeps the title and chucks the rest.Good points? Well the writing is as sharp as ever, not one word wasted, there's obviously a sharp mind behind it all. But it all seems small beer, somehow.I hope the next novel (will there BE a next novel?) strikes out away from this whole Lecter mess and into something fresh."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Really, I enjoyed listening to this book. The story is good, The dictation is perfect (specially for the mason character) and it really captivated me on the 40' drive to and from the office. The book is not a typical &quot;second part&quot;, but is able to stand on its own.As for the descriptions of Florence and the Italian life, only a few inconsistencies (nothing worth mentioning). Mr. Harris made also a few mistakes, as to mention that we have a sign on the car mirror that says &quot;Objects look nearer on this mirror&quot;... Sorry pal, but only american cars have this sign.My black note goes to bantam, as I got a set of tapes where tape #5 was a bad recording. Amazon responded and sent me another copy, no cost. Still, tape #5 has a hissing sound, specially on side B."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Perhaps my level of anticipation was too high, but it was much greater than the actual event (reading the book). There were some surprises and a very different character in Verger, but I did not enjoy him. The psychological realizations of Starling and Lecter were interesting, but Clarice's final status was, to me, not believable. My advice: re-read Silence and Red Dragon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not nearly as good as The Silence of the Lambs, but then, you expect the sequel would end like it does, I was a little disappointed with it, but it is nonetheless very sharp and incredibly interesting!I strongly recommend it, along with Thomas Harris' Red Dragon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I wish I would have read some of the other reviews before my husband bought this for me for Christmas. I have not gotten past page 100 yet, but it doesn't sound like things get better. My problem with the book quite simply is the spelling and sentence errors. Didn't anyone run Spell-Check or edit this book. What an embarrassment to the publisher. I haven't even had time to critique the plot in my head, I am trying to get past the spelling errors."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There is much controversy surrounding the final pages of &quot;Hannibal&quot;. As it relates to the movie people keep saying, &quot;It can't be filmed.&quot; With proper restraint, of course it can be filmed. As an operatic, surreal finish it should be &quot;suggested&quot; by Ridley Scott not &quot;depicted&quot; when he edits the movie. And who knows, maybe in the next book it will turn out to be a dream anyway. Regardless, it is a flawless ending to a flawless book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has made another masterpiece with Hannibal. What you think is going to happen in the end is incredibly off. After having read The Silence of the Lambs I wasn't sure if this could be anywhere near the suspenssfulness of it. But, it is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"this book was a suspenseful trip intothe the depths of the human psyche and a look at what dwells within all of us. Apart from non-stop action and chilling scenes this book asks the reader to examine him or herself, and not jump too quickly to convenient conclusions which most often then not fail. Hannibal Lecter is a monster but an intellectual one and thus adds an attractive dimension to his character. He is also a person of great understanding and empathy and thus is the reason that Clarice falls for him in the end. If a reader is willing to go beyond the mere suspense of this story and read between the lines he or she would see the true horror, and see in how in all of us lurks a side we rarely reveal to ourselves. I have to say I really enjoyed this book and was glad to see Mason get what he had coming to him as well as Krendler. For those who disagree, Clarice really didnt' have much of a choice. Lecter was the person who finally helped her break free from her father's ghost. The life she knew before did not. As for the production, having bought the audiobook version, it was great though Mr. Gerroll overdid it a bit concerning Mason's character. At times it was very difficult to understand him; all and all though he did an excellent job reading this great book; Bravo mr. Harris, hopefully you have not put your irresistible monster to rest forever; after all, he now has a bride of sorts; a fourth entry into his life would be greatly appreciated."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As far as I'm concerned, my sister and Harris owe me 3 days of my life back. Loved both the other books - hated this one. My sister hated it as well - had me read it just to confirm her dislike. In fact, you will not just be disappointed, but characters you've liked since Red Dragon and Silence get ruined. We think he wrote this just to screw up Hollywood. DO NOT READ THIS. Reread the other 2."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Inside this book is a great story, but Harris spends WAAAAAYY too much time on critiquing and analyzing Italian art &amp; history down to the very last inch. (WARNING: IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK DO NOT CONTINUE TO READ THE REST OF MY REVIEW)I liked how Clarice and Hannibal fell in love, but I didn't like how she had to become a cannibal like him (as he gave up crime at the end). Anyway, an average book that isn't a can't-miss thing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The more i thought about it the more i agree. This was the only possible ending. To watch Starlings character dissolve , to be eclipsed , was inspired. Who but Harris would have dared. This was the 'monsters' finest hour and darkest deed. Read it twice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I looked forward to this book for a long time, expecting the care, depth of character, and attention to detail that characterizes other books by this author, but was sadly disappointed. It is sloppy and frequently goes for the cheap shot. If you're going to keep characters and prolong a story it would be nice if they maintained integrity. Although Krendler sure got his. I wonder who actually wrote this book, 'cause it sure doesn't sound like Mr. Harris. I'll stick with Silence of the Lambs. Save yourself time and trouble and read something else."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;The evil that men do lives on and on; the good oft lies interred with their bones.&quot; So it is with Thomas Harris' followup to the electric &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Having had an Oscar-winning film made from his earlier book, Harris apparently intended to defraud the production company which purchased the film rights by writing a book which simply cannot be filmed.First off, the violence is way over the top, and Harris' descriptions of the same reveal a sort of manic glee, as though the author were intentionally seeking to alienate his audience in a fit of artistic pique.Secondly, the relationship between Starling and Lecter, so intriguing in the first book and in the film, is here reduced to an implausible and disgusting mock opera.Third, the very thing which made Hannibal Lector an appealing villain, the mystery as to how a man could become so monstrous, is herein revealed by the author in a fashion only the most pedestrian of amateur psychologists could find appealing.Fourth, the climax to the novel is so riduculous and over the top that most would simply throw the thing to the floor in disgust.The only obstacle to giving this book an even lower rating is the nagging suspicion that the author, rather than being merely incompetent, actually intended this farce to be a practical joke on the public. If true, I give Harris some grudging respect for his audacity. I would not, however, recommend his book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; but this third episode was a major disappointment for me. I found I simply couldn't believe Hannibal Lecter living a new life as a Dante scholar in Florence. And the whole sub-plot with the wild pigs is a mess. As for the end, well... a lot of the other reader reviews have said it already. I simply couldn't accept it, especially as the progression to that point doesn't ring true. All in all, a big let-down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not wait to read this book. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it, that is until the end. I know that endings are supposed to surprise you, but come on! This is not the same Clarice that was in Silence of The Lambs. Let's pray for a conclusion to Hannibal so Clarice can become a strong character again!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had been anticipating the release of Hannibal months before its release. I was waiting impatiently at the bookstore the day of the release. The Silence Of the Lambs is one of my all time fave books. I also liked Red Dragon and Black Sunday. I was not at all disappointed. No, the book isn't as good as its predecessor, it takes a new direction, so quit comparing it to the SILENCE. Open your mind, this book takes on twists and turns into the human psyche unexplored in earlier works. Harris did some amazing research for his foreign settings also. I love, love the fact that Starling shows her dark side in this book. Its just good, creepy fun, don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy. Harris is a rather elusive writer and I think that is his charm, if he churned out books like,say, Stephen King every week I would lose interest. It is worth waiting 10 years in between books. Harris, I hope your hard at work on the next installment, I will be the first to buy it! Also,what is this horrible news that Jodie Foster isn't going to be in the film version? Hopkins is returning. Michell Pfieffer was the original choice to play Starling, and she is THE ONLY other actress I will accept. If Gillian Anderson plays Starling I think I'll pass.."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I asked &quot;Santa&quot; for a copy of this book. When I recieved it, I couldn't believe the actual size of the book. And I couldn't put it down. It is amazing that one person could come up with such twists and turns. I recommend this book for anyone who remotely enjoys an excellent book. Read it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.. Okay? go read it now.. I beg you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The propagation of previously unacceptable concepts and/or practices is referred to as &quot;pushing the envelope&quot;. This has become the mantra, especially in the arts, without regard to the benefits or consequences to a society that result. This book is the latest illustration of the slippery slope upon which we slide. Mr. Harris evidently determined that to top his previous efforts, we need to visualize a man being fed his own brains and other such activities - and this is what is now &quot;mainstream/best-seller&quot; material! One can only sigh at the prospect that awaits us when Mr. Harris (or the next &quot;artist&quot;) tries to go beyond these images in the sacred pursuit of the larger envelope. &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, while having it's moments of depravity, was at least partially based on the real life story of Ed Gien who was also the inspiration for &quot;Psycho&quot;. The psychological profile(s) necessary for such stories provided redeeming value to these efforts. &quot;Hannibal&quot; can claim no such redemption and has obviously been produced to either express Mr. Harris' personal interests or, from a free market perspective, because Mr. Harris perceives us as not having enough depraved negative images to absorb. If the first reason is true, he has my sympathies; if it's the second, I feel sorry for us all. That's why after reading a synopsis, I returned this book as soon as it arrived. I refuse to help finance (and thus encourage) this garbage. My impulse to keep it and give it to a friend as a gift lasted long enough to realize that no one I care about should have their sensibilities so taxed for such little reward. Besides having been steadily &quot;dumbed-down&quot;, our society has concurrently been coarsened by such pornography. We are deluged with these and other images in our modern religion of pop culture. The average kid on the street can recite on demand the name of every Star Wars character and much of their dialogue ...and when Jay Leno interviews several members of a newly graduating college class and asks each one ...&quot;how many moons does the earth have&quot;, he received the answers: &quot;Nine&quot;... &quot;Five&quot;... and &quot;I don't know, I didn't take astronomy&quot;. We are reaping what we've sown- and the harvest that awaits us will be future leaders and managers who'll know all about eating one's own brains- and from this book, it's obvious that Mr. Harris has done first-hand research.SHRINK THE ENVELOPE: the mind you save may be ours!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't dismiss this great book on the basis of the ill-adapted movie. The movie stunk - BIG time - but please don't let that put you off, as the book was AMAZING. The last chapter (to date) in the Hannibal Lecter story included some very gruesome people & events - perhaps overly gruesome - but the sleek Dr. Lecter is still a blast to tag along with - as he glides noiselessly through cool marble halls to reinvent himself, and evade the long arm of the law that shadows him. Just lovely!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't believe it took almost ten years for Harris to write this sequel to Silence Of The Lambs! Not worth the wait! Red Dragon and Silence were far and away much better reads. One can only hope Mr. Harris'next novel (rumored to be another Hannibal novel)is as spine-tinglingly terrifying as he is capable of!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"wins vacuous blond in the end. The good news is that hannible's victims all deserved what they got... except for the old curator of some Italian museum, but what the hey, how else could Harris bore us with his impressive knowledge of Italian history and culture for 200 pages? I'll give the thing 2 stars because I was able to finish it, but I really am getting tired shock 'art' and rednecks getting harpooned simply for being out of favor with the mass reading public."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's hard to imagine a more artistic and refined treatment of thoroughly gruesome events than the one Harris gives them here. Despite what some may say, the primary effect is not to glamorize Hannibal Lecter, but to stun and chill the reader with his utter inhumanity. The elegant prose has the second very welcome effect of keeping the book from becoming brutal and revolting, always maintaining a cool distance from its gore. The astonishing climactic setpiece, which centers on a formal dinner party unique in the history of prose (trust me! this is Dr. Lecter we're talking about!) would have been stomach-turning, if not set up with such fine concern for detail and performed with such exquisite finesse. One is left not repulsed, but awestruck at this aristocratic monster and at Harris' skill in creating and presenting him. Not a pretty read by any means, but a tour-de-force performance all around."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The two stars for this book are for the opening scenario of the story and for Harris' writing abilities. The quality of the rest of the book degenerates and would deserve a negative rating. I was very pleased with the opening sequence of the book and found the current state of Starling's career to be in a believable condition. However, the pace of the story lags for a point; Harris seems too enamored of his ability to turn elegantly grotesque phrases and situations to develop a plot that moves along. His ability to describe details is beautiful. There are, however, far too many monsters in this story. In Silence of the Lambs, the central theme was Starling and how she used a monster to catch a monster. In Hannibal, however, there are far too many monsters inhabiting the pages and the tension that drove Silence of the Lambs is woefully absent. The corruption of Starling is the worst part of the entire mess, and I feel that the ending is a betrayal of the character who is at the core a good and decent woman. It isn't believable, and is an insult to the reader. If Harris' intent was to show that anyone can be corrupted, that anyone has these seeds within, he didn't make his point very well. More of the time between his books should have been spent strengthening the central theme and less time enhancing the elaboration of his images. I really hope that when a movie of the novel is made that they change the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is my habit to read the end of a book as soon as I'm interested enough in the story to see how it turns out. Having read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (and having seen the movie), I didn't even have to read the beginning of &quot;Hannibal&quot; to be very curious about the end. I had to go back 6 chapters to get the gist of it ... and it is AWFUL. Just horrendously violent!Will Graham, Harris' &quot;Red Dragon&quot; FBI agent, once said that he didn't want Lecter's thoughts in his head because they are the worst thoughts in the world. (I'm paraphrasing.) I don't want &quot;Hannibal&quot; in my head and I don't want this book in my house.I only wish there was an option for zero stars."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't be bothered. This 'book' is horrible. The story has all the charisma of an extended descriptive paragraph of Italy coupled with the warmth of a French gourmet-cooking guide. Stay away. (Or you get the hose.) You've been warned"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like many of the other readers, I've waited almost a decade to read this book. I am not sure it was worth the wait. The brilliant deviousness of the characters that impressed us so much in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is only present here in flashes.The plot is straightforward and dare I say it, somewhat predictable. Those rumored brilliant plot twists must have completely passed me over.But this is not a suspense novel. Anyone who bills it or raves over it as such hasn't read it or didn't understand it. It is a character study. So are the characters up to snuff?The main villian, Mason, has potential, but when the character gets going, he gets no more development. His planned fate for Lecter is not novel but it still would have been both an ironic and symbolic fate for a cannibal.Clarice is Clarice, and except for the ending, Harris handles her well. She's still sharp as a tack.Of the other characters from &quot;Silence&quot;, only Barney avoids short shrift. I was really dissatisfied with the gloss-over of Jack Crawford. Fredrick Chilton? Who's he? I wanted to know more about what happened to him than that!Hannibal does not top his previous outing. His &quot;longing&quot; if you can call it that, for his great loss seems out of character. I only enjoyed one aspect of that character revelation. His character background was welcome, and the comment by Barney about Lecter's belief system was great. We get a servicable rehash of the events of &quot;Silence&quot; in a conference involving a psychiatrist with no love lost for Lecter; which is also worth reading because it does offer an important alternative view of Lecter's interest in Clarice.This book comes up a little short on the rich symbolism in the first book, Hannibal as Apollo was a really neat metaphor in &quot;Silence&quot; which I didn't find matched in richness or depth in this book.Overall, I would read the book, but do not expect to be amazed. I can respect the opinion that this book is not a pleasing sequel. The worst thing about this book is the last few chapters, I have to admit the complaints about the ending being hard to swallow are not frivolous."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is absolutely, without doubt The Greatest Living Writer alive today.I have waited for over 10 years for him to finish this book. I read it in one sitting, staying up all night -- and I was never disappointed. He's a wonderful writer and Hannibal is a joy to read. It does differ from his other books and explores interesting new territory.I recommend this book to anyone. You may find the subject matter at times grotesque, however, his writing is superlative and his creativity so great -- you will find yourself enamoured. Plus he obviously loves food! What more can you ask for?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A page and stomach turner...full of dark humour where the author at laughs you: we complain about the ending? Yet how many of us pay good money to read such books and watch similar movies...it's about the morbidity in all our minds. The ending could not have been any other way."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow. Wow. Wow. I just finished reading HANNIBAL and I'm stunned. Stunned that the same writer of RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS wrote this book. I can't stress how disappointed I am and how awful this book is. If it was any other writer and any other book, I wouldn't even have bothered to finish it. This book is so bad, it feels like something that was rushed to print to capitalize on the success of SILENCE, not something that took 10+ years to write!All I can say is, I wish Amazon let you give &quot;0&quot; stars as a rating option because that's what this &quot;book&quot; deserves."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read it through, finding many endearing metaphors, I intend to revisit. This book approaches from a stranger perspective. At times, it pushes &quot;we&quot; away then brings us in, into Hannibal's inner world and a darkerville of Clarice. Where it ends, I'm sorry, what the hell was that? I'm laughing, sick and wonderful. Besides ending, this is a four-star book. Will they movie-it? pass the ham sandwich *grin*"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I love Silence of The Lambs. I always like the macabre, so despite hearing all about the gruesome brain-eating and quasi-psychosexual scenes, I thought, &quot;What the heck, I can stomach anything. This is Thomas Harris, what can go wrong?&quot;Plenty, as it happened. When I finish this book, I feel so queasy and sick in my stomach. I'll pass the chicken, give me a salad please."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first time I realized that there was a problem was when the book should have ended, but did not. I got to what I saw as the logical (and cinematic) climax and saw 50 pages ahead of me.I had an inkling as to what was coming. To be sure, I was hoping I was wrong. I was not.When I finished the book, I was uneasy. The ending disturbed me, as I'm sure it did most of you. It was a deamlike descent -- not just for the characters, but for the reader.Harris did not write a screenplay, he wrote a horror novel. My sense of uneasiness did not come from a poor ending, but rather the only ending he could have given the book: good is destroyed, evil remains.In fact, the evil that we were all rooting for (and Hannibal is a hero, no doubt about it) was the victor. Complaining about this is not only hypocritical, but misses the point."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Forget the Star Wars backlash. Hannibal is the true pop-culture disappointment of the summer. The book was actually in three- to four-star territory for a while. As outlandish and macabre as the new characters and situations are, they're never boring, and the novel zipped along...until the final chapters. Harris' resolution is a four-alarm misfire, a sick joke played upon his readers. He sacrifices characterization and logic for shock value, and the result will leave a bad taste in a lot of mouths."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't listen to all the others, people. This book is so trippy and bizaare. Just suspend your disbelief for a bit - let the logic of the scenario take over. Hannibal Lecter is the hero of this novel. He's a killer, all right. He's sick in the head, all right. But he's honest. And this novel constructs that as the highest of virtues. Maybe the end was supposed to be horrifying, and it was in a way. But I think it was a happy ending. It is highly problematic, but that's OK. It's supposed to weird you out that you're happy at the end. And I was. In a really messed up way. Give the book a try. It bends your values all around, which is a good thing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I, like many others, anxiously awaited the release of this book. I thoroughly enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence. Hannibal is missing the key elements present in the first two. I so enjoyed the forensics and psychological profiling that acted as revealing pieces of a puzzle and served to create dramatic tension. We always knew Hannibal was a monster, but we enjoyed delving into his mind. The characters in this book are just sick and I felt gross reading about all of Mason Verger's deviances with children. It feels like Mr. Harris has the kind of disdain for his readers that Hannibal has for humanity. Clarice is not much like her previous self through most of the book but the way she ends up is completely unbelievable. I hate to trash any book and especially one by an author I admire, but this book is a mess. I agree with the review above that this is a novel that cannot (should not) be made into a movie. I preordered this book before reading a review and I hope Mr. Harris makes a bunch of money off this one because I won't make that mistake again. Maybe this book is a set up for the next one and all will be made clear but I'll find out from the library, not by spending my hard earned money on this kind of drek. Most of all I'm disappointed by someone I thought was a master of suspense."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The third installment of the Hannibal trilogy is audacious, appalling, and a complete blast! Granted, the plot is out there--way out there, actually--but Harris' pacing, restraint and the utter authenticity of Lecter and Starling make it cook and keep it real."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Never would I have believed that this book, that I have anticipated so much, would end up being the worst book I ever read. What Harris obviously wanted to do was put an end to Hannibal and what better way than to give such an unbelievable ending. I feel cheated. I wish I had never read it....."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; may be one of the most exotic page turners I've come across. A one-eyed monster, man-eating pigs, hypnosis drugs, female body builders, a little Dante, lots of ugly cuts, bruises, and bites, a hungry pet eel, some evil Washington bureaucrats, and perhaps the strangest dinner party ever held make this one wicked brew of book. Hannibal may be a human cuisinart - but he also knows the sublime art of how to heal a soul. This book isn't simply about evil, but about the strange, uncanny intimacy between good and evil. What extraordinary places this book goes! You'll push your own envelope with this one!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Uh Oh! I am sad at having bought into the idea that this book might come close to the genius of Silence of the Lambs. Now that was a book that I couldn't put down! This one I put down a lot! I wanted to love this book, but I couldn't. I agree with the general consensus...the beginning was stupid, the middle very interesting, and the end a complete waste of paper.What a huge disappointment! Please dont make this into a film....at least not with good actors. You might just ruin their careers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"'Hannibal' is a stunning achievement. The literal-minded will hate it, however. And diligent consumers of brand-name products will feel betrayed. Nevertheless, it works beautifully as a police procedural and horrifying thriller (what 'fans' expect). But Harris is too much the artist to re-hash 'Cannibal Wars IV'. 'Hannibal' is also a hauntingly erotic love story. Anyone who didn't suspect how the relationship between Lecter and Starling would develop must have been distracted by the 'smoke-and-mirrors' in Silence of the Lambs - where the relentless sexual undercurrents of psychiatric transference (Starling) and counter-transference (Lecter) were already in operation."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First of all, I think the book should have come with an Italian to English Dictionary. The middle part was better. And the ending sounded like Stephen King snuck up behind Harris, knocked him out cold and finished his book for him. However, there is good structure and humor and a pleasingly curious villain in Mason Verger."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not wait for this book to be published! I wrote the date on my calendar so I could pick it up the day it was released. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The ending was so ridiculous that I just skimmed the last few pages. I would definitely recommend waiting until the paperback comes out or borrowing it from the library. I didn't even offer it to any friends to read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I regret the time I wasted reading this book. The plotting is simplistic and the juvenile ending hardly worthy of a teen horror flick. The constant shift of perspective and person (first person plural?) does not help. Dr. Lector as protagonist? I don't think so! Endowing him with a horrible childhood event, Harris wants to justify everything Lector does as somehow acceptable. He attempts to excuse Lector with the same simplistic psychology (&quot;Poor Hannibal, he can't help himself!) he satirizes in the novel. I had more sympathy for the professional killers. At least, they had some trace of an ethical system. Finally, there is the poor Clarise. Harris has become the cannibal, feeding her to Lector who devours her psyche and repeatedly &quot;rapes&quot; her in a doubly incestuous relationship. I hardly think even poor Mishe would approve (she of the tooth in the toilet). This book belongs in the toilet! I recommend it for the remainder stack, the sooner the better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could hardly put this book down. It was scarey, horrifying, and tense. I found Hannibal's victims to be even more evil than he is. I also did not find the ending as awful as others did. I was surprised and satisfied by it. I understand the event that triggered Hannibal's psycopathic state, but I want to know the process. It made me very, very curious to learn more about psycopathic and psychotic personalities. This book was not perfect, but it was entertaining and satisfying."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"the first 80 % of the book sailed along just like its twopredecessors, but the last 20% or so of the book was a disappointment.Red Dragon is still harris' masterpiece."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I know you don't want to hear it, but unfortunately it's true. This book is terrible! How can it be that a writer as talented as Harris has produced this? Unbelievably bad. A huge, huge, disappointment and a giant missed opportunity for Harris. If you have fond memories of Starling &amp; Hannibal, do not taint them by reading this rubbish; keep your memories of the characters as they currently stand. Spend your time &amp; money elsewhere."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thank you Mr. Harris! I've been dying to read this and finally got my mitts on a copy. It was miles beyond the formulaic work of the summer pop fiction whodunnits. Those of you who detest change or don't like to think when you read, avoid this book. Now bring on the movie!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If a writer takes 10 years to create a novel, I would expect a bit more plot. Harris is long on details of Lecter's tastes, and excrutiatingly hammers home Lecter's genuis. Enough already; we get it. The plot was thin, but the ending was so disturbing, confusing and frankly a literary betrayal. It was ridiculously out of character for Starling and difficult to stomach. Rarely have I read something that left me feeling so angry at the end. Harris takes a character we have come to honor and respect and turns her into a monster's whore. What a lame excuse for an ending. I love Harris's earlier work and had been eagerly anticipating this book. What a sad thing it is. Maybe the movie will be a bit less disappointing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the many reviews of this book, I was afraid I wasn't going to like it at all. I did. I liked the ending, kind of fairytale like, but somehow fitting to the bond that Clarice and Hannibal shared over time. She got into his mind and he, certainly, got into hers. Mutually attracted by the qualities that made them more alike, than different. Very interesting characters in this novel. Mason Verger is a monster, well drawn evil incarnate. Paul Krendler is a villain who gets his just desserts. There are parts I skimmed over because of the gruel factor and it is pretty graphic. I learn esoteric bits of trivia when I read Thomas Harris and I most certainly enjoy that. Good read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was anxiously awaiting the followup to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. I bought &quot;Hannibal&quot; looking forward to more of the intense dialogue in the &quot;Lambs&quot;.I liked the first part of the book, but was dissappointed near the end. I thought that Clarice tripped on her part of an investigator. Got too spacey.I will not recommend the book to others.Lee Valle ifrlee@earthlink.net"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A total disappointment. Mr. Harris took eleven years and gave his readers/fans an insult. This book is filled with ludicrous characters, a ridiculous plot and an insulting ending. It was so simple. All he had to do was give us a prequel. Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham. How did Graham catch Lecter? What brought them together? How was Will like Hannibal? So much furtile ground and Harris ignored it for wild pigs, lesbian bodybuilders and a moray eel. What a joke! Do yourself a favor and don't buy it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading most of the reviews on this page, it seemed to me that a lot of the anger felt towards this book was based upon the previous success the series has earned itself. But let's forget Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. You must judge books individually, and only then will they deserve their rightfully earned praise.In the 3rd chapter of the trilogy, Dr. Hannibal Lector has reached out and contacted Agent Clarice Starling, which starts an uproar in the FBI. His case is reopened, and agents worldwide are searching for the madman again. Meanwhile, Starling&iexcl;s career is ruined because of a shootout that turned into a bloodbath. While she is struggling to get back on top, lurking beneath shadows is Mason Verger. He is Dr. Lector&iexcl;s 6th victim, and is dying for revenge. He has the entire underground world working for him. Over in Italy, Pazzi is a burned out cop who desperately needs to regain his reputation. He begins to track down Il Monstro, a killing machine and eventually connects him to Dr. Lector. These are all very different people, yet they share one common thought. Where is Dr. Hannibal Lector, and how are they going to capture him?The key to a good book lies deep in the depth of the characters. In Hannibal, Thomas Harris has carefully sculptured each character to fit into the mysterious world of Hannibal. Each character is described to the core, and as you read, you actually begin to think like them. The more you understand about the characters, the more you begin to understand their actions and the way they feel. Emotionally, you become attracted to them. Well done, Harris.Good writers often do heaps of research before actually writing their piece of work. The knowledge and information gathered by Thomas Harris clearly shows in the text. Beautifully described art works, delicious meals, and ancient historical events are mentioned all throughout the book. From the elegant Givenchy, to the rusty old Mustang, Harris obviously did his load of research.Although one may argue that the ending is quite a shock, I believe Harris made it that way for a specific reason. Maybe the monster that has been roaming through the series isn't really a monster after all. Maybe it shows that when you're educated to the brink, you&iexcl;re mind becomes different than others. Maybe he wanted us to believe that even monsters can be tamed. Whatever Harris intended, we may never know. But what we do know, is that he has once again written a masterpiece that will stay in our minds for quite some time. This is defiantly worth buying, so elude yourself into the world of Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As well as being one of the most gripping thrillers I have ever read, a real page-turner even at 500-plus pages, it is a facinating study of a genius turned killer. The range of subjects touched upon -- Renaissance literature and history, art, baroque music, physics and mathematics, medicine -- is refreshing. Unlike most authors, Harris treats his readers as intelligent, well-read adults. As a study in a world devoid of moral absolutes and filled with atrocities and the response of a brilliant, sensitive mind exposed at a tender age to its horrors it is extraordinary."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While this book moved a little slower than Silence of The Lambs I felt it was an excellent follow up.These characters are intriguing, I can't take in enough info about them.It had a twist that was certainly unexpected at the end. I hope to see even one more book to follow this one. I will say that I was disappointed in the movie, especially the ending!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I started reading this book I kept in mind that it stands on its own, But still I was disappointed. I couldn't take away the image that I have in my head of Hannibal Lecter and the book just didn't rise to my expectations. I also felt that Starling's character wasn't really involved as one of the main characters except for the amazing beginning and at the end of the book. Furthermore, I really hated the ending. I just felt that all the qualities that made me love Hannibal Lecter, disappeared.I have to say that it is interesting at times and maybe if you can consider any character to play the role instead of Hannibal Lecter you can really enjoy it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I hated this book and the characters!! I really enjoy mystery/thrillers but this was too much. I read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and loved them. So, I was looking forward to Hannibal. I am so glad that I borrowed a copy and did not spend my cash on it. I felt that the whole intent was to discribe the most despicable characters doing the most despicable things. In that sense, it was a success. If you expect the quality and suspense of the first two books, I think you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal the book is by far much better than the movie, as is usually the case. One thing I know for certain, without giving away the plot, is that I will never look at pigs the same way. Hannibal is truly clever and intelligent; and, though, his character makes him out to be cruel and inhumane, you almost admire him because he is above the rest. The ending made my stomach turn. Then, it surprised me. A great read... it goes quick once you're into it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is known to most readers. I read it (whole thing) after seeing the movie. The book differs in some characters and in the ending, compared to the film. Harris writes quite well and uses an intresting technique to describe the happenings and feelings of the characters. The ending was a put-off for me, because I dont think it is 100% realistic. Starlings character would not do that (If you know what I mean). Still I recommend this book to those intrested in the macabre and chilling..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris novels have taken the American public by storm. I do not agree with some of the other reviewers, that he went too far, or twisted his characters. If you think about it, the reason Starling changed so much at the end was because of her loss in the FBI. The reason Lecter changed so much was because of the fact that he met someone who could stand up to him. He couldn't predict her, and found her fascinating in that sense.I love this book, more so than I love Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. Like a good bottle of wine, Harris just gets better with age. I hope he doesn't fall into doing another book just so Hollywood can have their ending. He wrote it to close this time, and they twisted it all around so that it was all wrong. I won't ruin it for you if you haven't read the book, but... The movie is all wrong.I love Thomas Harris's writing, and I don't think he's capable of writing a bad book. And believe me, I've read some horrid books, out of sheer desperation.If you're considering buying this book, you may want to think about it's sound track- it has some wonderful parts with Hopkins' voice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Even though I read this book out of order, I was impressed with Harris and his effort. However, he did get a little long winded at times but he compensated with a great tale of suspence and wonderment of what Hannibal the Cannibel would do next."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I believe that most people are upset with the book, because it does not follow a classic fairytale example. This book breaks new ground and has a very interesting ending (even though it is a little too surreal.) This is the most graphic book I have ever read, and I would not recommend it to the squeamish."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The novel is certainly exciting and entertaining because it makes your heart pound with sheer adrenaline. The dangerous cat and mouse game that Pazzi and Lecter play--who is the mouse?--is one of the most fun parts of &quot;Hannibal&quot;. We all realize early on that Pazzi will be one of Lecter's victims and suffer a ghastly death, but Pazzi's manner of death, when it does come, is beyond apalling. It is fierce, bloody, and well executed.The main disappointment was the revelation of Lecter's source of madness. I have always maintained that although Lecter is evil by nature, he seems to have a moral reason for killing. He ascribes to some higher understanding that his victims are too stupid to see. Only the select few can come into contact with him and not die. Disclosing his violent and cannabalistic nature as resulting from his sister's young death was a bit disappointing. I would have preferred Lecter's evil to be shrouded in mystery and incomprehensible."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was somewhat let down by the movie adaptation of Hannibal. I'm a fan of Ridley Scott's movies (Alien and Blade Runner are two of my all-time favorites) and I thought both Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore did a more than competent job. It wasn't a bad movie, but I left the theater feeling that something was missing. I think I would have liked it much better if I didn't have the book to compare it to.If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, in book and/or movie form, you owe it to yourself to read Thomas Harris' extremely well-written and compelling sequel, Hannibal. I had heard luke-warm things about the book when it was released two years ago, so I initially held off reading it. Then with the approach of the movie's release, I thought I'd give it a try.I was more than pleasantly surprised at the quality and elegance of the writing and the overall smoothness and fluidity of the story-telling. This is very literate writing. Not the kind you often find in mass-market paperbacks these days. In Stephen King's review of the book, he said that anything that helps blur the lines between literature and popular fiction is a welcome thing. I would have to agree. Harris' characters are vivid and deeply drawn. They come alive on the page. His metaphors are rich and provocative. Almost Shakespearean at moments.And yet Hannibal reads like the entertaining thriller that it is, at turns action-packed and at others almost comically gruesome. The ending of the book may be difficult for some readers to stomach. Either you don't like what Harris does with Hannibal and Clarice, as the makers of the movie did not (they changed the ending) or you go with it as a bold stroke of story-telling genius. Either way, this fine book is well worth your time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dr. Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lector is back in part three of the trilogy. Hannibal couldnt live up to Silence of the Lambs, though.Dont get me wrong, it was good. But Thomas Harris couldn't recapture the magic he had in Silence of The Lambs or the Red Dragon"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book was exciting in parts, every bit as good as silence of the lambs. But then it would digress off on to characters that really were not that essential to the plot. More needed to be written concerning Clarice and her efforts to locate Hannibal and not how to raise and train pigs. I felt as though I were being given a crash course in Italian arts and that was not what I bought the book for. If you combined the begining with a brief explanation of the other characters and finished off with the ending, you would have an excellent story. As it was, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' Hannibal revists the characters of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector almost a decade after their first encounter. One would think with two of the more recognizable characters at his disposal Harris would easily be able to replicate the success he had with Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. Alas, this is not the case.There's a certain spark that's missing from this novel and I have a feeling that it stems from Lector being on the prowl rather than in a cell. Somehow he was far more frightening when he was caged. He was far more mysterious. When free, however, Hannibal comes across as just another serial killer, one who can evade capture for the most part. He's reduced to really not much more than a Freddy or Jason type of character.There's also a lack of intelligence to the writing this time around. This is not to suggest that Harris is not a brilliant man but rather that he seems to be writing out of his league here. Harris' earlier books worked best on a psychological level when Lector was forced to stalk his prey solely with his mind. Robbed of that convention here Harris opts to lay the gore on thick and the results are underwhelming.I wasn't as appalled regarding the end of the book as some were. Rather, I thought it a logical conclusion given what Harris had written so far in Hannibal. That doesn't mean I liked it though."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A good piece of advice is &quot;never judge a book by the movie&quot; and _Hannibal_ is a perfect example of the maxim. The long-awaited follow up to _Silence of the Lambs_ has Thomas Harris exploring the character of Lecter in great detail, even more so than Starling and manages to do something the movie doesn't: allow the reader to develop sympathy for Lecter.This is crucial to the development of the story (which the film follows only partially. A great deal of fairly important stuff didn't make it from the book to the screen). At the same time we develop sympathy for the killer, we see Starling get systematically used and degraded, watching her descend from idealism (in _Silence_) to fatalism here. The ending, while shocking, is not very surprising upon reflection and that is a testament to the skill of Harris as a writer.This is an excellent, well-written, book. There isn't a lot of excess prose or description...every word has value and meaning. For fans of the first two books, it is a must read. If you are new to Harris or are buying the book after having seen the movie, my suggestion is to start with _Red Dragon_ and go forward from there. At the minimum, you should read _Silence_ before tackling Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't read many fiction books. I mostly stay with non-fiction. I saw the preview of the movie, and had to read the book. I thoroughly enjoyed this story, which I see as a very twisted love story--sort of a Belle meets Beast....I've not read _Silence of the Lambs_, and therefore am unaware if Dr. Lector got such a humane treatment in the original. Regardless, I was mesmerized by the written treatment of the 4 main characters: Hannibal Lector, Clarice Starling, Rinaldo Pazzi and Mason Verger. They each seemed to personify various character flaws. It was fascinating to see Dr. Lector outside of prison cells.Having heard about how gory the book was, I was surprised that it wasn't quite as bloody as I would have thought. As I read the final 25 pages, which constitutes the finale, I bursted out laughing. I will give this to Mr. Harris: He has a very sick sense of humor! I felt I had read the 80 previous pages just to arrive at a deliciously grotesque slap-shot routine.My favorite line from the book:&quot;I don't expect you to change your attitude entirely, as the other Paul did, Mr. Krendler. You are not on the road to Damascus . . . All we ask is that you keep an open mind.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book takes us to the world of Hannible Lecter as we have never seen before. The two previous books in the Hannible trilogy, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, dealt with Lecter and another criminal chase at the same time. Thomas Harris eliminates the &quot;other&quot; criminal and focuses specifically on Dr. Lecter. Harris repays the reader for this with the strange and extremely rich Verger family which keeps the reader with a weird feeling in their stomach. The book is amazingly written but leaves a tragic ending that comes as a true dissapointment for the readers of Thomas Harris' novels, and leaves a perfect series of sequels for Hollywood now that Harris has sold the rights to his signature character. Bottom Line: A great book but a weak finalle"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not believe such an ingeniously intelligent writer such a Thomas Harris could sell out his integrity like this. Red Dragon gave me nightmares and in my opinion is still one of the best horror stories I have ever read. Selling out at the end is a sacrilege, to the characters, the reader and last of all to Thomas Harris. I will admit that it is a good read until the last 2 chapters. If you just want to read another Thomas Harris book this will do, but if you are an avid fan as I was this book will disapoint you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just as we were recovering from the spine tingling yet fascinating reading of &quot;Silence Of The Lambs,&quot; one of the most frightening villains imagined returns.As we remember, evil incarnate in the form of the brilliant psychopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter has escaped his captors. As &quot;Hannibal&quot; opens it has been seven years of freedom for the killer, seven years of enjoying and employing his heinous plans. FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling is still haunted by him, and so are many of us.Film and television veteran Daniel Gerroll gives an appropriately chilling reading to this terrifying tale. Do you remember Hannibal Lecter's oily, ingratiating, scary voice? Wait until you hear Daniel Gerroll!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was interesting from beginning to end. At times you almost feel a little sorry for the sick, sadistic murderer. Then he shows his true colors and you quickly forget that notion. The involvement of Agent Starling in the story is minimal and I expected more. I believe that when it comes to the movie they will have to change the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must confess that after finishing the book I was first quite disappointed.I felt that the evil doctor had lost his mysterious aura of supernatural evility. I think that the &quot;reason&quot; for doctor Lecters unique behavior should have been a lot stranger and more horrifying than his - in themselves disgusting - chilhood experiences.By its structure the book was also quite peculiar. I had and I still have the feeling like Harris had changed his original idea radically while writing the book. Was the original idea make all the things to happen in Italy, and maybe without Starling at all?I hope that this shall be the last Hannibal Lecter -novel; I think that Harris has said everything essential aboat him and Clarice.In every case Harris had succeeded to create again some of the magigal atmosphere of the &quot;Lambs&quot;. The idea of the interial palaces was very beautiful.This was this far the best book of the year; Thank You very much mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You have to read this. Better than Silence of the Lambs. An Ending like you'll never believe. Harris is a master with a twisted mind."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Only THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY can match HANNIBAL for simmering intensity, chilling psychoterror, and depth of theme. This is a multi-dimensional work, perhaps too subtle for many, and certainly controversial. But it is worht reading, and that should count for a lot indeed. No, it is not perfect, but what is ?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Sorry. This novel is awful. A dull fairy tale that becomes less and less credible as it goes on, and ends up being just very very silly. Poor Mr Harris. Does he really think evoking all that Dante and cullenary nonsense make Lecter sophisticated? Oh dear. Harris has revealed something about himself in this novel that I'd never suspected of him: utter mediocrity."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book overall is quite good. Harris does a good job with the details, something that has been characteristic of his previous books. However, this attention to detail does make the book drag at parts. As the book progressed, I felt that Harris was trying to tie up all loose ends to make this the final book. Without giving anything away, I had trouble with the ending, which seemed to be quite a stretch. I know the prssure had been there for a sequel to &quot;Silence&quot;, but was this book a little forced?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As much as thomas harris would like us all to admire, understand, and empathize with Hannibal Lecter, I refuse. Talk about giving Hollywood what it wants--let's create characters more evil and corrupt than Hannibal so we can cheer him on. Let's delve into his soul to understand how he is just a victim of society, then end with acts of heroism and &quot;love&quot; we can all feel good about. What made the first two books good was believable characterization and events. This one was utterly preposterous. Of course people will love it. It's one giant metaphor for how women are consistently manipulated by, and fall in love with, the most disgusting men on earth. Enjoy ladies. The first 400 pages gets 2.5 stars, the rest should be used to wipe with. If Anthony Hopkins stars in the movie adaptation of this trash I'll get a sex change"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I want my money back. I want my time back. I want the part of my brain back that is storing any memory of this book. Maybe I'll get lucky and Dr. Lecter will dine on that portion of my brain one day.It's quite a disappointment, to say the least, when a sequel is so bad that it ruins for you the memory of its precursor. Unfortunately, this book has done that for me. Not only did much of the story drag seemingly without end, but the parts that could have been interesting or exciting only end up being ridiculous and unbelievable. The ending is not only unbelievable, but unforgivable.My advice is that if you must read this book, borrow it from the library or an unfortunate friend who paid good money for it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book lacks alot of the elements that made the other books a masterpiece. I would not recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"O.K., so i didn't hate everything about it, just almost everything about it. Terrible ending, full of one dimensional characters and characters who would've been better off as one dimensional (read:Lecter himself). Read something else."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book is fast and furious and brilliant. It is not for everyone. Those who need good and evil on separate plates will not feel satisfied. The ending is stunning and shocking and gorgeous--a mad retelling of Beauty and the Beast with phrases as carefully faceted and concise as Fay Weldon's &quot;Life and Loves of a She Devil.&quot; I recommend it for those who come to the book with an open mind and a strong stomach."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Enjoyable but last 20% is a bit corny.

The first 2\\\\3s of the book weren't at all dissappointing, but the ending is so absurd and out of character that it ruined the book. The only way to describe the ending is bad, bad, bad. On the other hand, I read Red Dragon just after Hannibal and loved it. Great story!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Extremely disappointing sequel to Red Dragon &amp; Silence of the Lambs. Fans of those books will, at first, be drawn into the world of Hannibal, but to paraphrase Stephen King, Harris has simply gone for the GROSS-OUT, when TERROR &amp; HORROR were what his fans were looking for. As for the preposterous ending, it is NOT worthy of discussion. I have NOT been so disappointed with an ending since Anne Rice's The Mummy (actually The Mummy has NO ending). As for a movie sequel, I'd say the chances of Jody Foster appearing in this, unedited (perhaps a screenwriter can come up with a believable conclusion), FAT CHANCE.Save your time &amp; money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wonders why people hated this book. Well, you have only to read the more articulate dissenting opinions. Scroll down, read the one and two star reviews. Ignore the vicious, personal attacks and concentrate on the criticism of the writing, the inconsistancies and anachronisms, the shameful copout at the end. Do these things, then save yourself the price of the book and read it at the library for free. If you come away thinking this was Harris' best effort, if you still think that you like it, go buy it. Support Harris. Here's what he thinks of you: &quot;Oh well, at least you people continually buy my book and financially support my self-gratification. Thanks!&quot; I think Amazon intentionally seeds these reviews with &quot;ringers&quot; that balance out the negative comments. After all, if a book gets a well deserved One Star, like Hannabal, they won't sell as many copies."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not sure why the reviews of many people are so negative; is it that we don't want the ending we read? Is it that we can't understand the depth of character which Harris has taken with Starling and Lecture? Come on!! It was great! I love a book or even a movie with an ending that makes you say &quot;HMMMMMMM&quot;.

Harris has made a mind bending sequal to &quot;silence of the lambs&quot;. It was a page turner from page one with an ending that will shock all who reads."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It took me a while to decide the reasons why this book was disapointing, aside from the uneven, cluttered plot which smacked more of sequelitis, what was missing was the puzzles. Silence of the Lambs was filled with little brain teasing puzzles frequently of the excessively macabre fashion. This time out, there's lots of talk about Classical literature, art &amp; gourmet cooking, but no puzzles. The result feels like when I read Michael Crichton's Lost World; A forced sequel rather than one that improves on the original."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't know about everyone else (apparently we have some heavy critics around here) but I find this book to be a serious work of art! Literature has finally found a thriller it can respect. At least, so I imagine. I love the book. I hope for a fourth!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Umm, 'Hannibal' is an attempt at satire, right?In 'Silence of the Lambs' Clarice tries to ask Lecter what was it that made him the way he was and Lecter replies,&quot; Nothing happened to me, I happened.&quot; It seems that in 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs' there is an aversion by Harris to define Lecter's character. However,in 'Hannibal,' Harris not only defines Lecter's character but turns it into a cliche, like some 'Dracula or mad scientist' type from a 1950's horror film.And on top of that, there is the scene at the torture exhibit, where Lecter's real facination isn't with the exhibit but with the people's faces while viewing the exhibit. The 'exhibit' scene coupled with a few comments reminiscent of the movie 'Seven', suggest that Harris is saterizing the public's facination with violence.Now, assuming that Harris knows what he is doing, he must be doing these things on purpose. Ironically, in lieu of Stephen King's review, he seems to be doing what the writer from 'Misery' was trying to do before meeting his 'Number one fan'. So, I'm not sure we are suppose to like his book? And if you do then maybe you don't get it? I'm not sure I do?Either way, Harris does write beautifully, I read the book in one sitting. And, if he did go for the satire, &quot;Misery&quot; angle, then he's got a lot of guts, too."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've been waiting for this book since I first saw Silence Of The Lambs, and the result is definately worth it. Obviously, from some of the other reviews posted, this is not an opinion shared by all.I can see why, though, because this book is difficult, literate, and winding. It requires thought, time, and a wonderfully developed sense of irony to &quot;get&quot;; things that readers looking for a carbon-copy, cinema-ready rehash of SOTL wouldn't have given it anyway. This book is a unique work of art on it's own, and needs to be appreciated as such.That dosen't mean it's perfect, and many of the complaints are valid(wandering plot, some pointless characters), but not all of them, especially those about the ending! Come on, guys! You can't honestly admit you didn't see something like that coming, in some way, from the Lecter/Starling relationship since the beginning. Yeah, it was creepy, disturbing, and a bit revolting, but isn't that the point. It definately did not &quot;betray the characters&quot;, like many have suggested, but, at least to me, seemed like a natural progression of events. HANNIBAL is is a great follow-up to SOTL, and will make an equally great movie. I only hope the original cast(esp. Jodie Foster and Sir Anthony Hopkins)is involved, and that the screenwriters and director have the courage to film the story as written instead of pandering to &quot;traditional Hollywood&quot; tastes. Whatever they do, I'll be eager to see the finished product, just like I was this time around. Hopefully the results will be as amazing!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hey....I thought I wanted another Francis Dolarhyde or Jame Gumb and that would have been just great, but this is a fine book. Thomas Harris gives the reader much to enjoy, see and think about through this tour of Dr. Lecter's mind and world. For the readers that did not like the ending (I did like it), it is a situtation that could change in an instant. Perhaps it already has. I know I'll be there for the next Thomas Harris offering."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Reading through the comments before adding my own, I'm struck by the outrage expressed at Thomas Harris'having dared to transform that nice Clarice Starling from the smart, if conventional, reassuringly sexless heroine of Silence of the Lambs into a far more complex character. You'd think another girl sleuth, titian-haired Nancy Drew, had totalled her roadster DWI. Is it worth pointing out that Clarice is not in fact the wholesome Jodie Foster; she is the terrifying Thomas Harris?Clarice/Harris - like Jame Gumb before them - seem to be in full metamorphosis. &quot;Hannibal&quot; must be the transition from the caterpillar state. I'm guessing it's an intermediate book and, being a gambler, I'd wager Harris has another finished manuscript in a drawer somewhere. Maybe Harris wanted with this novel to rid himself of the expectations of readers looking for the literary equivalent of a slasher flick. In so doing, he has pulled a fast one of Lecteresque proportions on Hollywood. Unless Lecter's theories on the reversal of time are correct (in which case Luis Bunuel will shortly be rising from the dead), a film adaptation seems unlikely - though I do feel like I should pay royalties to Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins for already having lent their faces and voices to &quot;Hannibal&quot;.At the end of Amazon reviews, there is always that &quot;if you like books by X, you'll love books by Y&quot;. James Ellroy and Ed McBain are mentioned. Ellroy and McBain ? The only suspense writer I would compare Harris to would be Patricia Highsmith with her seductive moral ambiguity. And, of course, to his and Highsmith's fellow Southerner, the thriller-loving Flannery O'Connor whose black comic imagination Harris can rival. If &quot;Mademoiselle Starling, c'est Harris&quot;, then I would add Flaubert to that list (Harris always finds &quot;les mots justes&quot;) and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; de Maupassant (Harris' soulmate in bloodcurdling irony). Perhaps it is only coincidence that &quot;Hannibal&quot; is evocative of &quot;La l&eacute;gende de St. Julien l'Hospitalier&quot;. Like Flaubert's saint, flawed seemingly beyond redemption by a bloodlust that can never be satisfied, &quot;Hannibal&quot; finds its resolution in the most sensually oneiric, sexually explicit (and gruesome) happy ending since Flaubert's.Into what species will that nice Clarice Starling be incarnated - butterfly or death's-head moth ? Thomas Harris, you tell me. Please."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal Lecter as a well-funded Narcissus wandering through life admiring beauty? What? The few original ideas that show up in this book are quickly invalidated by rampant absurdity, and the entire thing quickly degenerates into unconnected and awkward confusion. The ending is ridiculous - I was sure I would turn the page and find a 'Just Kidding, here's the real ending' in enormous bold print.Do not read this book. I read a bunch of these reviews while halfway through the book, and was skeptical of everyone that didn't like it. This book is truly bad."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I generally enjoyed the book, I was disappointed in the ending. I can not believe that Starling would join Lecter as a cannibal. The dinner scene was particularly unbelievable, unless you believe that Starling was then insane (perhaps I missed this point?)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The Great Undying Monsters of film and literature are mostly the products of the Victorian era as seen through the lenses of 1930's Hollywood. Almost all vampires descend from Bram Stoker, via Universal Studios. Most Werewolves and other changers owe their existence to Robert Louis Stevenson's Mr. Hyde. The Mummy (and all other tomb crawlers) descends from the spectacular stories of H. Rider Haggard and his ilk.There are a few more recent creations, but they lack the echoes of their Victorian and Edwardian elders. H.P. Lovecraft created an entire new world of Horror, and others have been playing in it ever since, but his vision is distinctly Victorian in tone, and never caught on much outside of the subculture of Science Fiction Fandom. Godzilla was something new under the sun, but rapidly degenerated into Tag Team Wrestling in rubber suits.Hannibal Lecter may well be different. Over the course of three books Thomas Harris has created a monster that fits the obsessions of the modern era as well as Dracula and Mr. Hyde fitted the obsessions of the Victorians. The horror of Hannibal Lecter is not that he eats peoples' bodies (although that surely violates the modern health obsession) but that he is a psychotherapist and entertains himself by consuming peoples' MINDS. To the therapy ridden culture of modern America what could be more disturbing than a monstrous therapist?The latest book, HANNIBAL, is the most surreal of the three in which Dr. Lecter has appeared. It is a much darker world even than the one Harris showed us in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Like the movie SEVEN, this is a deeply disturbing work and it does NOT have a happy ending.Whether it is a well written book is irrelevant. Stoker's DRACULA is horribly written, but contained elements of such power that it became a classic anyway. TARZAN is a piece of the cheapest Pulp, but the character remains one of the great archetypes. Regardless of what future generations may make of Harris's writing style the power of HANNIBAL is impossible to ignore. Unless future generations completely forget the uneasiness of having a mental health professional crawling around in their heads the character of Hannibal Lecter is destined to immortality as surely as that of Dracula.If you liked SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, you owe it to yourself to see the full blossom of the Lecter character. If SILENCE disturbed you, HANNIBAL will do so even more. If you are not prepared to take a walk into hell, DON\\"T READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"All this blah blah blah about how Hannibal is not not as subtle or serious as the first two books. How many serious crime novels do we get every year compared to the number of Grand Guignol masterpieces like Hannibal? And buried beneath it all is sly satire of American blood lust and our fascination with characters like Hannibal. This novel is to modern horror what &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was to westerns. He gives us exactly what we wanted in the back of our dirty little minds when we bought the book, then stands back and lets us see how silly and weird it all is.

I do not understand the poor reviews of this novel. While reading a novel readers must put their trust in the author. This novel was not what I anticipated but it was still great.

I reccomend this novel to anyone who is willing to let Mr. Harris take them on an unforgetable journey."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unfortunately, it may take you 10 years to finish it. That is, of course, if you wish to have a complete understanding of Thomas Harris's minute' of references. Harris delves deeply into the mind and mood of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, far deeper than the reader wants or needs or perhaps, can tolerate. It is a fascinating work in terms of the painstaking research that Harris has done. However, it will leave the above average reader of this genre wondering why he would reach so far in his need to explore Lecter's artistic side, when almost everyone pangs for, but doesn't quite receive, a closer look at the evil that Lecter is so expert at providing. Retribution of evil against evil leaves the reader a bit on the sidelines, offering no real protaganist to root for. One might argue that Clarice represents that character, but her fate and loyalities are left translucent. In the end, the reader is left with too many unanswered questions, an interesting way to set up the trilogy, let's just hope we don't have to wait 10 more years for our questions to be answered."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

The improbable, far fetched ending left me witha very unsatisfying feeling as I concluded the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a disappointing ending. Absurd. Harris flirts with the psychological background of Lecter but never gets there as in Red Dragon. The investigative work of Clarice I liked and some of the antics of Lecter but the &quot;relationship&quot; at the end of Hannibal was just beyond belief. How does one bring a monster together with the monster catcher? You can't, not possible. They are both just as intense at the extreme opposite ends of the spectrum. Francis and Reba form one of the most intriguing relationships in literature: the Monster and a woman who could actually love him (Red Dragon). It's hard to believe Harris wrote both books. The Hannibal dinner scene is incredibly twisted and vicious beyond all limits a la Lecter -- except one of the &quot;willing&quot; participants (&quot;More!&quot;) would never have willingly been there. Lecter's treatment of the unwilling guests is nearly as depraved as the re-enactment in the Gacy biography. What's missing is the elegant treatment of question, &quot;Why?&quot; imho No one has come close to Red Dragon for helping us understand where the monster came from. Maybe no one ever will."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book explains a lot of what happened to Dr. Lector in hischildhood. It was written to entertain you as well as enlighten youabout the backgrounds of the characters. Please keep up the good work MR. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a dissapointment. I don't know what has gotten into Thomas Harris' mind, but this book is a disaster. I am not sure how, but I was able to pull through the shallowness of his arid writing and finish it after 4 long weeks of dreadful reading. If I haven't checked the covers, I would have never thought this was the same writer who wrote a classic &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and one of the most supsensful novels of all time, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Save your time, money, and eyes and don't bother with &quot;Hannibal.&quot; It's a boring story, with a shallow plot, filled with one dimensional characters and their cliche monologs. As I thought of Thomas Harris as specialist at &quot;it,&quot; I waited for a page turning, and suprising climax. But once again, he failed at re-reaching the level of a master writing which has propelled his previous two novels to such heights this novel will not even come close to"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was definitely one of the most disappointing books I have read in a very long time. I kept going, waiting to get to the &quot;good&quot; part, but no such luck. I found both Lechter &amp; Starling to be completely unlikable characters this time around -- I had always found Lechter to be quite entertaining before. Much of the gore in this novel was just there for the shock value. And the ending was the biggest letdown of the whole thing. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this, and bought it as soon as it came out. However, I found myself plodding through it, waiting for the ending. Definitely not worth the time or effort."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Of the many books I've read this summer, this is by far the worst-and I've read some bad ones!Harris basically strings together as many gross-out scenes as he can think of, capping it off with the worst, most improbable ending of any &quot;best seller&quot; that I have ever read. Trapped on a long flight to Thailand with this book was like listening to someone in the seat next to me dragging their fingernails across a chalkboard the entire way.If this were the first book of the trilogy, no one would care about parts two and three. Save your money. Wait for the movie and hope they change the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I took this book to the beach with me this summer. Thank goodness I also took another book. The snobbish tone of the writing, coupled with the long-snouted man-eating pigs clashed like a Bordeaux with a Big Mac -- oops -- there I go, sounding like the king of all Cognac snifter sniffers, Thomas Harris. Then the ending. What can I -- or anyone -- say about that? This is a rediculous book that I pray never gets made into a movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I disagree with many readers who found this book to be a disappointment. I have read all of the books in the series, and I loved this one. I found myself unable to put it down. As for the ending, I found it to be bizarre, but that is exactly why I liked it. It was different than anything I had anticipated."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It seems many readers hyped the book as a sequel to the movie. This is not literature and it is not Jody foster-straight and vulnerable. As a stand alone popular novel it is a quick summer read. Give reading a chance-let the author write it his way! I enjoyed the characters for what they are and the plot is well-medium well."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Saw the first movie and read the book. Bought this as soon as it came out and read it. It started out well but the ending was ABSOLUTELY unbelievable. Any woman reading this book will probably be very disappointed as it turns out to be written like a man's fantasy. Doubt that Jodie Foster will sign up to do the sequel unless they modify the ending significantly. Too bad - had the potential to be a great book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"OK.. The book was good - the detail was incredible, but the plot was weak, at best. It was a page turner &amp; it did make me queazy, and it did make me root for Lechter to get away from his own villian. But, I had always given Harris credit for creating a truely strong, brilliant female lead character -whoops!! What happened to that. And as far as plot development, I think he needs to go back and read Red Dragon and remember what it's all about."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have bought and read the other books by Thomas Harris and looked forward to this not just for the continuation of the Hannibal Lecter mythos, but for a chance to see how Thomas Harris would handle a book based on this complex character.This character was created by Harris' mind, and comes out of his psyche, and for me, it was fascinating to see how he represented Lecter's mind and motivation. I don't know if you'd call it believeable, but it was very absorbing.I agree with the others who gave it five stars. It's the best read I've had in a long time. If I was wearing a hat, I'd tip it off to Mr. Harris..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;How do you hurt a man who has lost everything? Give him back something broken.&quot;This is the theme of &quot;Hannibal&quot;; the taking and breaking and returning and mending of things. This is not a book for those readers wanting a replay of &quot;Silence&quot; and the haughty competition between Starling and Lecter. And although the relationship between Starling and Lecter is crucial to the story, the story is not about relationships.In many ways &quot;Hannibal&quot; takes the concept of becoming that was exemplified by Jame Gumb in &quot;Silence&quot; and applies it liberally amongst the current characters. Aspects of people that were only seeds in the second book have begun to grow and bud. But it is a solitary process, carefully tended alone. And as each character becomes, she or he follows his or her own personal destiny. Paths may cross or even be shared, but they do not intertwine. Even love is only a projection and not to be reciprocated.This is a fine book, but must be read in its own right. Readers looking only for more of the same will walk away with expectations unmet. They will also have denied themselves the enjoyment of reading the work of a gifted author. Open your mind, forget the movie and enjoy.By the way....it is as exciting and nasty and dank as Lecter's old cell in the basement."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One star is too many and a minus ten is too few..This book could've been truly terrifying and a page turner IF: Mr. Harris hadn't broken two of the prime rules of fiction writing: 1) Show don't tell; and, 2) author intrusion...In fact, he could've gotten the readers to swallow the ending IF he had followed these 2 rules.. readers need to EXPERIENCE this book..and Harris robs us of that chance by always reminding us that we were being told a story..Parts of it were like a guided tour through the rooms of a video role playing game- and contrary to the book jacket, it wasn't really insightful into the mind of Lecter.Clarice makes a 180 degree turnabout...we wonder how..and then find out that it's all within the amazing time frame of 4 days...we don't see or feel her internal struggle..nor is there any indication about how she accepts it as a permanent status..in fact, to be a psychological thriller, this needed to be character driven, and it isn't.As a writer, I think there are two positive things I can say: 1) it's given me courage to get back to the book I'm writing; and, 2) Hannibal is the perfect example for writing teachers to use as a bad example..What does come through in this book is that Harris has made a lot of money. He's cultivated superior tastes and traveled extensively...thanks to his readers..in this book he rubs their faces in it and then talks down to them and practically laughs at them for not understanding certain things..and then in parts, it's like he says &quot; Ok..in case you missed it, here's the explanation for this..&quot; it's demeaning...what comes across is that he doesn't have much of an opinion about readers intelligence.I have this theory that maybe the reason it took him 11 years to write it is because this was the first book he started rather than the third. Maybe he put it down when it was disappointing and he lost his way in the plotting. Then, when he needed material for the sequel, he picked it up but didn't spend much time re-writing it..Hence, the difference in the voicings and sophistications from his previous volumes...Some of his misplaced modifiers scattered throughout the book provided some of the biggest laughs..And, I want to know when they started putting breast pockets in sweat suits (plane scene..) .I had heard that there wasn't much editing being done in the big publishing houses these days, and this book sort of confirms it..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I suppose after all the hype of &quot;Silence&quot; perhaps we expected more from this book. After all what could possible be better than &quot;Silence&quot; and that movie was to die for (ha)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had read the negative reviews here and other places, and was pleased to discover that I disagreed with them in most ways. This book accomplished what I think a sequel should, in that the characters grew in depth and perspective. I had a terrible feeling that some of the characters, particularly Ms. Starling and Mr. Crawford, would be forced into situations that they couldn't recover from; in a sense that turned out to be true. As I read on and on, dread grew that lines would be crossed that couldn't be withdrawn, choices made poorly. Ah, well...it seems these things happen. I don't see that as any sort of detriment; this novel entertained me thoroughly, I will advocate it to others, and I don't in any way feel slighted that the characters didn't go the directions I'd hoped they would...I was interested in the paths they (more or less!) chose. Wonderful reading, and I hope that Mr. Harris is inclined one day to pursue the lives of these people, to the benefit of every reader."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You can't put this book down! It is a real page turner! A thrilling book, which brings you deep into the mind of both Clarice Starling AND Hannibal Lecter"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In Red Dragon Thomas Harris dared to make the monster human. He gave his beast emotions, fears, a past to haunt the human soul. This did not make him any less terrifying, but it didn't make him a pop-culture icon either. In Silence Of The Lambs the good guys all wore white hats and Hannibal was the very portrait of evil. It was a wonderful book, but I always thought the characters lacked complete dimension. It is not always enough to SEE the monster. The need to understand WHY is always in the back of your mind. Hannibal is, in some ways, the best of the three. The monster is present, but flesh and blood. Mr. Harris has once again given his beast a soul. The &quot;good guys&quot; are far from perfect. The &quot;bad guys&quot; are often dressed in shades of gray. I don't think this book will enjoy the commercial success that Silence did because somewhere within, most people NEED the strong clear line drawn between good and evil, right and wrong, black and white. They don't want shades of gray, they don't want the monster to have a familiar face, and Sympathy For the Devil is never going to be their favorite tune."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is one of the most unsettling books I've ever read and I can understand why people who like conventional suspense/horror stories are offended. In those books, the world is put back in order at the end; even Dracula gets staked. Not here. The fact that I was so angry--it kept me up for nights--at the conclusion, in which evil wins as Clarice becomes Lector's most appalling victim and the only other likable character in the novel, Crawford, gives himself willingly to a pathetic death because life holds no promise, is something of a tribute to Harris's art. Two-thirds through the book, it occured to me that Clarice and not Hannibal was his most remarkable creation, a rare and genuine heroine for modern fiction, someone I'd want to read about again. Turning her into a zombie cannibal escort for Lector is hard to take; in some ways, it betrays the reader and the novel itself, not to mention the wonderful Clarice. On the other hand, some of the most macabre set pieces are hilariously off the wall, from the slapstick airplane ride to any scene involving the loathsome Mason to the unbelievable last supper and Clarice's Oliver Twist line. A darker, more misanthropic work I can't imagine. Even Lector, despite numerous protests to the contrary, betrays himself: he lies, disembowling a character he promised not to. It's not a book for the squeamish, to put it mildly. Silence of the Lambs was a chess game that left both kings standing; Hannibal ends within the giant maw of unremitting bleakness. It puts the horror back in horror."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After waiting with great anticipation for this book, I found it to be extremely disappointing. These were NOT the real characters created in Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. The most unbelievable part for me was the final outcome of Clarice Starling's character. I really expected a better story Mr. Thomas. Shame on you for this drivel. We all know you are capable of writing a GREAT story, I just wish you would have."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After waiting for years for another Thomas Harris, It was an incredible let down to read Hannibal. The charactors were not remotely similar to those in Silence of the Lambs, nor was the plot. Many parts of this book were so disturbing, that I had nightmeres."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The pacing is slow towards the beginning, though it gradually picks up until there is a stunning conclusion which managed to surprise me. Hannibal is definitely a must read, but not for those with a weak stomach."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Complete garbage. Thomas Harris is the quintessential hack writer who has duped the public into believing he's actually talented. Not one aspect of this novel is believable, nor is it even interesting. Of all the things he could have done with these characters, he used the most inane plot knowing the lemming-like public would buy it anyway. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would be wise to stay far away from this film project. Starling and Lecter have done 360 degree turnarounds from their previous incarnations. It's all too sordid to even go into---don't buy it or read it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Anyone wonder what's wrong with society? That so many can get so excited for so little is pathetic. The book is slop, cheap and exploitative. The ending is absolutely ridiculous. Harris must be laughing at us."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've read both Silence and Red Dragon multiple times, and like most everyone else, was very eager for this book to arrive. Luckily it only cost me 21 dollars. The book does have its shining moments...showing us a bit more of Hanibal's character. I am surprised that it took 10 years to write this book, it contains nowhere near the detail or researched information that Silence or Dragon does. If you are a die-hard fan of Lecter's character, you should read the book, but dont expect too much. The ending is not that good, and only opens the door for yet another sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, this is my first Thomas Harris book, but I've seen the two movie adaptions countless times. I would say that on one level, if you're expecting the same kind of a read as the prior stories, stop now, think twice, then proceed. the ending which had me shell-shocked The pure genious of it is the fact that it is the perfect demise for his character, and he should have been force fed. What else would be more appropriate for a character so...full of himself? I did miss the psychological suspense of the earlier stories, as whatever fruition it comes to in this story is more or less at an explanatory level, letting us see how perhaps Hannibal became the Cannibal. Disturbing as it is, it still takes some of the mysticism of his character away."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read it in 2 days, virtually non-stop, There are, indeed, some very scary people out there and this book brings them to life"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am more from a Cormac McCarthy, William Faulkner state of mind - when I dabble in horror, I like Clive Barker and the more provincial Stephen King - but I have long been an admirer of Thomas Harris and find myself deeply disturbed by his newest effort.I have little of originality to add to the myriad comments - I did want to touch on his use of the &quot;Shavian second&quot; in the descriptive passages - it's not many authors that could pull it off and I'm not entirely certain that Harris always did, but, then again, he loses no stars for the attempt.The ending that everyone talks about left me feeling disquieted for days. It is unconventional in every conceivable fashion and feels more like Poe than King in its brooding, hallucinogenic-nightmare imagery and insights. It is certainly a reading experience that few have ever matched for me (Klaven's TRUE CRIME, ELLROY's BLACK DAHLIA, McCarthy's BLOOD MERIDIAN and CLIVE BARKERS &quot;In the Hills, the Cities&quot; spring to mind immediately as others that have offered a similar visceral impact) - and on the basis of that alone, it must receive five stars from this nobody in Colorado!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"by these reviews, i gather that Hannibal is not so popular a sequel, but i thought it truly excellent. I had extremely high hopes about the book before reading it, and was not let down. ANYONE who loved Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs should buy this one!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In parts of &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Thomas Harris does what he has done very well in the past: tells a compelling story. For about the first half of the book, I read almost compulsively -- I couldn't put the book down.Then several aspects of the novel began to tell me that, at the end, I would find the book a dissapointment. The new &quot;villains&quot; of the book were resolutely one-dimensional; none of them ever did anything surprising. An attempt at explaining what drove Dr. Lecter ended up, in the end, taking away quite a bit of the mystique of his character. He was much more interesting as a non-human embodiment of evil, as several people in the two previous books had termed him, in one way or another. And the final thing was the realization that Harris was changing the characters -- not for reasons of growth, but so they could fit into the machinery of the plot.And, oh, the ending. (I read the Salon &quot;article&quot;, reprinted at CNN, which manages to give away the next-to-final plot twist IN THE SUBHEADER. If I hadn't stopped there, there would have been no point in actually reading the book, as it gives away most of the rest of it anyways.)Please note, I get the ending; I understand the ending, better than quite a few of the people who have left reviews here. It's quite obvious what has happened, and it is all about control. It just seems like an ultimate betrayal for things to have turned out like that. And, as a capper for an unrealistically-plotted two-dimensional plot like we are served in most of the rest of &quot;Hannibal&quot;, it makes the whole experience very very unsatisfying indeed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A good read until the ending. That was just too much to swallow (pun intended)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Too bad! So many things in life are anti-climatic. It was gruesome, the details actually made me lose my appetite. Yet, there was something very important missing. Harris, such a connoisseur of food understands the nuances necessary for a fine meal. He has wonderful nuances in this book. But what is wonderful seasonings without the actually food? e.g. Where is the plot? Why is there no character development? Why does the reader not care what happens? I cringe to think of a movie being made of this book. I hope Anthony Hopkins does not agree to play Hannibal again. It would be such a waste. The ending! The worse thing EVER! Completely, disastrously implausible. This is the true horror of the book, reading this author trash his characters this way. Why would Harris ever think the ending would work? I gave the book 2 stars because it was not the worse thing I ever read. If your really curious, borrow it from a friend."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It occurs to me that the people who label this book &quot;a huge disappointment&quot; could never truly be satisfied with anything other than a regurgitation of the &quot;Silence of the Lambs/Red Dragon&quot; pattern. That is, a hideous serial killer is turning people into chop suey, the cops are absolutely stumped and so must turn to the evil genius Hannibal Lecter for some helpful/unhelpful insight into the killer's pathology. Instead, Harris did something completely new and startling. He humanized Hannibal, made him fallible, made him something very like Adam from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. In the last ten years, I haven't read anything better or more fun than the chapter in which Lecter is trapped on the airplane with screaming babies and a brat who demands the doctor's &quot;liverwurst sandwich.&quot; Has it occurred to anyone else that the ending is a dream? Hannibal's dream? That doesn't make it any less real, you know. Or horrifying."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you ignore Harris's previous works, the ending would probably work for you. However, having not had the pleasure of removing the frontal lobe from my brain... I read the first two books and felt Harris betrayed his characters. Please God Please don't make a movie. Or, at least wait until I get the lobotomy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you like a fun ride with a bunch of low life sick demented folk, you'll love this book. Not since 'The Stand' have I been so engrossed in a book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Save your money people. A ridiculous story, lame boring characters and possibly the worst ending I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I hope to God they don't waste the time and effort making this crap into a movie"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have never been so disappointed by a book in all my life. Obviously Thomas Harris has been wasting the last eleven years! This book doesn't even belong in the same category with Red Dragon or Silence. Hannibal is pure unadulterated crap written (very poorly) to line Thomas Harris' pockets by perpetuating a fraud on his fans. It reads as though Harris put it down with 100 pages left to go and some poor wannabe author picked up and finished the tale without reading the preceding pages. Don't waste your money or your time, I felt angry and betrayed that I'd wasted mine on this poor excuse for a novel!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My heart goes out to all those who found to their disappointment that Thomas Harris has a mind of his own, and decided to write the book that HE wanted to write, rather than pandering to the wants of his fans.Folks. Please remember. This is the man who wrote Red Dragon, and The Silence Of The Lambs. Few authors living have his grasp of the thriller genre, can create fascinating villains and inventive situations as intelligently as he can. Based on past evidence, Harris knows exactly what he is doing. If this book is unusual, it follows that it is unusual for a reason. Harris must have known that this novel would excite much controversy, and would not necessarily be popular with the horror fan whose idea of literature is Dean Koontz or John Saul. So we have to ask ourselves WHY? Why has Thomas Harris written this book, and what might he be trying to tell us?Remember, people were similarly upset by Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, and later by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Both films were critically maligned upon their initial release, only to be hailed as classics long after better-received, more deliberately popular works were forgotten.I found the book to be gripping, disturbing, rather nauseating, and often grimly funny. I found the ending entirely appropriate, indeed the only possible ending for these characters. So they live happily ever after. Did you expect something different? If the American public insists upon romanticizing homicidal maniacs, we shouldn't blame Thomas Harris for rubbing our faces in it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers about the ending. I've read Harris' other two books about Dr. Lector and looked forward to this one. I enjoyed the background on Hannibal and Harris' writing is top notch. Clarice's career and the infighting at FBI rings true. Crawford, however is just a cardboard image of his former self. I found it fascinating right up to the last chapter. The ending just doesn't match Starling's character."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Of all the ways Harris could have ended this book, the ending he chose is easily the worst. The plot of the book is average, and the book lacks the eerieness and the mystery of the first two books, and in parts of the book, Harris uses Italian prases and then doesn't translate them for you. Early in the book, Dr. Lecter has the same presence as in the first two, but by the end his image is ruined. Harris changes him so much that I wished I had never picked up the book because it has ruined The Silence of the Lambs, and The Red Dragon for me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I believe the book is very good. It is not only very exciting to read (I only had a one hour break from start to finish), but it has more. Harris manages to show, that no person is born good or evil, but the circumstances of our lives makes us the people we are - and more importantly shows that we are able to change. This book is not only thrilling, but gives an exciting glimpse of how human psychology works. Only problem is, that a few minor characters are not believeble."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What happened to Starling? No one in their right mind would give any credence to the plot resolution of this book. I cannot think of a single reason why anyone would read it. Please don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Starling character too shallow while Lechter's character was really expanded upon through his youth and early adulthood. Enjoyed meeting Mason Verger( sick as he is) but I thought the story line was not as deep as it could have gone. It kept me at the edge for a good part of the book , but the ending was easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris really can spin a yarn. One has to wonder how his imagination can conjure up such horrific deeds and acts. One also has to marvel at his command of the subtle nuances of the different classes of people in the world ranging from career government employees to Sardanians to the ultra sophisticated. It really is amazing and I can understand why he might be able to write such a book only every 10 years or so.I could not put this book down, particularly towards the end. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book only got four stars because I was disappointed with the ending. Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling seem to get out of character toward the end. It is still worth picking up. Harris is great at putting disturbing images in your head."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The long awaited sequel seems to be Harris' attempt to live and love vicariously through Hannibal. The narcissistic Hannibal is borish and unbelievable. The few moments of true suspense are few and far between, what should be more rare is the excessive rehashing of Silence Of the Lambs storyline. In the end Harris mearly sets himself up for another book. I will wait for some reviews before shelling out for another example of Harris selling out!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For the first time in my life, I had to put a book down while eating. If/when they make the movie, they'll have to cut about a third to avoid the dreaded NC-17. Terrifying, paralyzing, with a bit of tongue (whose?) in cheek humor. Yet, it begs the question, &quot;We waited ten years for this?&quot; I would recommend it, but not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading this book, I've decided that it was okay...a good time-passer, but definitely not written up to the standards set by The Silence of the Lambs. In exploring the characters of Hannibal and Starling, I feel Harris has not gone in the direction he should have. IN this book, he has turned Lecter into a romanticized lead character and not the epitomy of evil that he once was. Harris tries to explain him as a human being and gives us the background we need as readers to understand him. If I had written this book, I would have left Lecter as he was...not insane really...just someone who plays by a different set of rules. Also, Starling becomes almost a stereotype of her previous character in this book. In closing, this book was an entertaining read. It just didn't go in the direction I would have liked to see it go."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hang-in and get past the first 100 or so pages and you will not be disappointed. Thomas Harris delivers us Hannibal in his finest form, albeit, with a somewhat slow start. If you have a vivid imagination, you should read this book. Be warned though, it is not for the weak of stomach. Find a quiet place and read it slowly in order to digest every word."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was sucked into the story from the onset. A few readers/reviewers previous to me complained about a lack of character development and plot. I can't imagine just what they're talking about. We get an inside look into the sick machinations of a twisted mind; several twisted minds, in fact. The plot is thick and mesmerizing, and very unique. My only contention is the ending...I had a hard time &quot;swallowing&quot; it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I personally found Hannibal very interesting. It led you deeper into the subconcious and phyche of Hannibal Lecter. Although the ending was very confusing I found that it made me think more and you must look deeper into the hidden meaning of the book. Overall I was very very happy with the outcome of this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...in creating this book, by dragging us into Hannibal's inner world, his thoughts and sensibilities, rather than just creating some sort of simplistic movie plot. I think he was able to give us a glimpse of a very remarkable kind of human experience.BTW, have you ever read anything autobiographical by Harris? I have, and I think that Lector speaks for Harris in matters of taste - cerebral, that is - well, you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal's escape and subsequent life of culture, wealth and satisfaction bordered on the absurb. A fantasy if you will. Still, I read this book in one sitting.The end mortified, disapponted and stymied me. No way would the Clarice character developed by Thomas Harris in Silence of the Lambs have allowed her life to take that path."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As an avid reader of this type of fiction, I was incredibly disappointed with the actions of the characters in this book. Harris spends so much time delving into the past of the two lead characters, then ends the book with them acting totally out of the parameters of their past experiences. This made the story that much more fictional instead of scaring you into believing that this could really happen. The ending reads as if a deadline is fast approaching for the author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished this book by listening to the unabridged audio tape. I can't imagine reading it myself, as the taped performance is excellent and brings out all of the characters. The descriptions are beautiful and bizarre. Unlike many of the reviewers here, the ending was one of my favorite parts of the story - it was an intertwining of Hannibal and Clarice - a juxtaposition of insanity and the world, which for these characters became intermingled. The question remains as to Clarice's true mental state, and what she will become with time. Another sequel perhaps?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"And my disposable income. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy! Pigs? Harris must be kidding...I can't foresee this being a blockbuster at the theater."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was impossible to put down. Although a little gory, I truly enjoyed the plot. (I mean, after all, Hannibal IS a cannibal.) I found the end to be delightfully intriguing and the plot was fantastic. Ignore the bad reviews and read it. It blew me away."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Logically Harris would fulfill his mandate only by getting it all more shocking, revolting, terrifying - with each new issue of the series. He does this admirably, principally with the unexpected circumstance that winds up involving Clarice and Hannibal....These books should be unanimously acclaimed. They're faster paced than James Bond and even challenge the coldbloodiness of &quot;American Psycho&quot; and the jovial outrageousness of &quot;A Cat's Full Nine.&quot; This last one, &quot;Hannibal,&quot; is deliciously, painfully clever too. It's subtle but this outcome involving Clarice and Lecter lays on a more ghastly trip than if Verger had prevailed. Think about it. Is there some assurance Clarice won't end up the next day as an entr&eacute;e on a bed of candied yams?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was disappointed with Hannibal. The grisly nature of the book was borderline sickening, and the plot was not involved enough to warrant this extreme violence. I liked the development of the characters in The Silence of the Lambs, but in Hannibal they were bumped off before they could become interesting! The development of the Lecter/Starling relationship and the ending was unexpected and welcome, but at the risk of repeating myself, the modes of dispatch were unnecessarily shocking. Mr. Harris is, therefore, going to have a tough time translating Hannibal into a screenplay the caliber of &quot;Lambs&quot; without allowing it to degenerate into a B-rated horror flick."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Finely crafted,deeply moving: with discomfort, some revulsion, longing and bittersweet.Another reader reviewer stated that they found it &quot;unbearably moving:-so did I. This book is not to be categorized-it is a dark elegy,a gothic meditation in part, but Harris's brilliance takes us beyond category-it is common ( and defensively easy ) to label the &quot;other&quot; as Monster..&quot;they&quot; is us, much to our distress-Dr. Lecter ( it would be rude to call him Hannibal ) and even the thoroughly revolting Mason Verger reside in us and under certain cirsumstances, are born. This is the first book in many, many years that I started to reread the moment I finished it - I wanted to quickly build a new room in my memory palace to place this treasure."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With a deep, almost uncanny understanding of the human potential for evil, Thomas Harris takes the reader on a soul-searing journey. The plot takes many unexpected turns as the story unfolds and the characters evolve in realistic (if not unpredictable) ways. Much more than a sequel, &quot;Hannibal&quot; deserves recognition as a thought-provoking, deeply disturbing story about people we hope to never meet."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a bitter disppointment. The characters are shallow, repulsive and weak. The same can be said of the plot and its outlandish ending. While Mr. Harris' talent can not be disputed, nor his intelligence, I am left to wonder how he, such a brillant man and author, allowed this book to go to print. Bottom line: A tree was wasted."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Run, Jodie!!! Run, Sir Anthony!!! Nay, let not the casting director of &quot;Hannibal&quot; capture you!!!How sad. I loved Red Dragon. I loved Silence of the Lambs. Both were tight, suspenseful, chilling, thrill rides into the world of sociopathic serial killers. Both were difficult to put down, once I started to read. Both had me starting at sounds in the night. Both had me looking over my shoulder, making sure no monsters were sneaking up on me.Hannibal, on the other hand, had me looking at my watch to see if maybe something more interesting was happening somewhere. Anywhere!Mason Verger is a caricature of evil. Hannibal himself suddenly becomes the cannibal with a heart. Well, maybe not. Well, maybe he is. Well, maybe.... Who knows? Who cares? And Clarice -- why, she's just a woman, after all, to be molded by her man into something better. Or is it worse? Or is it just silly?I know why I pre-ordered this book; what I don't know is why I finished it...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First off: I think Harris should be commended for taking such a chance with these characters. They are HIS, after all, not yours, and I see this in every form of entertainment: when a creator turns his/her work in a new and different direction, you end up with wildly divergent fan reaction...as witness the other 400-odd reviews printed here.As for my own opinion of the story, I felt it was flimsier than Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Those books appealed to me more--they were deeper, somehow, psychologically. You really wondered what the hell Graham had gone through to catch Lecter--what it meant to have Lecter in your mind.In Hannibal, it seemed, that everything was spelled out. Maybe I missed something, but I don't think so.That, and the fact that so many passages in this book read more like script treatments or movie scenes, made me feel that this book serves more as a sequel to the movie than the previous novels.Thanks for listening. KK"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A worthy successor to Silence of the Lambs! WARNING: If you don't find Dr. Lecter sympathetic, you probably won't enjoy this book. I loved it! It wasn't quite as gruesome as everyone made it out to be. The ending was really the only way it COULD have ended. I was hoping for it halfway through the book. The changing POV worked really well. Especially when a narrator lets us watch Dr. Lecter,unbeknownst to him, in his most private of moments. The only negative thing I could say is that there wasn't enough of Clarice's point of view after the first few chapters. Thomas Harris has outdone himself!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Silence of the Lambs was really a love story amid all the gore, and Thomas Harris explores these two &quot;star crossed lovers&quot; in the middle of revenge and trechery. This is not the formulaic sequel that most readers are looking for, or will expect. So, be prepared for some unexpected twists. Even without the familiar mystery of Hannible Lecter, it is a satifiying tale. Right up to the ending that begs for about 250 more pages. I hope Hollywood has the guts to make the movie that is written down here. I found myself compelled to Hannible Lecter in the previous books. No matter what you hear in the papers don't miss this one. Dana McDonald"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had to get up and check the locks on the door atleast 10 times before I could make myself believe I didn't actually hear the clink of a wine glass against another glass and the smacking of lips after just a taste of the main &quot;entree&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Here's a quote from the book (p. 127) that says it all: &quot;Now that ceaseless exposure has calloused us to the lewd and the vulgar, it is instructive to see what still seems wicked to us. What still slabs the clammy flab of our submissive consciousness hard enough to get our attention.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The author decides to shift the tone of this novel to that of a social commentary on evil, and in the process makes the characters behave completely unrealistic. That would have been fine if this were a new book with unknown characters; however, the fact that the first two books attempted to use realism as their focus, this book becomes very disappointing. The ending is probably one of the worst endings in modern fiction if you take the first two books into account."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, I rushed out and made a rare hardcover purchase of Hannibal. Having finished it, I feel...icky. Early on there are some great moments for Clarice and Hannibal but overall this book is a big, gross letdown. No, we really don't want to know about Lecter's childhood trauma. We don't want to see Jack Crawford forced into retirement. And what Thomas Harris has in store for Clarice-one of the greatest female literary heroines of the last 20 years-is criminal. The abrupt change in both hers and Hannibals characters in the last 100 pages is ludicrous. I hear David Mamet is writing the screenplay. I only hope he throws away the whole ending and starts over."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Enjoyed the book. The characters have substance. Howver, the ending is disappointing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal Lecter grows more and more fascinating with each book. Those with a sensitive sense of smell should be hanging out at bakeries or perfumeries, not reading great literature. You would probably have missed the whole point of Perfume, as well. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It took me three monthes to finally finish this book.I couldn't bare to pick it up after I had passed the half way mark.It had little suspense,the characters had little or no substance and the story dragged on like a root canal.Harris spent so much time building up to what was supposed to be an epic feast that he left me hungrier than the wild pigs he spent too much time describing.I feel sorry for all the people who have waited years for this book,they were robbed.I usually don't feel so angry after reading a bad book,but all I see is rave reviews for a book that is not deserving of them.The author spends a great deal of time speaking of Lector's &quot;memory palace&quot;,I'm going to wipe it from mine.If Jodie Foster is smart she'll avoid signing up for the film."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I started off really enjoying the book and couldn't put it down. Then around the middle of the book, the part set in Italy, I stopped for about 2 months. I felt that he was trying to impress me with his description of Italy and it's history rather than tell the story. When I finally started again, I moved through it pretty quickly, partially to finish. I found some of the characters, plot and outcome very unbeliveable. Not trying to give it away, I just found it inplausible. I must admit that I did enjoy some insight into Dr. Lector's mind and his past. This understanding, however, did not clear my confusion of certain things and event which might have resulted from unbelievability. Since Since I've heard the first two books are so good, I don't think that &quot;Hannibal&quot; will put me off from reading them. I'm not even sure that I'd see the movie- unless Hollywood drastically changes it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I would have rated this book two stars, except for the fact that it did keep my interest throughout. However, the ending is thoroughly implausible and far-fetched. A book like this should have ended with one gasping for breath, but this one simply trailed away. Another matter I thought disturbing was that Clarice repeatedly turned in information to the FBI, never suspecting that it was being used improperly. It seemed to me that she was too brilliant an agent for that to happen. This book doesn't quite &quot;make it&quot;, and that is a huge disappointment. I hope that Jodie Foster doesn't agree to star in this one, and that Anthony Hopkins changes his mind about appearing in it. That is, unless the screenwriters can rewrite the ending. Not neccessarily with a happy resolution, but a more realistic one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was so intense, I loved it from beginning to end. I wish I would have read the first two, before seeing the movie. I can't wait for the movie to come out for this one, cause I loved the ending"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Of all the sequels I have ever read, this one was by far the worst. Characters so one-dimensional I find my dental floss to be more substantial, a plot and writing style so untrue to the original &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; I never once felt like I was reading about the same characters or even a book by the same author, I couldn't help but wonder if Harris had just been out to make a buck on this one.Hannibal Lecter, who is a fine, fascinating support character, isn't nearly so intriguing when you get too close to him. Clarice Starling goes from being a smart, talented, admirable woman, able to compete well in what was traditionally a man's world and yet retain her femininity to a petted lap dog to a madman. The FBI goes from being a respected organization populated with a few bad eggs but mostly with dedicated people intent on their craft to a front organization for crooked politics.One good thing: &quot;Hannibal&quot; was so removed from the quality of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; that my view of the latter was not tainted. I truly felt as though I was reading a weak parody by a different author; I really did get a lot of laughs out of it, too.Sequels are often disappointing things, and I've found that a good way to tell just how bad it's going to be is by marking the time that has passed between the original and the next chapter (just look at &quot;Star Wars&quot;). Before I even picked up &quot;Hannibal,&quot; I wondered why it took a writer twelve years before he had anything more to say about the characters that populated his first superb book. The answer became clear as I was reading: he really *didn't* have anything to say; he forced it.I like and admire Jodi Foster, and I think Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors around. After his disappointing &quot;Instinct&quot; this past summer, the actor announced that he was going to be much more careful in accepting scripts in the future. I hope he keeps to that promise and give's &quot;Hannibal&quot; a thumbs-down when it finally appears on his desk."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I stayed up last night until 2:30am to finish the last 200 pages-that should tell you something! Although some of this book is hard to believe and at times hard to follow, Hannibal Lecter is one of the great fiends of all time. We root for him from the begining and the (predictable) love story is the only way for the trilogy to wrap up. I must say I can't wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Curious. I remember Mr. Harris saying he was not interested in creating a seqel to 'Silence of the Lambs' when the movie became such a smash hit. And yet, here is this piece of work. As many customers have pointed out, the first part (half? three quarters?)is absolutely brilliant. The man is using all his weapons to suck us in - not just plot, but language,figures of speech, fascinating echos and repitions, literary allusions - a whole bagfull of splendid and intriguing literary devices. This part of the novel is surreal, intriguing and completely compelling. But then, as Harris, himself observes later on -&quot;We are not used to seeing Dr. Lecter free, uncaged and in the world&quot; (or something like that). And we're not. Hannibal Lecter uncaged is a different beast entirely, still fascinating, still odd, but not as creepy and horrifying as the imprisoned, masked, intelligent creature we knew before. Clarice is as splendid as ever, until she comes under the extraordinary spell of the &quot;freed&quot; Dr. Lecter when she also (with the help of drugs and a completely corrupt and ungrateful FBI) changes into something unexpected and (maybe)disappointing to those who loved her ingrained feminist leanings and tendency to examine her own life(with Dr. Lecter's help, of course). I can't decide whether its a brilliant display of an author's independence or a knuckle under to Hollywood to just get it finished. In any case, I would reccomend a clutch of Cole Porter albums to those faithful readers who are a bit confused. It seems the perfect accompaniment to a wonderful yet completely unexpected continuation of the Hannibal Lecter story.A. Causey"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"200 pgs into the story I caught myself skimming. The ending felt like a betrayal. Certainly a novel this hyped would fall short of expectations, but please, Mr. Harris, have some respect for your readers, not to mention your characters. I've thrown the book away so as to never, ever lend this one out with my name attached."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a page turner all right but it fell way short of my expectations. The plot is way out there and Harris seems to be trying too hard to gross everyone out. He throws in a bunch of deep literary and artistic references trying to gain some respect for an otherwise run-of-the-mill thriller. If you didn't already know and love these characters you wouldn't even give this book a second glance. It reminds me of a recent movie sequel set in space.Speaking of movies all the actors from &quot;Silence&quot; should run from this script. As-is &quot;Hannibal&quot; cannot be made into even an average movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I only wish that I could read more books as polarizing and thought-provoking as &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Folks, this is challenging material. It's dark, it's disturbing, it's complex, and it isn't &quot;fun&quot;. However, Harris' work is utterly successful and brilliant.From reading the reviews below, I suspect that most of the one-star ratings come from readers confused with Jonathan Demme's interpretation of Hannibal Lecter versus Thomas Harris'. TH doesn't care his work is cinematic sequel material, and he shouldn't.I could wait a few years before my next literary visit with Dr. Lecter...but if the character still lurks in a future book, I look forward to it....and two years later, I still feel the same way. Great book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mason Verger, a deserving victim of Dr.Lecter's exotic skills, slithers to the forefront as the detestable villain we'd most want to consign to another session in the hands of the good doctor. Verger's millions enable him to buy the help of Clarice's enemy, Paul Krendler. Through Krendler, Verger manages to stay several steps ahead of Clarice as she searches for Lecter who has shown up after an absence of seven years. Whimsically, Dr. Lecter has changed his name to Fell while residing in Florence, Italy. Here a policeman turned Judas meets his fate a la Lecter. Flashbacks reveal the doctor's past psychic wounds. As in Pope's &quot;Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, As, to be hated, needs but to be seen; Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace.&quot; -so do we find our dread fascination with the doctor growing and changing. For Clarice, Hannibal will be either a white knight or the rider on a pale horse. Before we learn which, Clarice foils the horrifying Verger. While some will not approve of the ending, I found it extremely palatable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Add my name to the list of those very disappointed with this book. I rarely take the time to read fiction, but Red Dragon and Silence were impossible to put down, and I was anxious to dive into this one. It's hard to believe that Hannibal was written by the same author--yes, Harris' artistic prose and attention to detail are evident here (including a veritable lesson in Florentine culture), but he forgot to include the suspense, the intricate plot, and the subtle, fascinating character development present in Dragon and Silence. (One point that the 5-star and 1-star reviews seem to agree on is that Hannibal is a departure from it's predecessors, and in this case, that's too bad...) There have been a lot of complaints about the subject matter, the ending, etc., and I agree to some extent. (The weak attempt to explain Lecter's behavior via childhood flashbacks is what one would expect to see on an episode of Oprah...) But the biggest problem with this book is that it's just plain boring for the most part. I suppose that I'll give Harris another chance--given the brilliance of Dragon and Silence--if he pens yet another sequel. As the saying goes, 'two out of three ain't bad'."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like many others, I went into this book expecting a mere sequel to Silence of the Lambs. What a pleasant surprise awaited me! Those who expect more of the same here will be sorely disappointed, but for those who are ready to cover new ground....to explore the depths of human perversity.....this is the book for you. I liked the fact that I couldn't predict where the book was going.......and I LOVED the ending. It doesn't seem at all fantastic or &quot;out there&quot; as other readers have suggested. In fact, it made sense in a demented sort of way. For me, it showed just how supremely evil and intelligent Hannibal Lecter really is, and enhanced his monstrous qualities. Shed your expectations and step into a world full of more monsters than you ever dared to dream of even in your worst nightmares, and king of them all is Hannibal Lecter."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited patiently for eleven years for Thomas Harris to write another book, then one day I see the cover of a magazine telling of the publishing of Hannibal.Being really excited I ordered my copy and waited patiently for the mail to bring it to me.And then I found out I waited all that time for this? This book does not even read like Red Dragon (my favorite)or Silence Of The Lambs.Will Graham does not even seem to exist anymore as he was not even mentioned once.The characters that do return do not seem to be the same people that so excited me before.Mr.Harris does not seem to have written this book with the same detail and intrigue I was expecting.It seems to me that this book was thrown together in a hurry after a vacation in Italy.It seems to have been written in the last year or so ...doesn't it? I am extremely dissapointed in the way Mr. Harris has wasted his fine characters! And by the way .....What is this ending? No way the Clarice from Silence goes along with this ending! Is Mr.Harris destroying this series on purpose?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Being interested in the thriller/horror genre but finding many such titles much too graphic, obvious and/or badly written, I was happy to have stumbled upon Silence of the Lambs (on a remainder table, no less, long before the release of the movie). Mr. Harris' prose is well constructed, and he gave us two memorable characters in the shape of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. Unfortunately, he has ruined both of them in Hannibal. Please--a kinder, gentler Dr. Lecter and Clarice as the Bride of Frankenstein? It's insulting to both, and I particularly dislike the way Clarice's honor is so cheaply bought. I am sure that Mr. Harris is enjoying the remuneration from his latest blockbuster, but I'm sorry to have contributed to it. In the book's favor, I can say that I read it within 24 hours of its purchase and found it enjoyable right up to the time that Clarice and Hannibal revealed themselves to be nothing but a gold-digging ex-cop and a misunderstood sugar daddy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has returned in good form. Hannibal, unfortunately, has not. And Verger is a bad caricature. But the story holds you in there and makes you want to keep reading. I still prefer Red Dragon, and to a lesser extent, Silence. The most incredible psychopath of them all, though, is John Wolf (Prettiest Feathers, and Tunnel of Night). I laughed at parts of Harris. Philpin terrifies me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book is just plain bad. There is none of the behavioral science mystery solving we loved in Silence. Our strong Heroine is suduced by Lecter with drugs and volunteers to spend the rest of her days being his Freudian pacifier, literally. She is like the anti-Clarice and it insults young poor women who work hard. The office politcs is stolen from the X-files and Krendler might as well be the cigrette smoking man. Harris must have needed money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a science fiction/fantasy guy, this is not my usual genre, but it couldn't put it down. Fast moving story that didn't get bogged down. Surprise ending! Still don't know how I feel about that! Would highly recommend to those who enjoyed SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris moved us with Black Sunday. He stunned us with Red Dragon. Then he shocked us all with the Silence of the Lambs. Now that brings us to Hannibal. I have waited for this book to be written and then released. I have dreamed of what Hannibal would do. I had to think how the FBI( C. Sterling, J. Crawford) would do to put Hannibal back to where he belongs. Then I received the book, and I could not put it down for three hours. Suddenly I stopped and put the book down and said &quot;What is Thomas Harris thinking?&quot; I have never been disappointed with a T. Harris book before, now I wonder if he was finally tried of the Hannible concept. He had a chance to write a book that could have thrilled us for a long time and other writers could have admired for a long time. Now I am going to the other writers to find a better story because Hannible was a total waste to me and a big let down for one Thomas Harris long time fan."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I first saw this sequel, I had never thought about whether one was required after Silence of the Lambs. After reading this, I can see why the thought never occurred to me.At first, I was enjoying they story line even if I found it very different from Silence. I must say that suddenly, as the book draws to it's conclusion, I found myself reading about characters I hadn't encounter previously in this novel. Who are those people? Did Mr. Harris suddenly get a new editor? I must say, I had the feeling that Harris had a distinct hatred of these characters, particularly Clarice.I feel as if this was written the way it was to avoid ever having to write about these characters again. Since irreparable damage has been done, please refrain from further descriptions, Mr. Harris. Life is disillusioning enough. I don't need further disappointments in my recreational reading."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ok dont get me wrong it was a good book and all, but in some parts it gets slow. and other times its really exicting. I would say its worth the read, and especially when you get towards the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While the author creates an attention holder as was enjoyed in &quot;Silence&quot;, the story doesn't provide a consistent characterization of Clarice that's believable. As portrayed in this book, Clarice is someone who didn't seem to relate to the character in the previous work. She's someone we don't know. It almost appears that Harris was under some pressure to complete this book, and took what can only be regarded as a cop-out conclusion that leaves the reader wanting more; more of the characterization true to the person of Clarice shown in &quot;Silence&quot;, not of the limp clone that he portrays here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After I read this novel I decided to reread RED DRAGON, because of some of the references to it. It has been years since I read it and while rereading it, I was convinced of a feeling that started with HANNIBAL. This is not so much a story of Hannibal Lector, but an indictment concerning our justice system today. In RED DRAGON, everyone was working together to get the Tooth Fairy/Red Dragon. By the last book, everyone is at each others throats with greed, power, and revenge the only motivating factors. The old time policmen are gone with only the sycophants left."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After devouring the Red Dragon and Silence, I could not wait for this book....what a disappointment. No wonder Jodie Foster turned down the role. I respect her even more after that decision. I rarely feel that I wasted my time reading a book, usually no matter how awful it may be, it's better than sitting and watching sitcoms. However, I want my time back after reading this mess. Harris took the sensationalized parts of Silence and made the whole book gore and an Italian advertisement for tourism. He forgot to bring back the psychological, &quot;behavioral sciences&quot; portion that we all loved from Silence. If a movie gets made from this, it would be like any other teen slasher movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a major disappointment. I should have known betterthan to buy and read it especially after perusing the plotline revelations online, but when I read Silence of the Lambs curiosity got the better of me so I went into Hannibal with low expectations and it was even worse than what I had expected. It's unworthy as a novel let alone a sequel to a brilliant book and movie. I pray this never gets turned into a screenplay with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins signing on. Thomas Harris can surely do better than this it's just a shame that this is how it all turned out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has taken a strong fictional women's character and reduced her to mush. In Silence of the Lambs, Starling was a fighter, a role model. She took her licks but came out alright. In this book she is a helpless little victim who completely sells out. The plot is absurd. The ending is a disaester. Someone needed to throw a book together quickly, and get PAID..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While there are some pages full of tingling suspense, this book is more than disappointing. I don't cringe at violence and &quot;gross moments&quot; (and there were plenty in both &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;) when they help tell an enticing story, but in &quot;Hannibal,&quot; I got the impression Harris was just showing us nastiness for no reason other than the &quot;shock and buck&quot; factor. I didn't *need* to know why Hannibal is the way he is, but if I were going to be told, I'd like more of an explanation of the causalities than were given. The end: bizarre and cheap. Like so many other fans, I would have preferred to see a &quot;new&quot; story that perhaps drew on old characters rather than this drivel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With his new book Hannibal, Harris again takes us on a complex tour of the mind and life of Hannibal Lecter. This is not a comfortable place to visit and the book is not for the faint of heart. Lecter has been free from the prison for the criminally insane for 7 years. Clarice Starling, still with the FBI, still wants to find him. But so does someone else -- Lecter's 6th victim.Hannibal is not a simple story of the battle between good and evil. Often, it is the battle of evil vs evil, where one madman uses the greed of others to hunt down the cannibalistic doctor who tortured him. (Told you it wasn't for the faint of heart.)However, what impressed me the most is the complexity of Harris's writing, his craftsmanship and use of language. There is depth and texture to the writing that adds layers to the story and compells the reader to keep turning pages, even when the subject matter is its most gruesome."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read some of the other readers comments and one of them suggested that the people who gave this book 1 or 2 stars were simply not intelligent enough to understand how wonderful this book is. So let me begin by stating that I am a member of MENSA (the High IQ society). My IQ ranks me in the top 1% of the country. I thought the book was awful! The whole part that took place in Italy was boring and the ending was ludicrous! No I didn't expect it to be just like Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon which were both excellent but I did expect it to be a good book. It wasn't."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Again another example of too much hype. Silence of the Lambs was an outstanding book, but sadly Hannibal does not even compare to that creepy masterpiece. The book starts off at a breakneck pace, but the second half of the book just left me confused, and unfufilled. I kept thinking that this was not the Lector that I had enjoyed so much in Harris' previous books. The ending in my opinion is a total cop out, and seems totally implausible, and thats all I'll say about it. In closing read Red Dragon, and Silence, but stay away from this one!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was bitterly disappointed with this book. After waiting so long to read it, it seemed to be a rush effort by an otherwise good author. It seems that Harris has been pressured into writing this sequel and unfortunately as it is often said some things are better left alone. Who didn't wonder in amazement as Lecter walked off towards his next victim at the end of Silence of the Lambs. However, the major problem here is what could have been an explosive book, will fail to satisfy. I will not give away the ending but it will be said that the words weak and pathetic spring to mind. As I did, you will wonder why you stayed up all night to find that in the last 100 pages explosive has turned out to be nothing but a fizzle. Harris has proven himself in the past with his other books but I would give this one a real wide birth unless you a huge fan. Dont expect to hear any screaming lambs in this one. If they are screaming it is in pain knowing that the much anticipated sequel just did not do them any justice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Once again Harris takes his audience on an unexpected ride. For those looking for another &quot;Silence&quot; this may disappoint...but for those who want to travel with Lecter on his Witkin-esque journey it's quite a treat. Filled with bizarre characters and a mounting tension it will keep you waiting 'til the last pages to see what fate has in store for dear Hannibal and Clarise."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This part of the three part series digs into realms of the truly insane. I enjoyed the book more toward the end. Got lost a little in all the Italian, and I think it was a little too &quot;classy&quot; for us regular folks, but I'm not sorry I read the book. The ending is the best part. Part four coming up? I hope so."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris gets it right again - how else could I almost love a cannibal, whose sense of order is so precise and whose taste so divine? Different than the others in a more mature way, certainly not any more violent, and somewhat more lyrical. Very good."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It might look like the ludicrous caricature that turns out to be the main villian in this book. It even comes complete with a set of inept henchmen, an unnnecessarily complex lesbian, and an even more unnecessary shower scene.To the book's credit, it was a super-fast read and was highly entertaining. However, it was riddled with spelling and grammar errors, sloppy flipping in tenses, and incomplete sentences! AAAUUUGGHHH!!AS FOR THE ENDING...well, I am still out to lunch on it. However, I can't deny that it has stayed foremost in my mind since the moment I shut the book. It may be wierd, but it is definately haunting, and isn't that what you look for? Something that will stay in your mind whether you want it to or not?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have to admit that the fact that this novel, especially its *glorious* ending, is not everyone's cup of tea, only further whets my palate and assures that Harris is unmatched as a purveyor of the darker psychology of humankind.If you saw more in _The Silence of the Lambs_ than a highly entertaining Suspense novel, if you read between the lines, then _Hannibal_ is certain to leave you utterly satisfied. If not, buy a Patterson or Cornwell novel and go at it. Consider that this novel took Harris approximately 3,000 days to write. Consider that he does not, as is the unfortunate vogue amongst most popular authors of the day, pump out a book every quarter year. This is an author who not only cares very passionately about what he publishes and the myriad details thereof, but has a very -particular- vision he's trying to express to you, the reader. I was moved, I was made to think and look inward, and I could simply not be more satisfied by this work, which is certainly the last we shall see of Dr. Lecter.Because you know, after reading that astounding finale, I think he's sated now too."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING. DETAILS WERE PERCISE AND THE FLOW WAS EXCELLENT. HAVING NEVER READ THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, I HAD NO TROUBLE FOLLOWING ANY PART OF THE STORY. HANINABAL IS A FRIEGHTING CHARCTER FULL OF FURRY. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR ALL SUSPENSE FANS. I LOVED IT."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs scared and delighted me, Hannibal bored and irritated me. What could Mr. Harris have been thinking? I plodded through the book and felt like someone looking at a bad accident out of morbid curiosity. I should have given up when my instinct told me to."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris crafts another fine tale, with reprises from his most colorful characters: Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter.It seems that public opinion of this book falls in one of two diametrically opposed camps: &quot;I loved it&quot; and &quot;I hated it&quot;. This is somewhat surprising, given the book's similarity in terms of descriptiveness to Silence of the Lambs, a book (and film) which enjoyed unprecedented success and critical acclaim in this genre.The sticking point, it seems, which separates these two camps involves the highly contentious ending. Without spoiling this for potential readers, suffice it to say that it invokes a stretch of imagination.Harris's mind is clearly in another world entirely (this man scares me), making his well-researched and well-referenced style entracing. What's not to like?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I felt that Hannibal in a lot of respects was, in fact, better than Silence Of The Lambs, if not for the fact of being on a psychological rollercoaster all the way through the book. It's a very difficult book to put down, I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I felt that Hannibal in a lot of respects was, in fact, better than Silence Of The Lambs, if not for the fact of being on a psychological rollercoaster all the way through the book.

The ending was ingenious. I can't wait for the next book!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I feel Mr. Harris tried his very best to be outrageously decadent. He succeeded in making his book an outrageously funny black comedy. His other books were very suspenseful and daring with one of his characters being canabalistic. This time that roll was given to the pigs. I feel this story went over the edge and had no redeeming qualities, not even the pretense of an art history major who just returned from his first visit to Italy. Mason Verger and his sister were both totally unbelievable characters. I do think the ending was very weak and was only there to leave the door open for the future little hannibal cannibals. Sorry Tom, I think you got too greedy with this one and just rushed it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is one of the worst books I've ever read. I couldn't put Silence of the Lambs down; conversely, Hannibal is so gratuitously graphic and revolting that I had to put it down numerous times. A major disappointment. Don't waste your time and money on this one. Too horrible for words."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There is not much I can say regarding the book, other than I coulnd't have done it better. Bravo for harris. I myself would love to portray clarice in theis sequel!!!! A definite must read.Thank you for a great piece of art."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As I was reading this book I was reminded of musicians that have lost their magic and try to over-compensate by hiding behind way over-produced recordings. I did enjoy learning a bit more about what drove Dr. Lecter, but was generally unexcited about everything else. I couldn't put his other books down, this one took me two weeks to plod through."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is mezmorizing, as usual. I feel Starling's character could have been developed better, the ending was disappointing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm embarrassed for Mr. Harris that he has concocted such a bunch of drivel and called it a novel. While he's laughing all the way to the bank I'm going to toss my half-read copy of HANNIBAL into the lake and invest my time in reading some of the GREAT new novels out this summer, like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and STONES FROM THE RIVER, and MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and BAG OF BONES."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"They might have stopped him from releasing such a completely dumb book. Where 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence' were so beautifully crafted, this time out Mr. Harris seemed to be just racing a deadline. But he does have our money now, doesn't he? And he's set up for another lame sequel. And the ending? Are you kidding? Just think of 'Melrose Place' if it were on cable.Yuk."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Save your time and save your money.This book is a total waste. It has no real purpose and no real ending. There is the obligate sceens of sadism and canabilism. They serve no real purpose. Shame on the author. At the end of the day, I really felt cheated."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't understand the people who look down on this singular piece of work. It is exquisitely macabre, disturbingly nightmarish, challenging one's mind to the limits of realistic violence. A certain level of open-mindedness is needed to appreciate the grotesque, but all-too-human decisions of the characters. Like the audience in the gallery of Torture instruments, we crave, yet in public tend to shy away from the wicked and perverse. Here Harris presents it to us in the face, conjuring such repressed, corrupt feelings it becomes unbearable. I can see no other way to end the saga which had made a lot of people clamor for graphic subconsciously-ingrained violence, than be slapped with this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"a very real and accurate recreation of Hannibal's character exists in this novel. You think Silence of the Lambs had uniqueness in terror? You have to experience this to believe it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Another great story from Tom Harris. This is one of the few books I had real difficulty putting down. Harris is a master at keeping the reader turning pages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was worth the 10 year wait to read HANNIBAL-Thomas Harris did not just write a sequal to Silence of the Lambs, and Red Dragon-he enlarged the characters-I loved the ending, it made perfect sense to me-I waited till I was all alone and not distracted to finish the book-I wanted to find out how it ended, but I knew that -then-I may have to wait 10 more years-to hear from Mr. Harris again. The Barney/Margot relationship was important to the plotline-, I did not find it &quot;superfluous&quot;-Barney was involed with Dr. Lecter for years as his caretaker in the asylum. Yes, the book is gruesome, not for the squeamish, Verger is one SICK person-as is Carlos, and his group--Paul Krendler,well, the way he treats Clarice, I will not give anything away, but I was most satisfied with Lecter's solution for him-he is a &quot;character&quot; that treats women like &quot;things&quot;. I can't wait for the movie-I hope that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, and Demme will agree to go for it. A must read!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Does anyone else have the feeling that --in spite of the 10+ year wait-- Harris just whipped off this book in the last few months (even setting aside the allusions to Clinton's impeachment &amp; trial)? In short, &quot;OK&quot; is how I guess I can best sum up _Hannibal_. &quot;OK&quot;, that is, if we forget the 10-year wait since the last book; if we forget the silly dud of an ending; if we forget the slow, drawn-out, meandering waits between incidents in the plot; if we forget the repetitive, tiresome lectures on wine, italian art, gourmet foods, etc. All right; I'm as avid a Harris fan as anyone. I read the book, and I'm glad I did. But still... this was a lot of wait for very little pay off."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is almost impossible to judge this book by standards used for other books. By those standards it is a horrible book in which the author betrays his reading audience in a myriad of ways. Many of the reviews by readers in this section reflect just that reality. The first third of the book is overwritten, the second long and irrelevant, and the third - with its unusual ending - a betrayal of the characters we came to love in Silence of the Lambs. In spite of this I found the ending to be highly disturbing and had to ask myself if in fact the author intended to disturb the reader in just this fashion. It stimulates thought that doesn't easily end and that is uncommon in ANY book these days. Buy it but be forewarned the book is not like anything you are expecting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I applaud Mr. Harris on this fine novel. While it has a few flaws, notwithstanding, I found it to be tremendously enjoyable. The book lives up to its tremendous hype, but I wouldn't rate it among the classics by any means."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What exactly made Carlos' head so &quot;malodorous&quot;? This phrase was used at least 5 times. Verger actually said &quot;She can't prove she didn't do it&quot; two or three times. It reminded me an assignment in creative writing where you had to use as many cliches as possible. The story was all right, but could have been much better if Harris would have deigned to allow his precious work to be edited. It is inventive and fresh to create new metaphors that really bring the reader in to the story. It is annoying though when one thinks so highly of their newly coined phrases to keep using them over and over..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is a master at creating and building tension. &quot;Hannibal&quot; contains memorable scenes, with writing and research one can savor and appreciate again and again. Having said this, I must add, however, that the concluding chapters of &quot;Hannibal&quot; were somewhat flat -- like a disappointing dessert at the end of a fine meal. Perhaps I should read them again to uncover additional messages I missed the first time. In the demise of Paul Krendler, Harris may have deliberately withheld the satisfying irony in the details of a first-person glance at his &quot;capture,&quot; which dilutes some of the poetic justice and disturbing &quot;ripples&quot; provided in other riveting scenes, and in his other books, for that matter. Why? What has happened to Clarice? Harris keeps us at arm's length, and without her iron threads of narrative to guide us at the end, we are left without a strong incentive to keep us thinking. I truly hope Harris doesn't wait another 11 years to release his next work, but this time, I hope he leaves Lechter and Starling on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mr. Harris' first two books in this 'series' seemed to be examinations of the criminal mind and how an investigator uses evidence and intuition to stop psychos. This book reads like a digusting apologist screed for the indefensible actions of the 'hero' Lector. Mr. Harris is an excellent writer. However this story is strained in the sense that all the characters are weirdos. I understand that examinations of ordinary people do not a bestseller make. I do not understand why even minor characters must be given digusting quirks. This book is enjoyable. I garner some enjoyment reading about the flakes that the world can produce. The ending and the resolution of the relationship between Starling and Lector is obvious and possibly the worst of all possible endings to this story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has crafted another monster in Mason Verger; genuinely evil with no redeeming qualities. Although his sister Margot's role is predictable, her character is complex and tinted with moral shades of gray. The author guides the reader through several tours of Dr. Lecter's &quot;memory palace&quot;, where elegance and culture disguise the septic tank beneath. Harris gives Hannibal a motive; but vacillates between maintaining Lecter's evil status or humanizing him. Harris doesn't seem to know quite what to do with the character of Barney; initially making him a player in the plot, then abruptly erasing Barney until the end. Starling continues her role as the driven FBI agent battling her own personal demons, until the author unravels her moral fiber in the disappointing, implausible ending to this book. The final few pages have the effect of an author trying for shock value while meeting a publication deadline. A disappointing work from a talented author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've enjoyed previous books written by Thomas Harris, but this one was truly disappointing. I loved the &quot;chase&quot; of Hannibal across the continents, but I was stunned by the ending. I kept reading thinking, &quot;this must be a dream sequence.&quot; Did someone else write the ending to this book? The author can't possibly claim to know his characters as their actions, particularly Clarice Starling's, in the last few chapters are completely unlike them. Please don't even suggest another sequel!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After having read &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, I was looking forward to &quot;Hannibal&quot;.I enjoyed most of the book, mainly because I liked the detail Mr. Harris goes into describing the characters and the situations. I was very disappointed in the conclusion of the book, it was just too hokey of an ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Despite the gore the book is actually quite boring. The ending is implausible in the extreme. I know of no combination of drugs/dreams/psychotic breaks that the characters could have that could make this ending seem real."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was nowhere near as good as his other books -- in fact, it's hard to believe it's the same author. And the ending is insulting to his readers who have waited ten years for the sequel. I hope they don't bother making a movie out of this one. I can't imagine Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins starring in it, as the quality is substandard."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal's character is well developed in this new novel by Thomas Harris. Hannibal is not as terrifying as in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; he is nontheless gruesome. Hannibal dispenses his brand of high intellect and cold murderous ways with the same detachment. Clarisse is another matter. Harris details the attraction of Hannibal to Clarisse and her similarity to his sister. Yet, what brings Clarisse to join him in the end? This is an excellant read! I finished it in one sitting. A Real page turner and highly recommended. Appropriately, chapter 100's gruesome meal prepared by Hannibal Lecter is forever unshakeable from my memory!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The media having leaked the news that Jodie Foster had declined the offer to revisit her Clarice Starling role, I was a bit wary of reading the book. I don't feel this was written as well as &quot;Silence...&quot;; I found myself just skimming entire paragraphs because I was bored. I agree that Verger is almost more of a demon than Lecter, and his behavior with the visiting child drew loathing...at least Lecter didn't mess w/children's minds. I was terribly disappointed with the ending - I don't blame the classy and intelligent Ms. Foster for saying &quot;No thanks!&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just finished reading Hannibal. Where to begin? First off, the author Thomas Harris has not lost the ability to engage the reader with his page-turning stories. The book reads like a worthy companion to Silence of the Lambs, but not quite as good. That said, it's obvious from reading the book that Harris has an avid love of the research he incorporates in this story. You get the feeling he visited Florence and fell head over heels in love with it and spends an entire section of the book praising its every nuance to the point of nausea. He doesn't devote nearly this much detail to other locales depicted, even though they take up more pages and story than Florence does. Another thing that's ... irksome is you can SO picture him reading about the concepts of &quot;memory palaces&quot; and then deciding that's how Lecter's mind should operate (which is another thing : did we really have to know THIS much about him? I liked it better when all we got were frightening glimpses of Lecter's world, not his life story). The other characters in the book are more or less solidly written. There is a very funny moment involving Barney (from Silence) and Margot Verger (the real villian's lesbian sister) in a shower scene. Some of their fates are unbelievably horrifying, but most everyone gets what they deserve in the end. Except for Clarice Starling. I can see why the director talked with Harris and is now changing the ending of the upcoming movie (Feb 2001). Clarice, like it or not, became too much of a role model for her fate to be depicted as such on the big screen. I wouldn't have minded if Harris had gone further and more perverted than what he did write concerning her. But it's too harsh for the movie-going populace. Which brings us to Dr. Hannibal Lecter. This is a kinder, gentler sociopath. He doesn't kill or even maim everyone he comes into contact with, just knocks them out as long as they're polite and not trying to capture him. He's a lot more likeable in this book, and that bothered me a bit. This is a bit too much like glamorizing and romanticizing a serial killer. yes, he's actually more like the hero here,and that's ... weird. He's too cool, too debonnair and not nearly malevolent enough to match his old persona. All in all, this book was a good read. Not nearly as scary as Silence of the Lambs, though. The book also had the unfortunate quality of reading like it was ultimately meant for the movies. It reads like a movie (except for the surreal ending) and that may turn off some readers. Still, go buy and read it. Judge for yourself"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you are a wine connoisseur, or if you relate to love stories of hideous, cannibalistic serial killers who elope into the Brazilian night with gunpowder-damask'd ladies (or if you fancy villains who have no flesh on their face--only a goggly eyeball), then &quot;Hannibal&quot; is for you.This book has two meager things going for it: the final, hair-raising dinner scene (no pun intended); and the character Mason Verger. But these items themselves are not worth your 600-page perusal. (They weren't worth mine, anyway.)If &quot;Hannibal&quot; were an architectural structure, it would be a building half-destroyed by the wrecking ball. I find it extremely difficult to imagine any author working years on this story. I think Harris should retire from his profession, and perhaps begin a French catering business.Certainly anytime one entertains ideas or stories of 'Ultimate Evil,' important thoughts are sprung to mind. Hannibal Lecter is (OR WAS) a character that really makes (MADE) us examine certain theodicies and the problem, the phenomenon, of evil. But Harris ran a magic realistic pen through his sketch of Dr. Lecter, and made what had been a fine portrait of the Devil Incarnate into a fuzzy, nonsensical image, that when turned upside-down looks like the Easter Bunny with nasty fangs.I think William Styron's words regarding evil are much more relevant: \\"Real evil is gloomy, monotonous, barren, boring.\\" If you really want to study Evil, I would recommend reading, and then contemplating, Styron's novel &quot;Sophie's Choice.&quot;After reading Harris' &quot;Hannibal,&quot; I am convinced the author is only a pulp populist capitalizing (or perhaps, cannibalizing) on society's fascination with stylized grotesqueness. But what does he care? He has enough money to buy all the truffles and super-charged Jaguars in the world.(I hope Anthony Hopkins can somehow redeem Harris' mess in the film version of the book!)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has done the most amazing thing. He has writtenthe best suspense novel of the 20th Century (Silence of the Lambs) andthe worst (Hannibal). Silence of the Lambs will never be forgotten. Hannibal already has been."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was a big fan of Mr. Thomas Harris since I read Manhunter when I was a teenager. His Clarice Starling from Silence of the Lambs became my hero, my rolemodel. Dr. Lecter was the embodiment of silent evil: intelligent, cunning, witty and deadly. What made Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs true classics is exactly what is missing from Hannibal. The story is predictable and full of holes. It seems like the sole purpose of the book is to gross you out (and believe me, I don't gross out easily). The villian is straight out of a comic book (think a living blob with The Rock for a sister). The book seems to try to make the character of Lecter more human, explaining why he is the way he is... Big mistake. The most horrifying evil is the one you don't understand. On top of that, Clarice's character comes off as less human, a robot, a shadow of the persona shown in Silence of the Lambs. I kept reading the book thinking: &quot;This will change soon... it can't end like this&quot;... I was a witness to the death of my hero. When I closed the book, tears of anger were flowing freely through my cheeks. I want to thank Ms. Jodie Foster (greatest actress right now!) for refusing to do this film... That way she has spared moviegoers from one of the worst experiences in literature..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A Thomas Harris book boring? Is that possible? Did he really write this lame follow up to one of the all time great scary books? The characters are like cardboard cutouts who didn't scare, amuse, or interest me. Hannibal seems to have changed from an interesting and frightening evil person to a Saturday morning cartoon character who can dodge bullets. So why do I give it a three? Because Thomas Harris is one hell of an author and wrote three dynamite books in the past. I just hope he does so again - and gets rid of this guy masquerading as him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read this story and kept thinking these characters are really bizarre. However the pace and story line were good enough to keep my interest.The author used a strange writing style. At times it was a straight forward narrative and then would change to a voyuer type of writing. As if the reader and author were peeping in on the life of actual people rather than characters in a book.I kept on with it and read the final two chapters of the book. I HATED THE ENDING. I thought Mr. Harris showed contempt for the characters he created in his two previous works. I can't say enough bad things about the ending. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read the book and reveal the ending. I will say that if the movie follows this book, especially the ending, I won't be seeing it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a huge fan of Thomas Harris, I had waited forever for his next book following the Silence of the Lamb. What a heart wrenching disappointment! The book moves very slowly and reads more like a tour guide or an arts history textbook on Italy than a psycho thriller.In my opinion, it seemed that Harris got tired of writing about 2/3 through and just threw some ending together. I wish that he would have called me to write the ending, because I certainly could have done better. I can't imagine what happened to Harris's creativity when it came to the ending, perhaps he let Clive Barker finish it, or maybe his grandson.This book in no way resembles his previous masterpieces. Save your time and choose another."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book by Thomas Harris is a very intense and wonderful book. Just when you are ready to set it down something new happens and you don't dare put it down. The ending is very shocking and you have to read the whole book to get it. You might even want to read Silence of the Lambs before this one because then you get the whole story. This is definitely the best book I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read many other reviews and was under the impression that Hannibal would be a very disappointing ending to Silence of the Lambs. However, it didn't turn out that way. Hannibal is very slow-moving. The book starts out with a bunch of action, but then sort of declines downhill, but as you toward the climax, it becomes very suspenseful. As slow-moving as Hannibal is, you're drawn into the story and you don't really want to stop reading it. In Hannibal, you finally understand where Dr. Lecter is coming from. You learn about what happened to him when he was a child and how he may have gone insane. But really, when you think about it, Hannibal Lecter is not really insane. He was given the title &quot;insane genius,&quot; but really he's probably the most sane person on Earth. I personally think he's going along with being insane just so he won't have to face his victims' families in court and face the death penalty. Yes, I do realize he has a thing for eating livers and the sweetbreads from a person, but take note he only ate the sweetbreads from one of his victims' and no others. Hannibal was a very thrilling book that is slow-moving, but is well worth being read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal continues the stories of the cannibalistic Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who was so fascinated by him in Silence of the Lambs.The plot itself is suspenseful, though perhaps not quite as gripping as the hunt for serial killer Jame Gumb in Silence. Hannibal's villain, Mason Verger - a former victim of Lecter's - at times descends into unbelievable campiness. Harris seems to have written parts of the book with tongue firmly in cheek, which can make it hard for the reader to decide whether to laugh or grimace. But perhaps this was intentional.The fact that it is the murderous Lecter rather than some poor innocent who is Verger's intended victim makes it hard for the reader to pick a side - and this definitely IS intentional.The book's implicitly religious nature has been missed by many (though by no means all) readers and reviewers. Lecter's seemingly monstrous behavior makes perfect sense from one point of view, as those familiar with Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche, and O'Connor might agree. If God does not exist, all things are possible. So why not cannibalism? It would be interesting to hear utilitarian ethicist Peter Singer's take on this. In the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin once suggested as a class discussion the proposal that cannibalism should call for more lenient sentencing in murder cases, on the grounds that it is less wasteful.Homoeroticism is another prominent theme in Hannibal, with the terribly disfigured Verger being obsessed with Mann's tale of obsession itself, Death in Venice. Of course, the portrayal of Gumb in Silence had drawn criticism from homosexual groups, and the homosexual overtones of Lecter's cannibalism are obvious through the three Lecter books.The gross-out factor of the book is high, as is the interest level. The reader finds himself simultaneously wanting to find out what happens next and just wanting it to be over.Is it a perfect book? No. The origin of Lecter's cannibalism is presented in a manner a little too facile and straightforward, and seems almost designed to gain the reader's sympathy for Lecter.The one element of the book which has stirred up the most controversy is the culmination of the Starling-Lecter relationship. It was a secret hidden in plain view in Silence that above all else that she was, Clarice Starling was a woman fascinated by Hannibal Lecter. That the long-foreshadowed ending came as a surprise to anyone shows simply that some people were not paying close enough attention.Harris is not a first-order writer whose narration is meant to be infallible or 100% trustworthy. Although the readers were sometimes TOLD how bright and dedicated and together Starling was, what were we actually SHOWN was a woman who was very impressed by, respectful of, and deferential to a cannibalistic serial killer. The wise reader judged her by her actions, not by the thumbnail sketch of her given in the narration.Starling is in fact closely akin to those pathetic creatures who send fan mail and marriage proposals to butchers such as Ted Bundy. She is a serial killer groupie. This much was made apparent in Silence, so Hannibal cannot properly be seen as a betrayal of the \\"real\\" Starling of Silence. There always was only ONE Starling: the one who was captivated by Hannibal Lecter from the very beginning.Actress Jodie Foster (who played Starling in the movie version of Silence), is one of those who entirely missed the point of Starling in her prior appearance. She refused to reprise the role in the movie version of this book. With no apparent sense of the hideous irony involved, she announced her plans to instead go ahead with her production of a fawning biopic of Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl, of whom Foster was quoted on the British Film Institute's website as saying: \\"She is really one of the great stories of the Twentieth century and a moral tale for all of us. She is an extraordinary woman - sharp as a tack and as beautiful as she ever was with a tremendous body.\\"No matter how revolting the actions of Lecter and Verger (and perhaps Starling) are, those people are entirely fictional.But the reader should be warned: fictional though it is, the gore factor in Hannibal is high. I found it worse than Silence in that respect (though no worse than Red Dragon), so if Silence represented a limit for you, it might be best to avoid Hannibal.But if you can stomach (sorry) the butchery, the story is well worth the read. Harris always leaves his readers wanting more. In his place, many other authors would be on book 16 of their \\"cannibal / killer / psychologist / detective / hero\\" Lecter series by now, and the character would be completely forgettable. By providing only the necessary beginning, middle, and end of the Lecter story, Harris has guaranteed his creation a lasting place in suspense fiction."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you have read The Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs you will be disappointed and possibly outraged with this book. It has none of the qualities that the other two books offered.Basically it tries to explain Hannibal's background while being chased by a former patient/victim that wants to see him eaten by pigs. Yes, that's right pigs. Apparently sharks with laser beams, winged monkeys, or killer clowns from outer space were already taken so he had to improvise.Clarice goes from being a bright prospect with the FBI to eventually turning into Hannibal's sick cannibal mate tromping around the world. Nothing in this book is even remotely suspenseful. Instead Harris, with a deadline and major money at risk, whips out this pathetic piece. He replaces intelligently written suspense with needless, over the top gore.One of the few books that was worse than the movie. The movie was awful too but at least trimmed out some of this nonsense. No wonder Foster would have nothing to do with this."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The ending of this book is so implausible that it effectively ruins the book. (I am about to write about the ending, so if you don't want to know about it, don't read further.) Agent Starling's transformation at the end was completely out of character, and an insult to readers who had read the previous 500 pages. She is changed from being an independent, moral and law-abiding FBI agent to an amoral cannibal who without the slightest hesitation eats the brains of a fellow FBI agent, and then seduces her sociopathic captor and enters a long-term relationship with him.One of the things I appreciated about Silence of the Lambs was the psychological sophistication of the plot. And what I dislike so much about this book is that the author, for some reason, goes to the opposite extreme and creates an ending -- presumably for shock value -- which is not supported by anything that precedes it. As a professional writer who is capable of better work, Harris should be ashamed of this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Bought it before I headed off to Florida for 7 nights cruise in the caribbean. Of all the things I could do on a 110,000 ton ship, I decided to stay in my room and read this book. It's not a must read or a classic but an entertaining book. Story flows easily and characters are twisted enough to make it exciting.Worth every penny of paperback. Have a good time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is not hard to see why. Harris has spent much time on writing this one and in the hands of the right editor this book is nothing short of expertly published. Not only does it stand out as a very important development in the world of literature and the art of writing but it is also a great story to boot. There is not one page, not one sentence, not one word that has not been looked at or mulled over by the author. You can tell by reading it that this book has been in development for probably something close to a decade. Every paragraph reads like a paragraph that has never been made before. Every clich&eacute;d driven plot, character and dialogue has been skilfully avoided. The descriptions are on top form and the book delivers on all counts.First of all this is horror. This is not a murder mystery. Harris has thrown aside any preconceived ideas about what this sequel is going to be like and it pays off in aces. He could easily have given us ANOTHER Silence of the Lambs but what is the point to that? Instead this is a book about Hannibal... a cannibal.... a cannibal who is a man called Hannibal. That many figures from Silence of the Lambs are back here is only incidental to the fact that Hannibal knows them. The book is entirely based on his life following his escape from the asylum in Lambs and the life he has chosen to lead.Hannibal is really the most extreme anti-hero character ever conceived. He is the pivotal character in the story, not Agent Starling!, and it is through him that we experience the world of Hannibal. This book is about just that and then some more. Here we learn what made Hannibal a cannibal and why he is what he is. That should be enough to get anyone who is even remotely interested in Lambs to read this book.The premise to this story is a simple one. One of Hannibal's victims, a Mason Verger, has survived his attack and for years lies bedridden with his appalling injuries as he abuses little children. He has also hired some bounty hunters to track down Hannibal and will pay them whatever it costs because of his silver spoon heritage. Agent Starling discovers the plot to kidnap Hannibal and tries to get him for herself by way of deception. It is all out action and psychological horror from start to finish with a great ending too.This is all about Hannibal and fans will love it. Just do not go into it expecting the same as what you got before. This is horror through and through.**As a note avoid the movie which is very different and has a terrible Hollywood ending**"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...but I found myself finnishing \\"Hannibal\\" (the book) liking the movie better, and without any doubt. Not that the book written by Harris is anywhere near bad, while reading the first half of it I could swear I was holding a masterpiece in my hands. But the ending of the book, the outcome of the relationship between the coldblooded murderer (brought to human by the author as well when Harris takes some kind of a u-turn uncovering a traumatic childhood, to put it mildly -not very fortunate for the legend of a fictionary frightener Hannibal has indeed become (with amazing help by Anthony Hopkins too of course) if you ask me, a part of the mystery is gone!). So yes, the ending ruined it for me. And made little sence, if any at all.I must add that I enjoy perhaps Anthonys' Hannibal a bit more than Harris'. Lechter in the movies is more a sophisticated, gentleman -a wolf behind the mask of a lamb. And more terrifying this way.So prepare yourself for the book that's very different than the movie. Ridley Scotts' (the director) ending should make more sence, and dovetail with the two previous movies (and books I guess). You might feel let down by the author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read all of Harris's \\"Lecter\\" novels several times and none has failed to be a relentless page turner. The characters come to life and brutality somehow makes sense in the twisted yet brilliant mind of Dr. Lecter. The unfortunate motion picture, Hannibal, directed by Ridley Scott, was nothing like Thomas Harris's novel. The fact is, Scott lost touch with the purpose of Harris's eloquently penned psychological masterpiece and took us down a shallow road that Harris never imagined, driving the car into the ditch, leaving us with a false impression. Scott took license and made a mockery of the original story which turned Hannibal Lecter into an unwitting victim. Something that, the Lecter we have come to know, if not quite understand, would never allow. If you yearn to have your senses stimulated I recommend you buy this book and ready yourself for a wild ride through the human condition, bent psychological situations and find out about your own memory palace... A place we all harbor and can, if we want, retreat to for reflection. Before reading this novel, I recommend that you start with Red Dragon, move onto Silence of the Lambs and end with Hannibal. Unlike the motion picture; Hannibal, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs follow more closely, the original stories which Harris weaves with his down to earth yet educated southern style. All three of the novels are first rate reads, not to be missed.Why anyone would be offended by the ending of this novel is quite a mystery... Even eclipsing where Jimmy Hoffa is buried. It is not Mr. Harris who owes his readers an apology but it is the shallowness of the reader who can not or will not allow for human behavior, all of its aspects. Clarice, after all, was betrayed by the very people inside the DOJ - FBI who had used her as the sacrificial lamb. Her own lack of a family and need to feel the love she yearned for was what brought her full circle to examine her own motivations and to fall in love with her polar opposite and inevitably bring about the changes which Lecter in turn underwent after finding the deep commitment which was lost when he witnessed his young sister being devoured by enemy soldiers. Clarice represents all that is good and Mischa, Lecter's beloved sister. The tea cup that falls and is frozen in time is a representation of how we can and must choose our own fate and take responsibility for each moment.Just as the reader must examine their own dark side and take responsibility for our choices, Harris has gone beyond behavioral science and paints the images of his characters vividly and with respect to himself and his readers.Bravo!Robin redbreast in a cage, puts all heaven in a rage."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"*sigh* I've read Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, and this is by far the worse of the three. It reminds me of my experience with Micheal Chrichton. I'd read Congo, Sphere, The Andromeda Strain, and Jurrassic Park when I picked up a copy of The Lost World. Not only was the book contrived and poorly written, but Chrichton actually took the pains to contradict his last book (the vision of the T.Rex), causing it all to come across as fluff. Hannibal is in the same gutter: both this and The Lost World are hartily written, money-grubbing commercial sell outs, based upon the success of a film. I never did finish The Lost World.Hannibal I finished. I didn't realize as I was reading it how bad it exactly was. Only in retrospect . . . Hannibal's story is wasted: he simply tries to fit in so as not to be caught. Harris should have explored the possibilities, but he doesn't. The &quot;Mind Palace&quot; attempts to do this, but unltimately seemed silly and pointless. The great dialogue between Hannibal and Starling is gone, replaced with uninteresting characters (Verger and his sister) and manhunting.The man-eating pigs are out of place, meant to be menacing but nearly comical in their oddness. My reaction to the pigs and their trainers are similar to my reaction of the book as a whole: Why??"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading both The Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Hannibal. After waiting eleven years for this sequel, I expected the same suspense filled, totally frightening thriller, Harris had written before. Unfortunately, this is not the case. This book does not fill you with terror. Instead, many of the really &quot;scary&quot; scenes are just silly and disgusting. The characters, so well developed in the two previous novels, have become cartoon characters. The plot is not suspenseful, but very predictable and gets bogged down in many places. And, the ending is ridiculous and unbelievable. The one element that made The Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs such great books, stories you were afraid to read when you were home alone, was their plausibility; the idea that this could really happen. That feeling is completely absent in this novel. The only positive thing I can say about Hannibal, is that you get a very nice walking tour of Florence, Italy. But of course, that's not what I was looking for, from Thomas Harris. If you want to read a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller, that keeps you up all night, this is NOT the book. A total disappointment!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I hated this book. Harris bored me with his endless descriptions of Italian architecture, saddened me by shoveling Jack Crawford into an early grave, then disgusted me by making Clarice Bonnie to Lecter's Clyde. The only character that acted normal was Ardelia. I know Clarice needed a boyfriend but the demented Doc wasn't the one I had in mind. I kept expecting her to regain her faculties during the dinner scene and bash him on the head with a saute pan."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"\\"Hannibal,\\" is superb, carrying the characterizations of Lector and Starling to their logical, though shocking, conclusion. Starling's pathologies are demonstrated in depth, and Lector's exploitation of them is nothing short of masterful.Harris makes these rich, stunning, characters fully believable and their sadomasochistic machinations - in all directions - are explored in great depth.Those who fail to understand this work - and its outcome - have failed miserably in their understanding of psychology, Starling, Lector, and the human condition.Buy, read, cherish."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was one of the most disappointing books I have read in the past couple years. It includes some of the most well drawn characters in the history of thriller novels--Hannibal Lecter, Clarice Starling, and Jack Crawford--but Thomas Harris does nothing with them. Hannibal enjoys the good life on the outside, but jumps around trying to evade capture from either the police or Mason Verger. It is interesting for a while, but it never seems that anyone else is really on his tail or that there is enough action to keep everything moving along. Clarice is also in trouble constantly within the Bureau, but it isn't interesting and the political undertones in the story take away from the excitement it should have. This would have been bad enough, but the ending to this story is so inplausible and stupid that it would have ruined the book completely if it hadn't already been pretty much destroyed by the previous 400 pages. The only thing that makes this book worth reading is that Harris does include some good suspense and violence that keeps it interesting and making the reader want more, expecting that it will get good, even though when you reach the end, it never lives up to the high hopes. I would not recommend this book (though I would recommend Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon very highly) to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal continues the saga of Hannibal Lector and it is really a pointless work and elevates Hannibal from mastermind psychopath to a primeval force of nature or something. He wreaks havoc upon his adversaries and at the same time remains a conneiseur of taste and sophistication. Yes, he still has a thing for brains and fava beans, but the biggest let-down is the character of Agent Starling who has been turned into a weak character. Whereas we saw Starling grow into a formidable agent in the previous book, she is now almost passive and the ending of the book makes little sense on either a realistic or surreal level. Of course if I was getting paid as much as Harris was I'd keep cranking out books about Hannibal Lector and probably go back and cover his childhood too for that matter. The first two books, Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon were better and seemed to go somewhere, but now it feels like retread city. The Italian settings and characters give this book a more international flavor which is nice, but Hannibal lacks the heart of Harris' previous efforts. I'd recommend reading this book if you are really bored and you have nothing else to read and that's about it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yuk!! I felt like I needed to take a week long shower after finishing this book. I think that the author has been caught up in the Hollywood-ization of his work, and so he simply cranked out the most violent and incomprehensible swill he could come up with to make into an also disgusting movie. Until this book, I've enjoyed all of Thomas Harris books. I almost wondered if this was a \\"[descriptive word] you\\" to all the greedy movie types. You know the old--\\"You want a movie, fine.. I'll give you a stinking movie...\\" Would have given it zero stars or a negative rating if possible...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"\\"Now that ceaseless exposure has calloused us to the lewd and the vulgar, it is instructive to see what still seems wicked to us. What still slaps the clammy flab of our submissive consciousness hard enough to get our attention?\\" (Hannibal, 144)What indeed, Mr. Harris. Is it the image of a man watching as others eat his brain? Or perhaps that of another removing his face and feeding it to his dogs-themselves patients of his sadism-stopping only to consume the nose himself and remarking that it \\"tastes just like chicken\\"?This is the nature of glimpses seen through the keyhole to the doorway of nightmare; here they are offered as affairs in the realm of popular fiction.Our antihero is a serial killer, whose genius is matched only by his unbounded cruelty. His antagonist is his victim, now paralyzed and disfigured beyond recognition, whose thirst for revenge has fashioned a plan to slowly feed the killer to a group of eugenically-enhanced swine.With such a premise, one would be correct in expecting there to be little in the way of constancy and optimism in this place. Mr. Harris gives us a perverse literary landscape indeed, where sadism and pederasty are treated with surprising nonchalance. It is a place where Law enforcement and politics are inconsequential and unavailing. It is a place without mercy, where the weak and stupid are punished and the strong and cruel thrive.Hannibal is not justifiable as a self-sufficient novel. Conflict is between those who are cruel and sadistic, and those who are more so. Cartharsis is attained only through the unfathomable suffering of the merciless, suffered at the hands of the merciless. In the end, evil triumphs over evil, and all that we took to be good is defiled beyond redemption.Hannibal must be read as the third installment of the so-called Hannibal Lector trilogy. When weighed in this fashion, it is merely the final act in a long and violent narrative commenced in Red Dragon. Hannibal is grotesque and fulsomely violent; however, it is logical in the fictional universe Mr. Harris has created and maintained.Comparatively, Hannibal is the weakest of the three. Lector's motives are offered in clumsy exposition, and the finale makes a mockery of his supposed sociopathy, as well as Clarice's supposed lack of it. Characters are permitted to change, but the reader must be made aware.In many ways, the novel invalidates any moral system attempted within the first two novels. Perhaps it is meant as a lesson that there are times when evil is too willful to be vanquished; or, perhaps that we all have enough evil in us to become monsters. Either way, Hannibal fails to capture the power and precision of its predecessors."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a major disappointment. Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon were truly great because the author built the suspense and horror with excellent writing, combined with the gruesome acts. With Hannibal, he seems to be just trying to shock us. The characters in the book are almost universally loathsome, but Harris seems to be saying it's okay for for Hannibal to be a monster because he has good taste. He tries to humanize the character and blame his behavior on Nazis, which is laughable and cheap. One expects far more, both from the character and the writer. I read a review that stated that Harris had fallen in love with Hannibal as a character to the detriment of the story. That is so true. The ending is absolutely absurd, so out of keeping with the rest of the book and trilogy that it's utterly unbelievable and obviously designed for shock value. I'm not so easily shocked, especially with so transparent a ploy. Many people have the opinion that the ending is good simply because it took guts and daring on the author's part. I just wish he'd dared to write better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is awful, but not for the descriptions of horror that has, for everything else, in the first part of the book, when Clarice is in action killing Evelda and his gang is a real thriller, you think that you will never put down the book, but when the book goes to Italy is boring and boring and so it keeps.The less is written in the book is the life of Hannibal, you just know that his sister was eaten by some kind of cannibals in 1940 when their parents where killed in an invasion, but you don't know how he went to jail, how he escaped and why he has an expensive delight.All the chapters have an introduction to it that has nothing to do with the story of the book, this introduction is at least half page of the chapter, if you skip all the introductions you will have a book of 60 or 70 pages less , and here can I tell you that are 2 or 3 chapters that doesn't belong to the book at all, for example when Margot and Barney went to the gym.In all the story all the persons are the bad guys, except for Clarice, but Hannibal drug her, so at the end of the book only can win the bad guys, no matter what is your point of view."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Uggh! Thats how I felt reading this book. It's almost as if it wasn't written by the same person. I mean it was so obviously written as a screenplay to be made into a movie. All that was missing was the word &quot;CUT&quot;, at the end of each scenes discription.This book is a disappointment not because it is so blatently written to assit in the movie adaptation, but because it is a sellout of the previous one. The author let us down when we expected so much more, and we deserved it because we know he has it to give (evidence Silence of the Lambs).Also disappointing is the fact that it goes for cheap gore. Yes I know Hannibal eats his victems, but that is only a part of what makes him frightening. What really makes him scary is his crazy intelligence, his planning, his passion and manipuation, his power over his victems. All of these things were so brilliantly highlighted in Silence of the Lambs, that the reader has no choice but to be let down while reading this.It's like the author tried to pull a fast one and thought no one would notice. It makes me angry because readers are smarter than that. We know what the author is capable of and we expect their best and no one got it in this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Previous Thomas Harris books have entertained me and even educated me about the possible mind of serial killers. In Silence of the Lambs, I liked the dynamics between Clarice Starling, the young FBI agent in training, and Dr. Lecter. So of course I purchased this book in hardback as soon as it came out, to see what Harris could tell me next. Usual grisly and extreme behavior on the part of Hannibal occurs. He outwits most of the really stupid law enforcement people. A new character with much more power than most bedridden people are able to command is introduced, and this provides some amazing plot twists. Perhaps the book is a worthwhile read, based on what I've said so far. but the ending is so false in terms of Clarice's character development that the whole book becomes a disappointment. Harris takes this interesting 3 dimensional character and turns her into a girl toy. Human nature doesn't change that much, regardless of how many psychotropic drugs a person is fed. Maybe having the competent intelligent FBI agent taken down in the end works out some need on the author's part to tell us that unmitigated evil will win. I don't think a woman author would ever write anything so silly and unlikely as what Harris has done to Clarice, but, I don't want to make this a male female thing. It's just that the ending, besides being gratuitously horrible, is silly. Hope I didn't spoil the surprise for anyone!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first time I ever heard of Hannibal was when I was listening to the radio and I heard a preveiw for the movie. Have you heard the line &quot;I'm giving serious thought to eating your wife&quot; ? Creepy. I immediately decided to get the book and I wasn't dissapointed. There are so many psychological and religious issues in this book! I'm an eighteen year old college student and some of them went beyond me. I'm hoping to figure them out when I take Psych 101 this fall!Hannibal Lecter is a fantastic villain, cultured and educated, who would kave no problem killing you if you threatened his freedom. This is evidenced by Pazzi's untimely demise. I enjoyed learning of his past, his childhood even. Although some may disagree, I like it when a villian is given a past: it makes him more human and it makes you think &quot;Could I have ended up like this?&quot;Clarice Starling in SOTL was an enthusiastic young FBI trainee looking towards her future with bright eyes. In Hannibal, she is cynical, beaten down after seven years of subtle sabotage of her career by Paul Krendler. She knows her career is going nowhere and this is what makes the ending of the book more realistic to me. Clarice can stay in a dead-end career working for the organization that betrayed her, or she can run off with this facinating man, so much like herself, and travel the world.Mason Verger is one sick puppy. He makes Hannibal Lecter look like a fluffy doll. Hannibal was a killer and cannibal, yes, but when reading about him one feels a sense of elegance and taste coming from him. Mason radiated evil. He is a child molester, a man who raped his own sister repeatedly and violently enough to cause her to need stitches. He tries to entice Hannibal Lecter into a bit of S&amp;M (shudder) which leads to Hannibal getting Mason high and convincing him to remove his face with a knife. And the way he plans to kill Dr. Lecter is vicious and brutal. In the end, you actually find yourself rooting for Hannibal.What really got me was the ending. It was so unexpected for me, I just gasped out loud (which got me a lot of wierd looks, I'll tell you). I loved it, though. It makes me wonder what kind of choice I would have made.All in all, I give this book 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who loves a good involved story. Just make sure you have a strong stomach."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is so refreshing to read a novel and have no idea how it is going to end. Your critics seem to be more concerned with screenplays and oscars than they are with the story at hand. Hannibal is a dynamic character and you have shown us yet another side of him that we would have never predicted. That, in my opinion, is what Dr. Lecter is all about. -JC"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A terrific read which completely held my interest for almost the entire book. I found the end, a bit unconvincing but that in no way detracted from my overall enjoyment of the book and it was not illogical as had been stated by other reviewers, but rather a continuation of where Harris left off in SOTL. I would encourage all who haven't read it yet to give it a try, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I -loved- Hannibal. Couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. If you haven't already, you must read this book. Unless of course you are underage, squeamish or are otherwise delicate of stomach, liver and thyroid (Now, if you are that squeamish, well... Move on to whatever it is you allow yourself to read and best of luck in life).For anyone else, this book is/was/will be astounding. It's a clear example of good and engaging writing. I don't believe a better book has been written in years.Hannibal will immediately grab your attention from the begining. The story is unique, the characterization of Lecter is brilliant and the attention to detail is amazing. And while I'm sure many will disagree (Particularly those fond of Detective Starling or Jodie Foster), I found the progression and ending to be entirely logical and satisfying.Granted, this book was imperfect. There were one or two moments when scenes were surreal and somewhat disrupted the flow of the book. So, the book could possibly have been drafted one last time (Near the end, maybe?). However, I'm sure no major revisions were necessary, and would have instead, been counterproductive. For those who were unsatisfied, I believe they are suffering from their own expectations. Since many of us have been waiting 11 years, we've come to expect perfection from Mr. Harris(And are maybe just a little sour about not getting a happyhappyjoyjoy fairy tale ending? :)).My suggestion is, if you're going to read this book, don't think about the movie, or the wait. Just start Hannibal wanting to read a good book and I promise you'll be satisfied many times over."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In SOTL, Harris spent time developing his characters. In Hannibal, those characters are already in place and Harris is able spend more time playing with the marbles your head. It was a great read. After waiting for the book, I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am apparently one of the few readers who looked forward to this book with absolutely no expectations at all regarding plot and character changes. I am a writer, too, and I know if Harris had simply left Clarisse and Hannibal stay exactly the same way, it would have retarded the story (not to mention Harris' storytelling craft)and left nothing to discover, either in storyline or characterization. Personally, I enjoyed having more knowledge about just what it was that made Hannibal the cannibal. And while I have heard some readers complain about Clarisse changing from gung-ho superagent to FBI outcast, I hardly see how any intelligent person could realistically study the FBI and not come away with the idea that the inhuman machine grinds away what is good &amp; noble in its ranks, so Clarisse's situation is only honest and true to form. To put it simply, I loved it, and I loved the ending. Imagining what Hollywood is going to do to it makes me shudder, but I applaud Harris for having the guts to write the kind of story he wanted."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the Italian section, and the first few chapters. Two good sections, two stars. The ending was just plain silly, and there were too many two page chapters that didn't give us any new information only reinforced what we all ready knew. If you want to read a good Lector story re-read RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While Red Dragon and TSOL were both more realistic in their portrayal of serial killers, this book was by far the most enjoyable to read. It was fast paced, not burdened by the self-pity of the characters (Red Dragon was held back by Will Graham's character), and enjoyable. I hope there will be a sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris gets better with every book....and again, this has been left open. I look forward to the next one!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unlike most of the other reviews I loved this book and I was actually very satisfied with the ending. Mason Verger and his eel? Have to say Loved them too. If only Jodie Foster and Sir Anthony Hopkins would agree to a sequel I would love to see the movie again and again. Plus I'm quite interested in how they would have Mason Verger look. Any one who has read or seen Silence of the Lambs and truly Loved it should Love this book! I've already read it twice and I'm starting on the third."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is probably more disturbing than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, because it is just as far-fetched. But the reader must remember that &quot;Hannibal&quot; comes from the mind of a writer who created a character that was making a suit from real women.The ending was a little much to take at first, but after thinking about it, it was very appropriate. (I had a problem trying not to relate this book to the movie version of &quot;Silence&quot;).I think that by trying to humanize Lector, Harris gave me a better insight to him. I didn't sympathise with him or his culinary tastes, but felt that I could understand the motivation of why. If anyone liked &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; I'm sure that they will be pleased with this, after a little thought."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I doubted that the expectations I held for this work would be matched by Harris' fine prose. As expected the work was stellar in its language, rich with its imagery and powerful with its pace. The denouement leaves an aftertaste reminiscent of a truffle; perhaps slightly bitter after time, with haunting memories of the pleasure, and a desire for more."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Never before have I read something which would keep me reading the whole day! I had to pick up the book, after reading all about the hype a few weeks before. And after a few hours, I have to say this is definitely up there with some of my favorites, including the works of James Patterson. Harris is a great storyteller and let's hope that he continues on in the future. My only problem: It has evil tabloid reporters! But, that's not too bad of a situation to keep the story going. Good job, Mr. Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this story to be an intelligent and well constructed tale. I definitely recommend this one to others as I found myself staying up way past midnight to finish it. For other interesting reads, check out Joseph Green's PSEUDO COOL and SOULS BIZARRE."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was nearly as riviting as the original, with as many chills and surprises as I would like to handle in one reading. The character roll over is great, kudos to Harris for remembering who is characters are after this long an absence."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First impression not up to Silence but need to think more! More violent, less subtle. Will write more soon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"From the Author of Black Sunday comes his own &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot; trilogy: Red Dragon, Silence Of the Lambs and Hannibal. I have read the book, and although I am quite familiar with his other two books, the new culprit was still quite pleasantly suprising. Again, your world is complelely changed as the master, Thomas Harris, rips the fabric of Hannibal Lecter that he so carefully weaved with the previos two books. Masterful, suspenseful, satisfying. I dig it, totally."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's seven years after Starling's success of tracking Buffalo Bill and the subsequent escape of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

The manhunt for Lecter is in full swing with a little push from Lecter's only surviving victim, Mason Verger. Verger proves to be as menacing as Lecter and his obessesion with Hannibal puts Clarice in danger.The tale of Clarice and Hannibal reaches a feverish pace as the hunt goes on and Clarice's career starts to fall apart. The presence of Verger, a man so vile and evil, actually causes the reader to cheer for Hannibal Lecter. Only the quick pen of Thomas Harris can have you rooting for a cannibalistic serial killer.The book reaches uncharted territory with graphic violence. It touches every evil known to man and then some...... murder, cannibalism, torture, child molestation, incest, bribery, corruption, greed............. these and more keep the reader spellbound to this nightmarish novel.The book reads fast and holds interest right up until the shocking end. A magnificently macabre five star thriller!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Never have I anticipated a book so much...and never have I been so disappointed. The plot never really got off the ground. I had this sense of waiting for the story to really get going and it never did. That's not the worst part though. What Harris did to the main characters was utterly ridiculous. With Lecter he had developed one of the most menacing villians in current literature. He took a monster and made him a victim. With Starling he had an excellent protagonist. He took a woman who was strong and smart and made her weak and stupid. It's hard to believe he took 10 years to write this. It reads like he took 10 weeks. Read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Leave this one on the shelves."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There was a lot of discussion and general hub-bub about this book when it came out. Did you like the ending, how could he write that, Clarise would never do that blah blah blah. I think this book ended honestly!Clarise finds herself in an awful, career ending mess. there are forces that surround her, pushing her in many directions, but SHE choses which one to follow. Hannibal is where her obsession lies, and she follows that path to the very end.Yes this is a twisted book with a bizarre ending but to me, it was what made this book interesting and special. Really I couldn't put it down. I think I read the last 200 pages all in one sitting. I recomend this book to anyone who loves Silence of the Lambs (book or movie) and even if you've seen the movie and it's changed ending, read the book so you can decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Do you ever feel like that? I know that we humans are said to use only ten percent of our brains or something, but even with all that excess capacity I dislike using any of it to store the details of this book.Devoid of suspense, consisting of moving from one grotesque Hannibal Lector Moment to another, and concluding with what has to be the least satisfying conclusion to a novel ever to see print, this book was an utter waste of time. I only read it because I loved \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"Understand, I can't blame Harris for cranking out this dopey sequel. He probably did all right financially with the previous two, but with Hannibal Lector now nearly an institution, there's big, big money for him in the sequels. A man has to take care of himself and his family, so more power to him.For me, I think I'm done with the good doctor."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this book extremely gripping, but ultimately not satisfying. Certainly not as good as the author's Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. My major gripes are that Lecter becomes a virtual superman in this book, capable of almost any feat, and the ending, of course. At least it was unexpected, if disgustingly absurd."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've been trying to figure out what made Hannibal the book and the movie box-office hit that it is... and why I liked it as much as I did.While reading the book My Ishmael, by author Daniel Quinn, I finally figured it out. It's not the horror of cannibalism that's made it such a hit, it's Hannibal Lector's stepping outside the &quot;keeping of food under lock and key,&quot;* and dining on &quot;free-ranging&quot; human flesh, that fascinates people so much; the violation of a taboo that is absolutely essential to our culture (*See My Ishmael, by Daniel Quinn).If you want another take on this taboo in a tribal setting, see the book Alive, which was also made into a movie. In Alive, a high school ball team, stranded by an airplane crash high in the Andes mountains, agonizes over staying alive by eating the flesh of their dead companions on the plane.The point is only heightened by Hannibal's highly intelligent, charismatic, and cultured demeanor in both the book and as portrayed in the movie by Anthony Hopkins (one of the finest actors I've ever watched). Try to imagine either the book or the movie even being published in the 1950s, say? Let alone being a major hit? I give it 5 stars and hope for the future!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Amazing book. It started off as a real page turner. In Hannibal, Dr. Lecter has escaped from prison and has been on the loose for several years. Mason Verger, one of his previous victims is trying to catch him to see him die. Hannibal contacts Starling in letters occasionally. Watch out for the end. It is an absolute surprise."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; were both excellent books, and both good films. They are therefore going to be a hard act to follow and, for the screaming millions that have waited so long for this book, nothing less than a brilliant read was going to do.Thomas Harris has made a game attempt at this masterpiece, and he is to be commended on not sticking to formula. The early part of this novel shows Harris' ability to write fast paced and detailed narrative, a quality that is observed in all his books. And the horror moments are, generally speaking, frankly stated and brutal - just the way Lecter fans like it.So where did this book go wrong? Firstly, the formula has been altered. I know I commended Harris for this before, but the other Lecter novels are so utterly brilliant that a change in formula was always likely to be a step backwards rather than a step forward. What made &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence&quot; was the psychology of the characters, and the chase to capture the killer in each book. In &quot;Hannibal&quot;, we have several mini chases and no psychology to speak of. Mason Verger is the closest we get to exploring the mind and he is an example of where the book falls down again.Harris, in his acknowledgements, thanks a couple of eminent psychologists for their information on the &quot;memory palace&quot;. This is the device that Lecter uses to remember everything he has ever done. He walks the corridors of his own mind and enters rooms that act out memories. This is how he can call up information, however small and trivial, at a moment's notice from something that happened literally decades ago. I can accept phenomenal memories, but I don't think Harris' descriptions of the memory palace add anything at all to the book. Instead, I get the feeling that they have simply been lifted from some textbook, or a conversation with an eminent professor somewhere.Throughout &quot;Hannibal&quot; we are faced with situations that just do not ring true. Previously, Hannibal Lecter was an incredibly intelligent man that was approaching a superhuman status through his strength, crimes and intensity. In &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Harris has allowed him to become superhuman and thus destroy the reality that &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence&quot; approached but never crossed. Nothing displays this more than the ludicrous dinner that Lecter holds at the very end of the book. A scene so syrupy, so farcical and so ridiculous that no reader is going to be taken in by it.If &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a one-off book and not the climax to a trilogy, it would have fared a little better. As it is, it had to live upto the very high standards set by its predecessors and could not do so. &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence&quot; show that Harris' ability to write a very good book was not a singular occurrance. &quot;Hannibal&quot; shows that Harris simply had an off 11 years or so."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I anxiously awaited the arrival of the next Hannibal book, after reading Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. The book starts out with a bang - grabbed my attention immediately. Clarice is facing some hard times at the FBI...she is in trouble. Harris does a really good job of drawing me into the situation. However, the next section of the book comes to a grinding halt. It is almost like this section of the book is written by someone else. After I finally got through that section - the last part of the book clips along (I guess this is were Harris takes over the writing again!).My only disappointment with the book is the ending - without giving it away, it is a very unlikely situation."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"RE: ABRIDGED AUDIO TAPE READ BY AUTHOR. There is no doubt that Hannibal Lecter is an intriguing character but like an oh-so-rich dessert, is better enjoyed in modest portions. I liked Harris' previous 2 efforts where the doctor dominated quite effectively from a supporting position. Here he is served up as the main course on a heaping platter that ultimately proves indigestable.At first listen, the author's southern drawl is distracting but as the story develops, I came to appreciate his informed interpretation of the work, if not the work itself"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In so many cases, the sequel of a spellbinding novel does not live up to one's expectations. I pondered as to whether or not to buy this book...the first, though spectacular, was certainly gory enough!!! However, to my delight, this was a true work of artistry. The characters of Starling and Hannibal come to life as actual human beings...you see now their hearts and souls...their intelligence....their foibles..every nuance of their complicated beings. I became spellbound as the mystery of Dr. Lector unfolded and as Starling untangled a mass of diverse and astonishing facts and fictions about the cannibalistic murderer in her quest to bring him to justice after his escape. The interplay of these two opposing, conflicting people is superbly done and the subtlety with which the plot is finally unmasked is both shocking and intriguing. It leaves you asking, &quot;Is this possible? Could this have happened in this way?&quot; I know the answer and I strongly recommend that you read for yourself a totally different and compelling novel in which those characters whom you thought you knew, develop before your eyes until the very end when just when you think you know what is going to happen....well...does it happen or not? Find out by picking up this thoroughly fascinating sequel to an equally fascinating beginning novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's a tribute to Thomas Harris that even his flops are page turners. As far as trashy novels to read on the airplane go, HANNIBAL cuts the mustard and more. When you compare it to the stellar work under Harris' belt in the past, this book shows its threadbare seams.To give Harris the credit he deserves, his instincts for this novel were right. It did require a more artistic treatment than the prior two novels to keep its less terse (but still suspenseful) plot moving. However, Harris' &quot;artistic touches&quot; are almost invariably in badly handled second person, &quot;You are here&quot; type stuff that rings oddly and meshes poorly with the rest of the book. The always-iffy second-person prose is poor enough to mar the book's better features. Unfortunately, even those features aren't up to standard. Too many characters, moments, ideas in HANNIBAL seem unreal and contrived, an oddity from an author that has created terse and terrifying reality in the past. Perhaps the worst example of this misstep is the ill-contrived insight into Dr. Lecter's past. The sinister aura surrounding Dr. Lecter is marred when it becomes clear that he did not spring fully formed from his own head. The connections Harris draws for us are too obvious for Lecter, and slightly illogical as well. Why did this terrible experience encourage Lecter to re-enact it? And, if Harris has described the root cause of Lecter's actions, why does Lecter himself seem to ignore it and replace it with other motives entirely? Many other assertions seem equally hollow, many charcters contrived and flat.Pick up RED DRAGON. Pick up THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. It is then inevitable, I suppose, that you will pick up HANNIBAL. Just try not to hold it against Thomas Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In what could be described as one of the biggest disappointments in literary history, Thomas Harris' Hannibal failed to meet expectations. Meeting these huge expectations could be difficult enough but Harris looked more than up to the task in the first two thirds of the book. There was excitement and intrigue, I could hardly wait to finish. However, the remaining 50-70 pages could only be described as &quot;hurried&quot;. The ending appeared as though it were written by a high school sophomore attempting to finish their homework early so they can go to a movie. Besides being hurried, the ending was also, in my humble opinion, ridiculous. I won't go into details, but trust me, opt to read another book"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dear readers of this review,Just so you realize how cheated out I feel, I have not finished this book yet. I am hanging on by sheer determination (or stubbornness) to see if it gets any better, any more credible.Reasons why I believe this book should not have been written:-The Silence of the Lambs grabs you by the scruff of the neck and doesn't let go until you're finished. Hannibal Lecter is the genius, the mastermind, and to me- the central character in that novel. -The confrontations between Clarice and Hannibal are devoured readily and eagerly and you want more. -When Lecter orchestrates spectacularly his escape from the jail, I cheered him on. As he says in his letter to Clarice...&quot;the world is more interesting with you in it.&quot; I thought so too. Not much was known about Lecter's past, his background. Virtually nothing, actually. When he ran away at the end of &quot;Silence&quot; I felt oddly satisfied. It was the appropriate conclusion for the book.Where Harris really goofed up for me, was in writing this book. An unnecessary sequel that devalues Hannibal Lecter. He's no longer the caged creature. The mind games are pretty much over.Silence of the Lambs was a &quot;mess with your mind&quot; novel. Hannibal is a &quot;mess with your stomach&quot; novel, going for excessive gore and shock value to get its point across. In doing that, in my mind it makes a mockery of the character of Hannibal Lecter.He has never looked so &quot;bad guy from the bad B movies&quot; like before! You can almost expect to hear him cackling shrilly after committing an evil deed. Like the character of Brad Pitt said to that of Kevin Spacey in &quot;Seven&quot;, and I quote:&quot;You're a movie of the week! A T-shirt, at best!&quot;I believe Lecter is heading for the same unwelcome status headed by the likes of Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger. These guys used to scare us in the past, as did Lecter. Now they're just comical."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In Silence of the Lambs, Starling is well defined and depicted, a person of great integrity and courage. Hannibal, the character in Silence of the Lambs, begins by being almost romantic in character, because the clues he parcels out to Starling regarding the new serial killer seem to imply a truly intelligent insight into the new killer's mind. Starling's respect for Hannibal is based on basic human decency as well as on a respect for his intelligence and insight, which it seems may be ongoing. In the end, however, we see that Hannibal's clues come from having had direct knowledge of the killer, and Hannibal is thereby de-mystified, as his sociopathic cruelty in manipulation is further exposed. Starling's respect for Hannibal is thereby reduced to a less personal wariness and knowledge of his character. In Hannibal the book, the wonderful characterizations of Silence of the Lambs are thrown out the window, and two unrelated characters called Starling and Hannibal are written in. In an attempt to show there can be a character worse than Hannibal, the pedophilic cripple is created; a sympathetic Hannibal is drawn by means of showing cruelty to him; and the previously unique and integral characterization of Starling is violated by having her reviled by the FBI and then throwing her into Hannibal's arms when she tries to save him from cruelty. In Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is treated with respect from other humans, and the horror of himself is thereby very vivid. In Hannibal the book, he is another misunderstood guy, beset by another horror of a human being, without interest and without integrity. Harris created two unique characters in Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lechter, and then threw them away in this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Others have said it, but by golly I'm going to repeat it--this was a disappointment. What can you say when every single character (with the exception of the puppet Clarice Starling) is so incredibly venal and unpleasant that a psychotic cannibal is the hero?Possibly Harris meant this as an experiment in making the totally unsympathetic sympathetic, and he does toss us a few bones, so to speak, with some insight into Hannibal's motives--another mistake, in my opinion. Hannibal the Cannibal, as portrayed in the first two books, is larger than life--the Bogeyman--a creature to darken our dreams. He is a Monster. In this book, Harris has to *tell* us Hannibal's a monster, over and over. Hannibal the man, as portrayed in this book, is just a dirty old man with the hots for Clarice (and admit it--at the end, didn't it come down to sex? Didn't Harris even say it himself? And don't tell me his word choice--penetration--was psychologically illuminating.)And what's this with Clarice? Talk about a pawn. She's the one character to root for, and she's totally powerless throughout. Everything she does is stolen, twisted, and corrupted. Even her action at the end only serves to deliver her to -- well, best not to mention that, because I do not believe that ending, I do not. Not Clarice.These are the major problems. There are others--Krendler is so shallow and stupid he is unbelievable. Barney is dropped in the middle in a ridiculous twist that contradicts some very nice work almost immediately prior to it. The whole thing with the eel--tres melodramatic.Big sigh here. So why did I bother to read it all, you ask? What else was I supposed to do on the plane home from my Christmas vacation?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read all three of Harri's previous books and enjoyed them all. They have good, believable plots with tight character portrayal and are genuinley frightening. Good stuff. Then along came this book Hannibal. What a pathetic waste of time. I got my paperback copy free and even then I feel ripped off. I won't bore you with a plot summary because this book doesn't deserve it. Reading it,I had a gradually increasing suspicion that the author had lost the plot and the final 60 pages or so where the author goes into fantasy land confirmed it. Why Harris has written such a poor novel I will never know. The problems are numerous. They start with poor character portrayal. We never get a clear picture of Clarice Starling (and it gets totally fuzzy at the end). Hannibal becomes a sort of gourmet fairy godfather. Krendler is a cardboard cut out. And so on. It gets worse. Add to that a rather weak plot. Pad it out with long pretentious descriptions of Italian scenery and lots of vague airy fairy analyses of mental processes. Add in some unbelievable plot developments and a totally laughable ending and you've got one major disappointment on your hands. Presumably Harris was trying to impress us all with his &quot;literary style&quot;. If so, he failed dismally. Even the explicit gory scenes fail to thrill simply because they are so unreal and so obviously contrived. I would give this pathetic book a single star for keeping me reading to the end. I shouldn't have bothered. How did Stephen King et al give this piece of rubbish such high reviews? Can you ever take a reviewer like King seriously again. My advice is give this loser a miss."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am writing this review in the hopes that it might prevent someone from wasting any of the valuable moments of their lives with this book. Your time would be better spent rereading Mr. Harris' earlier, and much more enjoyable, efforts. It would have better had he left the subject matter alone than to spoil \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" with this worthless dribble. The only enjoyment that I got out of it was a morbid fascination with how ridiculous the plot would resolve itself and in that I was not disappointed. I laughed my way through the final chapters as the character of Clarice Starling acted in a manner that was totally unexpected, without motivation, and unsupported by what Mr. Harris gave us of her character. That was the ultimate failure of the book. Another failure is the silly plot. Basically we must wade through an implausible, ridiculously elaborate scheme by a victim of Dr. Lecter to enact revenge on him by feeding him to man-hungry pigs. Let me repeat, to feed him to man-hungry pigs. Since Dr. Lecter is now the hero of the book, it was necessary for Mr. Harris to contrive a villain that could eclipse the cannibalistic rage of Hannibal. The absurd character of Mason Verger was designed for this. From his grotesque appearance to his evil intentions he is more comic book than character. There is nothing believable about him and he sits as flatly on the page as if he were sketched in ink and watercolor. Mr. Harris surrounds Verger with the typical stock evil henchmen that only need money to motivate them to set up his elaborate plot for Dr. Lecter. Will Really big pigs eat Dr. Lecter? Will Clarice Starling decide to do her job and pursue the evil Lecter? Will the faceless Verger die and elaborate death of his own? Do we care?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's hard to say what went wrong with this novel. The raw materials for a great sequal to 'The Silence of the Lambs' are all there. Our favorite characters are back; perhaps not in the situations we imagined them, but true to their natures nonetheless. The initial situations are believable, and consistent with the world Harris created in his previous novels. As the novel progresses, however, it spirals farther and farther away from believability. I suppose that's my complaint. What made 'Red Dragon' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' so engrossing and terrifying was plausibility. We all hope that we don't know anyone like the Tooth Fairy or Buffalo Bill, but we know that we might. 'Hannibal', on the other hand, reads more like a grotesque James Bond novel than anything else. The villain is a physically repulsive man of limitless wealth and influence, surrounded by henchmen who are drawn in caricature. The action in the last third of the book grows increasingly fantastic, to the point that I expected to find, in the last chapter, that the book was all a fevered dream of Agent Starling's. The ending was not at all what I wished for in this novel. Still, an unexpected conclusion can be effective if it is consistent with what we know of the principal characters and the world they inhabit. I simply could not believe that the resolution of the story in 'Hannibal' could be drawn from the actions of the main characters. It seemed driven by outside forces (i.e. Harris' imagination) with no regard for the net result.One more annoyance. There is a scene in the novel which places Hannibal Lecter in the middle seat in the coach section of a trans-Atlantic flight, next to an annoying small boy. This had great potential to be gruesomely funny. Instead, not only did the scene come to an unsatisfying close, but it served no purpose in furthering the plot. I felt cheated, and I suppose that is as good a characterization of my feelings toward the book as a whole as any."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One of the most ridiculously stupid novels I have ever had the misfortune to have read. The plot defies belief, the characters are thin, plywood cut-outs and the resolution is silly enough to make you wonder if Thomas Harris went insane while writing it. I mean, I actually thought I was losing my mind as I ploughed through the last fifty pages. I nearly checked myself into the nearest psychiatric hospital, complaining of hallucinations and imagined story lines that made no coherent sense.I can only conclude that Thomas Harris wrote this lousy, terrible book for the massive crates of money currently being shipped over to his house. The only benefit that may come out of it (for the rest of us, that is, not Mr Harris) is that De Laurentis might actually turn it into a film. If he does then go and buy a ticket, I really implore you. You may never get the chance to see something this funny ever again.(&quot;More brain, Clarice?&quot;&quot;Only if you have one of the pigs bring it over.&quot;)Definitely, absolutely enough said."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Who would have guessed that such an expertly rendered series would degenerate into harlequin romance so suddenly and compeletely? To be fair, I was enthralled for the first 98% of this novel. It was the last 2% that I found so utterly disappointing. My advice to a prospective reader is to buy the cheapest paperback copy of this book that you can find and rip out the last chapter. If I had omitted the final chapter from my reading, I would have given Hannibal a 4-star rating instead of 1."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you liked Silence of the Lambs, let it end there. You will thank me later. This story has none of the horror, none of the compelling drama. The only it had in common with its predecessor was that it used the same names. Apparently if you use the same names from book to book you dont have to use their same personalities. I was severly disappointed with Thomas Harris' fourth attempt."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It has been three years since this book burst onto the market place and was given the hysteric fanfare and critical acclaim from the likes of the 'Guardian' and the 'New York Times Book Review'. At that moment in history it appeared this book could do no wrong - a perfect thriller and a triumph for the literary establishment. After finally reading it last night, I'd have to say that the general response from these distinghed critics was way over the top. The novel is good, but not that good. Harris was true to his successful formula and as a result, managed to sell a lot of books. Contrary to popular opinion, however, ~Hannibal~ pales in comparison to its predecessors. And it fails on many counts.The success of the 'Hannibal' trilogy is an intriguing one. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is without question, the story's appeal. Here is the manifestation of a monster with god-like qualities: the archangel Lucifer in the guise of a psychiatrist. Lecter is the fallen angel in human form - the spoilt prodigy child forced to live amongst human beings who he sees as nothing more than chimpanzees. Exiled from paradise, he's hell-bent on making trouble, ensuring the great cosmic experiment will fail. Most of us have 'sympathy for the devil' because we're all essentially in the same boat. There are moments in our lives that we too feel exiled from heaven, and can relate to the devil's resentment. Hannibal is a mythological figure in modern form; he's Milton's Satan with a medical degree. The novel is a distilled version of a missing chapter in 'Paradise Lost' in the guise of a paperback thriller.The novel moves along well up to the point where we are told why Dr. Lecter does what he does...the reason for his cannibalism and his hatred for the world. This particular causal explanation struck me as much too easy: something a first year psychology undergraduate would dream-up...and it was disappointing. The 'true' evil in the novel is the antagonist, Mason Verger - a maimed pedeophile with a penchant for drinking the tears of abused children. This is a disturbing idea. Harris has a disturbing imagination; but the Verger character isn't smart enough to manifest something a subtle as this insanity - he would have come up with something a lot more sinister and sophisticated for exacting revenge on the good doctor. The Verger character didn't pan out; he simply was too melodramatic to the point of absurdity.To Harris's credit, the ending was a surprising one. The Starling character, in the previous book, was a person that most of us could relate to...a virtuous individual fighting the good fight. Harris turns this around, however, and the reason(s) given for Starling's fall from grace is weak. That said, the last fifty pages describing the therapy exchange between Lecter and our tainted maiden is chilling.The myth of Hannibal Lecter is an old one. But Harris gives us nothing new, and pessimistically presents us with a future of no hope. Even the Starling's of the world will fall from grace, and there's nothing we can do about it. In this round, at least, evil takes the upper hand."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris began the Hannibal Lector trilogy interestingly in Red Dragon, then developed it to a nice edge with Silence of the Lambs. This final piece of the tryptich, however, is simply bad all around. I sense Harris had grown barnacles on his earlier fascination with erudite, sophisticated Dr. Lector and simply wanted to play out some rather silly, adolescent fantasies gleaned from 1950s horror comic books. Eating some's brains while they're still alive? Seducing (unconvincingly) Starling the arch FBI agent to the dark side? Eaten by pigs? (Well, okay, that played for laughs very well in the movie Snatch, but it WAS for laughs).While Harris might have continued to play Lector against the thick-as-brick minions of Law and Order and used him as a clever foil for society's other evils, instead we have an exagerrated, over-the-top caricature of \\"evil gone astray\\" like a boogie man from a warped Willy Wonka factory. If this was intended as heavy-handed satire, Mr. Harris needs to take lessons from Gunter Grass, Thomas Berger, and others who have done it much better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal reaffirms my long held personal theory that most contemporary authors have only 1-3 (maybe 4) good books in their careers. ie: Mario Puzo &amp; The Godfather-Stephen King had maybe 4. While I thoroughly enjoyed Black Sunday, Red Dragon and even managed to find some literary salvation in Silence of The Lambs, it is clear (at least to me) that with Hannibal, Mr Harris has, like his aforementiond contemporaries, finally touched the bottom of the barrell. It will be interesting to see if he tries to redeem himself with a sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book gets 4 stars, the audio a zero. One of the main characters has a speech impediment and the reader has taken too much poetic license-ie. you can't understand a word he is saying.After the first 4 painful tapes (we were driving from Dallas to St. Louis) we had to go by the book to see what we missed and to finish the book.Tapes were quickly returned for a refund. As readers of the book, you already know that Mason's &quot;speech&quot; was properly written in the book. But the tapes- &quot;bhey er erribul&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well worth the long wait after Silence. True, Silence was a great novel (as were Red Dragon and Black Sunday); but Harris gets credit by not rehashing the same thing. The insight into Hannibal's character is intriguing and fascinating. The evilness and hypocrisy in this book is vivid. I enjoyed the whole novel; those who have not anticipated what they wanted to read, not what the author had devised."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've just wasted one day of my life reading what was meant to be the long awaited sequel to Red Dragon and SOTL.

At no time was it believable, therefore it was never even mildly frightening. The premise was ridiculous. The execution was even worse.

Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited for the sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; for 10 years, and I suppose nothing could live up to my expectations. However, I did NOT expect Clarice Starling's bizarre behavior at the end of Harris's work; in fact, there was no motivation for it that I could find in the book to justify it. Unless, perhaps, Dr. Lecter performed a lobotomy on her, without our knowing it? What a major disappointment... The reader is provided with a complex villain in Mason Verger, however."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a disappointment! I had been eagerly awaiting the continuation of the Hannibal Lecter story. What a let down! The plot was completely unbelieveable and the character development was nothing like this book's predecessor. I wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to get this book as soon as it was released. My only hope is we DON'T see this weak story on the silver screen. Silence of the Lambs was one of the BEST adaptations I have ever seen from a book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I eagerly anticipated this book.

I just didn't want to stop reading this, and I was sad when it ended, I wanted the bizarre journey to continue! The others who have trashed this great work have obviously missed something, and attacking Mr. Harris is unjustified, his work was creative, taking the saga of Lecter in a totally different direction. The ending was so wild, I couldn't believe it, and I loved it, all at once."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was nasty. I wish it were a crime for something to be printed in haste.

The story dragged, there was very little 'suspense'. The ending absolutely destroyed the whole 'Hannibal' reading experience. I probably will not purchase another book by this author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An excelllent book with the most in depth and accurate description of foreign surroundings that I have read in a long time.Dr Lecter has long been one of the most intriguing and menacing fictional characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about.Much criticism has been levelled against the book and in my opinion it is totally unwarranted in that most people when reading have &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; foremost in their minds and while there are similarities Harris in my opinion opts for a slightly different direction supplying us with two monsters who both play heavily in the occurences of the book instead of just the one.It was fascinating to see one of Lecters old victims attempt to rid the earth of the good doctor.Many have said that Lecter is humanised in this book which may,depending on your view of humanity,be true however Lecter performs acts of butchery in this book that would make you check under your bed at night regardless of how long its been since you done it last.In summary Lecter was nothing more that a spectator in the previous novels and as such little was know of his past or much else for that matter.The new book\`s title says it all and thus a closer examination of Lecter was inevitable.I cannot understand how Harris can be criticised by some for his portrayal of lecter when in actual fact we learned so little about him until now."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had been waiting for this book since the furor died down from Silence of The Lambs... and I was not disappointed. This novel was hard to put down, keeping me up late at night and causing me to sleep in a few days from reading so late.I won't give away any key portions, or spoil the ending; but some other reviewers here seem to feel that the ending was awful, or that things didn't turn out to their liking. Well, my thoughts are that the ending is awesome (if this ever hits the big screen, as with many scenes in the movie, I will bet they'll Disneyize it and sanitize it for the frail public). The book drips detail, as is Harris' style, but has a dark shadow cast over it for most of the story - almost like most of the story took place at night even if it didn't. This novel is not as stuff or pretentious as a Tom Clancy novel... prepare to get your hands dirty.Mr. Harris - you can rest now. This is the finest work of fiction I have read in the past several years. You should give workshops to many of your contemporaries and school them in the ways of the world."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Where &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; explored the psychology of the serial killer and provided thrilling plots to boot, &quot;Hannibal&quot; takes a different tack. It goes for the gross-out. Calling this a disappointment is an understatement. Believability doesn't even seem to have been a consideration here, and Harris betrays (or causes outright reversals) in the nature of characters he developed solidly in earlier books. I have to wonder what Harris was doing for eleven years. It certainly can't have been working on &quot;Hannibal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dr. Hannibal Lecter returns with a method behind his madness. In this book we find that as twisted as the good doctor may be there is always someone who can take it to another level. Harris has written a brilliant novel, which despite its gore and brutality allows you to see into the characters personalities. I tip my hat to Thomas Harris, it was worth the wait."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This follow up is without the riveting desciption of forensic science and investigation that drive the first two books. Unlike Red Dragon and Silence, Harris includes description after description of gruesome acts without any relevant context and these scenes lack a great deal of tension. The thin psychological forays into Lecter and Starling are without significant revelations and are fairly boring. Harris has obviously been paid well for this effort, but it feels like he wasn't engaged in even a remote way for the story development.My recomendation: Don't buy, don't read and don't bother. After spending the time reading this poorly written book, I felt like re-reading Silence of the Lambs to regain my appreciation of riveting writing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Stephen King's review was right on the money. This is a fascinating story. It is condensed to some degree, and each character seems to have only one single moment in his or her life that defines his or her personality. Taking time to develop each character more completely would have made this a 1000 page tome. As it stands, a quick read with a good story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Stephen King's review was right on the money. This is a fascinating story.

The book went so far into detail that instead of forming a picture in your mind it created a world. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is described with such brillance and elegance than any other charachter I have read in a book. The end was the best part of all. I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this book entertaining but a little hokey. Come on &quot;killer pigs&quot;. Lets just say I was more than a little dissapointed by the ending of the book. What happened to our heroine? Silence of the Lambs was edge of your seat reading,this book just could not seem to pick up the same momentum."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've never been one for mysteries, but I picked up this one, because I had seen Silence of the Lambs. All I can say is Wow! This is a quick read, with scenes and action on every page. Despite the sometimes gruesome parts, it keeps the reader breathless throughout. And the ending was . . . well, I really don't want to say how it ended. It just wouldn't be fair.For lovers of the unusual, this is a great book. Just beware what you order at dinner . . ."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Nevermind the fact that I really hate books with foreign language phrases inserted all over the place. It's like going into a room and then asking to leave and then coming back in. I too was very disappointed in the ending to this book. Totally out of character for Clarice to become a cannibal and flashing forward 3 years to find out that her and Hannibal are lovers. It took Harris 10+ years to come with this? Please give me a break."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I am terribly disappointed to see Lector and Starling come to such a mediocre end. In Harris' previous books there was always a twist - a surprise. The plot in this book is so thin and predictable I am not sure that Mr. Harris' creative well hasn't run dry."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although I saw the excellent film adaptation of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, this was the first Thomas Harris book I have undertaken. In HANNIBAL, we are introduced to a veritable pantheon of villains, from the disfigured, paralyzed Mason Verger, to the corrupt Florentine lawman Pazzi, to the vengeful, scheming OIG-man Krendler. A gang of murderous Sardinian thugs is thrown in for good measure. Dr. Hannibal Lecter can't compete very well with so much evil, so Harris gives us a kinder, gentler insane cannibal in the title role. Harris handles the character transition very well, but he gets into problems by trying to so the same with the main protagonist, FBI agent Clarice Starling. I can't go into details without giving away too much, but suffice it to say that both the means by which her character is changed, and the ultimate product into which it evolves, is simply not justified by the action leading up to it. Ultimately, the ending, which seems rather rushed, is grossly unsatisfying.I do have to grant kudos to Thomas Harris for the style of writing. His venture into Italian culture and history is engrossing and makes me want to learn more about it. His descriptions of scenes involving Dr. Lecter's elegance, sophistication, and culinary skills are positively poetic.For this unabridged audio version the reader is veteran English stage, TV, and film actor Daniel Gerroll. As the story opens, Gerroll seems a little rushed, distracted even, and my first thought was, &quot;Oh no, another bored Hollywood actor slumming for a few bucks in the audiobook studio.&quot; If you have the same first impression, just be patient. After the first scene, Gerroll quickly finds his pace, and his interpretation is a real treat. When he describes Italian culture and Dr. Lecter's pomp and finery, his British accent is a delight. However, when it's time to portray American regional accents, he slips effortlessly into those just as well. Ultimately, it is an excellent reading, one of the best in my admittedly brief experience with audiobooks."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read _Red Dragon_ and _Silence of the Lambs_, I had looked forward to _Hannibal_, Mr. Harris' latest novel. While the language and prose was up to par, I never found the story very engaging. Worse, I never felt any sense of dread or suspense throughout the novel. There are parts that detail grisly murders, but it was more a sense of repulsion than true horror. I think I could have forgiven such short-comings, but then the ending left me completely baffled. After reading it several times, I puzzled out what exactly happened, but it left me feeling disbelief for the way events turned out. I certainly will not spoil the ending, however I will say that I found it highly unlikely.For the style and prose, as well as beautiful descriptions of Florence, I give it three stars, but I cannot say that I recommend it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A delicious novel! It kept me reading into the night. Seeing how the Dcotor became who and what he is was the most satisfying (if shocking) part. Certainly disturbing, it's not for everyone... but if you crave an intelligent horror novel, this ones a keeper!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ugh! This book was awful. I read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and thought they were great. This was simply &quot;let's have fun with canibalism&quot;. Until the last 100 pages or so, it was boring. Those pages were more gripping, but the ending was horrible. Until I got to it, I thought there was a chance that the majority of the book was going to be redeemed by the ending. Not so. I can't say enough how much I hated this book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was an interesting read, primarily becasue Harris is (certainly in this instance) a master teller of story, and can set a scene and describe minutae and description in a great way. The book is great fun to read, if somewhat lacking in not only believability, but plausability. The fashion in which Harris writes is quite compelling. Unfortunately, the book seems to get bogged down in scenes which become way over-the-top, and ultimately an ending which, while believable in the context of fiction, not in keeping with the integrity of the characters. It will indeed be interesting to see how the film version will be adapted, and even if it is untrue to the book (posibly a plus), it would have to be amazing to be even half as good as The Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal the book is not). I can see why jodie Foster turned down the role, but it may not have been for the level of gore or violence, but rather the almost inane ending. But, given all that, I still enjoyed reading the book, and give it a marginal recommendation."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't believe that I wasted 500 pages worth of time on this atrocity of fiction. The characters are loathesome and uninteresting, not to mention laughable and absurd. I kept on reading only to the belief that it has to get better. I never read the Silence of the Lambs, but if it was anything like this, they must have done a lot of rewrites pre-production for the film version. News that Jodi Foster doesn't want to be a part of this film adaptation is no surprise, in fact I hope they scrap the whole idea. This book, with no other better way to say it, is so stupid. The only reason that a book of this caliber could ever make the NY Times best-seller list has got to be the herd instinct of readers. I am only sorry that I went along with them. Don't be a part of the herd."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is truly a case of living in a society that has been numbed by violence and morbit thought alike. The book \\"Hannibal\\" is the worst kind of deforestation. It would be easier to digest the let-down of this work if there had not been moments of great promise along the way.With out destroying the integrity of the suspense A would be reader should be forewarned that in this book Starling's most treasured qualities, the very ones that drew us to her are replaced by sheer lunacy and immature fiction.First and formost it is a novel. But anyone who reads this book can see why an actress the caliber of Jodie Fosterwould dismisses this storyline. An in fact, with out a major overhaul of the ending the film version will not play in America."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm so dissappointed. I eagerly read this book only to find narry a character that I cared about, was interested in, reviled, or even pitied. Definitely a sorrowful sequel to Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It almost seems as if Harris rushed through the book, when he had years to write it. It is very disjointed and constantly told from the same banal perspective and therefore reads like a screenplay and not like a novel. The ending is completely out of character and the events that transpire leading up to it are so odd, that they are just wrong; they do not fit into context at all."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If I had to sum up my feelings in one word, it would be &quot;ambivalent.&quot; The ending was disturbing (I finished the book at night and had trouble sleeping) so, as a horror novel, one could argue that the book was successful.But as disturbing as I found the ending, I'm not convinced that it made sense given the characters and their arcs. Moreover, what Harris does to generate empathy for Lecter detracts, I think, from the quality of Lecter's character. The great thing about Lecter in the prior books, particularly SOTL, is that he was monstrous and there was no reason for his monstrosity (&quot;Nothing happened to me. I happened&quot;). Now, all of a sudden, we're privy to his childhood trauma and can almost excuse his prior acts. And his acts of mayhem in the current book tend towards self-protection.There's much to commend in this book. But the ending and the devices used to generate easy empathy for Hannibal may leave a bad taste in your mouth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a &quot;can't put it down&quot; novel that twists and turns like a moray eel. Thomas Harris has written a sequel that doesn't seem like one. Scary, surprising, and superb writing make this horror book a must read. It's no fariy tale, but if you enjoyed any other books with Dr. Lecter, or just enjoy a horror story real enough to make you a little afraid of the dark, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I prepared myself while waiting for this book by re-reading The Silence of the Lambs. That was a good preparation, because you have probably forgot some of the lesser characters which return in Hannibal. But: Since The Silence... was such a fantastic read, and since we have been waiting so many years to see what happened with Dr Lecter, I set my expectations way too high. Hannibal is well worth reading, but don't expect it to be as good as or better than the previous two books. I'd rate this one about as good as Red Dragon but not as good as The Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In this satisfying sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Thomas Harris avoids ripping himself off-the blight of most sequels. Like in his earlier work, the story is riveting and the characters are mesmerizing. The only problem is the ending, which, though intriguing, is not quite believable"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":". . . for those people who had a concrete idea of what they wanted _Hannibal_ to be. There's a lot of outrage out there, but somehow I don't feel any. Maybe because I'm young: my suspension of disbelief is in unusually good working order. I accepted the story as it was. I read the book without knowing the first thing about it, plot-wise; didn't even read the cover blurbs. I didn't read it critically. School's out and I wanted a good book. As far as I'm concerned, I found one.Clarice Starling's life is changing rapidly, and she's not supposed to be the same person she was in Silence. If she was, that would be a cheat -- it's too easy to keep stock characters. Lecter's life is very different as well -- he's free, but his freedom is in great danger. He grows and changes with the book, and while there have been criticisms of Harris' making Hannibal human instead of keeping him a &quot;scary monster,&quot; I found the development refreshing. The boogeyman's scary because he hides in the dark, but after awhile, the light goes on, you stop believing, you stop being scared. I would have been disappointed if the novel hadn't made Lecter more human than monster; it would have been too easy to continue scaring people. Instead, Harris makes you think.Whether or not you like the book depends entirely on what you bring to it. If you want a good story, if you don't mind being shocked and considering the reasons for your reactions, then read this book. It'll keep you up at night -- not out of fear, but amazement and intrigue. The ending, which could so easily have been spoiled, was believable, daring and impressive. At least in my opinion. Please, please read it for yourself -- you won't be sorry, if you like a good story more than an easy story, and recognize the difference."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"HANNIBAL by Thomas Harris is a daring and provocative novel, one that dares to shatter expectations without apologies. Harris manages to question the conventions of his chosen genre by examining different manifestations of what could be considered evil. Readers may find Harris' depictions of bureaucratic and political psychopathology more disturbing than the more straightforward acts of violence depicted.Better yet, HANNIBAL examines the relationship between Starling and Lector in an audacious, unflinching way. Harris, who refused to view the film version of SILENCE OF THE LAMB, offers a ghoulish finale which will defy the mainstream even as it provokes thought in readers who enjoy something new and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book has managed to carry on the horrific and sometimes sickening story of Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lector. The detail and description of each and every scene, sound, and environment is a credit to Harris' brilliant writing style. The only potential part of the story that seems to flow out of bounds is the ending. It simply seems to implausible to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot;; even for the most passionate Hannibal supporter."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't waste eye movement on this book. If there were no stars possible, that it what this should receive. Inconceivably disappointing, incredibly weird and illogical, too many holes in the plot to plug with an octopus. Ridiculous premises and implausible actions. Limp effort at horrifying the reader presumably to mask the absence of a plot leading to a laughable ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An author of genius has succumbed to pressure; the book feels as awkward as a seven month fetus. Perhaps the wait was too long, and the expectation too high, but I know I gasped out loud when I saw that the book was being published, and I gasped with horror when I read it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought that this book was exceptional, in the fact that it left everyone who read it with a vaguely disturbed feeling. It seems prepostorous on the outside; Why in the world would that pair work out? Clarice Starling is immortalized for her sharp thinking skills, and unbreakable set of morals. And yet, part of me is wondering. Is there any other way the story could have worked? Hannibal is Hannibal. Clarice is Clarice. But throughout silence of the lambs, we had that enticing dialogue and exchanges between these two adversaries. When the FBI betrays Starling, is there anyone else she can depend on the protect her. I, personally, loved the ending. There is no way anyone could have predicted it, which drives innumerable people crazy. Please read the book, and decide for yourself. Every review here is valid. I suggest, however, that you make your own."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"show that Harris continues to create characters who are uniquely his own. If you expected a cookie cutter sequel to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, you may be disappointed. I wasn't, and thoroughly enjoyed the outlandishly psychotic behavior of each personality. Afterall, this is the story of Lecter and Starling who are, oddly enough, attracted to each other from the outset. Add to this strange fascination of Starling's moth to Lecter's dangerous flame; a former child molester who had been a client of Dr. Lecter's and had made the mistake of offending Hannibal's sense of decency, paying for it with a loss of face, literally; now out to seek revenge...well, what can we expect? Crazy people don't behave sanely. I liked the twists and shuddered at all the right places. Harris writes to please himself and those of us willing to accept the bizarre antics of his characters, aren't offended."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Boy, what a disappointment. Including this summer's Phantom Menace, I have now been left utterly flat by two events I've anticipated for over a decade. Mr. Harris has an obvious disdain for his readers. I almost got the feeling that he was writing angrily, as though he felt put upon by all the demands for a sequel . The sequences in Italy were very good, and should have served as the opening of the book. Starling should have been in the career predicament she was in. All of that was fine. But Mason Verger and his sister Margot ? Was mister Harris writing a sequel to Silence of the Lambs or a new James Bond movie with a half-baked villain and his stereotypical sidekick? If you wanted to bring a past victim back to seek vengeance on Lecter, why not his ultimate victim, Will Graham from Red Dragon? I would have created a scenario where Lecter wreaked the havoc he does in Italy (you'll have to read the book to find out what havoc, exactly), and the FBI gets wind of it via VICAP. Starling, who is in the doghouse because of the shooting described at the book's beginning (again, read the book...this part is not too bad), is given a second chance by Jack Crawford who assigns her the mission of apprehending Lecter. In order to do this, however, and since she has never actually apprehended him, Crawford orders her to seek out and work with Will Graham, ex FBI agent and original captor of Lecter in Red Dragon. In Silence, we learned that Francis Dollarhyde had, with Lecter's long-range assistance, attacked Graham and his family. Although Dollarhyde was killed in the process, Graham was left horribly disfigured ( I believe the description of his face was \\"like a Picasso\\" and his wife and child left him. Starling would have to convince the now disfigured and alcoholic Graham to help her, then wonder throughout the book whether he would, when the moment of truth came, help her, or look to revenge himself on Lecter. In addition to this, fans of the two earlier books would have enjoyed the cat and mouse between Lecter and his nemesis (Graham) and his favorite (Starling). The movie tie in to this would have been tremendous, since Dino De Laurentis owns the rights , and he made the original Manhunter, based on Red Dragon. Hopefully, when the movie does get made, it will have a more coherent and believable plot line that will respect our intelligence and not insult it as the last third of this unfortunate book does."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After finishing Hannibal last night I just had to go in and read the other 117 reviews left by the other readers and I have to agree with all of them, even the ones that loved this book. I waited 11 years to read anything by Thomas Harris and I wish he had picked a new topic and not mined the fields using Hannibal and Clarice. Apparently Mr. Harris has such major mojo with the publisher he gets away with having his book unedited. No editor worth their salt would have let Hannibal out without making a few major changes. The ending (and no I won't give it away for people that haven't read the book) is so stupid and unbelievable, I thought surely any minute the characters would wake up and realize it's a dream. Also did anyone else find all the major name dropping of the finer things in life annoying? Is Thomas Harris really trying to make a commentary on the moronic masses by having Hannibal looking down at the way the average person lives and eats and dresses? I really felt cheated since this book robbed me of several hours of my precious time that I could have spent on something else. For those that love Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs don't despair there are still auhors out there writing good novels. Pick up anything by Kent Harrington (Dark Ride or Dia de los Muertes) and you will have a new favorite author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Rather than rehash the Hunter-Hunted angst he created in the first two novels, Thomas Harris goes off in a bold startling new direction. Like the difference between James Whale's orginal 'Frankenstein' and the long awaited sequel 'Bride of Frankenstein', Harris transplants his tortured characters from serious gothic to a wild pitch black comedy in order to keep them fresh and interesting. This novel is surely going to let down those who want a rehash of the more serious tone of the first two novels. But that type of story has been done to death in endless knock offs by Patterson, Cornwell and the like. I loved this beautiful sick novel and will never in my life forget the startling tableau of Lecter and Starling at the dinner table 'having their revenge.' I cannot imagine how they will ever make this into a movie and don't care. Harris has taken the exhausted serial killer genre and dropped kicked it into the new millennium."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is NOT the sequel I expected.This book is NOT the sequel most of those who have SEEN Silence of the Lambs will expect.This book is NOT the sequel most of those who have read - like me - both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs.This book is all of these things.It is also quite simply brilliant.Don't let your own expectations blind you what Harris is created."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Have you ever had the experience where you pick up a glass of liquid and think &quot;ah, ginger ale... this is going to taste good&quot;, and then it turns out to be champagne instead? Your first reaction is &quot;yuck..this ginger ale tastes really weird&quot;. Then, after it sits on your tongue for a minute, you stop defining it by your expectations and realize, &quot;oh, it isn't ginger ale. It's champagne. Wow, this is great.&quot;That's how I reacted to &quot;Hannibal&quot;. It's so truly creative and unique and odd that it defies definition. Thinking of it as a &quot;thriller&quot; doesn't work. It's an exploration of nihilism and perversion meticulously crafted by a brilliant writer.Reading this was like looking at some of Mapplethorpe's more perverted photography or reading the graphic sex scenes in Nabokov's &quot;Lolita&quot;. You're enticed by the plot and delighted by Harris' writing style and then you feel this convulsion in your stomach and you realize that what you've read is truly grotesque . &quot;Upsetting&quot; is one of those words that critics banter about.... you see it plastered on the cover of thriller after thriller. Well &quot;Hannibal&quot; is upsetting, and I'm not talking about the cannibalism. I'm talking about the ending.Clarice Starling has always been a very appealing character to me. The picture of her twangy, abrasive rural accent and lack of social charms move her beyond the realm of &quot;good guy&quot; to that of nice human being. Dr. Lecter manages to annihilate her as a person. It's beyond murder. The ending of this book is one of the darkest things I've ever read.I'm appalled by this book, but it's so unique that I feel an incredible admiration for Thomas Harris. It would have been easy for him to crank out a scary, thriller and instead he's produced something much more complex."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has satisfied his faithful readers with a tour de force that uncovers even worse villains than the evil Dr Lecter. No skip reading here, his prose demands every word be savored. As Hannibal nears the end, a final twist is added, that no one can anticipate!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I confess that I have not read Red Dragon or Silence of the Lamb, but still I have read Hannibal and I am not biased by previous Harris works. Firstly, I love and hate this book at the same time! I don't know how this happened, but by the end I was dismayed, disappointed and thinking about it non-stop. The novel seems a collaboration of Anne Rice and Tom Clancy. Set in romantic settings with a definite sense of paranoia, with eccentric characters throw into the mix. Hey, I wasn't expecting gypsies!!! I respect the choices Harris made with this novel even if I don't agree with them. Case in point--Lecter will never be a sympathetic character in my opinion. Despite the extreme reactions to this book, by fans, I recommend it as a good distraction. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I agree with the NY Times review. It's not as good as &quot;...Lambs...&quot; It's much better. Except for a slight loosening of his story telling reins at the very end (I guess he's entiled to a bit of whimsy), Thomas keeps his plot taut, spare, and targeted like an arrow (crossbow?) headed to the bull's eye. A pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has an increadible gift for bringing life's less pleasant aspects to a stunning, if not brutal light. While not for the squeemish, Harris is true to form and true to his charectors. If, after seeing the movie, you expect Anthony Hopkin's &quot;Lecter,&quot; think again. As a charector, Lecter is written evil, without apology, and he makes no bones (forgive the pun) about it. If you search for safe summer reading, pick up Danniel Steel, but if you want to be scared and intruiged, this book is perfect."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have only seen the movie &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; before reading Hannibal so I wasn't sure if I was going to like the book or not but decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed, well not till the ending but it was original I must admit. I was pulled through the book very fast and it always kept my interest. I now plan on buying the first two books so I get the complete Triology."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Where to start? It needed a better concept, then some actual editing. &quot;Hannibal&quot; mistakenly tries to recast the scary psycho into a somewhat sympathetic protector of Clarice Starling. As a result, I wasn't scared any more. I also was annoyed that Dr. Lecter is apparently some kind of martial arts master who's virtually unstoppable (how'd he get caught in the first place, then?). A big comedown from Harris' previous spare, straightforward, REALISTIC thrillers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have never before this read a Thomas Harris novel. I had seen &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; I am forever fascinated by the human mind and all it's complexities. I wonder about my own &quot;sanity&quot; at times. Harris reminded me that &quot;sanity&quot; is a word defined only by the context of the society one chooses. I found &quot;Hannibal&quot; fascinating reading and want to thank Mr. Harris for his research and the many years of his time that it took to spin this tale. It seems a shame that I took only 8-hours to read it. I devoured it and did not savor it as Dr. Lechter probably would have. It is time for me to go back to the Holy inspired Word of God as I have danced with the devil long enough and prefer the freedom of an ordered universe to that of chaos.Chaos is so tempting to me but ultimately so unsatisfying. Nevertheless, I felt this a well written book and of great entertainment value."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Talk about marketing hype - the book got treated to the same feeding frenzy attributed to The Phantom Menace, but unfortunately - and similiarly - fell short of certain expectations. One would expect that with name of the book being attributed to the villian, it would shed more light on his shadowy past but is instead treated to details on his (admittedly) impeccable taste in food, wine and the fine arts (good taste, by the way). His childhood is merely brushed away on thoughts of his late sister, Misha (whom he later replaces with Clarice) and his parents of nobility mentioned en passant. What of his childhood after the war? His early education? How did he develop his depravity (was he forced to eat Misha as well)? Like Darth Maul, none of it is ever fully explained (worse in Darth Maul's case - he was killed before any of it was known, but i digress). The Red Dragon had a more informative history.The ending, unfortunately, had an alarcrity that suggested gun-induced pressure on the author's part...read for yourself and see. Bad editing too, the resultant of a lesson on how not to rush a masterpiece.Recommended for those who thought the film Ravenous had no artistic flair to it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished the book and I'll merely give my strongest impressions.First, the ending actually saved it for me because it unleashed the same level of shock and distress that was much more common in &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; It was dark and gothic, where much of the preceding parts of the novel seemed self-indulgent and overlong. The many chapters set in Italy were pedantic and arcane to little or no purpose (certainly no dramatic purpose) and the main Italian character was both overwrought and underdeveloped.Though it was used to better effect at the book's very end, in general I found the author's direct invitations to the reader(s) jarring and poorly integrated into the typical narrative style of the novel. This conceit was unexpected and unwelcome. &quot;Come with me now as we explore...&quot;To my mind Harris simply asked weak characters -- Verger and Pazzi-- to carry too much of the book, while deflecting attention from more interesting and familiar characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As Red Dragon is one of my favorite books, I was truly looking forward to this novel. I thought it was acceptable...until the last chapters! Overblown, unbelievable, over the top...it reminds me of My Fair Lady set in hell - ridiculous! It read like bad Anne Rice! One of the things I liked about Red Dragon and Silence was the realism and the gravity with which Harris treated the subject matter. Now Lechter only eats &quot;free range rude&quot; people and Starling is won over with cashmere and emeralds? Ugh..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"as Jed Clampet would say.. Pitty-full. Terrible compared to his prior masterworks. Inconsistancies.. Are we to believe that Lecter left a victim alive years ago.. who did not turn him in? (remember that Lecter was caught by the character in Red Dragon. But this book has a character who could have Identified him as the man who tore his face of..but did not? The Ending was so bad.. I gave the book away."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After waiting 7 years for the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, I was very disappointed in Hannibal. This story was mostly implausible to me especially the ending. Much of the time I felt that Mr. Harris was gratuitously gross. In my opinion, this book contained none of the subtilty of the first; everything was overdone. I also felt lost in much of the references to Italian culture; one would have to be a student of the classics to comprehend many of the references."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think a lot of readers expected the wrong thing from &quot;Hannibal&quot;. They wanted something that would act as the third part of a trilogy; to cap off these books as &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; did to &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Hannibal didn't really do that. However, the story is good enough to stand on its own, without the hype of &quot;SoTL&quot; to back it. Whereas in the previous books, Dr. Lecter was a complete mystery, &quot;Hannibal&quot; goes into his actual personality, his thoughts and reasons for things he has done. It shows Dr. Lecter as a person rather than an unexplainable monster. This is wildly different than his past portrayal. He seems to resemble one of the Crane brothers from &quot;Frasier&quot; more than a psychotic serial killer. Combine this with the surplus of disgustingly violent minor characters in the book, and Hannibal himself seems almost harmless.The only thing that really detracted from the quality of &quot;Hannibal&quot; was that it seemed Harris couldn't decide what he wanted to do with the book. Did he want to concentrate on Mason Verger's story of revenge, or did he want to elaborate on the strange relationship between Clarice and Hannibal? The story seems to fight between these two main points until the ending, which tied up all the loose ends in a thorough fashion and made use of a wonderful plot twist. I'll go against the crowd and say that I loved the ending. It was appropriately chilling for Harris-the type that sends shivers down your spine.All-in-all, &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a wonderful book and certainly worth reading once, twice, even three times. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am not a very fast reader. And I don't read that much fiction at all. But I could not put this book down. I began reading it on a Saturday and finished by Monday. It is a very good read. Its exciting and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Now I will say it is not for the squeamish. If anyone saw the film of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and it made you sick or really creaped you out then don't read this book. For everyone else, who saw that film, you have to read &quot;Hannibal&quot;. It is truly thrilling."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Compared to silence of the lambs, this book is awful. It reads like a movie script and unlike the last Hannibal book, I had no trouble putting it down. In fact many passages were boring. I would not sped the money. There is too much else out there worth reading"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, my review pretty much follows the general consensus. I liked it a lot up until the last hundred or so pages, and then it just became so weird and unbelieveable that I didn't know what to think. Mr. Harris certainly isn't a bad writer, but I'm not sure what his point is with the ending. I thought there were too many extraneous sub-plots, I thought the ark with Barney and Verger's sister was wholly un-necessary. Although I thought the Italy scene was awesome, especially the part when Lecter kills Pazzi. For any of you that have seen &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, the Pazzi death scene will be akin to the scene when Lecter suspends the guard from his cage with his guts hanging out, that scene will definitely stay peoples minds. The revenge plot was a little over-elaborate, although I can see how a bitter victim could have imagined such a &quot;fitting&quot; end to his enemy. I still don't think Starling would have ended up the way she did. Anyway, I'm hoping the movie will be a little better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book comes with a very unexpected end,but may be this is the only one probable.The loss of the Clarice Starling as a detective is great one,her charecterisation is superb,but in the end there is too much of a surprise ,maybe auther needs to exeplain few things.The 100th chapter of the book is simply crazy.We hope to hear more about Dr. and Starling.But the conclusion is that you never want to miss this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must agree with the other reviews that the ending was a great disappointment. Also I'm wondering why Hannibal turned out to be such a great guy after all. If he can understand Stephen Hawkin I don't understand why he can kill innocent people around and then fly away with the girl of his childhood dreams. The author is undoubtedly a good writer, and much of his research and knowledge are impressive, but for this book I really can't give a 5 star. I will wait for his next one for a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I actually quite enjoyed the book until the ending. Although I admit there were major flaws in it. All the main characters, except Starling, were just way over the top (even Starling changes quicker than Superman in a phone booth at the end). The main characters are all evil. Even poor old Barney is wheeled back in to be a bad guy. The man eating pigs were a bit too much. Surely there must have been better ways to torture a man than feed him to swine. I guess the pigs will be good fodder (pardon the pun) for the special effects people in the movie.Speaking of the movie, I suspect a lot of the book was written with this in mind. Even Lecter's mask miraculously reappears. Couldn't have a sequel without that in it, now could we? Same as a visit to the old cell and up pops one of the old inmates still living there even though the building is condemned (much in the same way as this book should be). Even the end seems to be designed to provide the requisite &quot;twist&quot; of many movie thrillers. I like a twist, but it must be believable. And there must be some hint at some point that it is coming, even though it is not recognisable at the time. As in Sixth Sense."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a dedicated Thomas Harris fan, I anxiously awaited the release of Hannibal and ran out and bought it in hardcover the first day. I can't deny that it a supurbly written novel--in all of it's ghastly, gruesome, and suspenseful pages. In the end, though, the book disappointed me because I don't feel that Harris stayed true to the characters of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. They both behaved in ways that they would never have considered in Silence of the Lambs. The story in and of itself is fabulous (as long as you don't have a weak stomach), but as part of a whole, it was a cop-out with the characters forgetting personal standards for plot convienance."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I greatly enjoyed his previous books and I eagerly anticipated reading &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Now all I can say after finishing the book is, &quot;What! &quot; The book had its good moments but there were long periods that lulled me to sleep. I felt that the author betrayed the two great characters of Lecter &amp; Starling with his awful conclusion, and in doing so, betrayed the fans that built his fame. Lecter's macabre mystique and power &amp; Starling's balance of strength and vulnerability? - the authors throws all of this out in this book like used kleenex. I would say it ranked with &quot;Godfather III&quot; in disappointing sequels. If you are a fan of Silence of the Lambs, my advice is: read the first half of Hannibal, then make up your own ending - you couldn't do any worse."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Say what you want about the ending. At least it wasn't a &quot;safe&quot; ending, with some high-toned victory by the law over the criminal, as we find in many &quot;thrillers&quot;. Perhaps Harris is reacting to the fame and popularity of the movie Hannibal, knows movie audiences really root for Dr. Lecter, and gives them what they want to their own professed disgust. Perhaps there is a subtextual meaning to the dreamy epilogue we just don't get. Or perhaps he is just setting up the next book, in which he Sets Things Right. It's hard to say at this point.Some readers are so emotionally conservative the over-react to an ending they don't know how to deal with and write an exaggeratedly negative review of the entire book, which isn't fair. Hannibal is mostly as thrilling as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. The stuff in Italy is brilliant, and the set up involving the nemisis is quite compelling. I don't see that much difference in literary style compared to the past Harris novels. I admit the ending is hard to swallow, but maybe it will make more sense when I read it a second time, or when the next book comes out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must admit despite some inconsistancies (ex. when did Clarice become a world class marksman? Certainly not in &quot;Silence of the Lambs!&quot;) I liked the first 450 pages of this book. Though I felt the descriptions in the Florence portion of the novel many times uninteresting and pedantic. Most readers would probably agree with me in that the Barney/Margot relationship was superfluous except as a plot device in the end. My problem, like many others, was with the ending. To describe it as Nihlistic would be kind. It is Absurdist!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I liked the book until the last 10 chapters. This ending made me so sick I cried. The first part of the book was great but I don't know if it makes up for the end. The only way I change my mind about the end of the screenplay, or soon to be screenplay, is if Thomas gets Courtney Love to remake the song &quot;Wind beneath my wings&quot; for the final scene of the movie. Then and only then will I change my mind."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed this book overall; however, be forewarned of the gruesome nature. Some of the descriptions of people/victims and activities is grotesque. It is a pretty fast read. I just don't &quot;buy&quot; the ending. I'm eager to &quot;hear&quot; what other people think, and even MORE eager to see how this book translates to the big screen."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I wasn't quite as intrigued as I was reading &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; what with the moth in the throat and the entomologists explanation, I have to say that this was one exciting, however, gory read. The whole swine thing really made me cringe in horror. But, you know, I really liked the ending. And, of course, throughout the whole read, I was able to picture Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in the lead roles. That made it so much better. Clarice, what's next? (Can't you always just hear how he says &quot;Clarice&quot;?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is true that the ending is a bit lacking, but you cannot deny that the language of the novel draws you in. Harris uses strong images boardering on horrific, that stick in the mind and give a sense of the madness within some of the characters. Krendler's fate is quite disturbing. One cannot judge a new book on the reputation of its prequels as can be done with movies. New novels may have the same characters, but they are an island to themselves."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Those who dislike this book probably prefer their melodrama relatively simple, White Hats vs. Black Hats. &quot;Hannibal&quot;offers anything but that. One notices partway through that one feels far more loathing for other characters than for the Doctor himself. This, for me, culminated before I realized it was happening, in a desire for Harris to aim Hannibal at these characters like a weapon. The &quot;fate&quot; of Clarice, while a complete surprise, was thoroughly prepared-for over two novels."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed this book, although I do feel this effort is Mr. Harris thumbing his nose at all those who begged for a sequel. The writing as usual is great, the characters &quot;fleshed&quot; out (with one glaring exception), and the plot quite intricate. I enjoyed it. I do not think any actor will take on the roles (as written). It would be another &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; fiasco. I read this book in one day - I had to find out the ending..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...it's something even better. Mr. Harris provided the template of the Obsessed Cop/ Serial Killer novel with &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; and perfected it with &quot;Silence Of the Lambs;&quot; rather than trying to outdo himself with &quot;Hannibal,&quot; he instead gave us something new; a fable in which every major character is capable of tremendous evil (including Clarice Starling). There are no Good Guys/Bad Guys in &quot;Hannibal,&quot; only Monsters..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've looked forward to the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; sequel for years, and boy was I disappointed w/Hannibal! I forced myself to finish it, thinking it was bound to get better. Sadly, it didn't! Wish I could get a refund!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although I enjoyed this read, I found myself reacting to this book much as I would to a vegetarian paella...where's the meat?It's hard to read Hannibal and not notice that much of it was written after the Starr Hearings. There were too many blunt references to the Clinton fiasco to ignore Harris's obsession. For a guy who focuses on minute details of Renaissance art, Harris fumbled current culture sadly.Throughout the book, Harris refers to Clarice being harassed by Paul Krendler, an executive in the Justice Department. From an FBI trainee who blows away Jame Gumb in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; to a dilatantte thirtysomething fretting about her existential void at the FBI and lack or decor in her living room, Clarice Starling has shriveled away to nothing more than a cartoon. The Clarice of old, had she been hustled by Krendler, would have eaten him for breakfast, so to speak, and still had room for brunch. Certainly, she didn't have to wait for Daddy Lector to saute him for dinner.Ardelia Mapp, the African-American valdectorian of Starling's FBI class, has disappeared into the bowels of the FBI. In real life, its hard to imagine that Mapp wouldn't be highly visual on television, briefing the press on the hunt for Hannibal Lector. In Hannibal, however she's wringing her hands and offering Clarice the phone number of a lawyer. What is Harris doing?By the time I was finished reading Hannibal, I expected a recipe for &quot;Sauce Monique&quot; rather than &quot;Krendler Saute.&quot; Clarice has disappeared into a cloud of voile, tucking her gun and identification into a lingerie drawer. It's hard to believe that Harris isn't mocking the dilattante feminist in many of us who voyeristicly snickered even as Lewinsky &quot;dined&quot; in the Oval Office."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book made me feel, it outraged me, it made me laugh, it made me wonder about myself - made me wonder about Harris! Are we readers the morbid throngs at a torture exhibit? Good books are not read passively, the end of this one had me clamping my hand over my mouth saying &quot;omigod, what is happening!?&quot; Harris has written a book in which unique characters dare to find a unique ending that stood me on my head, a story of a world where good is overwhelmed with treachery, horror, and deceit, evil is at least honest, and the only true choices we have are what we will allow in our own reach. I don't think I can stand to see Hollywood gut this book. And I don't want a sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If one has been to Florence, then he/she can almost smell the city; the imagery is that strong. As for the rest, well it did not hold together nearly as well as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. It is quite apparent that the ending is a set up for another book and another film, assuming this one is purchased by a studio. I did enjoy the book, but it is not the best thing I've read in the last two weeks."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Why the author spent so much time detailing Italian history and over looked the successful qualities included in his prior novels, was a mystery to me regarding this book. Where were the overviews of the technologies available for crime fighting as in the Red Dragon? Where was our protagonist? The author spent too much time trying to disgust me instead of working on an engaging story. Yes, the book kept me absorbed, but only to make me feel I had wasted my time reading it in the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An incredibly long, wordy, disgusting story with no real plot. All the characters, except Clarice, were horrible people who committed unbelievably revolting acts that could only have been included for the shock value (and &quot;make me want to vomit&quot; value). In the end, even Clarice dissapoints. I found it hard, despite (or perhaps because of) the detail, to actually follow some of the actions. It was somewhat interesting to learn more about Hannibal's motivations, but I would have preferred hearing those parts from someone who had read the book rather than subjecting myself to the entire story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris got all the hype and then left us holding the bag. Characters are unbelievable and the ending out of this world. To wait so long for the sequal to Silence of the Lambs is a big letdown. Book could be half its size and tell twice the story. Gore is in with Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"thomas harris must have gotten tired while writing Hanibal. Well written but poor imagination throughout and especially toward the end. let us hope that he can redeme himself with his next book ."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book was a great read considering the nasty content in some of the scenes.....but all that is for naught because our office is in total controversy over the ending. My question is this, very simple, was Clarice all drugged out for the remained of her life or did she actually fall in love with Hannibal? I say she was drugged every day, that's the only way she would stay with Hannibal. My manager says she was drugged at first, but then fell under his spell. We have gone back and reread it several times, each stressing our point and finding passages to back up our claims. Who is right? My e-mail is jweimar@tu.infi.net"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How discouraging to have read the entire literary work, riveted to each word, only to discover that I had exhausted hours of my precious time for nothing. The ending left me unsure just where Mr. Thomas Harris will commence with his next novel. I have no doubt that he clearly has his work cut out for him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited for this book with more anticipation than probably any other book I have ever read. The need for Harris to provide details that got more graphic as the story progressed is nothing but a shock ploy. While I loved his other books this offering has poor character development and worse plot flow. If this is what takes him all these years to produce I for one will not be anxiously awaiting another."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"after all that hype, I'm just glad I bought it through amazon and saved some $$. Until the creepy but totally unbelievable ending, the plot was predictable, and the writing pretentious. But I felt compelled to keep reading, just like rubberneckers feel compelled to watch a gory traffic accident, wondering what gross and disgusting thing will happen next.True the ending is creepy, and it caught me by surprise, but the reason why it did was because the characters did not act &quot;in character&quot;-- Harris created these people and gave them personalities and motivations, and they just did not act true to form here. The other characters (including Clarice!) were 2-dimensional comic book stereotypes; shallow at best-- racist, sexist, and homophobic at worst. I just couldn't get interested in them.And unlike SOTL or Red Dragon, no real deep themes here. To paraphrase another reviewer: Man-eating PIGS???!!! Oh please..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a big fan of Dragon and Silence, I thought this book had a much different feel to it. I was hoping it would go into greater detail about Lecter's past. Nontheless, it was quite enjoyable, and I especially liked the way Hannibal offed Pazzi."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I took 2 days to read this, and avoided all spoilers of the plot. I wanted to enjoy it. I didn't. The plot was poorly paced, the whole section in Italy appears to have been draped across the main story for no other reason than to show us that Lecter is a man of refinement. Harris is clearly infatuated with the character of Lecter, but in showing us his mental thought processes and getting us inside his mind, he doesn't instill the same love of Lecter in us. Rather we see that Lecter is another psychopath with a messy childhood. Compare the scene in SotL where Lecter says &quot;You can't reduce me to a series of impulses. Nothing happened to me. *I* happened.&quot;Compare that with this travesty of a novel. No. In attempting to make us love his wet-dream of a character, he merely removes the mystique. Thoroughly awful book, but even moreso for fans of the original stories. Awful awful awful. I'd be embarressed to be Harris's editor right now. It was his job to rightly point out how bad this manuscript is.Having paid 9 million for the rights, a movie is likely. I can't see Hopkins or Foster appearing in this rubbish, but a good scriptwriter could shave off 90% of this book, change the ending and make a decent movie out of it. (A bit like how the movie The Firm with Tom Cruise was salvaged from that terribly dull book about photo-copying.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just spent most of a sunny weekend reading through &quot;Hannibal&quot;. I did so because the story is compelling and written in much more &quot;filmic&quot; terms than any of Black Sunday, Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. Harris pitches the intellectual content at a level that doesn't intrude unduly into the storytelling, he uses Italian sparingly and usually obviously, but in the case of the poetic quotations he resists the temptation to translate away from the native tongue in order to preserve it as poetry in the first place. However it is in the pacing, the scene shifting and the authenticity of his locations and characters that he excels. Yes, the story is extraordinary, perhaps even unbelievable to some of us, but life is also extraordinary and unbelievable at times. Don't forget that we're dealing with an extraordinary character in Dr Lecter, his life is by nature strange to most of us (I hope).I have read criticism that this sequel offers fewer insights and perspectives on the character of Lecter whereas I believe that he becomes more multidimensional once he is free to interact in the &quot;real world&quot; again. The insight from the Silence of the Lambs regarding his extreme civility alongside his extreme violence (both physical and psychological) is developed and extended well. The gentility of Lecter's day-to-day life would be the envy of many, his intellectual capacity the envy of most of us. Harris wants us to want to be Lecter, wants us to identify with this person capable of so much evil. He tries to bring us around to accepting the character to some extent, he makes Lecter attractive, you know you'll be burned but you want to reach out anyway.As for the ending. Well, it is made obvious that drugs are a factor during the dinner scene, so we can excuse ex-Agent Starling for her selection of courses, although the later scene does stretch the imagination somewhat. However you need to remember that all the ties binding Starling to the FBI are removed one-by-one, she has absolutely nothing to go back for, and thanks to Lecter's devious psychological work on Starling, she sees Lecter as the healing force for a great many other things that had held her in the past, associations with the death of her father.I don't know whether it was Harris' intent, but the butterfly (or moth) that Clarice becomes in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, particularly in the closing chapters, was certainly a chrysalis in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Lecter was always the flame."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"So this isn't as creepy as Silence of the Lambs, but I just loved the exhilarating feeling I had while reading this. GO FOR IT!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After I managed to trudge through the Italian culture lesson, I thought Harris was building up to a classic ending. Not so. It was as though Harris was writing a school essay and decided to finish it as quickly as he could so he could get out to play. I had high hopes for this book following Red Dragon and Silence, but I'm afraid Dr. Lector simply out grew Harris. As for the ending, please... I don't think so. If this makes it to the big screen, it will take some performance from Hopkins to keep Dr. Lector the likeable cannible we all love, alive. The success of the film will depend on the actor who is to play Mason Verger, who was unfortunately the real star of this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is as well written as Silence of the Lambs but not in SOL's realistic vein. It is, in my opinion, extremely difficult to come to grips with this because of the deep affection many readers have for Hannibal and Clarice, an affection supported by the way many of us identified with SOL. It is difficult to identify with Hannibal. In my wildest dreams this is not how I imagined their future, not in my maddest romantic fantasies. It's difficult to accept. I have such affection for the Memphis Tennessee locations in SOL, for Quantico, for the Chesapeake area -I didn't realize how invested I felt in Clarice's career with the FBI and how hard it is to give that up in Hannibal. I didn't realize how invested I felt in the underlying romantic tension in Hannibal/Clarice's meetings in SOL, the unacknowledged friendship that sprang up within its &quot;formal structure&quot;.The first sequence in Hannibal - the drug bust gone wrong, the stagnation of Clarice's FBI career, Lector's letter of support and the introduction of Mason Verger -- put us on secure SOL footing. Well, okay, not Mason Verger - between his facial mutilation, his three mile long braid and his Dr. No electronic command center in his bedroom not to mention his sadistic psychological torture of the underpriveleged minority children he entertains - is over the top and then some. But we know where we are.Then the action shifts to Florence, Italy, and the interior life of Pazzi, a Chief Inspector turned bounty hunter scheming to turn Lector over to Verger for big money. Pazzi has been unfairly wronged in his career too, and there's poignance in his love for his beautiful wife and his longing for the shores of the Chesapeake, but this side trip to Pazzi-World feels like a bloated digression. I was resisting every chapter of the Florence sojourn, everything I was discovering about Hannibal Lector. IMO, what we imagine about Lector, wonder about Lector, is more powerful than anything we learn about Lector. I prefer Harris to suggest the interior corridors of Lector's &quot;memory palace&quot; rather than take us - as he does - on a guided tour. Too much information! IMO it begins to reduce Lector. I also rolled my eyes at the news Lector was the son of a Lithuanian count and a &quot;high born&quot; Italian woman - oh hey, of course. God forbid there's anything non-aristocratic in Lector's background. His being the son of a count only proves his superiority, don't you know. There's a little ancestor worship, money worship, culture vultur-ing in this part of the book that has a little of the zeal of a convert about it - I wonder how Harris has been spending his &quot;Silence&quot; money. In other words, Lector's history is trite.Then Lector is forced to flee Italy and finds himself in coach with a bunch of tourists. This got on my nerves at first as well, because Harris portrays the denizens of coach as ill-mannered, crude, and with lousy sanitary habits. Even the babies in coach are unpleasant. So different than those one imagines Harris imagines occupy first class. I can accept coach being totally uncomfortable with rotten food, I have more trouble imagining everyone in coach is ill bred, including the newborns.But paradoxically, it is here that I suddenly felt re-connected to the Lector I first met in SOL. On that plane for the first time Lector isn't Superman and James Bond in one. I started to give in to what Harris was doing, I started to accept that I would get to know Lector as a man and not as the fabulous monster of Silence. There's a beautiful sequence in Mason Verger's bedroom among Verger, his sardonic (and weirdly lovable) sister Margot, Barney (the orderly from Silence), Clarice's FBI nemesis and a self-important psychiatrist. We're on familiar ground again here, and the dialogue, characterizations and one-upmanship are priceless. There's another sequence where Clarice is running in a Virginia State Park observed through field glasses by Lector -- absolutely beautiful. At this point I believe, without my realizing it at first, Harris won me over to this book, to telling this story from Lector's point of view. I began to view the Florence sequence in retrospect as Lector's dream - a dream he was able to realize and inhabit briefly - perfect order, perfect beauty - only to be thrown back into the messy contemporary world once more. Viewed like this, in retrospect, the Florence sequence works and resonates. There's also a description of Lector's baby sister in a tin tub, her pure heart, and her &quot;star shaped hands&quot; clapping Lector's face - what a beautiful and accurate description of a toddler's hands.There's a whole process of grieving in reading Hannibal - that whole anger, denial, bargaining, acceptance process is going on while reading it, but I believe Harris does earn acceptance from the reader. My feelings began to be agitated as the book wound to a climax and I felt terribly sad. Not from disappointment with Hannibal, but as a consequence of the accumulated emotional power and poignance -- and difficulty - in Hanibal. IMO, it's a great book, but you're going to have to wrestle with accepting it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I finished this book i had to ask myself what i really thought of the ending. Compared to the rest of the novel (which is wonderful) the ending leaves one in a state of utter disbelief. But whether that stems from the fact that it is a bad ending in the literary sense or in the theatrical sense is hard to say. I don't see how this novel could be made into a movie but on the other hand Harris does seem to have let Lector be Lector."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just cannot believe the anticipation I felt for this book is now replaced by head shaking confusion. I hated the first section of the book, but was won over by a second section that was simply classic Harris. The ending was absolutely ridiculous and completely neglectful of the characters he developed over 2 and 3/4 books. The final murder , though done with the old Lecter panache seems wasteful even for a homocidal maniac like the doctor. A lot of the problem comes from the amount of light put on Dr Lecter who loses something when we start to know him even a little. He was impenetrable and more interesting in the first 2 books. To tell the truth, I was hoping for a showdown between Lecter and Jack Crawford not another Hannibal /Starling encounter. This would not be a terribly interesting film even if it does get made. The moral of this story is supposed to be something about the evil inside all of us. Who knows? Thomas Harris obviously spends his time in a very dark place. I am actually looking forward to his next book to see if he can surprise us again now that the slate is clear. I hope that James Ellroy finshes his novel quickly, it is now the only book that I'm dying to read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After just finishing Thomas Harris' new addition to the Dr. Lecter saga, I am completely at a loss. I wish that I could bill the publishing company not only for the cost of the book, but for the time invested in the reading of it. At least in true Harris style it is a quick read. In my humble opinion Hannibal does not live up to the task of continuing the compelling saga created by Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. What a pity."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished the third installment of the Lecter books this afternoon and I must admit the ending was disappointing but what a good story. Granted I don't think it held the same gut renching realism that kept you up in he middle of the night and affraid to go downstairs in the dark. But, Hannibal definately was a good story with a delightful return of our favorite characters that Harris has held from us for so long. I hope he rights another. As much as I like Lecter he needs to die."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is, quite simply, the best novel I have read in a long time. To the reader who brags of his Mensa membership: Don't mistake IQ with intelligence and experience. You have neither, and thus cannot appreciate the true wonders of this book. For all others I recommend you read it as soon as possible. It is the greatest horror novel of the past few years. Stephen King is a piker compared to Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. His characters, Hannibal, Clarice, Mason . . . are priceless and complex. I feel guilty because as I was reading this book I kept imagining what the film would be like. I hope Jodi Foster and Sir Anthony are able to act together in Hannibal if it is made into a movie. I would love to see these Academy Award winning actors bring Hannibal and Clarice to life in this very disturbing book. I would recommend this book to others with the caution to expect the unexpected at the book's end or it will be quite the heart stopper. No one told me about the ending and I am glad of it because the impact was very startling and fascinating, enough to imagine the film ending to this good book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed reading the latest instalment of the Lecter trilogy. Although it lacked the crackling pace of Silence of the lambs it was no less a cracking read. I was a little dissapointed with the plot which became a little &quot;whimsy&quot; towards the end and left me wanting something more substantial. I still don't know who was more ahborrant, Lecter or Verger. And yet we still know very little about DR lecter. I eagerly await the next book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I heard terrible reviews of this book on television, myreaction was &quot;It can't be that bad.&quot; Even as I read throughthe pages, which kept my attention thoughout most of the book, I couldn't see what the critics had to complain about. There were some rather gross sections, mainly focusing in on the character of Mason (He's more dangerous than Hannible.), but nothing that seemed over the edge. Then I hit page 435, and the novel collapsed into total unbelievablility. I won't give away the ending, but all the people who loved Silence because of the strong female character of Clarice will be extremely disappointed. I wasn't necessarily one of those persons, but I was disappointed by the lack of keeping with the character created within the 2nd novel in this trilogy. The ending ruined the entire rest of the book. If you must read it, The first 434 pages are fairly enjoyable, borrow it from some. A book whose ending appears to be nothing more than a joke at best. All I can say is that I should have listened to the critics."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Notwithstanding the many negative reviews I just read, I had a ball reading &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I thought the characters were delicious and surprising, and often quite hilarious. Harris' style and tone are extraordinary and I was quite disappointed to have finished the book, which I wanted to go on for several hundred more pages. The ending was a brilliant turn-around -"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book, while on its own, is an ok read, does not compare with the previous two Hannibal Lecter books. There is no tension; weak plot; very little new about the good doctor. And the ending--what a crock!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What can I say but those of u who say that the ending ruins the book are on crack and are missing the main point of the book. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not a replica of &quot;Silence&quot; for it has no chance to surpass it in any way its too hard , so Mr. Harris takes a smart approach, he changes the books 'motive'. It is equally entertaining and a lot more sick and twistted, what it would be like in the mind of Hannibal the Cannibal.The ending is surreal and twisted just like it should be I know all u people want is a shoot out at the end but just as in &quot;psycho&quot; this anti-climatic ending serves the right purpose as only Harris and Hitchcock can do. Great Book, all of the cynycs either havent read it or are stupid. BUY HANNIBAL. It was well worth the wait."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited, I looked, I preordered and I enjoyed reading it. Some very well-crafted passages and phrases - not his best, but hey...My only regret is that Harris takes sooooo long between books, he may just be finished."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has gone off the deep end with this book. As others have said the ending is the worst I have EVER read in any book. If you like his previous books do NOT read this one and preserve your memories of the characters. Most of the book is exactly what you would expect in a sequel and seems a little simplistic at times. Then he writes a very non-normal ending but a worse ending then a formulaic one could ever be. Horrible! When winter rolls around this book will go straight into the fireplace."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Red Dragon had a beginning and an end. So did Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal has a beginning, a fine beginning, but it does not have an end. It screams for a sequel to allow the reader to return to tonic. But after paying for half a book, I sorta feel like I should get the sequel free. Mr. Harris, your book needs to be patched!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Maybe we expected too much. The hype regarding this sequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS began last year, with speculation that Hopkins &amp; Foster would wait for the story before signing on.The story rolls along fairly well, with a few major characters introduced, and a new locale in Italy. There is your pre-requesite amount of graphic detail, pyschoanalytical mumbo-jumbo, and Starling up again the world.The ending itself was quite a surprise, but it reads as a quickie, neat &amp; tidy, and pretty implausable ending. I cannot imagine Mssr's. Hopkins and Foster reading the conclusion, and keeping a straight face.If you have read all of Harris's stories, you will be able to anticipate just about every turn in the story. Still, not a bad effort from Harris, but not one of his best."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is not only on Hannibal, but a great narrative of Italy and art. Great, fast reading with well written pages!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was a HUGE disappointment. If you liked the characters Jack Crawford and Clarice Starling from Silence of the Lambs, don't read this book. Any fond memories you had of the characters will be ruined. The plot is improbable from start to finish, and downright sick at times."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After ten years of waiting, I scarfed this down in 24-hours. When I hit the end, I was thrown. TAKE YOUR TIME reading this medium. I say 'medium' for the novel sense that this great book is not a flick by flick passage.Re-reading it the second time, I savored cherishing, incredible, carving insights. You find Hannibal, as usual, not obvious. Buy it. Enjoy a fantastic book!As for references to being a movie, certainly the possibilities are there.Thank you, Mister Harris, I love your writings. &quot;Please, can I have some MORE!&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was a HUGE disappointment. If you liked the characters Jack Crawford and Clarice Starling from Silence of the Lambs, don't read this book. Any fond memories you had of the characters will be ruined. The plot is improbable from start to finish, and downright sick at times."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The official Thomas Harris website allows us to hear in the authors own words, the fact that Hannibal took 3000 days to write. During those 3000 days, Mr. Harris did wrestle with the preposterous, yet even when he has ventured beyond the point where we may suspend our disbelief, he remains interesting to read. The manuscript, poorly edited as it may be, is a tweak away from a screenplay, and what may seem preposterous to the reader, is mere fluff when compared with modern movie horror. I enjoyed the attempt, but disliked the final product. Pigs eating people? Enormous eels shoved down one's throat? Perhaps the movie shall be called... &quot;Hannibal...I still know what you did last summer...&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs each were terrific studies of human nature within a tight, engrossing, thriller. Hannibal was neither, and wasn't even written very well. Harris should have been able to capitalize on the interesting characters he had created, but instead laid down an absurd plot from which they had no choice but to become more and more ridiculous."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't say this was a disappointment because I had no great expectations but I did expect a decent read. I found myself skimming the book when Starling was not around. Her character is the most interesting in the series. Hannibal is just unreal. I was bored in Florence and with the details of Lechter's &quot;superb taste&quot; It was still salvageable until the end when Harris underwent his full frontal lobotomy which is the only explanation for his ridiculous conclusion. I suspect that he may have done this to ensure that there will not be a movie sequel. The audience would laugh thenselves sick."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How sad to read Hannibal the day of its release and discover that only evil exists in all characters- with no sense of available redemption. Previous Harris books offered this hope. Hannibal does not. Although many characters are sicker than Lecter himself, their sickness is unrealistic. Turning Lecter into a sick saviour of sorts is also hardly satisfying. I will be looking elsewhere for my summer reading thrill. Sally Anne Leger"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished the book, having been a fan for years (my cat's name is Thomas Harris, and Not just Tom!).... but this book rocks! At first, I wasn't sure, but the more I read the more I SAVORED-- I had to re-read parts to prolong the ride! Horrific and awesome! If they do make it into a movie, they Must use the same actors... but they'll never portray it like it was written... Great Book--- now I'll be in suspense for years to come waiting for the next... Clarisse will snap out of it. won't she??!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris continues to excite readers with his journey into the mind of a psychopath. The characters Hannibal and Clarice flow from the page into the imagination. Thomas Harris finds new and original ways to detail the actions of my favorite fictional (?) characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris continues to excite readers with his journey into the mind of a psychopath. The characters Hannibal and Clarice flow from the page into the imagination. Thomas Harris finds new and original ways to detail the actions of my favorite fictional (?) characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First of all, I must say that I have read every review I could put my hands on. Believe or not, there are some great reviews. The bad reviews have in no way changed my opinion of the book.Here are my thoughts:THE PACE: The most incomprehensible criticism I've read is that this novel is boring. I thought it was a really smooth ride. In fact, it was the most gripping book I've read in quite a while.THE WRITING: I don't want to put myself on a pedestal, but as an English Literature student I have a chance to come across a lot of &quot;great writing&quot;. Without a doubt this novel is written with style and a great sense of imagery (only a talented author could do so).EVERYTHING ELSE: I enjoyed the things that many of you hate about the book. I loved the graphic, sadistic, and twisted passages that define the story. It's good sometimes to read something that shakes our mind.Note: Thomas Harris would not have taken about 11 years to write a novel, nor would he have written such a weird book, if he only wanted the &quot;big bucks&quot; (as some of you have proclaimed).Finally, I respect other people's opinions. But I deserve myself the right to love this book. I think it's a great book. Case closed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"WHAT!? If i had roughly 80-100 pages left in Hannibal, i would of given the book probably four stars b/c of Harris' beautiful writing. His eleborate descriptions and images he conjures up are only paralled by a few authors. After that, he was lucky that 0 stars wasn't an option on this review! Cutting someone's brain while he is singing nursury rhymes with Starling? Give me a friggin' break! The fact that she ends up with Hannibal is disgusting in itself. Obviously Harris didn't read his psych books too well. Hannibal is not normal! He eats people! Throughout the whole book, Harris makes Hannibal to be the good guy, while the FBI are only cramping his style. The FBI hates Clarice. The man whose face was ripped off by Hannibal (and at first seen as a 'victim')is a down-right dirty man. Where's the hero? Hannibal is. Disgusting, grotesqe, and i'm sorry for the people who spent thrity bucks on that garbage."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"you'll be VERY disappointed!!! Very big letdown - the ending must have been written by someone who didn't read the first 2 in the Hannibal Lecter series!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a really funny book. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't howl through this. It starts off as vintage Harris (although having an opening shootout was a hackneyed idea--I think really good stories open quietly and then build), becomes an Elmore Leonard caper, and ends up ludicrous and unbelievable, like Brett Easton Ellis. The plot, like Silence and Red Dragon, is magnificently crafted but I think that with Hannibal, Harris has properly debunked the Lecter myth. It is, like its predecessors, just a story, you know."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Why it took Harris so long to complete this crappy book, I have no idea. All he did was throw a rough plot outline and a treatise on abnormal psychology to a ghost writer with the command: &quot;Fill in the blanks. And make sure it can be adapted to film, cuz that's where the big bucks are.&quot; I was horrified by the result. Other than than the typically overblown narrative, it didn't even read like a Thomas Harris novel. Maybe he and Caleb Carr could get together and produce something worth reading that comes close to their initial successes."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is hard to believe this book was written by the same man who wrote the masterful &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is shallow, poorly paced, and is full of phony-feeling characters. When Harris tries to shock, it feels gratuitous; when he tries to surprise, it feels contrived. The ending is so shockingly stupid that you want to bill Harris for thetime spent reading this piece of trash."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although the Author describes himself as &quot;Verbose&quot;,the success of his novels has proven that many readers enjoy this style of writing as evidenced by the popularity of other authors, such as Clancy,etc.As for this book, specifically, although I enjoyed it, I can't help but feel that an accurate review of Harris should read, &quot;Author writes 3 parter-- 2 parts Horror Story, and 1 part Fairy Tale."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"No way could this book ever get an average of three stars. Don't do it Anthony Hopkins or Jodie. Unless you need the money as Thomas Harris obviously did. Thank God I discouraged as many people as I could from buyong it Loved SOTL but after this ?book? don't think I'll ever watch the movie again. So let&quot;s see if this gets printed"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was definitely unpredictable to the last. And having just finished it, I wonder if that's such a good thing. It feels like a book written in fits and spurts. Harris pulls a few disconcerting writing tricks in this book, worst of all speaking to us (the reader) directly, breaking the imaginary 'fourth wall'. I didn't find it particularly gruesome or distasteful, only boring. I only finished Hannibal because I had to know what he (Harris) would do to end this mess. Too bad. I should have just stopped. I loved his other books and the highest hopes for Hannibal, buying it the day it came out. I read Silence of the Lambs in one sitting. Hannibal was far too slow to start for that. It is a tragic waste of two of the best literary characters of the late 20th century. I see why Jonathan Demme passed and will bet that both Hopkins and Foster will, too. In fact, I don't see how this will get made into a movie at all. Note to Ridley Scott: RUN!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was one weird book. I was very into it, though. It didn't take me long to read. I like Harris's deftness at changing tenses and stuff. Yes, I agree that it starts out much more spare and action-ish, (the beginning reminded of 'silence'), and that the middle is really interesting. The ending is where everyone seems to be divided. I thought it was just hallucinatory and surreal and that it really borders on going over the top, but Harris writes it so well that I don't think it does. It is strange, though. And it is going to be really hard to make a film out of. I just can't see the whole denoument with Starling, Lecter and Krendler (interesting dinner party indeed) making it onto film the way its done in the book. Not necessarily cinematic, but this weird book is definitely an involving, very visual, and creepy one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read all of this author's previous books, I eagerly awaited Hannibal. In my opinion this book is a total waste of time. It is neither well written nor entertaining. The story line is nonexistent, the violence is nauseating and the ending is ludicrous. This truly has to be the worst book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I anxiously awaited this release and was thrilled when the book arrived at my door only 2 days after release via amazon.com. I loved the majority of the book, except for the ending. I felt cheated and very disapointed. Throughout reading the last third of the book, I found myself wondering how Harris was going to tie all of the events together. The plot somewhat indicates that something freaky is likely to take place, so I kind of expected the bizarre, unsettling closure, but still yet, the ending make me ill. It killed the five-star rating I would have assigned to Hannibal. I don't suggest making this into a movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I learned years ago, not to go into a new 'read' expecting a book to follow the same course as previous ones. Having avoided the disappointment felt by many - of this book not having the same feel as Silence of the Lambs - I read Hannibal in one sitting...it is chilling, fascinating, horrifying, and at times, charming. The dinner scene near the end is a literary masterpiece. And the ending...well, if it leaves us feeling unsatisfied, doesn't the mirror many real life endings. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I nearly gave this book three stars, but the rather pat explanation for Hannibal's madness and the ridiculous ending really hurt what would otherwise have been an enjoyable read. Mason's character was over the top, but there were some real thrills. I would say the most disappointing aspect of this book, however, is in the way Harris chose to end it. I felt like I was wandering into Anne Rice territory..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Am I the only one who noticed Harris' completely arbitrary-seeming (accidental?) switching from one tense to another, sometimes in a single paragraph? Is Hannibal horrifying? Yes, if you're a grammarian. Otherwise the book is just plain lazy. Lecter presents &quot;insights&quot; on Dante that are supposed to dazzle a bunch of professors -- but they're like stuff out of a freshman lit paper. The main thing I learned was that it's bad when dumb people kill deer but it's cool when smart people kill dumb people. I realize that Starling and Lecter belong to Harris and he can do whatever he wishes with them... but the ending is nuts! I hope Mr. Harris enjoys rolling in his enormous stacks of money. I certainly felt like a sucker for contributing. Please note that the glowing NY Times review above was written by Stephen King. He's where I go for literary insight!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a ghoulish, ghastly, chilling treat this book turned out to be. It was a long wait for &quot;Hannibal&quot;, but more than worthwhile. I can't think how long it's been since I raced through a book in three days, with my hands seemingly nailed to its covers (Lecter might like *that* image, yes?)--and this was just that kind of book. Mixing icy restraint with jolting shocks, Harris has delivered a book with a great, gruesome story and an ending that'll blow you away....an absolute triumph of perverse logic. I'm thrilled at the job he's done. My hat's off to Thomas Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An excellent sequel to the first two. I read the first two novels and saw the movies. This book is just as good. I hope the movie does it justice. Since both Starling and Lecter have survived, I hope the next sequel is already in the works!!!! I can't wait!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've read all the other reviews and I can understand the negative outrages at not being given what you might expect from the first two novels of the Hannibal trilogy.But &quot;Hannibal&quot; is something altogether different and face it, reader, it's hard to get out of your mind when you've finished it.OK. You might miss Lecter's superhuman persona. But then, most people morph after 10 years. Give the good (?) doctor a break.Too disgusting? Isn't that what you want?Too implausible? How about an evil, possessed house (&quot;The Shining&quot;) or an evil, possessed car (&quot;Christine&quot;). It's called the willing suspension of disbelief.&quot;The ending never could have happened.&quot; Whether it could have happened or not, I was mesmerized by Harris' skill at painting a parallel universe of style and taste (!!!)All I could say after my 7 hour feast was &quot;Bravo&quot;. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is operatic fiction at its best!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If it took the author over 10 years to come up with this installment, how many other versions must he have trashed in order to settle on this one? Maybe Mr. Harris should rummage his trash and see if a better Hannibal exists and call it Hannibal II. The bad guys are painted with extremely broad strokes, Starling dissapoints big time, and old Hannibal is somebody you would like to have as a best friend, except for his nasty habits. BUT... a page turner none-the-less Read it for yourself and decide."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For starters, do not read this book with the preconcieved notion that it will be the equivalent of &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; It is an interesting book and not a slow read, but does have parts where the writer drifts away from the true story of the book. I would put a slight recommendation on the book. The ending was terrible and if screenwriters decide to adapt this to the big screen there will have to be considerable work done to make it a decent movie. By the way, the ending sucks!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I saw &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, then read the book. I was looking forward to the return of Hannibal the Cannibal. However, the ending to Harris's novel 'Hannibal' is so utterly and completely moronic that it ruined the entire reading experience. I don't believe for a moment that the Starling character would act in the way she did in the last part of the novel. Mason Verger and his sister Margot were interesting and creepy, but the entire 'A Long Spoon' section is too stupid to believe. Shame on you Thomas Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm only giving it two stars because Mr. Harris did keep me glued until the bitter end. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. The ending is just completely implausible and idiotic. I considered it an insult to what little intelligence the author gives me credit for.If you're like the 2 or 3 other million people in the country and decide to read it against my advice, grab a dictionary. Mr. Harris likes to place 5 syllable words where a single syllable would do just fine. And don't use a Webster's dictionary either -- he uses words not found in that particular dictionary."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you like your sequels wrapped up in nice tidy little packages, then this is not the book for you. If you like one dimensional characters who are totally predictable, then this is not the book for you. If you want to plumb the depths of what makes Hannibal Lecter who he is, then this is the book for you. If you've been around the block often enough to know that the world is not black and white, and that the lines between good and evil, maddness and genius are, more often than not, blurred, than this is the book for you. Whether readers want to admit it or not, they are drawn to Hannibal Lecter like moths to a flame. Why is it so much of a stretch to think that Clarice would end up as she did? Part of the reason is hypnosis and drugs (which apparently a lot of readers never caught or chose to ignore), but let's all be honest, Dr. Lecter is a fascinating man, and part of the fascination is the danger. I will admit, the end of the book surprised me, but I certainly didn't find it implausible. As I said earlier, life isn't tidy, and certainly, with an individual as complex as Dr. Lecter, and a character like Clarice, who's been betrayed by the &quot;good guys&quot; and been beat up by life, it's not out of the realm of possibility. Don't read this book with preconceived notions of how it &quot;should&quot; read. Read, and try to comprehend the insights that are given to you, and be willing to admit to yourself that under similar circumstances, anyone could potentially fall into Dr. Lecter's web of influence."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is impossible to deny that Harris is adept at many of his descriptions of smells and gore - although some of the smell stuff was clearly influenced by Patrick Sueskind's &quot;The Perfume&quot; (read that if you like smells. . .). Nevertheless, it is clear that this was written after most of Harris's talent was spent on the previous books. Writers become less careful once they're rich, I guess. Witness the plane ride back to the U.S., for instance. There are no night flights westward on the route he describes, and there never have been, but Harris couldn't resist. Also, what really happened with Mason's nose? The book will hold your interest, but it's sloppy on the edges."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a sad excuse for a follow up novel. The characters were changed, overdramatic, and lacked any integrity! I so looked forward to reading this book; it turned out to be the biggest disappointment I've ever read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had anticipated the release of this book ever since I read Silence of the Lambs as a teenager. This book is right up there with Silence of the Lambs until the ending. I felt Harris lost track of who Clarice's character really was. He betrayed her in the worst way. The book was also a bit on the long side but all and all it was an okay read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"No wonder Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins turned down the sequel. The writing is good to excellent; the plot twists are ingenious; and the explication of the villain's character/ psyche/ motives provided by the auhor is satisfying, especially because such &quot;insight&quot; is frequently missing in other novels of this genre. Nonetheless, the notion that Clarice would succumb to Hannibal's version of the Stockholm Syndrome shattered my suspension of disbelief, and left me shaking my head. No amount of literary contortion would convince me, or the others with whom I have discussed this book, that any confluence of circumstance would cause Clarice to become the willing companion of this engaging, but ultimately deadly madman."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just finished reading &quot;Hannibal&quot;--Cannot believe the ending. There is only one person to play Hannibal in the movie version. I'm only hoping Mr. Hopkins decides to take the part again. Here's hoping Jodie Foster will join him. But who will play &quot;Mason Verger?&quot;! What a character."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I didn't read Silence Of The Lambs, but I enjoyed the movie very much. I was looking forward to reading Hannibal, but I was bitterly disappointed. For some reason, the gory details in movie form don't bother me as much as reading about them. This book is full of horrific scenes that got into my head and gave me terrible nightmares for all the days it took me to read it. Harris' sentence structure was, at times, awkward enough to interrupt the flow of the story. I agree with some of the other reviewers here that the ending was out of balance with the characters as we came to know them. All in all, not worth the time. Wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read this book over summer vacation when it was nice and hot, but the book left me with chills! It was by far the best &quot;horror&quot; novel I have read (If you wanna call it that). I would recommend this book to fans of Harris' eariler books, but I would not recommend this for the faint of heart, or those who are squimish. This is the most violent, graphic, and disturbing book I have ever read. I loved it. If you have a spare weekend, I would recommend getting in bed, turning down the lights, pulling up the covers and reading. Trust me, you won't be able to put it down, I couldn't. At least give it a shot, what harm could it do?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I picked up this book because I had already read Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. I wanted to read more of the famous Dr. Hannibal Lector. Let me just say that he didn't disappoint. I was a little hesitant becuase many of the on-line reviews weren't to appealing. After reading it I realized that most of the reviews were wrong. I encourage anyone who enjoyed Harris' other books to read this one because it is by far the best in the series. I couldn't put the book down for the last 100 pages. After I was through my only words were WOW! ANyone who wants to be frightened to their very sole should pick this up from the bookstaore and give it a read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; by Thomas Harris is the 3rd installment of the &quot;Hannibal Lector&quot; trilogy! After Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs this book gives you the final (?) chapter with a stunning conclusion to the relationship between the Doctor and Clarice Starling! What can you expect from a man being a cannibal whose life is no more real than every other fantasy movie! Once you have crossed a certain line of reality there is no turning back anymore! So isn't it logic for Clarice Starling after having lost everything, even her new home i.c. the FBI that she has decided to lead a life as mentioned in the book! One can understand it without approving it! BTW isn't society and it's off-spring like each big city, Wall Street, Hollywood, NBA, NHL,...also a cannibal in sophisticated form?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I very much enjoyed this book and I'm sure the movie will not do it justice. It was however, quite disturbing to consider the possibility that human beings could behave in the manner described throughout the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is the perfect sequel to 'Silence of the Lambs'. I can only recommend it to those who like suspense thrillers!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just finished Hannibal. I'd passed over it a few times at the airport book store, not wanting to make the psychic commitment to what I knew was coming. I've always been intrigued by the world of the sociopath, and the almost infallible Hannibal Lecter takes the persona to an even higher level. I feel that perhaps Harris was trying to pull all the stops out on this one, which is not totally in keeping with the things I admire most in the main characters. The final 100 or so pages of the book were very rewarding - yet delightfully disturbing. ...After the many allusions to high speed cars I was very glad that it did not end in a &quot;chase scene&quot;. J"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The style of Harris' writing has changed from &quot;The Silence Of the Lambs&quot;, but I found it all the more enthralling. Harris coaxs you in closer, giving the impression that all is right with the world just in time to rattle you to the core. Then he shocks with his surprise ending. Overall, one of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is GREAT. I have always enjoyed Thomas Harris' novels. This one is just as good. Harris has you yearning to continue to read further on. It is a book that I could not put down. The ending is the most surprising. But rather than spoil it and tell you I recommend that you take time out and read this book and then see the movie that is coming in February."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't believe those who say this was a gross let-down...Harris once again weaves a dark, hypnotic spell over the reader with this disturbing sequel. While the climax may not please everyone, it caught this seasoned reader totally off-guard and that alone is worthy of a couple of stars. It's not just &quot;Dottore&quot; Lecter you have to watch out for this time...Mason and Margot Verger and their Sardinian crew of killer-pig trainers are just as frightening! A great book...my only regret about the upcoming movie is that producer Dino DeLaurentiis will probably ruin it..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If it were possible to give minus stars to a review, I would give this book -100. When I finished this piece of TRASH, I wanted to grab Thomas Harris, shake him and ask what the hell he was trying to do. There is NOT ONE likable character in this awful book. Even Clarise Starling turns evil, wicked, mean, bad and nasty. It is full of evil lesbians, horrible mutations of humans, a character who loves to make children cry so he can collect their tears, and unrepetant monsters.It is no wonder that the screenplay will have major revisions in the plot and characters. Jody Foster was absolutely right in refusing to participate in it.The only reason I finished this thing was because I could not believe that it could get any more depraved as it progressed. I was wrong. The ending will make you sick."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' book Hannibal is incredibly well-written and interesting! Nobody I know who read it was able to put it down! Absolutely the best of Harris' four novels! It's interesting to me that many reviewers didn't like the book! Was this perhaps that it hit too close to home? Aww...perhaps they were brought up to believe that a murderer or any deviant is a monster. How safe to feel that since Hannibal and other serial killers are monsters, I can't possibly be anything like them. They were &quot;disappointed&quot; in the fact that the reasons were given for Dr. Lecter's insanity. &quot;We want him to be an inhuman monster! We don't want him to be a human being! We don't to understand, to feel compassion! We don't want him to be able to feel! &quot; The society that we currently live in doesn't want to hear the &quot;psycho-babble&quot; or psychiatic &quot;rubbish&quot; because they are more comfy thinking that they are on a higher moral plane. That they are regular human people and murderers and serial killers are evil monsters not even resembling the humans that they kill. Oh well, they can believe whatever they want to believe, the facts are: Serial killers and murderers and other criminals are normal people just like you and me, they've had good experiences in life, just like you and me, and they've oftentimes had awful things happen in their life just like you and me. The difference is that the awful things in their life affect them in an involuntary way that make killing ok. People don't want to face the truth: Most serial killers and murderers become serial killers and murderers because of society's negligence. We don't take care of, or protect our children properly, we fight wars, we allow horrific atrocities. Some children when exposed to awful evil, become awfully evil, others don't. Why? Who knows? In the United States, we'd rather kill the grown-up children in jail for commiting crimes, than prevent these crimes by protecting the children who will grow up to be the criminals of the next generation. What a backward society! The book Hannibal shows Western &quot;civilization&quot; and the way they handle crime to be complete absolute bunk! This is a novel of humanity, not cannibalism! It doesn't display all that's wrong with Western Culture by glorifying cannibalism, murder, and lawlessness, it simply shows that as long as we won't practice justice and mercy there will be criminals who will commit crimes in the name of justice. If Jodie Foster and all the other Girl Scouts out there want Clarice Starling to remain a Girl Scout then they should read Pollyanna and the like, this is the real world, glass ceiling, response to injustice and all."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"From the sublime terror of Silence of the Lambs Hannibal sinks to the level of simply pandering to those fans of the gory &quot;B&quot; flic horror genre such as Jason and Freddie. The gloss of sophistication is belied by the stereotypical characters that are all too predictable. Sorry, but for me this sequel is a bust."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In this abridged, audio cassette version of \\"Hannibal\\", the author, Thomas Harris, decides to treat the listener by doing the reading himself. This was a decided mistake. Mr. Harris, while no doubt a masterful story teller, is unable to read his own work without making the listener wish that Hannibal Lecter would creep up upon him and put an end to his reading. Mr. Harris should stick to writing, something at which he is quite capable, and leave the reading to those whose talents lie in that direction. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst audio cassette versions of a book that I have ever heard. Mr. Harris has a voice that gives the same effect as one who is raking one's fingernails across a blackboard.The story itself is fairly good, though it is not in league with \\"Red Dragon\\" or \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\". Here, Hannibal Lecter, having escaped from custody about ten years ago, is living the good life in Europe. Unbeknownst to him, however, he is being hunted down by Mason Verger, a fabulously wealthy, former patient of Dr. Lecter. Verger is also one of Lecter's victims who happened to have survived Lecter's unusual mode of attack. Left horribly disfigured by his former encounter with Lecter, Verger is very determined to hunt him down, and what he has in mind for Lecter will chill the listener. It is Verger who is truly monstrous, as the listener will discover (though with his unskilful reading, Harris gives him a run for his money).FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling remains an integral part of the story. After heading up a drug bust that went bad, she becomes persona non grata with the FBI. Still, when the FBI gets a tip about Lecter's whereabouts, it is she to whom the FBI turns, given the unusual relationship she previously had with Dr. Lecter. This assignment, too, turns bad, as Agent Starling is being set up for a fall by members of her own agency. What ultimately happens to all the players in this story is horrific.This abridged audio cassette version gets three stars for content and one star for the reading by the author. If one is interested in an audio version of the book, it is recommended that one pass on this one and try any one of the other versions in which the author is not the reader."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book isn't terrible but it's just such a dissapointment compared to the Silence of the Lambs. In the Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal was a dangerous threat but in this one Clarice Starling has to save his life. Kind of weird. Also, the book progresses very slowly and just isn't interesting.In this one, Hannibal is loose and everyone is trying to find him. The ending is absolutely horrid and makes no sense. It's such a letdown to me after the brilliant Silence of the Lambs. Read the Silence of the Lambs but forget about this book.If you want a pretty good movie, watch Hannibal the movie. But ONLY IF YOU HAVE A STRONG STOMACH. The movie's a lot better and Ridley Scott's ending is a lot better than Thomas Harris's.You'll be thinking: is this by the awesome author that wrote the amazing Silence of the Lambs? No, it can't be. Oh, yes it is. A major letdown. This book is a mess."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Disregard the reviews of this book being a must read. It is more of a must pass. The book began well, but then it seemed like Harris just lost his train of thought and started to make things up. The plot was poorly developed and the descriptions of the gory murders, wasn't even disgusting at all.This book was too long and dull. The ending was absolutely horrible. No wonder Jodi Foster refused the part. The characters were lost from the original series to become lovers! This cannot be! It ruins the entire mystique of the relationship between Starling and Lecter! C'mon! Harris, you must've been offered a HUGE advancement to write this shoddy novel. I can't believe you rushed to write this awful book. Warning to others, do not buy unless you want to waste money and time and energy in a dull, predictable book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I received this book in the mail, it was packaged neatly and carefully. I really appreciate the way it was handled. It looked almost like new. There was scuffing barely visible where the plastic of the jacket was rubbing against the covers of other books, but it was only visible if you looked hard enough. It is, after all, a first edition. All in all, great shape. I was very pleased with my purchase. :)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The movie was pretty good but there were some inconsistencies. The book has the details and creates a better 'visual' than the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Being a huge Thomas Harris fan, I greatly anticipated the release of \\"Hannibal\\". I bought it on it's release date, read about a third of it the first day, hoping it would get better. I was mistaken. Being the high-grossing movie it was turned into, I'm sure you know what it's about. The writing style is exceptionally well, yet the story lacked a major plot. \\"Hannibal\\" was OK, but should have been edited. If you're still interested in reading this, make sure you read the Hannibal Lecter trilogy in this order:1. Red Dragon2.Silence of the Lambs3.Hannibal..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a really good book, I read it two or three times. I don't think that little kids should read this but it is a good book for the older people. It is very well written. The athor of Hannibal has a good taste in words, he has also has written many other good books so get out there and get a good taste of reading."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought this was truely an excellent book. I have to admit, I have not read Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs (i saw the movie :), but I thought it was very well written. I enjoyed the book very much and as long as you don't have a weak stomach, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was extremely disappointed. I found this book boring and self indulgent with not a single character worth caring about. The ending was laughable. For a book to be truly griping or scary there needs to be an element of truth. This book is so far out that I found myself saying aloud &quot;yeah, right&quot;. I hope this is never made into a movie. As written, it is far beneath the talents of Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster. It reads more like &quot;Scream&quot; or &quot;I know what you did last summer&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is a major disappointment. Where &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot; was about suspense and subtlety, Harris' new book is about pushing the boundaries of tastelessness and trying to incorporate as much sadism and cruelty into the plot as he could muster, as though daring the reader to be sickened or not. The credibility of his two main characters gets marred by an ending that is as preposterous as anything I have recently read. And the short, choppy chapters and even choppier language, suggest this was a project exercised exclusively with an eye towards making money and a movie sale. Except the details are so grotesque I would not want to see them enacted, and Harris' ruination of both Lecter and Starling is so appalling, I would not blame Anthony Hopkins or Jodie Foster for turning the film down. To keep afresh the memory of Harris at his most powerful, revisit 'Silence', or, even better,&quot;Red Dragon.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not surprised that many people dislike this book. Many people dislike their own darkest desires but this book fufills them. There was a reason that Lecter--especially as portrayed by Antony Hopkins -- became an icon of horror with an erotic overtone. He is the ultimate evil, so perfect he becomes a kind of deity. And his uncharacteristic concern for Clarice resonated as an all too modern demon lover. Harris certainly did not sell out. He read the minds of his audience and he read them a bit more deeply than most people can bear. I hate to say it, but I hope for no more Lecter novels because any more would deprive that creature of the perilous salvation he seems to have found in this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book proves that you are what you read, and if you haven't 'fessed up about the dark places in your own mind after reading Hannibal, then you're deluding yourself. Harris is playing with his readers and loves it, and the ending is perfect--if you are bothered by it, well just look in the mirror, Krendler!In conclusion I just ate it up. &quot;Would I sound like Oliver Twist if I asked for MORE!?&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has a wondering style of writing and develops his characters with skill throughout Hannibal. I found the book to be riveting and worthwhile reading...until I got to the last 30 pages. I was extremely disappointed with the ending and found it to almost be a cop-out for the author to hand it over to the publisher."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal should have been called, Hannibal: A Love Story. In the end, all of the protagonists - Hannibal, Barney, and Margot end up happily ever after in loving romances. Hannibal with Clarice, another protagonist and most unpredictable character. Hannibal, Barney and Margot are all the masculine aggressors. This is most important with Hannibal, who somewhat nakedly &quot;saves&quot; Clarice. I remember the first two books to be better, though this was entertaining and compelling. This one was a bit too cartoonish. It was a bit to much of an adolescent fantasy. One gets the impression that Thomas Harris is hoping for a movie version in order to see Jodi Foster naked."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very excited about the sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. However, when I received the book and started to read it I became more and more disenchanted. I feel Mr. Harris did a great injustice to the characters of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. The ending cheapened the entire book for me.I had the feeling Mr. Harris wrote himself into a corner and didn't know where to go from there. I was truly disappointed.By pass this one, and reread &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If this is the sequel you've been awaiting, then you're going to be thrilled with Hannibal. While Harris has written some good books, this one fails. Starling's relative innocence juxtaposed against Hannibal's evil was one of the attractions of Silence of the Lambs. Hardening her character undermines the new work hugely. The shifts in person, number and tense are annoying, but it is the change in character that makes Hannibal so irksome. This novel should've been a good book and is not. What in the world is Starling going to do in the movie? Surely it'll be different."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"C'mon, this is FICTION, I found Hannibal absorbing and amusing. Not to mention having the best revenge scene I've EVER seen in a book. Yes, it does require both a willing suspension of disbelief and a reasonable appreciation of satire, something it seems that many readers just don't get."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm a Thomas Harris fan, so I enjoyed this book. It wasn't as good as THE RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it was good enough that it kept me reading through the night. The ending could have been better. *** I would like to recommend another author by the name of A.T. Nicholas. He wrote a novel called, THE FIST OF GOD. It's his first book and he's signing the first three thousand sold through Amazon. It's a great supernatural thriller."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book blew me away. Although a little slow, I did enjoy the Italy descriptions. The ending was stunning and 180 degrees from were I thought it was going. This book had me on the edge"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris draws the reader into a morality trap: who deserves the reader's empathy? The answer is no one. Readers are treated to morality lessons from Hannibal Lector and forced to choose between his brand of evil and that of his sixth victim, Mason Verger. Clarice Starling, in the end, also fails as an empathetic character, and the reader is forced to wash the distaste from his or her mouth. In addition, the plotting is predictable except for the ending which lacks verisimilitude. Harris creates one character in Starling and then bends her without foreshadowing into something else just to end this screenplay treatment. It is not worth wasting your time or money on this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i was on the edge of seat for most of this thrilling book. until after the climax hit and the book came to a close. the last 50 pages gave quite an unrealistic twist. it personall ruined it for me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart. We learn more about the motivations of Dr. Lecter and begin to understand his fondness for Agent Starling. The ending is absolutely worth the ride!!! I am eagerly awaiting the pre-quel of Red Dragon--I want to learn more about Lecter's crimes and how he was caught. So, Mr. Harris if your reading this....."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great opening scene, gritty and intense. Everything was good, good story line, great explanations and good follow through. Characters seem so real that you associate yourself with them. You understand their motives, their desires and fears. Finished book in one night..so dissapointed at the ending.....one comment to all prospective readers....DON'T READ THE LAST FORTY PAGES IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY THIS NOVEL......"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Liked &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, loved &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and was really looking forward to this. The main part of this book, while not breathtakingly exciting, was very interesting to read. I liked seeing this different, cultured side of Lecter, one of the most interesting characters/villians ever. However, I was absolutely astounded at the ridiculous ending involving Starling, one of the most compelling female characters I have ever read. It was like someone else wrote the ending. Does Harris not have family, friends, editors who can be brutally honest with him? If they make a movie out of this, and I hope they do (and I hope they can get Hopkins out of retirement; he would relish this deeper, cultured side of Lecter) they had better do a serious re-write on the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just perused some other reviews and was happy to see that most agreed with me, very big waste of time! I honestly can't believe Harris wrote it, its not worthy of him. Not only did it not scare me, it was boring, and many facts were incorrect from SOTL- for example, Clarice's mother was dead before her father was shot - how come Harris didn't remember that fact? There were other inconsistencies as well. For a book that many of us had waited for over 6-7 years, it had a lot of pages but short on substance. I believe that a few of Harris's readers could have come up with a much better story line than what was served up to us in this book. Maybe Harris has just lost his touch - too bad! I thought he was one author who wouldn't give in to the almighty buck from Hollywood as others have (Patterson, Grisham et al). Oh well, time to search for a new favorite author! The Red Dragon was the best mystery that I have ever read - it kept me up the entire night and home from school the next morning."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Entropy reaches its climax in this book. Sick minds seem to beeverywhere and Clarice Starling is Dr. Lecter's ultimate victim andachievement. Only him could understand and savour &quot;il miele dentro la leonessa&quot;. A powerfull, complex and disturbing book. I really enjoyed it. The unknown is only more fascinating when it comes from Thomas Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although the style of prose is far too movielike for my taste, and certain sequences are very predictable, the ending is a good one, probably as far from hollywood as you can get considering that it will be made into a blockbuster movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris takes the reader where they would never willingly go. While I was surprised at the ending, after much thought it is the logical conclusion of the whole process. Neither character has anyplace else to go. Harris methodically leads the characters into this web and they can't escape. The book surprised me. For that I give it four stars. It certainly avoids the formula ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought this story was riveting, and could barely put it down. Many of the plot twists were totally unexpected, and I was stunned, but not disappointed, by the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I put off reading my copy of this novel because of all the negative amazon reader reviews...My mistake! This book was stunning, gripping, slippery, elusive, elegantly wrought. I was hooked by the second chapter and carried swiftly through to the startling conclusion. Obviously it's not what a lot of his fans expected or wanted -- Harris has stepped out of the thriller genre and into the realm of horror/dark fantasy -- the elegance, sophistication, and dark carnival violence of his writing have more in common with Clive Barker than John Sandford (both these guys also topnotch writers). And horror tends to end darkly: evil can't be fully vanquished or contained, and -- especially with the help of drugs, isolation, hypnosis, and a preternaturally skilled &amp; brilliant psychiatrist -- can be incredibly seductive. I was thrilled to read a bestseller with some style &amp; meat on its intellectual bones, and the sheer audacity to take us someplace dangerous and different. What a ride. Thank you, Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished reading HANNIBAL and I kept dozing off. The book would fall to the floor and my trusty Amazon.com book mark would fall out. The story line of this novel is so dull that I had a hard time finding which chapter I was trying to read.It's really time to dispatch old Doc Hannibal. If Mr. Harris will promise to get rid of this goof-ball in the next novel, I'll read it.I'm a doctor and Hannibal is starting to remind me of too many of my colleagues.Time to say goodbye, Dr. L."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read Silence and was anxious for the thrill, spine tingling suspence created by that novel but was sorely disappointed by Hannibal. It took me half of the novel to get really into the book. So much was wasted in Italy and trying to decipher the wording and reference points given. When the setting of the novel returned to America it was at least understandable and I did not have to keep rereading passages for added understanding. Gore appeared to be added for gore's sake and was more boring than titallating. Definitely a disappointment and I even splurged on the hard cover version"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs &amp; I looked forward to reading this book. I was very disappointed with the book, especially the ending. I'm not sure if I want to see the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal (the book, not the man) was surprisingly bad. It was almost devoid of plot, created little or no suspense, and the ending was absurd. I think Harris was away from his craft too long."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"To all of you erudites of the world: Unite!Harris' descriptions of the rarities of the world are truely captivating.As a high schooler going up through the ladder as a true conformist, it was veryy exciting to read a piece of literature that played by its own rules. To quote SOTL: &quot;I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chiati.&quot;Harris' panache, &quot;cajones&quot; and brilliance make this a startling and mesmerizing read.Give it six-stars!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like so many of the reviews I've read, I agree that this book isn't in the same league with Red Dragon or Lambs. I am saddened to think that a writer of Harris's abilities would sell out to the current rage of violence and gore for its' own sake, instead of to further the plot line, which he accomplished so brilliantly in the other two books. The ending was a complete joke and the entire book a boring waste of my time.I'd give this review zero stars but that wasn't an option!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Bite me. Again, I was not disappointed when I read this. I read 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs' and this final sequel was true to the characters presented before. Dr. Lecter, a fellow psychiatrist, is one of the most polite people I've ever had the pleasure of reading about. Which is why I do wish he was a real person. You get the feeling that he is trying to avenge his sister's death and make up for not being able to protect her. When he falls in love with Clarice, he doesn't fight against it, but finds another reason for his interest. Truly Lecter."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I put this book down after about 100 pages. Then i saw the movie to confirm that it was terrible. It consists of what Thomas must consider creative violence, but it isn't any more valuable than a Freddy or Jason sequel. This story offeres nothing above a very low gross out level. Its not a psychological thriller. Its simply cat and mouse, and playing violent tricks. SOTL is better paced, seemingly unconcerned with cramming in shockers, and filled with what seems to be psychological insight. This book has little to none of that."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I wonder how much they paid Stephen King to comment on the cover about how great this book was. I hope Thomas Harris' other books aren't this bad. I enjoyed the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; movie, but after reading this book, I won't be seeing the sequel. If the book is this bad, the movie will be horrible. Sorry, Thomas Harris, but this was about as exciting as watching paint dry."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Reading was never my hobby till I picked up this book. Here you can really understand the mind of Dr Lecter, although evil, but very cunning. The ending was weak which cost the book another star. But overall, if you enjoy psycho-thrillers, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is one of the best thrillers ever written. It is more than a simple crime novel, it is elegant, hypnotic, darkly romantic and artistically gothic. The negative reviews here are obviously by people who have no appreciation for the elegance, texture, and intelligence of this book. Their small, condensed minds should stay away, this is a book for those who savour the descriptions, the moods, the atmosphere and dialogue. Thomas Harris once again shows his brilliance by presenting a book that truly studies the mind and world of a monster. &quot;Hannibal's&quot; chills come from the surreality of it all, the realism, and the way Harris doesn't over-do it, but brilliantly describes the violence with the pen of a genius. The book is an example of real WRITING. What did the attackers expect? All and out, simple gore? Go read crap by wanna-be authors for that. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is for those who appreciate art, those who read &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot; and feel the passion and feelings. &quot;Hannibal&quot; deserves more than one reading because you find something new each time. I love how Harris writes with a poetic, clever style like the passage: &quot;A puff of air as Dr. Hannibal Lecter passes us. The great door creaks, closes with a thud we can feel in the floor. Silence.&quot; People have complained because the book doesn't resemble much &quot;Red Dragon&quot; or &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs.&quot; DU! Those two books were more about other killers and other people and Lecter was a mere supporting character, a memorable one, but a supporting character still. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is entirely about Lecter. If you want a real book to appreciate and read many times over, get this one, if you like crap, don't."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book is overrated. WAY overrated.

First of all I think Mr. Harris is a brilliant writer. I bow down to you Sir, someday I hope to be a quarter as good of a writer as you are. Please know that my words here are not meant to be disrespectful, just how I see things as being truthful. Please don't hate me for this.Sir, I don't think you meant to, but you hurt your characters. I keep trying and trying to understand what you were doing with that ending but it makes no sense. You know Dr. Lecter would never allow himself to do something like that! Even if he did, which he wouldn't, couldn't and shouldn't, Clarice would be strong enough to stop him. Sir, when I read the end of that book I was sobbing! Please don't take this the wrong way, but that ending hurt me as much as it her Dr. Lecter and Clarice! What happened, Sir? Now Sir, this is your book, you have the absolute right to do whatever you want with your book, however this is going farther than just that. Hannibal is becoming a movie. Sir, it's bad enough to have this in writing, but if genius actors like Mr. Hopkins, and Mrs. Foster get on camera and act it out, it's set in stone! Sir, you can't do this to your characters, you can't hurt them like this! Please Sir do something to stop them. Now I've heard that the directors and producers are, however, through my experiences, I've learned not to trust what I hear. Anyway, please think about what I've said. Don't hurt Clarice and Dr. Lecter like this.

I didn't care much for either the book or film version of Silence of the Lambs, with its ludicrously-named protagonists 'Hannibal the Cannibal' and 'Jame Gumb', but this alledged sequel was ridiculous, vile, and an insult to the intelligence of the reader.

That's about what says it all. How Hannibal is honorable cannibal who is just mis-understood.

Starling traveling the world with him as his &quot;love interest&quot;? Come on! It's a total departure from the original story line and not very believeable at that.The book isn't a total waste of time - I had to read it to see where all of it was going. But if you're looking for something will scare you, forget it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Have you ever had the feeling, while reading a book, that the author has run out of good ideas and is simply writing for the sake of writing? Have you ever known an author to add shocking things, regardless of how rediculous they may sound, just for the sake of shocking? Have you ever known an author to use names, from some of his past books, on completely different characters that have nothing to do with the characters used in those previous books? Have you ever known an imposter to get a book published under a well know author's name?I was very disappointed with this book. Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were excellent, which is why I just can't figure out what happend with Hannibal. I figure that at least one of the above questions is the appropriate one to ask.I finished this book, which is why it got 2 stars, since I reserve 1 star for books I can't even finish. It was close though, being that looking back upon my decision, and the fact that the book just got worse as I continued, I probably should not have finished this book. At least if I would have put the book down prior to the approximate page of 100, I would not have gotten the distorted image of previously used, brilliantly contrived characters. And, my only negative memory of the book would have been that it was unrealistic. At least my image of Starling and Hannibal would have been preserved at what I previously thought...brilliant. Unfortunately, it's too late for that...I read on."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ugg. I can't believe they're going to make it a movie! I was really looking forward to this book because I loved the first movie, but gees, talk about torture. Hannibal, who was such a fasniating character before was made soft and good guyish with a sad past, they ruined him. Then there was that 100 some-odd page Italian section with the psycho inspector who seemed obsessed with his own name that was nothing short of maddening. It took me almost three weeks just to get through that part, and that was only because I forced myself on. Clarice I had no quirl with until the end. THAT would not have happened. No way no how. Do your eyes and mind a favor and avoid this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I consider myself well-educated, experienced and cognizent of the finer things life has to offer, but this novel over-indulges itself, just as its &quot;hero&quot;, Lecter, does, in tedious descriptions of gourmet food,(yeah, that type of &quot;food&quot; too.., medieval literature and art, expensive cars, and other ephemera of the ultra-rich.) Basically, I got bored with it all. Still, I finished reading &quot;Hannibal&quot;, mainly to see what happens to &quot;Starling&quot;. Even so, the ending will likely gross out the reader(not &quot;amuse in a certain contex&quot;, to paraphrase Lecter, who seems to speak for the author here) and Starling's actions were unquestionably out of character and hard to believe. No wonder Jody Foster refused the sequel's role..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am glad to find that I am not the only person disapointed in this latest Harris novel. I too, found the ending to be quite tame. It certainly was not up to Harris' caliber. I did enjoy the decriptions of Florence, they brought back fond memories of a great trip."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In this sequel to the famous and historical Silence of the Lambs, Thomas Harris presents us another exquisitely written novel. With his upscale writing style he brings us back our long time friends Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. The novel itself is fast pacing, interesting and worth reading. Those pages will keep on turning, I guarantee you. I thing (and its very personal) that the downside to this novel, is the fact that Hannibal Lecter himself is now the main character of the book, loosing some of the mystery upon which his style was built in past novels. Looking from the bright side, this is the chance to step into one of the most intriguing and complex minds I am familiar with."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Arthur Conan Doyle was trapped into writing his Sherlock Holmesstories by a voracious populace who wanted more of the detective'sexploits. It became so burdensome that eventually the author killed off his character, much to the dismay of his public.I think that this is what Harris is trying to do here. He's saying, &quot;I may be contractually obligated to write another Lecter novel, but nobody said it had to be a *good* one.&quot; He's also saying, &quot;Never again,&quot; by writing his characters into such a box that basically they are unusable for any future books.This book is not without merit, but it is so dreadfully below the standard established by the author in his works &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, I'm almost inclined to believe he had a ghost writer. (Almost, but not quite)The tone is *completely* different from the other two serial killer novels, which can not hope but to fail to please his fans.He must have known this. I refuse to believe that this was anything but an intentional effort to kill off his characters so he wouldn't have to write any more about them.Well, he's succeeded. I sure as heck don't want to see what happens next to Lecter or Starling.The only recourse, should he choose to pursue it, would be an &quot;Exorcist 3&quot;. If you recall, after the incredible success of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, they made a *really* awful sequel, &quot;Exocist 2&quot;, not written by Blatty. Then later, they made &quot;Exorcist 3&quot; after Blatty's sequel, and pretty much assumed that &quot;Exorcist 2&quot; never happened.Maybe we can pretend that &quot;Hannibal&quot; never happened. My girlfriend felt so cheated when *she* read the book that she said that she had been &quot;Hanniballed&quot;. END"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'll start off by admitting that I haven't read any of Thomas Harris's previous novels, but common wisdom claims him to be a writer of merit. Something of which there is zero evidence of in this very average thriller. Why give an &quot;average&quot; thriller one star? Becuase it commits the unforgivable crime of explaining Hannibal Lector, in the procces destroying the character's enigma. This fatal error doesn't just make this book a failure, but to any of its unfortunate readers it also weakens The Silence of The Lambs and its excellent 1991 film adaptation. Bypassing this point, the book is still weak on its own merits, Harris seems to think that mixing tenses(past and present) is clever or stylish, but since he obviously has no idea or point, it seems to be an idea abandoned halfway through. The rest of the book , is a Nelson Demille class (airport) thriller, with random passages of gore that come off as a desperate attempt by an author to add something to a completely unremarkable novel. For some real horror, check out Irvine Welsh's brilliant horror/comedy/tragedy FILTH."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There were pages I had to skip past because I couldn't handle the goriness (and I'm not generally a wimp). I didn't like the way Clarice was turned almost into a buffoonish character (i.e., no dignity to be had as reporters snap pictures while she gets a speeding ticket; a senseless petty theft leaving her helpless in a supermarket and looking a little foolish). I didn't like seeing Clarice looking like a fool. On the other hand, a character like Hannibal Lecter can not NOT be fascinating. That alone kept me rivetted to the book and let me overlook it's flaws. I was (like in Silence of the Lambs) obsessively compelled to try to figure out how his mind was working."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can see how the way this book ends could aggravate some readers; but, for me it was exactly what I wanted to see. I loved almost all of this book. Mason Verger's character was the epitamy of a despicable creature and his plan for Lecter is nothing less than terrifying. Lecter became this sensual man with nothing but class and inteligence. I simply couldn't put it down. I just hope they don't make the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you can accept that Hannibal is different from Harris' previous works, you might enjoy yourself. The style: yes, it's disorienting, but I thought Harris was trying to make the reader experience events in a cold-blooded, de-personalized way. Like our main man. The ending certainly induced a dream-like state in me, and Harris laid a lot of careful groundwork for it. The book is a fantasy. Characters are contrived to behave in certain ways. Seems that most people object to the fact that human nature is not presented in a truthful manner. The book doesn't ring true. I agree with them. Still, if you can enjoy it, Harris does a remarkable job inventing experience and motivations that lead to the inevitable horror show.I wouldn't say the book had an ending. Though there is no resolution, the conclusion is not illogical if you've already bought Lecter's unlimited capacity for manipulation and brain- washing. After all, he has made people commit suicide just by talking to them. Without drugs.You may find, as I did, that this book offers a lot of entertainment, horror of the most stylish and stylized kind and delicious surprises. It is wrong to say the book is poorly written, meant only to exploit the popularity of Lambs, or is an indifferent effort. It is crafted with dedication and skill. I just don't think it was well-conceived or ultimately satisfying. Whether he will or not, Harris has a lot more to say about the characters. This book is an introduction for the next story. Can't wait to see what Hopkins does in the Hannibal movie. Jodi could have brought a lot to this film. Too bad."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I &quot;devoured&quot; this (if you pardon the pun) in two days flat. I literally could not put it down, rearranging meals to get more pages under my belt. Not my usual reading matter, but I had read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and thought: &quot;why not?\\" I was glad I did. This novel grabs you by the throat and compels you to read it with a sinister energy the good doctor would be proud of.In all ways, the characters of the &quot;Silence on the Lambs&quot; are back with a vengeance. And vengeance is very much the key to this novel, with practically everyone having a score or two to settle and not just with Lecter. Moving Lecter out of the confines of his cell where he had lived for the last two novels, was a challenge for Harris, with astonishing results. Lecter lives and breathes through every page (particularly as Dr Fell), knocking Starling back to the mere sidelines. His power and grace and cat-like movements revealed in the narration, match Harris' sparse economical language. This is not a novel languishing in detail and description. The detail is there when needed, a few words to set the scene. It is a testament to Harris' skill that atmosphere and mood can be conveyed with restraint. Clearly well researched, without preaching, the tools of Lecter's' excellent taste set out like a fine meal he would enjoy. Foreign language and settings are handled almost effortlessly. I resisted the urge to see the novel in a film sense, as I know that Hopkins is filming the role as we speak, but I could not help myself a little and I will see it when it comes out. The violence, though of course distasteful at times, this is a dark-thriller after all, was still restrained and reasonable (though very shocking at the end), considering the characters. You deserve a chill. Read it. Read it now."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really liked this book. The ending (I won't spoil it for you) I didn't exspect. It wasn't as creepy as 'Silence' but just as gory, if not more so. It was about Dr. Lecter after he escaped (6 years after). It tells the story of Manson Verger, a man he mamnied years prior to 'Silence.' Clairece is back, along with Barney and Jack Crawford. A few scenes were interestingly unpredictable but the rest of the novel follows Harris's stream of historical interest. If you enjoyed 'The Silence of the Lambs' and Lecters and Starlings twisted relationship (like me) you'll enjoy the book. Worth buying, if you do."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I know that a lot of people will be giving this book terrible reviews, however, I feel that in all fairness, this is not an honest assessment.I was enjoying this book the entire time I was reading it, right up until the shocking conclusion.I thought it was written very well and kept the attention of the reader throughout. Additionally, it has everything one needs in a good story....drama, mystery, gore and romance....yes, that was romance in a Hannibal Lecter novel. Go figure.Anyway, I think that it is a must read, however, be prepared to dislike the ending immensely, as I did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought this book was rather good. I did learn much about Florence, Italy and many other things. This book produced a person who was more evil than Dr. Lecter. This book makes you cheer for Hannibal and hope he gets out of certain situations. Now, about the ending. The last few chapters had me thinking about love in the air and I guess I was right. I do recommend this book to anyone who loves a good old maniac who is smarter than the world around him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't normally read a lot of books but when I did decide to start it was with this book. You always hear from people how the book is sometimes better than the actual movie so I decided to see what some pe were talking about. After reading this book while I was working on nights in a refinery, I can now understand what being scared can do to a person. I highly recommend this book if you want the HEEBEE JEEBEEZZ scared out of you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have already read &quot;Hannibal&quot; 5 times, and I must say that it is the best book of this trilogy. It's a shame that Jodie Foster has turned down the offer to reprise her role as Clarice. But, with that notwithstanding, I'm sure the movie is going to be as good as the book. I like the unique idea of revenge that Mason has in store for the good dottore. I also like the way Harris gives us insight into the characters and what their agendas are. What I like the most is the probable cause of why Lecter is how he is. I dont want to spoil the book, but, lets say it's very unique. The accuracy of the layout of Florence is nothing short of perfection, and this book is the absolute best way of closing out a chilling trilogy of a &quot;treasure dive&quot; into the human psyche, though this is far from a treasure dive. Simply a must read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely, but I believe I understand why many people choose to be shocked and negative about this latest offering in the saga of Hannibal Lechter. There is something in our civilization that wants to believe (even though we know better) that good will always triumph over evil and all the 'bad guys' will get it in the end. Surprise...The theme is reminiscent of Neitsche's admonition to &quot;Those who hunt monsters&quot; and is probably very disturbing to folks who compulsively lock there doors each night. Yeah, the bad guy wins every once in a while."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The Mason Verger character was despicable and heinous. That was the first turn off. When we go to Florence, all I could say was so what who cares."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This has to be the best book I have read this summer! It is so well written that you can almost experience each page happening. You learn the reason for Dr. Lecter's &quot;tastes&quot;, and the true depth of his psyche. Thomas Harris continues to tell a horrifying tale with class, and I can only hope that there will be more in the life of Hannibal Lecter!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only thing positive I can say is that I'm glad I resisted the urge to buy it in hardcover when it first came out. The style seemed to jump all over the place. The characters were a disappointment. I felt very odd indeed to be pulling for Hanibal to get away and disappointed to read that Clarice turned out not to be a strong woman afterall."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While an author is certainly entitled to write whatever book he/she wishes, one would think that they would feel SOME sort of responsibility to their readers/fans, in addition to remaining true to their fictional creations that have come before.Thomas Harris does neither of these with HANNIBAL. After RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, one reads HANNIBAL and comes away thinking that someone else must have written this book. This is not the Thomas Harris writing that we have come to love.Gone is the tight, suspenseful writing of the previous two books. There is no suspense and the writing is poor. The writing consists mainly of lines like: &quot;Clarice did THIS...&quot; or &quot;Dr. Lecter likes THAT...&quot;. HANNIBAL is all over the place. Too many locations, too many superfilous characters, too much verbiage. More is not always better. Unlike DRAGON and SOTL, which concentrated mainly on the protagonist and one or two other main characters and the suspense built from those interactions, HANNIBAL has a huge cast of supporting players that we're supposed to care about and don't. (Is/was Barney REALLY necessary in this book?) And, is Clarice the protagonist here or is Lecter? This confusion hurts the story, especially since I don't WANT Lecter to be a hero!HANNIBAL is too big, too sprawling. Example: we have a huge middle section that takes place in Florence. An Italian police officer works to have Lecter captured. This whole subplot is not only useless, but the denouement is completely predictable. We KNOW how it's going to end and it doesn't advance the plot at all (except to point out to us just how &quot;cultured&quot; Hannibal Lecter is).Harris' attempts at &quot;thrills&quot; are failures. There ARE NO thrills, there is no suspense. The fate of Starling's nemesis at book's end (at the dinner table) is ludicrous. And Harris couldn't come up with a better (and scarier) agent of revenge than killer PIGS?Lastly, and most importantly, there are the main characters. Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling are completely (pardon the expression) butchered. The young, confident, capable Clarice Starling becomes little more than a mindless zombie by novel's end. And Hannibal Lecter, who we've come to love as a sheer monster, is made to be an almost acceptable human being. His monsterousness is &quot;explained&quot;. Hannibal Lecter has become CHIC! It's almost as though Harris had contempt for the success of his characters...or his readers... and Harris said, &quot;I'll show them.&quot; And HANNIBAL is the result. Well, Harris showed us. Now I'll show him. I won't be purchasing any further novels from Mr. Harris based on the mess/disappointment that HANNIBAL is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Some books are so well written and so compelling that the reader hopes the book will never end. This is one of those books. As a fan of the Hannibal series, I only recently began reading Thomas Harris's books. With this book, I completed the first three books. Of these three, \\"Hannibal\\" shows the greatest difference from the movie. The plot lines omitted from the movie that are part of the book reveal several different dimensions to the story. These alterations leave the movie inferior to the book.Hannibal Lecter has been on the run for seven years. Not only is the FBI still seeking him, but Lecter's only living victim has the desire and means to return the pain Lecter inflicted. While the Starling and Hannibal story line largely runs parallel to the movie until the end, the book develops the Mason Verger character to greater depth. The book elaborates on Verger's motives while further explaining how Lecter was allowed to torture him. Margot Verger is never mentioned in the movie. As the bodybuilding sister of Mason, she plays a key role in Lecter's eventual escape. More importantly, she is an important device used by the author to reveal more about Mason Verger.The ending portrayed in the movie shows another marked difference from the book. It is the one part I liked better in the movie than the book. While the movie insinuates Hannibal may be a homosexual, the book dispells any doubts that he is heterosexual. In the book, Lecter and Starling run away together. Obviously, this means Hannibal never chopped off his hand and Starling released her desire for law enforcement in the book. The ending of the book makes it hard to believe that the Hannibal series would continue into the future. In the book however, the reader is given insight to the prequel plots that Thomas Harris is creating for the Hannibal series. While Hannibal's childhood seems traumatic from what we know, it will be interesting to see how Harris develops the story.Perhaps reading about a serial killing cannibal is a guilty pleasure. However, this book not only satisfied my palate, but it left me hungry for more. Fans of the series simply must read the books to accompany their love of the movies."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Tsk, tsk....Who could imagine that Hannibal Lecter would be *gasp* boring and silly? I've long admired Harris for his character development and knack for nail-biting suspense. He seems to take his time between novels which leads to rich, frightening reads. HANNIBAL, to me, seemed rushed and juvenile. So unlike you, Mr. Harris!From the very beginning, favorite characters from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and RED DRAGON do not behave consistently with the way they were originally written. I think Starling must have suffered several blows to the head to act as she did in this one. The entire sequence with her and Hannibal alone together is just not believable. And the scenes in Italy are uninteresting at best.Several times I wanted to put this novel away for good but kept reading in hopes that it would improve. Unfortunately, it just got worse and worse. If you have to read it, save some money and buy the paperback. I rushed out to buy it in hardback when it was released, and that hardback is now sitting in my &quot;to be donated&quot; box. I'm very disappointed, Mr. Harris. I'm a hardcore horror fan, and reading this novel took up time I could have used to read something worthwhile."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"By the time this book was published, Hannibal Lecter had become a common piece of pop culture, largely due to the success of the film, The Silence of the Lambs. Despite the amount of anticipation for the followup to the novel Silence of the Lambs, on which the film was based, Thomas Harris managed to present a thriller that is a worthy successor. The scares and thrills are bigger and better than any of the other two novels to feature the character, and I really enjoyed the ironically poetic ending. With this installment, Harris proves why his novels are some of the best psychological thrillers of a generation."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"when i picked this book up i wasn't sure what to expect. i had seen the bad movie years ago but didn't remember any of it. I just read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs back to back and was ready for more. In a nutshell I was hooked right away and I unlike other and like some others loved this book. Well written, entertaining and thoroughly engrossing and I think it had to do with reading the others first. I have grown to actually like Dr. Lector because of this book and appreciate him for whatever he is. He became a fascination for me and I wanted to learn more. This book is what it is, it is not a 'Silence' sequel but frankly its is better then both those books combined."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I hesitated before purchasing this book because I readso many mixed reviews from customers and critics but I'mso glad I decided to buy it. I absolutely loved thisbook and the interesting characters and the bizarreand perverse mind of Thomas Harris. I couldn't put thisone down and each night I hoped I wouldn't fall asleep so I couldread a few more pages; alas, the book ended. Unfortunately,this is the last of the Lecter series. My only problemwith the book is the last couple chapters but I won't give anyspoilers away, you'll just have to read it and see what I mean.Of course, this is what Lecter wanted all along, not what wewanted for Clarice.I'm ready for another sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris is a talented writer, no doubt. He writes with conviction and his subjects, numerous and varied, are exhaustively researched to a fault. However, what made Silence of the Lambs so good -- the interaction between intriguing characters and griping pace -- is lost in Hannibal.When I picked this book up, I wanted more of one of my favorite antagonists of all time: Hannibal Lecter. Instead, he got lost in lengthy narrative and characters I just didn't care about. So much of the first half follows Pazzi and Carlo attempting to apprehend Hannibal when I want to be inside Hannibal's head.There are flashes of the magic that made Silence of the Lambs so compelling, but it gets diluted with so many unnecessary subplots and Harris's tendency to write exhausting details about scenes and subjects. The only new character that felt up to the task was the main antagonist, Mason. But, again, he seemed to get lost in a novel that overreaches.I suppose I was disappointed more by my expectations than Harris's ability to write."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can understand where some would dislike the ending, but the way it is described as building up and happening, I can see where Clarice might get some Stockholm Syndrome.Very interesting book. I bought it immediately after it came out, and was very excited a few years after that when I heard they were doing a movie. Well, the Hannibal movie was entertaining but cut out key characters (Margot Verger) and changed the ending. Movies normally aren't as good as the book and this was no exception."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is simply amazing...a true work of art in every sense of the word. In Hannibal, author Thomas Harris has weaved a tale 10 years in the making, to follow-up the epic Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal Lector is the greatest fictional character of all time, melding unspeakable physical brutality and unthinkable psychological powers. He touches the soul of all he encounters, for better or worse, with unfettered honesty and truth. In a very dark corner of my memory palace, I actually wish Hannibal Lecter existed, for the sheer power of his mind. I have read \\"Hannibal\\" literally dozens of times and always discover new details in it's rich prose. Passages in this book evoke self-reflection. A choice to see yourself through the monster's eyes and under his microscope. I believe this was Thomas Harris' goal all along."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just couldn't help myself. After getting about half-way through, I found myself compelled to read on to the silly end. The plot loses its way and gets messy. Giving Lecter's character a reason for his behavior served no purpose other than pandering to the human need to give motives to horrific acts. Lecter was better as a personality mutation making an artistic statement than a victim who's damaged childhood drives him to kill."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it to be scary and suspenseful. The story ends on a perfect note, leaving the reader wondering if Clarice will ever escape ... and into what the offspring of Margot Verger (via Mason Verger) develops. I hope that Mr. Harris will write again ... and not make us wait for 7 years!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Never before has the ending of a book totally ruined my reading experience before Hannibal. I got to the point where I couldn't wait for it to end. It just seemed to get more and more ridiculous as it went along.The best thing I can say about the book is that Harris certainly has a way with character development. Whether you like them or not, the characters in Hannibal are well developed, interesting and memorable, even if the story wasn't.Where have you gone Thomas Harris?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While some parts of the story werecompelling, the central plot was contrived. It was like Harris rackedhis brain for a sadistic torture that he could incorporate into the story to top &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. The ending of the story was preposterous. It's a shame, first Larry McMurtry sells out to write pure gore, now Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I stayed up until 1:30 to finish reading the book, and am still not quite sure if it was worth my time. On the whole, i thought the book was well written, and the story was interesting. Most interesting was Mason Verger who actually seemed to upstage Hannibal as the guy you love to hate. I actually found myself pulling for Hannibal towards the end. The end was a shocker, and it will be interested to see if the movie will take the same turn..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I realize Thomas Harris takes a long time between books, but this one seems to have been written in a very short time, particularly the ending. It's almost as if he wanted to get people to quit asking him what was going to happen next, so he tossed something together.I was very disappointed in the way he seemingly ran out of ideas at the end of the novel, and I thought many of the characters were of the throwaway variety. Without the added dialogue and activities revolving around Barney (why was he even here?) and Margot, as well as other wasted characters, this book could have been much shorter, which is a shame to say, because it was an easy read.The major characters were not handled much better. Mason Verger was a caricature (drinking the tears of children? Come on!), and the way Harris treated Starling is the biggest shame of the book. Lecter's underlying reasons for his criminal life were not convincing, either, although they were painful to read.On the other hand, the portion of the book that took place in Italy was good. It was interesting to see the way ancient history carries over into everyday life, and how Lecter immersed himself in that culture. I was actually able to understand the motivations behind the police official trying to catch Lecter; his character was one of the few &quot;real people&quot; in the book.I hope that if Mr. Harris delves into Lecter again, it will be from early in his career. Otherwise, I think it would be best to just let sleeping (or is that stinking) dogs lie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A very good book that is not as much of a pure thriller as one would expect. It is a testament to Thomas Harris' skill that he could create a scenario where Dr. lecter is seen as distinctly sympathetic compared to a creation of malevolent evil driven by calculated revenge. A good book - not a great one though."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book had me turning pages so fast, my fingers felt hot; I wondered if the pages would burst into flame. All the way until the end, when I felt betrayed! After almost two complete books covering not just Hannibal Lecter, but Clarice Starling, Thomas Harris wrote an ending which went completely counter to the person - personality, morals, ethics, and integrity - with which he built our favorite FBI agent. It just felt wrong."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Where did this come from? The ending, at least to me, was not really beleivable and made my evaluation go from 5 to 3 stars.This book goes in stages. The 1st hundred pages fly by, then the next hundred are tough to get through, then it picks up speed until the ending, where you are left wondering how in the hell that could be the ending. UGH."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Superficial motives, unbelievable scenes, a prodding plot and weak grammar combine to make one of the worst reading experiences I have ever had. The appeal of Harris' earlier books, a quick peek into distorted minds, is lost here. We see to far in, and discover characters without a drop of subtelty."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Its all about the endings. How can you read a book that you have enjoyed thoroughly, but the ending is less then adequate? I found this book to be quite interesting, but it doesn't matter, what matters is that the ending took me by surprise, and left me quite shocked, but in a good way."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How could Thomas Harris have done this? For once in my life, I can actually understand what the main character in 'Misery' felt like when her favorite author killed off her favorite character. This book was a good read, until the end, which was an utter and complete let down. Yes, Thomas Harris has found new and interesting ways to scare, gross-out and disgust, and so if you are curious, then this book will satisfy some of that curiosity. Read this book only if you have nothing else to read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think that Hannibal Lector should be admired for his intelligence, but cautiously approached because he is a monster. The book had too many monsters. No major character in the book was redeemable. Even Clarice Starling became a monster. Unfortunately, in this book Hannibal Lector's monstrous presence can not compare with the pedifile Mason Verger and his murderous sister. I found myself cheering for Lector and sickened by the fact that I was. The last four chapters left a bad taste in my mouth, and the only charater that I liked at the end was Ardelia."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A fabulous sequel, the characters jump out of the pages. Clarice develops a complexity that was missing in &quot;Silence&quot; she becomes a woman, a disillusioned bureaucrat, a mourner and is a willing subject/student of Dr. Lecter's. She must blur the lines between good and evil. Lecter may actually evoke your compassion as more of his backround is revealed and we can understand and appreciate his anger and humor. Together they are electric."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The follow up novel to Silence of the Lambs exceeded my expectations. It was interesting to see the shift in character of both Lecter and Starling. The ending was so suprising that I read all night to finish the book. I hope Harris writes another very soon. This is one delighted reader."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Why does Harris use present tense in the front of each chapter and switch to past tense once the action gets going? Why does the book end without Clarice overcoming the political backstabbing at the FBI? She was such a strong character in Silence of the Lambs, but now she's as spineless as a jellyfish. There's more to a good book than disgusting imagery and hooks. What a waste of time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is one of the most vivid and interesting novels I have ever read. You end up caring about certain characters, while passionately hating others. This novel is not for the weak of heart (or stomach for that matter). The best thing about the third novel in the Lecter trilogy, is that it is not the same as The Red Dragon (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs (though both are also good novels)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is an intriguing character and his adventures are entertaining, however, this book is not as exciting as the lambs was. If this is your first exposure to Thos. Harris, I recommend stepping away from this book and reading Silence of the Lambs first."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One thing not touched upon in these reviews is the way Harris (through Lecter) constantly reminds the reader how dumb they are compared to great minds like Lecter. The book is pretentious in the extreme, more of a class in antiquities and cooking than anything suspenseful. So, dear reader, you can't cook with white truffles? Too bad for you. The tone of the book is snotty and lets the reader feel his/her inferior education at every turn. And how does the incredibly superior Lecter fall afoul of his enemies? When Interpol and the FBI can't find him for seven years, he gets grabbed in a Safeway parking lot by a carful of goons. Does this make any sense? No, but it needed to happen for the sake of the alleged plot.One has a feeling this was written in just a few months. It is unedited and has a first draft quality. Mistakes that wouldn't get by in a freshman English class are on every page.Overall, Hannibal insults the reader. Save your $$. Pure junk."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There were some things I liked - the FBI stuff, the shootout in the first chapter. I also found myself liking Hannibal - he had good reasons for killing some of those people. It was pretty well-written, but...I thought Mason's sister was ridiculous, and I was a little annoyed with the fact I predicted the ending. Everything tied together a little too neatly. I'm glad I didn't buy the book - it was a gift. I thought Silence of the Lambs was better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought this was one of the worst books that I have read in a long time. It seemed contrived and pretentious. It took short cuts that took out all the tension, and ended on a truly simple and trivial manner."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I knew from the opening line there could be trouble. Having enjoyed Red Dragon as well as Silence of the Lambs, I was expecting a knock-out punch from Hannibal, which Harris half delivers on; I was intrigued with Dr. Fell/Hannibal Lector. Questions are answered and pieces to the puzzle are revealed in regard to why he is deranged which is cool. Italian cop and Lector whistle blower Pazzi is interesting as is Mason Verger family and friends, although it was a bit much in parts. Barney, the former nurse/orderly and now Lector &quot;Guru&quot; is good. Paul Krendler, the big gun and corrupt nemesis from Justice is midly entertaining, a tad weak at times. I liked the open mind line. Clarice Starling's character never really took off for me, I wanted it to, and it had nothing to do with her metamorphisis. It seemed forced and wooden, too predictable (until the end?). Who to root for? Hannibal was hard for me to put down sometimes though. I found Harris' colorful description of Florence pleasing as the good Dr.'s taste in cousine, drink, music, the arts...In the end, I wasn't necessarily let down, or even surprised. Like I said in the beginning, I knew from the opening line there could be trouble..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Sometimes I wonder what Thomas Harris has done to the classic THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Because, sometimes, I sequel is not needed to understand the characters. That's why I wonder if Thomas Harris should have written this book.Just in the beginning, you realize that there will be many surprises on the story. And that's the good point on the book, at least in the beginning. The problem is that Thomas Harris told everything about his most famous character, Hannibal Lecter. He probably didn't remember that good stories shouldn't be told twice. Mary Shelley didn't have to write two books to make Frankenstein a classic. Bram Stoker didn't have to do it to make Dracula a classic. But if Thomas Harris felt that way, who can blame the creator for doing what he's done to his creature? No one.And although the reader will see many surprises - many of them which they won't like - , the reading is not terrible. The book is a very enjoyable piece, and you feel compelled all the time. Then comes the ending of the story... Well, who can blame the creature?Time will say if this is a book Thomas Harris will regret for have written it or not. The readers already made their choice.Marco Aurelio."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was cautious about buying this book as I had read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and thouroghly enjoyed them. Curiosity got the better of me however and I gave way to tempation.I have to say I thought the book began well, the first part was compelling, all the usual suspense was there along with the characters we met in the previous books. There were also various new and interesting people. Sadly by the time the book moved to Florence the pace was lost. It seemed the author was trying desperately to flaunt a knowledge of Italy and was concentrating on padding the book out to it's final 562 pages. Thankfully some pace was regained by the end of the Florence part and the well known characters of the previous books were once again central to the story.In reading on my spirits lifted, as I felt the book was improving and I believed I could forgive the author for the boring interlude. Alas this was not the case. The final part of the book was so preposterous that I felt frustrated beyond imagination. The author rushed to the ending seemingly without any real thought as to how the characters have been written all along and how much of a sudden contradiction this brought. Then it just finished, using Barney in a rather crass final chapter to let us know where Starling was.I feel that this book could have been much better if Harris had remained true to the characters he created in the beginning of the series rather than trying to delve into pastures new. He completely distroyed any feelings of familiarity I had with the main characters and left them distorted beyond recognition. Maybe I am just set in my ways, but I believe the characters in Silence of the Lambs were powerful and did not require this twist to make them any more interesting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris obviously got tired of the publishers and public asking when the next Hannibal Lecter novel would appear, so he produced this load of garbage. Hopefully this will be the last one. Readers who enjoyed the first 2 books would be better off if they read MESSIAH by BORIS STARLING or THE PSALM KILLER by CHRIS PETIT."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After considering Thomas Harris' earlier works as exceptional entertainment, I found I had an exceptionally difficult time even getting through this book. One wonders if the same person wrote it as the writing styles seemed to change throughout -- sometime in the normal third person and sometimes as the all-knowing narrator -- making the book extremely difficult to read. Probably the biggest disappointment was in how the author chose to end this novel. After giving us exceptionally strong characters in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, these same characters rolled over and died without a fight(sometimes literally) in the sequel. If Thomas Harris was seeking contraversy, he hit the mark. If he was seeking a quality novel, he went off course about a third of the way through. Bottom line: don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Gross, not particularly frightening, and way too long. The character of Hannibal, however, is developed with consistency and verocity -- I can hear Anthony Hopkins saying the words and can see him moving about using the gestures and mannerisms so expertly described. On the other hand, the behavior of Starling is completely inconsistent with the personality developed in Silence of the Lambs. Additionally, the sub-plot of vengeance by Mason didn't hang together for me, and seemed contrived. Merely an excuse to have Starling meet up with Lecter again. Overall, I'd have to give this one a thumbs down. This is one of those rare stories where the movie will surely surpass the book in terms of its entertainment value."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read this book in about three days, and had trouble putting it down. Yes, it did bogg down in places, and true, there was no sense of dread throughout most of it, but it was definitely worth the time. There was alot more Harris could have done with this novel that he did not do. And, too much time was spent in Florence with the Dr Fell thing. The ending was almost obscene to those who adore Special Agent Starling...you'll see when you read it. I hated the ending and I would have liked to see it completed much differently, possibly in a way to leave the door open for a fourth book. With that said, I enjoyed the book and recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I didn't find this book nearly as good as Silence of the Lambsor Red Dragon but it is an exciting story with now familiar characters... The finale is grotesque but so hard to believe that it detracted from the many wonderful pages of mystery and suspense that preceded it. But if you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, I suspect you won't regret reading Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After the thrill of Red Dragon and the suspense of Silence of th Lambs, one cannot blame Thomas Harris for a last attempt at cashing in on the craze. This book is poorly written, untrue to the characters, and uneventful. If you haven't read it, I suggest you don't, and just simply reread Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. It will be time well spent."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't recall a more elegant thriller than &quot;Hannibal&quot;-- in its careful, restrained use of language, its well-drawn characters, and especially in its commanding use of painstaking research. The book is replete with interesting facts about medicine, history, forensics, zoology, animal husbandry, medieval literature, art, cooking, the city of Florence, the Italian language, classical music, and wine-- all presented with Thomas' sure, confident touch.This is not a conventional sequel, and many fans of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; will surely be horrified by this book's extremely shocking conclusion. Those in particular who regarded Clarice Starling as a feminist icon (including, perhaps, Jody Foster) may feel betrayed. However, I think Harris should be commended for his courage. The easiest (and most profitable) thing for him to do would have been to give us a &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; rehash, tailor-made for another blockbuster film adaptation.Most of the plot concerns Mason Verger, a meat-packing tycoon and an early victim of Hannibal Lecter. A child molester whose victims include his own sister, Verger is as diabolical in his way as the doctor himself. Paralyzed and disfigured by his brush with Lecter, he is planning an elaborate and ghastly revenge-- which Harris describes with a morbid lyricism worthy of Edgar Allen Poe. The conflict here is between two monsters: one attractive (Lecter), one unattractive (Verger). Harris subtly encourages us to root for Lecter, giving &quot;Hannibal&quot; a moral landscape far more ambiguous, more disturbing, and more ironic than most thrillers.Although I'm saving my pennies for the hardcover version, the 6-hour audio abridgement that I was lucky enough to find at my local library features a nicely understated reading by Thomas Harris himself-- speaking in a craggy, Mississippi-inflected voice that made me think of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While Silence of the Lambs is the best film in the Hannibal series. Hannibal by far is the best of the book series. Actually it's a masterpiece, if you can handle it. The way Harris develops plot and character is amazing. It is by far the weirdest and strangest. With characters who are disturbed, crooked, or cannibals this book is not for the faint of heart. The story his Harris's best and the themes are the most thought-provoking.The story begins with the downfall of Clarice Starling (one of the best developed character in books today); a drug bust goes wrong, Crawford can't defend her anymore from injustice, and Hannibal Lector once in a while sends her letter. Her world is falling apart and you feel for her. Meanwhile Mason Verger, a child molester who Lector deformed has revenge on his mind and will pay anything or anyone to hunt down Lector alive so he can, well you'll see. Then there is Pazzi an Italian detective who hasn't had a big break for a couple of years and decides to hunt down Lector to get Verger's fee, little does he know how cunning Lector really is. And finally the controversial ending that everyone talks about. Its shocking and unexpected, if you haven't read about it yet, I'm still not sure if I like it, but you will think about for days.The world is a dark place even for those who are good, is there light or redemption, or is there just death and mayhem. These are questions the book raises. Almost all the characters are the definition of grey; both good and evil are inside them. Its makes you look at yourself and what you have become. And what about all the biblical undertones? Powerful, masterful, and amazing, Hannibal will shock and haunt you for weeks. It might even make you think."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Being one of Thomas Harris' most dedicated fans, I purchased this novel upon the day of its release and eagerly gobbled up every sinewy morsel. After finishing, completely in awe of Harris' work (as always), I was astonished that so many had been disappointed, even appalled, by this offering. Speaking as one who has gone as far as to seek out and purchase first editions of all four Harris novels, I can say this...\\"Hannibal\\" was NOT as good as \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\"...this much is true. Then again, \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" wasn't as good as \\"Red Dragon\\" was. But \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" was still a fine novel and a fitting sequel to \\"Red Dragon\\"...just as \\"Hannibal\\" is a fitting final entry in the series. What Harris has given us here is almost a parody, a caricature of Lecter as he appeared in the first two novels...and why not? Now that Lecter is free, is it not plausible that he would be behaving quite differently than he did while confined? As for one reviewer's note that Lecter has been transformed into a \\"psychopath-wizard-pharmacist-scholar-surgeon\\"...well, apart from being a wizard, Hannibal has always been skilled in anatomy (see the previous books for further elaboration on this point) and his training as a psychiatrist would certainly explain his knowledge of pharmaceuticals...and who can deny that the good doctor has ALWAYS been a scholar? So, why is it that the same readers who believed Lecter capable of accurately depicting the Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo (as seen from the Belvedere, mind you) solely from memory find his actions and capabilities in this novel so far-fetched? Lecter's intelligence, let us remember, has never been successfully measured by any standardized testing. As for Starling's actions in the book's closing chapters, she WAS under the influence of heavy drugs when she first bonded, shall we say, with Lecter...and, after learning the reasoning behind Lecter's cannibalism, she felt a certain kinship with him, and even an empathy for this man who was initially described to her as a monster. And what this novel does so brilliantly is to bring to light the root source of Lecter's psychosis...something which had always been the subject of fierce doubt. After all, people don't become serial killers (much less CANNIBALISTIC serial killers) without reason. And the childhood trauma experienced by Lecter as a child in WWII Europe certainly explains well enough why the doctor has such a taste for human flesh. And let's not forget that Thomas Harris didn't HAVE to write this novel. He was at the peak of his popularity with \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" after the film version prompted many to pick up the novel at their local bookstores...he had written three #1 best-selling novels, all of which were adapted for the screen, and he was living the good life in Italy, feeling no financial or career-oriented pressure. He never had to write another word as long as he lived. He had earned his living, and he'd certainly made his mark. This novel was a GIFT from Mr. Harris to us, his loyal fans worldwide. It's a gift which I, personally, had been waiting YEARS for...and I loved every word of it..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I thought Silence of the Lambs was incredible in its readability and fast-paced, terrifying action. How could this have been bad, I wondered? Familiar characters, familiar writer. Was I ever wrong. Thomas Harris, what were you thinking? Most of this was tedious and slow as molasses. Harris seemed determined to give us every detail he could while we were &quot;visiting&quot; Italy with Hannibal...and it was all I could do to push through the endless descriptions of this street, that street, this church, that church. I'm all for setting and mood, but this was like a travelogue which rambled on and on to distraction. Harris' back-and-forth between tenses, I'm sure, was an attempt to be creative and to &quot;flow&quot; but it stopped me cold each time. It was like gears changing in a car and scraping madly each time. But the worst sin of all in this novel which held so much promise was the incredible depart from character at the end. I won't say anything to &quot;spoil&quot; the story but I felt like I'd suddenly been thrown into Bizarro World. I believe a writer has the right to create his/her own conclusion, but this was so out of left field I was almost insulted as a reader, as someone who had invested some time into the main characters. I was supposed to *believe* this could happen this way? Don't bother. This was a waste of a weekend for me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris lured me into this book with his reputation (\\"Silence of the Lambs\\") and kept me there, albeit reluctantly, with his skills as a writer. Unfortunately, in the case of \\"Hannibal,\\" the plot leaves a lot to be desired. The whole thing was so bizarre that I had to finish it just to see how it turned out, but did I like what I was reading? Not so much. I'm referring specifically to the ending, which I thought was absolutely ridiculous. I can't accept that the Clarice Starling readers have come to know, admire, and even love, would ever run off with Lecter.As far as the other characters are concerned, the new ones are so far over the top as to be completely unrealistic (Mason and Margot), and most of those we remember from \\"Silence\\" behave in ways that are just too outrageous to be credible. I finished this book and just sat with my mouth open, unable to believe what I had just read. \\"Sex is a splendid structure they add to every day,\\" is not a sentence I ever wanted to read about Starling and Lecter. It's just...wrong. Granted, these are Harris' characters and he can do with them what he likes, but I think he dropped the ball on this one.My last complaint: Harris' clumsy attempts to explain the origin of Hannibal's evil. He should have left well enough alone. To me, it is much scarier *not* to know why Hannibal Lecter is the way he is; it leaves open the possibility that it anyone could become such a monster. I imagine people had their own theories, and when something like that is left to the reader's imagination, it can assume many shapes. When Harris gives us Lecter's backstory, as unusual as it may be, he forever closes the door on our possibilities, and thereby reduces Lecter as a villain, although he does perhaps become somewhat more sympathetic a character. I don't think we needed to know *why* Lecter is evil; it is enough to simply know that he is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've waited ten years for the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs; ten very patient years because I believed the longer the wait, the bigger the payoff. Wrong. If Thomas Harris spent the last ten years meticulously writing this latest installment, I'll eat my liver. Now hang on, I don't mean to say this is a bad novel, in fact it will make a tremendous movie. That's the problem...it read like a screenplay. The characters I grew to know in the last novel just didn't seem real enough and I didn't really feel anything about anyone. The writing seemed rushed, and as a whole rested on the laurels of Silence of the Lambs, of which there were many references. On the other hand, the story is pretty darn good. So this is a mixed review...great story, disappointing writing. To be frank, I first smelled trouble when the highest accolades came from Stephen King, whose endorsements I take with a truckload of salt. I recommend you read it, just don't set your hopes as high as I did and you'll enjoy a good story. And be sure you have an Italian-English dictionary on hand for those annoying non-translated passages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't see how anyone can give this book 5 stars; I debated between 1 and 2. I read this book over the summer with three friends. Three quarters of the way through we all had a tough time with the basic plot: a past, living victim of Lecter's cannibalistic tendencies wants him dead. His answer: hire someone to catch him and feed him to a group of really hungry pigs. Somehow the author made it believable, so it worked. But the last few chapters were so incredibly disappointing each of us confessed we were screaming back at the book. It seems Harris either didn't know how to end this book, or he simply ended it this particular way because he knew the book would turn into a movie and that audiences would appreciate this ending. By now you are wondering what the ending is if you haven't read it...I won't tell you but if you are dying to know, borrow it from a friend who had to pay good money for it. Harris' writing is spectcular, yes, and he weaves together a good story--but the character Clarice seems downsized in personality whereas I was almost becoming bored with Lecter. I hate to say it, but I wish I never read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Let me say at the outset: I love Thomas Harris's work. I have read and listened on audio to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs multiple times. I did not care as much for the movie Silence of the Lambs, because I thought they got elements of the Lecter/Starling relationship wrong.Well, the movie didn't get it nearly as wrong as Mr. Harris himself in this novel.Although the novel is completely engrossing (and will gross you out), I simply didn't believe the ending. I could very well have accepted it if I could have seen the logical development of Clarice's character moving in that direction. I was left thinking &quot;Why?&quot; I was sorry to see Clarice come to such a sorry end. I genuinely liked her. And, I would have continued to like her if I could have seen her character developing in that direction. But it was almost like I was moving along the road South, then all of the sudden - OOPS! I'm going East! It was awkward and poorly developed. It was not that it was a surprise ending - it was a poorly contrived surprise ending.I was very intrigued by the development of Dr. Lecter, and recognized that I was &quot;rooting&quot; for him. I wanted to know more about Dr. Lecter after reading the two earlier works, especially about how he developed his predeliction for cannibalism and torture. The background on the Tooth Fairy and Buffalo Bill were some of the best parts of their respective books, and part of what I felt was missing in the move adaptation of &quot;Lambs.&quot; Harris does almost as well here, though I wanted more.Mason Verger was a revolting and fascinating villain. I easily was more sympathetic toward Dr Lecter.There was lots of Harris's trademark detail and atmosphere. I did not resent the time spent on Florentine history and art, but I wish he had spent equal time developing Dr Lecter's past, and also on developing the Clarice plot so that the ending made sense."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What's with Harris' obsession with farm animals? I enjoyed this insofar as sections of the book went. I think anyone expecting this to top &quot;Lambs&quot; is being unrealistic. A) This is a sequel (really the first, if you consider the worldwide success of the &quot;Lambs&quot; film vs. &quot;Manhunter&quot; aka &quot;Red Dragon&quot;) and B) Sequels are usually disappointing. What I give this novel credit for is an interesting portrayal of Hannibal living it up after escaping the asylum. Very interesting and believably done. I also enjoyed the first part of Starling's dilemna at her job, though it devolved into an overblown and improbable scenario. And while I think the ending was written as though Harris had been doing ecstacy for three weeks straight, I give him credit for being ballsy enough to go there. Nobody can say they predicted THAT ending! I thought his writing was up to par, but the story-telling was too random and left Starling dangling in the breeze for way too long. I lost interest and went about reading it as more of a serial (no pun intended) ... treating each section as a new episode in the lives of Starling and Hannibal. I enjoyed it as I would a campy trashy movie. But mine is a peculiar and forgiving taste and I wouldn't reccommend this book strongly to anyone expecting what most of the disappointed reviewers seem to have expected."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't say I'm surprised at the mixed reviews here. I first read Hannibal the week it came out in hardcover. I finished it in three or four days, and found it one of the ugliest, most depressing stories I have ever read. As others have suggested here, the ending was entirely unbelievable, and near ruined the entire book for me. But...With the release of the movie version this February (2001), I decided to go back and re-read all of Harris' &quot;Lecter&quot; books, in order: Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal. I thought maybe I'd find a progression of character and relationship that would make the end of Hannibal more palatable, if not believable. For any reader who still has copies of all three books, I encourage you to read them, back-to-back. I can't promise that the ending of Hannibal will make total sense, but I found the exercise totally enjoyable. The first two books still hold up as classics of the genre, and Hannibal emerges as a daring, more experimental extension of the Starling/Lecter relationship that emerged in the second book.One disappointing thing about reading all three in quick succession: I realized that TSOTL is really just a retelling of Red Dragon -- they both involve the FBI's hunt for a serial killer, and in both books, the Bureau turns to Dr. Lecter for help. Lecter's cat-and-mouse games with the FBI make both books shine, but Harris outdoes himself with the Starling/Lecter relationship in TSOTL, making it, at least for me, the better book.It's this relationship that Harris tackles in Hannibal, and if you found it (the relationship) to be the most interesting and frightening thing about TSOTL, you really can't miss Hannibal. On rereading it, I appreciated Harris' refusal to simply tell another FBI v. serial killer tale -- this book has psychological depth that few horror/thriller books ever come close to. It's fascinating and subtle, exciting and well-written. If the end stretches things a bit too far, so what? The ride was exhilarating and challenging, and the ending will leave you thinking about it for days, refusing to accept it.And perhaps that's the point . . ."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With Harris's talent at description and pace, I was looking forward to this sequel. &quot;Hannibal&quot; starts out well, with Starling well rounded out and changed in the seven years that have passed. Somewhere around the middle, the plot starts to falter, and the characters begin to act as if they were in a cartoon rather than a novel. By the end, readers have landed squarely in the Land of the Prepostorous. I could almost sense Harris losing interest in his book as it continued, and the nice, neat ending tied up in a pink bow is almost insulting. It's a shame that two such interesting and stimulating characters as Starling and Lector have been reduced to intellectualized romantic trash novel characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's a new American masterpiece by America's greatest living writer. Enough said? We've waited a long time for this one, and &quot;we&quot; are not disappointed. Awesome."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is splendidly written, absorbing, with scenes knowledgeably set in Florence and within the Beltway area (never to be confused with Florence), and Harris provides a human touch to Dr. Lecter's life. A must-read book, suspenseful and never gratuitous. Best, Justice is truly &quot;served&quot;! This is really not that violent a book; there are a few &quot;public service&quot; killings the reader will enjoy.Bravo, Thomas Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris's novel is like Silence of the Lambs but worse ... he's guilty of committing the cardinal sin of repeating himself, and making the opportunity of writing a great sequel nothing more than a joke. It's like a movie sequel which has no chance of living up to the original. It doesn't engage with anything more than a post-modernist's masturbatory fixation upon violence without cause or reproach. American Psycho, in all its minimalist glory rips it to pieces (no pun intended). Shame really, once again the hype betrays the product. Mind you, the way things normally go .... the next novel should be infinitely better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the first section of &quot;Hannibal.&quot; All I can say is, WOW! I came away envious of Harris' writing ability. . .It's not diminished one bit since &quot;Silence.&quot;I saw the movie version of &quot;Silence,&quot; then read the book. The book was better, which is saying a lot since the movie blew my mind.I hope Hopkins and Foster reunite to do this movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins has said that he's retiring from acting, though. We'll see."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've waited years for this sequel, and unlike many of our cultural events which get overhyped to the point of nausea(i.e Star Wars), Hannibal came out of nowhere...And it doesnt disappoint (i.e Star Wars). Harris proves again that he is arguably the greatest literary thriller writer of all time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really wanted to like this book in the worst way, but it just was not happening. All the realism that Silence had is thrown out the window in this one. Lecter has become almost like one of the bad guys from the Firday the 13th/Halloween movies. It would be easy to pick the book apart by going in depth about the story line, but don't want to spoil the book for anyone. Face it, no matter how many bad reviews are written, you will still want to read it. If this ever gets made into a movie, count on it being vastly different from the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like the title of my post implies. Hannibal Lecter is one of the most unforgettable fictional characters I have ever read. However, I found the pace sometimes rather leisurely (I felt like shouting &quot;get on with it!&quot; at several points).Also, I wonder if anyone really edited the book for the author. Sometimes, Harris makes a very confusing reference.I also have counted and counted in the scene at the beginning where a shootout takes place, and I only note four people being shot by a particular character and not five as it is later stated.The ending of the book is pleasingly surreal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have some problems with this book.. as the book starts it sucks you into its world and is Very compelling and just makes you turn page after page as the plot unfolds and the darkness Of the whole book is revealed. The characters are all you could expect (and then a lot more beside!).. but I have problems with the last 100 (approx.) pages which in itself is very good but I just cannot believe the changes in major characters that we have to expect to make the ending work.In short the book start well and then just gets better &amp; better (this book is a bulldozer that just keeps on going) and the ending is good (ok) but I just cannot connect the end &amp; the start"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The action takes place seven years later as we revisit familiar characters such as Jack Crawford, Ardelia Mapp, and of course Clarice and the good doctor. I have read many, many a book. Few possess me with a spirit to read straight through to the end in one sitting, but this one did. To me, Harris is as selective in his taste of words as Lecter is in his tastes of the finer things of life. The scenes towards the conclusion are perhaps some of the most chilling scenes I have read so far in my life. This is certainly one of the best books I've had the fortune to buy in the last few years."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book was excellent and the delivery was fast and very convenent to order on line. the book was very interesting alot better then the movie. The book made you feel as if you were there watching form the sidelines it took you into their own little world.

Dr. Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter is once again wanted by the FBI and on their ten most wanted list. He has been missing for ten years since he escaped from prison. Agent Clarice Starling is now a full Agent in the bureau and the head of a task force. She was busy with a prestigious drug bust when the raid became a bloody mess which resulted in Starling being wounded, a good friend's death, and the death of Evelda Drumgo, a wanted drug lord. After the mess, Clarice was put back on Lecter's case. In order to catch the mad man she once knew, she has to seek the help of one of Hannibal's victims, the only to survive, Mason Verger. Little does Starling know that Verger is using her in order to catch Lecter for means of personal revenge.After his escape, Lecter left the United States for Italy. Now living in Florence, under a false name, he lives a life of class much like before his imprisonment. Florence's police chief Rinaldo Pazzi consults Dr. Fell, also known as Hannbal Lecter, about disappearances and murders in the Florence area. When Pazzi is consulted by the American FBI about Lecter, he begins to wonder and his curiosity with the cannibalistic maniac later leads to his horrible death.I enjoyed Hannibal. Thomas Harris once again pulled off an excellent psychological suspense novel that keeps the reader guessing. This is Hannibal best role ever. No longer is he the enraged psychopath/sociopath that he has been in both Red Dragon and The Silence Of The Lambs. He has now become a much more classy cannibal. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy the Hannibal Lecter trilogy and those who can stomach graphic violence. This is also a novel for a mature audience due to graphically described scenes and language. This was a great story and an excellent way to end the trilogy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished this book last night and I must say that I completely enjoyed it. This book becomes even more interesting as, we are allowed into the mind and past of the infamous Dr. Lecter himself. Harris does a wonderful job of creating people and enviorments that are extremely deatlied and filled with emotion. Some have called this novel, the worst book in the series, but I'd have to disagree with them because, as far as I'm concerned, there isn't a band book in the series. I do hope that Harris might consider writing a new addition to the series, but if this is the last time we hear from the doctor, then it was truly a \\"tasty\\" experiance."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It seems that many people did not like this book, but after listening to the unabridged performance on audio cassette, I found the story compelling and psychologically intriguing, once you cut through the campy melodrama. Grant you, some of the characters, in particular, the hideously incapacitated Mason Verger, are portrayed as one-dimensional over-the-top drones on a mission that simply drive the story's action rather than provide psychological intrigue. Clarice who in 'Silence of the Lambs' was both intrigued and repelled by Lector now seems more reticent regarding him, yet remains intent on capturing him alive before he strikes again. However, her fate, albeit befuddled, befits her portrayal in this storyline. The Italian police inspector, Pazzi, proves to be an adequate fly caught within Lector's web of mindgames; Harris' well-researched information regarding the Florence of Dr. Fell's world interests the reader enough to pursue Lector's penchants for the world's finer things with outside resources.Above all, one cannot help but like Hannibal Lector. Harris' disclosure regarding an episode in his childhood gives some indication of why he chose his rather (un)savory road, but remains mysterious enough to stimulate thought regarding this rather than providing definitive answers regarding all his motivations. His passion for good music, books, 'food' and wine, amusingly calls to mind the traits of some of my more ambitious friends; his anger with those who offend and downtrod the innocent can be thought questionably admirable rather than strictly abhorent.The characters of Barney from 'Silence of the Lambs' and Margot, Mason's sister and one-time patient of Lector are examples of Harris' more complicated studies; both are interesting and enjoyable characterizations.When reading this, try not to think solely of the movie, although I found this difficult to do. Instead concentrate on how wonderfully Harris fits all his pieces together to form a puzzle that is more than a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'll start off by saying that I've read all three books in the Hannibal Lecter series (\\"Red Dragon\\", \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", and \\"Hannibal\\"). Characters in Lambs appear in Hannibal - and some are quite significant. Clarice Starling is still the main protagonist for most of it, and I was a bit disappointed that the agent in the first book, Will Graham, didn't come back for closure. I really came to like him in Dragon.Of the three I definitely have to pick \\"Hannibal\\" as the best. I felt that the first book asked me to sympathize with the murderer way too much, and the second didn't ask me to sympathize with him at all. The third, with its established character, Lecter, seems the best mix of the two. It reveals his past, pieces of his mind, and his desires without specifically asking me to feel anything. His character doesn't want for understanding. His character just is. I'm not expected nor forced to react a certain way to his crimes or his personality.I haven't seen the movie version of Hannibal yet - but I probably will before long. I've seen the other two movies - and I liked Lambs better. The Red Dragon movie was a bit disappointing compared to the book. Actually, I've heard that they changed the ending of Hannibal for the movie - and that is a big let down since my favorite part of Hannibal is the end!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The good Doctor returns for an encore, and Harris actually has us rooting for him, if only because Hannibal is being stalked by a greater monster.Hannibal Lechter is one of the two most memorable villains to come out of contemporary American literature - the other being James Ellroy's Dudley Smith. Until \\"Hannibal\\", Dr. Lechter, like Dudley Smith and Dracula, spent most of his time off stage. This is not the case in this book, but Hannibal's mystique remains intact.Harris has served up a most delicious main course his time. Please pass the guava beans and chianti."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This story is fast-paced, interesting, and scary. It takes you on a trip, where you find Hannibal living the finer life, solidifying his brilliance as both a killer and an intellectual. It takes you back to the character that is Clarice Starling -- forever righteous and dedicated federal servant. It introduces Hannibal's enemies, all avaricious characters lacking in dignity and loyalty, who ultimately deserve his wrath. Hannibal is the hero of this story. You'll find yourself cheering for the darkside."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must admit that I had never read Silence of the Lambs. I had seen the movie, and had not taken the effort to go out and get a copy of the book. I was browsing the bookstore one day, and saw a hardcover edition of Hannibal. I picked it up and flipped through a little. This novel grabbed me from the first. I had to make myself stop looking at pages as not to ruin the story when I would read it. I bought both Silence of the Lambs (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and Hannibal that same day.This book picks up where we were left Dr Hannibal Lecter and Agent Starling. I was quite surprised by the direction of the book and the choices the characters made at times, but afterwards, when I would read a little further on, I would catch myself saying, \\"Okay, I can see how that would happen.\\".Overall, I must say a very good read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I love Harris' work -- all of it. But do him a favor DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. &quot;Red Dragon/Manhunter&quot;, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; were classics -- both book and movie. The 1st 1/2 of Hannibal was looking good with plot twists and characters galore. At some point, I think Harris either sold out or got bored.In his effort to explain the tragedy of Hannibal Lector, Harris tried to make him a hero whilst still carrying fatal and unredeemable flaws. It doesn't work. I wanted to throw the book across the room when I finished.Please Thom, explain to us what you did here.-Mike"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Human behavior is often very ugly and Mr. Harris honestly exposes the dark side of humanity. I love the way he works in Lecter's appreciation of the Arts and Food. The ending was very shocking and clever."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"At the risk of inciting even more feeding frenzy over this too well digested topic, I am submitting this 2,563rd review for the delectation of whoever is bored or obsessed enough to read their way through this much hyperbole. Well, that or the number of reviews will eventually qualify &quot;Hannibal&quot; for The Guinness Book of World Records as &quot;Most Customer Reviews for a Single Novel on a Website.&quot;Snide lead-ins aside, I must congratulate Thomas Harris for being the only author besides Stephen King to succeed in making me peek out from between my fingers long enough to hold a horror novel much less read it. As I rule, I avoid this genre as adeptly as Hannibal's Barney escapes being bumped off while those around him kill or are being killed.I particularly enjoyed the one scene in this book that puts a wickedly punnish, Oliver Twist spin on how best to avenge oneself on anyone who has been 'eating' at one's nerves for years on end. Definitely worth toasting with a glass of Veuve Clicquot in various re-readings, as I imagined an ex-husband and several former boyfriends substituting for the actual victim in the novel. And I made do with Veuve Clicquot only because I can't afford any of the preferred appellations Hannibal imbibes.I also speculated about the inspiration for Mason Verger though Harris provided all the usual disclaimers about this being a work of fiction. If you think of the first letter of Mason's name as being the first letter of the real-life person's first name and the additional four letters as being being the last four letters of the last name...Well, there was that and the fixation on kids, the wealth, bizzare appearance, breathy voice, the one hand, peculiar pets and so on.My favorite parts of this book took place in Italy. Hannibal's a monster, but he's an exquisitely tasteful beast in every sense of that.Only one thing bothered me about this. I always thought of Clarice as being Hannibal's salvation. So, unless Harris plays the cheap trick of having Clarice jolt up in bed at the beginning of the next novel, shuddering in recollection of the nightmare she just had, I see no way for him to salvage her for a third round. But given Harris's talent for compelling even squeamish me to venture into a monster's mind palace and linger, I have no doubt he'll come up with something else too delicious for this comely bird to fall prey to."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must admit that I couldn't wait to be hypnotized and surprised by Dr. Lectors antics. I was fascinated to read more about Dr. Lector. On the other hand,I felt that the author in giving the reason for his cannibalistic actions left me less reason to be terrified and amazed by this evil creature. I don't think a part of me wanted to really side with him as much as I did. The finale annoyed me. It didn't seem true to the Clarice Starling character. I loved her strength and belief in justice and right in the Silence of the Lambs. She loses some of her illusions and her icons fall here. I couldn't believe that she would change so much in the face of the events that she would become a pretty 'dollface'. I couldn't put this book down even though I was occasionally annoyed and can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book after having considered The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs as two of my favorites. This book was poorly written, including many things more for shock value than for plot value. The characters were poorly developed, with Clarise and Hannibal going in directions that their basic character make-up would never allow. The work changed tenses and styles. One wonders if this wasn't taken out of Mr. Harris's hands and put together by an editorial commitee...that lacked talent."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story itself felt like a poorly-stitched quilt. Every story segment seemed to be a setup for a set piece grossout scene. This was a story virtually devoid of the psychological tension done so well in Silence of the Lambs, that went, unerringly, for the easiest of targets: the Grossout, as Stephen King calls it.Starling has turned out to be a big, whining crybaby, and the outcome of her and Lector's relationship has got to be the hands-down award winner for Biggest Waste of Good Characters.I finished it because I always like to finish what I started, unlike Harris. I have no way of knowing, but this book felt to me like someone with a bad case of writer's block just blowing out words onto the page and then selling them for zillions of dollars.If I were you, I'd avoid this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not so sure about this one. It was an okay read, but as a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs? Harris could've done better. I too agree that what happened with the Starling character was totally unlike the strong individual Harris created in Lambs. Based on the kind of person she was in the first book, she would've never let that happen. Sure, she and Hannibal respected eachother and everything, but she still knew he was a monster! And the fact that Harris gave some insight into why Hannibal was the way he was kinda didn't work with me. Don't you think it was much scarier to not know what drove him to be so brutal? This book is almost asking you to forgive him and think he's a better person. I think the only reason I didn't like this book too much was because it didn't end the way I wanted it to. Everybody has plans about what they want to happen to the characters before they read HANNIBAL, and if their expectations were like mine, it will not turn out the way you want it to. The movie is not going to work for me if Julianne Moore is playing Starling. Maybe there will be hope for it since Anthony Hopkins is coming back."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am not sure what happened to Thomas Harris in this one. The man has proven his writing talent in the past with 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Red Dragon'. He stripped Clarice of all we loved about this character. If you want to read the book, borrow one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Those who loved Clairce Starling will be disappointed that she has the same types (nothing new) of flashbacks and thought patterns. Those who were breathless at the back and forth slickness of Hannibal and Starling may become angered that Hannibal now triumphs with the greatest of ease, to become the ultimate winner. The book was written as though the author simply became tired of his heroes, so created even greater monsters but tied their stories to the more clever characters, and then threw in a plot which is wholly unbelievable. It's more like &quot;horror surfing&quot; and far less sublime than any of his previous writing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was great -- up until the last 15 pages.I just finished reading Hannibal yesterday. 90% of the book was great - very exciting, and very well written. Unfortunately, the ending left much to be desired. After reading the book, I definately plan to skip the movie when it comes out, if it ever comes out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mr. Harris excelled in his first two stories of Hannibal Lecter (&quot;Red Dragon&quot;, &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot;). This latest installment is a horrific disappointment.When the book debuted in hardcover, much was made about some of the dark turns in this novel. Much of it I brushed off as critics overblowing a couple of small passages - especially since many of the same reviews praised it as being a terrific read. I did, however, wait until &quot;Hannibal&quot; hit paperback before I decided to read it. By then, there had been the mini-controversy over Jodie Foster refusing to star in the movie adaptation, and some other continued &quot;warnings&quot; of this book's dark plot. I am thoroughly convinced now that I should have paid more heed to the warning signals.There is the old expression that a book was so good, you couldn't put it down. Well, in the case of this book, it was so bad I couldn't wait to put it down. The entire book seemed geared to be less of a taut psychological thriller and more of a 500 page &quot;contest&quot; to see which character is the most perverted, demented, sickening, and twisted. The &quot;conversion&quot; of Clarice Starling from protagonist to willing accomplice seemed to be overly contrived and a lame path for Mr. Harris to take in the continuing saga of Starling and Lecter. The story and plot was so weighed down with the perverse and sick - that seemed to only escalate as the pages rolled on - that it moved at a snail's pace.By the story's merciful end, I was severely disappointed and disgusted. I know that the theme of my review makes me out to sound like a prude of sorts, but I have read my fair share of disturbing/scary books, both fiction and nonfiction, of this genre. It wasn't the theme that turned me off as much as it was that it was so over-the-top as to be an unwelcome turn-off. Moreover, my disappointment lies in the fact that Mr. Harris is obviously capable of finer, more frightening, and more satisfying work - as evidenced by &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot;.Personally, I hope that Mr. Harris ends his saga of Lecter here. To take it any further would be an even bigger waste of time, as he has done enough damage with &quot;Hannibal&quot; to render it unsalvagable. People who haven't already paid their money to make this a (unfortunate) bestseller should heed this warning: look elsewhere for a good read for your dollar...it's not to be found here. To echo the sentiment of a previous reviewer, kudos to Jodie Foster for passing on the movie adaptation. I wish I would have known then (when she passed) what I know now. I wouldn't have squandered my money on this distasteful clunker."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How I wanted to like this book. As a Harris fan from Red Dragon days, I hoped for a thrilling, thoughtful, tightly written narrative, starring the fascinating and pitiless Dr. Lecter. Sadly, we have a rather dull exploration of &quot;taste&quot; and madness. The ending, moreover, is simply an outrage. It subverts the stern morality which pervaded Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs; this consciousness of right and wrong allowed the reader to accept the horrific violence of Harris' novels. Without this moral center, Hannibal made this reader feel like an accomplice in pointless gore."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Delicious page turner! I found this book hard to put down. Dr. Lector is still a charming, intelligent, evil psychopath and he's been missed. It's nice to see the continuity from 'Silence' to 'Hannibal' flow so cleanly. Anyone who is looking for another 'Silence' should not read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am not going to harp on the ending which I still do not understand. I think it goes against what I thought Starling was about but maybe we'll find out more in the 4th one. You figure there has to be a 4th. Maybe with Will Graham coming back. Does anyone else find it strange that Harris did not bring him back from Red Dragon? I keep thinking he has grand plans for the future books."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Apart from the typos and other errors not caught during editing, this book is amazing. Forget any nice, clean, predictable story formats. The entire story and most of the characters are borderline if not completely absurd. The typical &quot;good&quot; characters end up being meaningless while the truly evil end up with the most style and taste. The end, while completely unpredictable is entirely believable. Well worth reading! If someone does make a movie out of this book I definitely hope they don't spoil it with fake feel-good packaging."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is the disappointing sequel to its chilling predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs. Clarice Starling, who was charming and vulnerable in the first book, has evolved into a pistol-packin' FBI agent. Dr. Hannibal Lecter, whose psychological acumen seemed able to pierce anyone's armor, has become a globe-trotting cannibal on the loose. The story line is improbable, minor characters are flat, and the book lacks the intrigue and horror of the previous volume. Further, the quality of Harris' writing seems forced. Present tense and sentence fragments are liberally employed to create suspense and an aura of impending doom. This is a difficult technique to maintain, however, and it falls short of the mark in this case. Being an impatient type, this reviewer purchased the book in hardcover. Don't. Hold out for the paperback or simply wait for the inevitable movie"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The dramatic turn of event of this story as it unfolds is quite mesmerizing and exciting. As my business takes me on extensive road trips I find that listening to audio books is more stimulating than music. While I've experienced a number of audio books that made my travels quite pleasant, I've never been so consumed that I accually dreaded reaching my destination before the end of the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A cacophony of evil, Thomas Harris has taken Dr. Lector over the top in the much-waited sequel to Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal.It is difficult to perceive how someone who can peer so deeply into the darkness of the human heart can even live with himself after creating such a cast of monstrous proportions. While Lector himself serves as the centerpiece of this brilliantly crafted work, his nemesis-in-revenge in the persona of Mason Verger through his scheming minions plots a delicious and horrendous revenge for Lector's previous psychological and physical atrocities with him.Clarice Starling, FBI behavioral sleuth and the Doctor's personal toy returns as a Machiavellian surf and turf, friend and foe.Festooned on the landscape from DC to Florence, Italy Hannibal conquers in historical craftsmanship and literary complexity and originality. Silence of the Lambs quite simply pales in comparison. This is worth the eight-year wait.Be sure to acquire the book-tape as well as the hardcover. Harris' own read, though abridged, adds another dimension to this cauldron of fear."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Michigan says Harris doesn't know when to use past and present tense? He is one of the few writers I have read who knows exactly how and when to use the tenses. For those who think Clarice's character is not in line with reality, read Kestler's FBI or any of the Jack Douglas books. Many agents tread a very fine line and more than one crosses over. A great story. Every word is a jewel. Clarissa's eyes are like cheap birthstones, says Lecter. Fabulous metaphor. Well deserves its place as number one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Of the 3 Hannibal Lecter books, this is one is by far the most bizarre. Part of the charm of reading about Hannibal was the fact that we knew so little about him. In Hannibal, Harris attempts to give some reasoning for Lecter's crimes. In doing so, he creates an ending that is completely out of character for both Clarice and Hannibal. The mutual respect that is discussed in Silence of the Lambs is twisted, and in my opinion, ruined in this sequel.The other characters that Harris throws into this novel are interesting, but they tended to overshadow Hannibal.All in all, Hannibal was a good read until the resolution of the story began. At that point, I began wondering if he was going to end with the cliche &quot;it was all a dream.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading most of the book. I liked learning more about Lecter's early life and what made him the monster he is today. The ending was a disappointment. I do feel like I was jerked around by the book after reading how it ends. I almost felt like Barney: sold-out when things were going great but when things got difficult, decided he didn't want to see anymore or know anymore. That's how the ending made me feel. I regret reading the book and I nearly threw it out after I finished. The four stars I gave it are for the first 434 of it's 484 pages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I immediately dropped what I was reading as soon as I got this book, which I was eagerly waiting for. At the beginning it had my fullest attention, but after that I don't know what happened. The descriptions of Florence and fine food is nice, but not an entire book of it! Another reader commented that these are Harris' characters and can choose to do whatever he likes with them, but they are also the readers'as well. I feel that if I bought the book because of the characters, then I have a right to state my like or dislike. Starling was something else as well. At times she was the most clever FBI agent, just to end as what? Hannibal's sole mate?? I was shocked at how the book ended. I dragged through the last pages and was glad to finish it. Sorry, but if this book is made into a movie, wild horses couldn't drag me to see it. Hopkins/Jodie playing these roles? NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.P.S. Stephen King is one of my favorites, and now I believe that authors due stick together through THICK and THIN"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is one of the most over-rated books I have ever read.

What happened to theme consistency, deep characterization, and logical resolution. Mr Harris, get another job!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read this book through and through without ever feeling the need to say &quot;Why so much cruelty?&quot;. I felt that the cruelty and horror of this book was somewhat needed because it just wouldn't have worked without it. I think that Thomas Harris just made the logical step after Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. The story is well built. Thanks to the short chapters there is no straining, but always a sort of &quot;edge of the seat&quot; eagerness to turn to the next page to see what's going to happen.I am eager to see how they will do the movie on that."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'd say not to waste your time, however, the ending is soooo bizarre, you should read it to know what I mean. Harris did an incredible job in creating a monster so equally as terrifying as Hannibal, you honestly can't decide which villian is more deserving of death. 3/4 of the book was gripping, but, the Hannibal/Clarice Starling conclusion left me...well, feeling cheated."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm shocked! Coming from one of the best books I have ever read (Silence of the Lambs) to one of the worst. This story was totally disjointed, with no real excitement or intensity. That ending fell apart completely. I will hope that I dont have to revisit this farce being advertised as the sequel on the big screen. You failed us Mr. Harris!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was with great anticipation that I read the newest Hannibal Lector book. I've been a fan of the series since Red Dragon...I swear to you that I thought I was reading an Executioner book towards the end. I half expected Agent Starling to come racing into the scene with a Harley Davidson and an M-16. I can't even explain some of the premises of this dime store pulp. Awful. An insulting joke."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While the first two books in this series were absorbing crime dramas with elements that were horrific. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a contirved attempt to write a horror story that just didn't work. The whole section in Forlence was cliche. Character treatment was lame. Lecter wouldn't have noticed the big grey van in the parking lot? Starling was so weak willed as to sucumb to Lecter's mind games? Jack Crawford would just wither up because of his wife's death? I think NOT! I suppose if you hadn't read the previous two books it would have helped, but really &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; are far better novels on many levels. After much anticipation &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a real let down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Absolutely spellbinding. I couldn't put it down. Harris has created a scary but facinating character. The ending is mind-blowing. It will take a Sherlock Holmes to get this bad boy because the 'dark knight' now has his Robin! I can't wait for the next Dr. &amp; Madame Lecter from Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First, let me just say that up until Lecter gets medieval on Pacci (literally), the *Hannibal* definitely has its moments. But even those first 200 pages have many, many flaws. For one thing, the whole man-eating pig thing strains credulity. One of the wonderful things about *Silence of the Lambs* was that you could almost imagine the events happening--and it terrified you. Not so with *Hannibal*. The plot is farfetched, and ludicrous, and each chapter is bogged down by cumbersome geographical descriptions and much-abused grammar.As for character development--Harris reduces Starling to a foreword and afterthought. She isn't even a fully realized human being, so weak willed, apparently, that she easily relinquishes her deeply ingrained sense of right and wrong. One of the things I loved most about Starling of the *Lambs* was the conviction that, no matter what happened, she would do the right thing. It made for an interesting contrast with Lecter.And speaking of Lecter, Harris, not satisfied with destroying one strong character, turns Lecter from a criminal mastermind to a cheap fettishist. The Lecter of the *Lambs*, you could almost admire, despite his cruelty, because you knew that he was a being unlike any other, free of the laws and mores that bind the rest of us. And you felt that, despite his contempt for her &quot;cheap shoes,&quot; he really admired Starling. Not so here. This Lecter is trite, arbitrary, and visceral, controlled by habit and a pathetically contrived childhood trauma. And the way he treats Starling...well the less said about that the better.Unless your thing is gore for gore's sake, ignore this book, pretend it never happened. I certainly will."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A lame satire when you least expected it, this large and horrific lump of processed trees leaves me feeling as if Thomas Harris is entirely bored by the whole thing and typed this mess together very swiftly. Now, a satire-sequel could have been interesting and unexpected. But this satire lacks respect for the characters, it reeks of the ho hums. And the end, well, hmpf. Mink thinks Thomas Harris is far better than this and he should be ashamed of himself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book intends to be a sequel to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, and it does continue the same character names, and in the text refers back often to these predecessors. However, the continuity is purely formal: the characters of all persons and even institutions, are completely different from the earlier ones of the same name. And the style, technique, and approach of writing are also startlingly altered.To begin, the protagonist Lector is no longer the sadist that we knew and hated. He has transmuted to a sort of superman, dealing out rough justice to evil enemies. His historical learning and esthetic appreciation win him a coveted position over the competition of Italian scholars. His physical prowess enables him, with no assistance, to hang the corrupt chief of police of Florence from the balcony of his palace. And escape, of course.Lector's place in our disaffection is taken by one of his two surviving victims, Mason, a one-eyed, partial-faced monstrosity living on a respirator, and devoting his life, such as it is, to the capture and painful extinction of Lector. Kremler, of the Justice Department, promoted from his role of ambitious bureaucrat of Silence, now is second-villain, a cold, mercenary collaborator with Mason.Clarice begins as a devoted FBI agent, but quickly runs afoul of the bureaucracy, and with her career in ruins, loses faith, and with some psychiatric help (from Lector himself!) frees herself from the sense of purpose, integrity, and discipline that she had learned from her parents. She ends as an amoral hedonist, living a felonious existence.The FBI itself is no longer recognizable. The dedicated agents and technicians of the earlier books have disappeared (her two closest colleagues and role models both die in Hannibal), and the Bureau is a faceless bureaucracy with no loyalty to its employees, ready to sacrifice any of them for minor public relations gain. This new Bureau is unable to arouse itself to its proper function, even when the Most Wanted is under its nose.Any thriller requires of the reader some forbearance of the reader at certain weaknesses in the plotting. In the earlier books, weak spots were carefully concealed and attention was directed from them by good writing and interesting characters. Hannibal is more in the tradition of the James Bond series, with no attempt at credibility. One can conclude only that Harris, in the third book, lost interest in his characters and his former style. He apparently forgets that the new style requires a sympathetic protagonist, and he now has none."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"By itself, this novel is perfectly enjoyable and engrossing. However, it cannot compare to its predecessor, _The Silence of the Lambs_. Harris has spoiled the combination of traits that made _Silence_ so successful by blowing up each element to grotesque proportions:Lecter's erudition has been elevated onto the level of an Umberto Eco protagonist, combined with the refined and expensive tastes that make Carl Djerassi's heroes so annoying. The childhood traumas that shape many of the protagonists have increased to a level that would make Andrew Vachss shudder. The subtle, but constant power and gender struggles that Starling has to fight in _Silence_ have been replaced by an all-out, Rambo-style &quot;One person against a corrupt system&quot; war, and the latent erotic tension between Starling and Lecter in _Silence_ turn into a bodice-ripper in _Hannibal_ (Mad Scientist Ravishes Beautiful FBI Agent! Film at 11!).Now all of these styles (and I'm sorry if this sounded like a shopping list) of course work perfectly fine by themselves, but the way Harris combined them in _Hannibal_ simply doesn't work that well for me. Still a fun read, but not a classic."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews! Everyone likes different things, and I most certainly liked this novel and found it a quite worthy ending to the Hannibal Lecter Saga. I rather liked the ending (which I won't give away), and did not find it out of character for either Clarice or Lecter. For the reviewer who claimed this novel explained Lecter, let me tell you, it did anything but! Maybe revealed some of his past, yes, and helped you understand his motivations, Hannibal is still not &quot;explained&quot;.Clarice is in a different place in her life then when we left her in Silence of the Lambs. Her promising career is left in shambles, (I've leave it to you to read the book and discover why) and she's got more years to her credit, now, and I think where she is at the end of the book is quite understandable, and where I always hoped she'd be. :) Hannibal knew, from the first moment he met her, that she was like him.Not an uplifting read, (and, of course, not for the squeamish) but most certainly well worth the time. You thought The Silence of the Lambs was dark? SotL looks pink and fluffy next to Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not only did I read and love Silence of the Lambs but after Isaw the movie I vowed never to see it again because it frightened meso. Needless to say, I too, waited in anticipation for the sequel and was more than disappointed. The book started out catchy and kept my interest for a while. Then it was a little hard to follow when the plot switched to Italy, but that turned out to be okay. Even the &quot;brain-eating&quot; storyline in the ending lived up to my Lecter expectations. But about the very end with Hannabal and Clarrice &quot;hooking up&quot;....all I can say is, &quot;Mr. Harris, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?&quot;. Therefore, my recommendation is~ do not waste your money on this like I did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After having read Harris' other novels years ago, I was more curious rather than exspecting anything in particular to happen. The novel starts in a predictable but fun-to-read way. Up until the end of the Florence-part my opinion was: so what? I could have told you that was gonna happen!- nevertheless, it WAS enjoyable reading! When I then noticed that the book was only about half-finished, I began to get more curious. I then was surprised by the sudden turn the plot was taking, and the suspense held up right up to the last page. It took me four days to read the first half of the novel, and I read the second half in one afternoon: I JUST COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN! (I was running to the bathroom like when watching a movie in the cinema!) However, the ending is strange: some of the bad guys get what they deserve, but some of the bad ones get away with it, and some of the good ones pay for it...... not a black and white ending!I ENJOYED READING THAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just a few years ago I read Silence of the Lambs and enjoyed it very much. I think of it as a masterpiece. So of course when I heard about the sequel I was very excited, and bought it as soon as I could. Overall I enjoyed the book the very much. All up to the last few chapters that is. I think anyone will agree with me that the ending is a disappointment and weird. You have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this book to be worthy of equal acclaim as its predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs. I was riveted by the book from cover to cover. The manner in which Harris formulates the characters before introducing them into the plot was not only equally entertaining as the actions of the characters, but allowed me to have a deeper view of the characters and the motivations for their actions. Many people told me that the book was rather trite, but the suspense had me wondering what would happen next from minute to minute. Though Hannibal Lecter is to be feared, I think that it is an odd, but fascinating twist to have the serial killer appear to be somewhat of a hero. Whether it was Harris' intention or not I was definitely rooting for Hannibal midway through the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With Hannibal, Thomas Harris has given us a great comic novel that is \\"beyond good and evil.\\" In this highly entertaining novel, Mr. Harris demonstrates the ability to say terrible things and present horrific images with a verbal delivery so \\"deadpan\\" and swift (in its economy) that for the reader it is like being raped before we realize any of our buttons have been undone. The author's \\"neutral\\" stance on inter-species and human cannibalism, for example, can only be seen as a great comic vision that \\"this too does not really matter.\\"****** SPOILER AlertHarris, the ironist, identifies God as the master sadistic ironist whose games of human cruelty pale into insignificance Hannibal's \\"own modest predations.\\" This realization comes to Dr. Lecter as a six year old, after seeing the baby teeth of his cannibalized sister, Mischa, in the \\"reeking stool pit\\" of her anonymous predators (end of Chapter 48).The final \\"dining scene,\\" so finely wrought with its elegance and sophistication, once again is best understood as comic ---- given the incongruity of the highest \\"cuisine aesthetic\\" juxtaposed with the gentle feeding on a living human brain.Dr. Lecter's ruthless and powerful seduction of \\"goodness\\" (Starling) is greatly aided by the ever-presented documentation that the universe is unbelievably cruel, arbitrary, or at least profoundly indifferent and uncaring. That the highly educated and brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, knows this (as does the author) is his only redemption. This terrible knowledge, it must be said, would not be redemptive if it were not so very true. The refined feast of evil presented to us in such an orderly and dispassionate fashion in this great novel is the comic cover for the dark, limitless, and terrifying process of entropy that we as readers are allowed to apprehend only from a distance. Our comprehension from the comic/aesthetic distance of Thomas Harris's vision is necessary (the distance I mean) for us to maintain our sanity and yet grasp some of the true horror of human existence, and still be entertained. I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a modern-day masterpiece which can only deserve a treasured place on the shelf amongst the great authors, Dante and Shakespeare. After reading both Red Dragon and the Silence of the Lambs (Harris' previous novels that focussed around Dr Hannibal Lecter) I waited with great anticipation for this seqeul and was not at all dissapointed. The novel rotates around the infamous doctor and I think is an improvevment on the other two previous novels as more attention is paid to Lecter. I could not put this book down once I had begun to read it and I'm sure you will be the same. Dispite the controvesy caused by the ending, it was a marvellous suprise and Hannibal will hold a place in my life forever. A true psychological work of genius that you will never forget. Greatly recommended!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is quite different from the movie, and although the movie is dark the book is even more dark. With the third installment of this series, Harris yet again manages to throw us another great story involving Lector and Clarice. The last quarter of the book was a wicked adventure into the mind of Lecter and Clarice that makes everything you thought before about these two characters questionable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really wanted to like &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I had read many negative customer reviews before reading the book, but then I seem to be in the minority who likes &quot;Red Dragon&quot; more than &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Different strokes, and all that. This time, the naysayers are right. True, &quot;Hannibal&quot; starts fast, features an intriguing, if over-the-top new villain, and gets us up to speed on Starling quickly. Her character still rings true, and she's very well written. Starling's battles with Paul Krendler move well, too, and this was a pleasant surprise to me. Too bad the ending's not only unbelievable, but just plain silly. I can only guess at what kind of Hannibal-and-Clarice redux will appear, and wonder how we'll keep a straight face (sic) while reading it. Will Ardelia Mapp track Clarice down? See her face in the background photo on a travel brochure, and take up the quest? And how about Barney? It must be easy to get cheap steroids in Rio, etc. I understand that life doesn't offer many tidy endings, and I don't appreciate simplistic writing. But I'm afraid that Thomas Harris really let me down this time. That's a shame, because the guy shows he's still got it in many parts of &quot;Hannibal.&quot; But the payoff just doesn't make it. Seriously, if anyone would like to discuss this with me, I'd like to consider your differing points of view. I'd like to be wrong, and I really want to like &quot;Hannibal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved the book all the way. Admittingly i had to read quickly through some of the book to avoid getting sick, but the ending was something i was secretly rooting for all the way. Hannibal and Starling are like the Mulder and Skully, a mismatch of male and female that seem to be on opposite poles but ultimately get together. In Starling's all consuming chase for the killer, she fell in love with him. Also, note that Jodie Foster passed on the role for her own personal reasons...not because the ending &quot;upset&quot; her. This is the actress who starred in Anna and the King for heavens sake."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A step down from the two previous books, &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. The two previous books helped us get into the minds of &quot;serial killers&quot;, something which facinates most of us. Dr. Lecter, in thoes books was our guide, he helped explain how they function. His sadistic murders were a sidelight to the main issue, &quot;serial killers&quot;, which is what we all came to read about. Arguably, Dr. Lecter is not your typical &quot;serial killer&quot;. This book explores Hannibal the man. We now know that what happened to his sister is perhaps what ignited his cannibalism. The book is NOT about &quot;serial killers&quot;, a disappointment.I used the title &quot;...the best of ....the worst of...&quot; because I notice a big difference between pre and post-word processor authors. Pre-word processor writers seemed to develop their novels more. For instance, he could have developed the initial discovery of Dr. Lecter better. He could of done that in a chapter or two. Instead it suddenly dawns on a discraced Italian detective that he has just met Dr. Lecter. That and other parts lacked development.I agree with other reviewers that the book was great up to the mid 400 pages, then it takes a dive. The ending is less than believalble and not very palitable (no pun intended). I can understand why Jody Foster chose not to be associated with Hannible the Romantic. The book sets up another book and movie. I think Harris should accept some editorial help, from which he is usually immune, if he want to make the next book and movie a success."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Perhaps what I enjoy most about Harris' books is his elegant use of language. His choice of words paints a lush, beautifully realized landscape. And it is this use of language that makes Hannibal Lecter such an appalling monster. He doesn't fit any of our presuppositions of what an evil person should be: he's educated, polite, cultured and refined. The reader is constanlty challenged because in the face of overwhelming evil, a small corner of the mind is always hoping he will escape justice.Ultimately, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a look at the dark side of human nature. While no sane person would ever commit the acts Hannibal does, his motives aren't mysterious. It's not impossible to imagine a person you know succumbing to the predator buried in their genetic make-up.This is not an easy book to read. Aside from the gore, parts of it are profoundly disturbing. But it is a smart, haunting thriller, and anyone who approaches it with an open mind will surely enjoy it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While moviegoers will undoubtedly flock to see Hannibal in theatres when it's released this February, I'll lack the enthusiasm that I might of had if I did not read this book. Thomas Harris starts off Hannibal with a gun-ho shoot-out scence that leads to an intriguing, yet somewhat unplausible downfall of Clarice Starling. Her actions spark a media frenzy, grabbing the attention of Hannibal Lechter, who now resides in Florence. The affiliation between Lechter and Starling blurs as the book procedes, their relationship grows even more blurry. It is never truly clear what Hannibal feels about Starling and vice-versa. I picked up this book and read Stephen King's synopsis. He called it one of the two top scariest modern books, along with The Exorcist. Well, Mr. King, I hate to break it to you, but this book is definitely not scary. In fact, it oftentimes borders on ridiculous. The ending is two-faced, while it does bring the book full-circle, it is a bit ridiculous and leaves the reader unfulfilled. A decent read, I recommend it for those who are curious about what happens."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In my opinion, Thomas Harris wrote the book on the Thriller Genre, literally, with &quot;Silence&quot; and it still stands as the book I hold all other thrillers up against. I was very disappointed to learn that there was a sequel, more disappointed to learn that the screenplay rights were sold for an obscene amount of money BEFORE the novel was even written, and was the most disappointed with the actual result.This book lacks all of the heart of Silence and even the Red Dragon; stories where the real terror was written into the dialogues between the characters whom you cared about and written in between the lines. The gory details acted as filler which supplemented the implicit terror and drove home the evilness of the acts of the killer(s). It was written in such a way that you almost grew to like the monster named Hannibal and really invested yourself in Agent Starling.This book came up short in the heart area and was overdone in the gory details. Agent Starling who????????? What a disappointing 180 turn in her character. They were two completely different characters, they just happened to share a name from one book to the other. The attempts to explain Hannibal Lecter's childhood traumas were very weak and took much away from the mystique of his character. Much of what makes up the horror/thriller genre is the unknown. Not knowing what made Lecter tick was part of that character's heart in &quot;Silence&quot;.But I must say in Harris' defense, that it is well-written overall, which makes it readable. And like many who read the thriller genre, my morbid curiosity compelled me to read scenes like Starling's dinner party (if you read it, you'll know the scene I'm referring to). it's not hard to see why Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins skipped the roles for the movie sequel. I might skip the movie sequel as well."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs tremendously and eagerly dove into Hannibal. I was very disappointed! I actually found the book offensive. Harris seemed determined to cram every variety of evil into this book. It felt as if the book was written to titillate a very perverse segment of the population. This seemed most evident in his depiction of the former child molestor turned child tormentor. I found this so distasteful that I refused to lend or donate the book and threw it away - a first for me! If you felt any connection or admiration for Starling you will be further insulted. I can not in any way recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a monumental let down. After the brilliant Silence of the Lambs, and Red Dragon, you give us this? Thanks. I think I'll pass on your next one. I bought this because I figured that it would be even better than those 2. I thought wrong. If I could give it no stars I would"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book &quot;Hannibal&quot; would have been more aptly named &quot;The Most Respectable and Genteel Cannibal&quot;. What disappointed me most is that the story contains NO heroes. But it's not merely the lack of a hero that makes this novel unique: the author makes it abundantly clear that HUMANITY can be divided into two categories: LAMBS and SWINE. The lambs are incorrigibly pathetic and helpless, and the swine are incorrigibly unholy and predatory. At the end of the novel, I found myself sympathic to no one (except the reader). Even the surviving victims of Hannibal were so corrupted by their lust for revenge (ie, emotionalism over intellect) that I could no longer sympathize with their victimization. I first placed my hopes in Clarice Starling, but it soon became obvious that while she was interested in pursuing Dr. Lecter, her concern was NOT with bringing him to justice. Hannibal's villainy is compared and contrasted with the villainy of those who seek revenge against him. But the other &quot;monsters&quot;' in the story are all &quot;babes in the woods&quot; compared to the suave, sophisticated and highly-cultured Hannibal... They hate Hannibal because he has tormented and mutilated them...but they cannot gather their wits sufficiently to satisfy their emotional need for justice against him. The author Thomas Harris loudly proclaims Hannibal to be &quot;Il Mostro Supremo&quot; by gracing Hannibal with THREE advantages: SUPREME intelligence and intuition, the ability to CULTIVATE SYMPATHY from those who should know better, and sheer &quot;good LUCK&quot; when the first two fail. In other words, the author Harris tries to make us sympathize and even &quot;admire&quot; the character of &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot;... After all, Hannibal only eats &quot;rude&quot; people. Which makes me wonder: would we sympathize, admire and respect Jeffery Dahmer... IF he had played the harpsichord, eaten white truffles, and evaded captivity by outsmarting authorities? (Perhaps Hannibal is the ultimate POLITICIAN). It boggles my mind that an author could spend and entire DECADE thinking and writing about these characters... emersed within their possibilities...During the time he wrote Hannibal, WHAT was Harris thinking...? When Harris dedicated Part 3 &quot;To the New World...&quot;' what is it that he's trying to suggest about the future of the New Age? &quot;The Serpent devouring Humanity&quot; is an appropriate cover for this novel. It wouldn't surprise me at all if the devil himself knocked on Mr. Harris' door and handed him the completed manuscript for &quot;Hannibal&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you have not read this novel, I would suggest not reading all the reviews. I did that, and lost out on quite a few surprises that make this such a fun read! Okay, it's basically a book about strange people (and not who you think -- Hannibal, the titular cannibal, is a strange bird but everyone here is bizarre to say the least). What was missing? Any connection to RED DRAGON is not in here...Will Graham? He caught Lechter the first time...why no mention in here? Mainly this is to be seen as a sequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. As you all know by now, Jody Foster hated what happens to Starling in this novel...so much so that she refused to do the movie(even though Anthony Hopkins will be back). It's an interesting, fun, fast, scary read! Do you want more? I think Harris did a good job of wrapping up the story, but the ending is a little bit out there (be warned). But the ride is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely! Thomas Harris leads us &quot;tastefully&quot; and gently through the book to the last page. The interplay between the characters is done well, although in-depth descriptions are a bit sketchy on a few characters. Suffice to say Hannibal and Clarice get their &quot;just desserts&quot; (pun intended!) in the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed the way the book began in it's departure from the 1st two books. But after the introduction of the &quot;Pazzi&quot; I was finding myself a little bored and wondered were Starling was. The ending to the &quot;Italy segment&quot; was anticlimatic. Starling's intense investigation into Hannibals &quot;Tastes&quot; was good, but it makes you wonder shouldn't that have been done all the years he was missing.I can only say one thing about the ending&quot; AWFUL&quot;. What was Harris thinking?If you find yourself wanting to put it down, go ahead, you will only be wasting more time!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited eagerly for this sequel to come out and am so disappointed. The writing style is difficult to get used to, and Harris jumps from past tense to present tense in his sentence structure. Where were the editors? Characters are boring and I don't even know if I want to finish reading this book. Was Harris in a hurry to meet the deadline? Were the editors afraid to make constructive comments? Did Harris have one martini too many while he was writing? I find myself analyzing Harris instead of Hannibal. This can't be the same person who wrote Silence of the Lambs. Like another reviewer I wonder if he is on a remote beach, counting his money, and laughing his head off while drinking a martini? Dang! I wanted this book to be better. The potential was there. Where were the editors?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really like Thoman Harris and like many of his dedicated readers, I awaited the release of this book with great anticipation. I actually stalked the local bookstore waiting for it to come in.I read the book with great anticipation, but when I got to the end I was horrified. The ending is a disaster. The actions of the characters are not in keeping with any rational conclusion.I would return it if I could."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hollywood take heed!!! &quot;Hannibal&quot; the movie will be a box office bust unless the screenplay deviates from the book's boring middle third (Florence travelogue) and an ending that defies 600 pages of character development."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I carried this book around with me for days reading whenever I had a chance. I was totally addicted up to chapter 102! The ending was really...for lack of a better word, wrong. It was like someone else wrote the ending without having read the book. I feel like I got to the top of a roller coaster then had to take the stairs down. A real let down. I LOVED the Mason and Margot Verger characters. They were very interesting. I also liked the way Harris gave each character equal parts, there was really no main character. He kept the book fast paced. I'm glad I read some of these on-line reviews right before I was finished so that I was prepared for the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was really looking forward to reading the sequel to &quot;Silence...&quot;, but I was very disappointed when I read it. The author seemed to have the thought &quot;Just how perverse and grotesque can I make this?&quot; While that is to be expected in this genre, I felt it was done merely to gross the reader out. I did not feel that it explored the characters nearly as well as &quot;Silence...&quot; did. I do not think that the Starling character in &quot;Silence...&quot; would have wound up with Lecter, as the poor, pitiful, weak Starling in the sequel. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After being thoroughly intrigued by his two previous novels, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this one. Harris's writing style resembles a novice: short, choppy sentences, two-sentence paragraphs, and excessive chapters (103 chapters for only 484 pages). The plot development was tedious at times, particularly the numerous pedantic references to Italian art and history, which were not explained to the lay reader. I did enjoy the characterization of Mason Verger (could he more evil than Dr. Lecter?) and the explanation of Lecter's childhood trauma. This novel was not written for readers, it was written for directors, complete with the ending. Let the cameras roll!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If anyone has taken a tour of Florence, they would appreciate Harris' cultural travelogue.This is a definite dark ride, a descent into Dante's Inferno with no Beatrice or Virgil as a guide. Perhaps the biggest circle of Hell is not lead by Dr. Hannibal Lecter, but Federal Burreaucrats lead by Willima Jefferson Clinton."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"*This review contains some spoilers*My first impression with this book (after only one reading) echoed many of the other responses below: I was unused to the new, rather cinematic angle which Mr Harris decided to take with this final novel in the &quot;Lecter Trilogy&quot;. His villains were more black-and-white stereotypes, his heroes curiously impotent in their social situations, and the killings and violence which made SOTL such a thrilling ride were altered in this book beyond recognition. It wass not at all what I expected, and after one reading I felt disappointed enough to throw the book away.Thankfully, I didn't. A week later, and I decided to try the gauntlet again - this time, with an open mind. Much of my initial distaste stemmed from the fact that I'd been expecting Harris to have remained unchanged and unaffected over the eleven year (or so) gap between this and SOTL. I had been hoping for more of the brilliant and gritty realism that was ubiquitous in Silence, and I had hoped to see Lecter as untouchable, distant, and aloof as he had been in his insane ward cell.All of which, all things considering, were unreasonable. Harris immediately lets you know that many years have passed since Clarice defeated Jame Gumb, and that in the interim, many things have changed. Crawford, Starling, Senator Ruth Martin, and (later) Hannibal Lecter himself have all developed and aged. Where the FBI was once a paragon of operational efficiency in Silence, here Harris details its slide into dogma and bureaucracy after seven years' passage. Where Clarice Starling's career seemed unstoppable, Harris brings you the story of an ambition unfulfilled.Nothing stays the same, and it is neither reasonable nor realistic to assume that Harris' style or his focus will remain likewise unchanged. Granted, he is writing about characters that have been earlier portrayed in certain fashions, but ultimately the characters are his to change, and if he chooses to do so the result should be viewed in as objective a light as possible.Secondly, I believe that his entire tone was different with this novel than with Silence. Where Silence seemed to be based on adrenaline, Hannibal's focus seems to be more one of drama, both negative and positive. Starling's career is in decline, tainted by her zeal and love for her job; Crawford's prediction of forced retirement (in Silence) is fast coming true; Paul Krendler's backbiting and infighting seems set to reign supreme. Senator Ruth Martin, defeated in the last election, is unable to offer the help that, in Silence at least, would have seemed omnipotent.Yet the other, and to me, more positive, major focus of the plot is *hugely* involving: Lecter himself. Where Red Dragon and Silence simply portrayed Lecter as a brilliant and aloof evil genius, here in Hannibal, Thomas Harris takes the potentially dangerous step of humanizing him - tantalizing glimpses are seen of Lecter's past, and reasons for his present psychological state are hinted at.Understandably, those readers who would prefer Lecter to remain forever an untouchable godlike being in their minds, will take umbrage at this change. However, the majority of readers would probably have to agree that a human villain (or even antihero), with his or her own faults and weaknesses, is far more engaging than some faceless, unstoppable, Batman-esque superhuman baddie. With this novel, Hannibal Lecter's genius is not diminished in the slightest, while his character, hitherto an enigma, is slowly made more accessible with the story of his making.Whilst the argument has been voiced of Harris devaluing his villains' characters, I believe that this cannot possibly apply to Lecter himself...and Lecter himself is the only villain worth bothering about. Verger and his cronies may well make for a standard stock of criminals, and their exploits may be standard novel gruesomeness, but the main focus is on Lecter himself (as the title leaves no doubt about). Yes, I initially found Verger's story and his friends' characters somewhat extreme and dramatic, but would I have felt that had I not read Silence beforehand? I think it is important to keep Hannibal and Silence separate - they are two different books with different stories and different styles. True, Hannibal's style may not appeal to the tastes of the longtime fans of Harris, but given time and consideration as a work in its own respect (and out of the shadow of Silence of the Lambs), you might find yourself holding a grudging admiration for it.I certainly did..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I too pulled an all nighter to make it through this page turner. Although I couldn't put it down, I found the writing style occasionally forced, and don't feel it is quite in the same league as SotL, the penultimate novel of this genre. As for the movie, Hollywood shouldn't bother. I would, however, like to see another book in the series, in the not too distant future please."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Even though I missed the intensity felt from both watching the unsuspecting victims of Jame in &quot;Silence of the...&quot; and Lechter's maneuverings, I still didn't put &quot;Hannibal&quot; down until I finished it. I liked the characterization of the tawdriness of today's FBI; the erudition of the european scenes; and Clarisse's professional disillusionment. Sure, it is a cliched ending, but there is still a revolting sickness to it all that seems to fit the novelist. To repeat, I didn't put it down..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I too waited years for this book, and found it to be a terrible let down.The vast majority of the book reads like a travel guide for Florence, and the Characters are very thinly painted.The terse prose of Red Dragon, is no where in sight, the more plot driven Silence of the Lambs style is also out the window, so we are left with a lurid and plodding trip round the world while Mason Verger, the new Villain, tries to out-Villain Lecter.The last 30 pages are some of the worst fiction I have read in a long time.It is just a BIG mess.Also is it only me,Did anyone else notice, but as someone who comes from Lithuania, I know the name &quot;Mischa&quot; (Lecter's sister in the book) is the diminutive form of Michael, NEVER a girl's name..That is &quot;Mascha&quot; a diminutive form of Maria...I laughed out loud...A small point, but tied into a another mess, his family was &quot;noblity&quot; and had an estate that was shelled in the war...Wait...Didn't anyone ever hear of Joe Stalin...The were NO estates and noble families left in the Prebaltik by the war as Stalin Purged them all in the late 1930's starting in 37'...(If they survived the Civil war in the 20's) If you want to go into detail about Florence, get it right about the Prebaltik as well...Don't bother...or just put the book down 30 pages before the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I expected a great read after Silence of the Lambs but I didn't get it.

What concerns me the most is that in previous efforts Harris made the FBI seem as a capable law enforcement agency. In Hannibal the FBI doesn't appear at all. The agency knows Hannibal is back in the U.S. but little is written about attempts to capture him. Further, the manipulation by bureacrats to ruin Starling's career is hamhanded and ludicrous. In short, there are so many plot flaws and holes in this story that it is unenjoyable. One minor peeve: Harris or his editor should know how to spell sizable (no e) and buses as applies to the vehicles, not busses as a kiss. I waited six years for this book. I hope Mr. Harris will use the next six years to return to the good form demonstrated in Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is not a bad thing though because it made the book unique. I can tell you right now if you are expecting a book similar to The Silence of the Lambs, you are in for a huge disappointment. If you are looking for an entertaining book though, you have come to the right place. Lots of people were mad at the ending of this book but I think that the ending made this book even better. Just because the ending was not what people wanted, it does not make it a bad ending.

Not for dull or unadventurous minds. DO NOT read this if you haven't read _Silence of the Lambs_..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I also eagerly awaited &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I greatly enjoyed &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; movie. However, &quot;Hannibal&quot; was my first Harris novel.Harris seems to be a master at psychological suspense.His characters are interesting.The cold blooded, devil, Dr. Hannibal Lecter as always is captivating. I found my self wanting more of the evil Mason Verger.The book kept me spellbound through out the beginning and the middle.Unfortunatley, then came the ending! What happended? It's as if the ending was written by a different author.Harris lost his sense of imagination, intrigue and creative writing. The ending was out of character, for both Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling &quot;the warrior.&quot;The end makes no sense and I'm left unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has sinned in the mind of many readers by delivering a sequel that is not a sequel. He has written a novel so unlike The Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon that many have felt cheated or betrayed. This is not the Clarice Starling or Jack Crawford of Silence. It is not the Lecter we glimpsed in Red Dragon or saw more completely as he slithered through Silence. It is not a satisfying novel; it is not a moral novel. It is disturbing, daring, challenging and in the final analysis, completely experimental. Harris plays with the reader's minds and emotions the way he attempts to play with the English language. The book is vivid and stark at the same time. And the noble experiment Harris plays with his use of language in the end is what decided me to drop a star and only give it 4 (still high praise when placed in context with the bulk of other readers' opinions).We probably learn too much about Hannibal Lecter here, and certainly see a side of Starling only hinted at in Silence. I think Harris plays his grammatical games, mixing tenses in the same sentence, to immerse the reader into Lecter's world where the present and the past are one. Each act committed, enjoyed or endured by by all of the characters in the novel (from Lecter and Starling through Mason Veder, Barney and even Pazzi in Florence) is a composite of past deeds coalescing with present circumstances to create a chaos called Now. Harris spends much time discussing Lecter's vast mental warehouse and his methods of accessing the past to live at the moment. There is no future. Only a mishmash of what has been mingling with what is.But I think in a sense Harris succeeds a little too much in creating this chaos. His writing here is far less powerful than in the past, even though there are moments of gut-wrenching impact nearing poetry. The final effect is a distraction. The reader must go back and read passages again to see what he is really saying. Maybe that was my mistake, but I think had Harris held back a little in his language manipulation he would have created a much more powerful novel.That said, I think Hannibal is worth four stars, which is to say worth reading. Many, in fact most will feel emptiness with the ending, but it works. This is not just another entry in a series (though I certainly hope we hear from these characters again). It is a daring, highly original work that perhaps tries a bit too hard to break new ground. Thomas Harris almost, but not quite, succeeds in this experiment. Not 100 percent, at least. But he's one of the few writers around with the shortbreads to try it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In Hannibal, Thomas Harris makes Lecter almost loveable. Those that gave it &quot;one star&quot; just don't get it. I found the ending fascinating and unpredictable. I hope TH hasn't put his typewriter, cigarettes and whiskey away yet...I don't know how long I can stand to wait for Book IV!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i thought that this book would have the theme that books that are sequels to the originals do not live to the hype this book proves it wrong i don't read much but i couldn't put this book down it was mesmorizing and i hope they make a movie out of it like the original the only thing i found lack was the ending but i will leave that to the reader to find out"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was great, until it ended, or should i say crashed. at least the doc has a new pal to savor. i'm hoping that he eats her liver with some pork and beans and an icy cold zima. we need to get this story back on track with some gratuitous evil so that will graham can come out of retirement (again) and save us all (again)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The exposition in Hannibal is a beautiful thing: from the isolated wealth and depravity of one of Lector's victims, to Florence, Italy, and flesh eating pigs, the novel abounds in the craft of description. More so here than in the other two novels, Harris also roots Dr. Lector's behavior, as Clarice describes it, in &quot;whimsy&quot; more than psychological disturbance, even though there is plenty of that, too. It's intended to be a funny book, and it is, as it also is horrific, gruesome to an extreme, as would be expected, and truly suspenseful almost throughout. The end? Without giving detail, it seems inconsistent with the rest. My guess is that Harris had a helluva fun time inventing this fiction, from exploring the settings to the inner workings of almost all of the characters. I had a helluva good time, too."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Anticipating and then reading Hannibal was like biting into a luscious, golden puff pastry and then finding it has been filled with Cool-Whip which has gone slightly past the expiration date. The scenes of Lecter in Florence, lurking in his digs like Mephistopheles, were well done, but the book slowly went downhill."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was not disappointed in this book. Hannibal really gets into your head...it's amazing just how you start pulling for the monster!!!! The ending was awesome!!! and unexpected...I liked it so much that I ordered the first in this series, Silence Of The Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ok, guys those of you that hated it stop already, let those of us who enjoyed it have a chance.I agree with very little of any of the negative reviews I've read on Amazon. It is action packed, moves very fast, it is hard to put down. I read it in one day, and found it very enjoyable, can't wait for the movie to come out.A suprise ending, for a suprising book. A great read for the summer when the lights are on or you are outside. Harris, did a great job of tieing in &quot;Silence&quot; as a summary and held my attention. You go boyfriend, you go and keep on writing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Because I have never read a Thomas Harris book before, I was not tempted to compere it to his others. Yes, I did see silence of the lambs, and did not expect to like it as much as I did, because I do not consider myself a horror fan. Hannibal, I could not put down. Thomas Harris's style of writing was intriguing. The reason the end is so unreal to many is thier fixed opinions of what should happen. Thomas Harris is to be admired for taking this step. After all what Starling is doing can be seen as effective rehabilitating of a criminal. That is, if she could just get him to stop eating people."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It seems almost as though parts of this book were written as a screen play, and it makes the flow choppy and puzzling at times. It is not Harris's best work. During the entire novel I was rooting for Dr. Lecter, which felt odd. The ending was a total disappointment, and hard to believe. I felt that most of the violence and gory situations were added for shock value only, and not because they played an integral part in the telling of the story, as in &quot;Silnce Of The Lambs&quot; (which may be the best book I've ever read!). I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to the average reader, as it leaves a bad taste in your mouth that lasts for days after the last page has been read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Reading this book I feel that Harris wrote this knowing it would be made into a movie. Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were books that made sense.I could believe that such seriel killers in those books could be out there some where. I could believe that the FBI would handle the cases the way Harris wrote them.Hannibal as a whole felt like I was reading a made for TV movie on the USA Network. There were characters in the book that had no business being in the storyline. Such as the friendship between Barny and Margot Verger. I felt like these characters were forced on me so Harris could bulk up the book.Everthing written in Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs had a purpose. Anything he wrote in those books, even the things that seemed vulger to some were used to push the plot along.In Hannibal anything that could be deemed vulger or sexual was used for shock value. Kind of like having a nude scene in a B movie just to see a naked girl.This book seemed to be written just to cash in on the success of Slience of the Lambs. It's a bad book that will be made into a bad movie. Of course the movie will probably gross $100 million in its first week."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you want to experience mindless psychological terror watch the news from Kosovo. If you want to read a GREAT novel, try &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;. I read it between missions and it was VERY inspiring. If you want to read something sensitive, try &quot;Stones from the River&quot; and if you just want to be entertained you can't beat Bill Murray's new autobiograpy. But it is obvious Harris could care less about what he put in Hannibal because he knew it would sell into the stratosphere no matter how much it reeked. And believe me, it reeked."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; starts off exteremely promising. Seven years after the escape of Dr. Lecter, three different people are chasing Lecter toward different ends. Mason Verger, a surviving victim of Dr. Lecter, is bent on revenge. Renaldo Pazzi, an Italian detective, has the motive of money and retrieving former glory. Then there is Clarice Starling who's intentions for finding Dr. Lecter are a little less clear. Clarity is a big problem with the last of Thomas Harris' trilogy. There is no pace to the book, and if there is one, it would be like watching a race between a turtle and a snail. The largest portion of the book occurs in Italy, and through this section, I had to fight to maintain interest. But my largest problem was that of Special Agent Clarice Starling. Her character seems vastly different from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. It was like she came straight out of an &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; episode. Her emotions come off as hollow and she shows no strength of character. And as for the end, I must say it's a surprise, but a poorly developed one. It seems like it was tacked on after a fairly interesting climax. This may be the first book I've ever read where the movie is better (at least i hope so)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not content to tell the great story he is capable of producing, Harris sets about tying anvils to the text. Artsy pretentions abound, from forced literary references to high-culture laundry-lists to disengaging &quot;experimental&quot; narrative departures. For all his high-minded aspirations, Harris never rises above one-dimensional villains who keep exotic eels in tanks, play classical piano, and have six fingers on their left hand, among other tired cliches endemic to the genre. In addition, Harris is unafraid to include thinly-disguised rehashes from Lambs (Starling/Mason interview as Starling/Lecter interview, searching abandoned prison as searching abandoned warehouse, Dr. Chilton virtually resurrected as Paul Krendler, although, this time, it's impossible to believe in him.)The whole of the Florence sequence needed to go. Starling's character is utterly destroyed. There is one truly bizarre scene towards the end which almost makes suffering through the whole mess worthwhile, since, by that time, you will likely have stopped trying to take the book at all seriously. If you liked Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs, I advise you to avoid this disaster, so that those two worthy books remain untainted in your memory."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Creepy book, many weird and disturbing characters. It really makes you think about what your definition of evil truly is. The last three chapters made me smile. It was poetic justice. Ignore the naysayers and read this book!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is the best one I've read in a long time. If you don't read another book this year make it this one. Thomas Harris is a literary genius. This book is unpredictable once you think something is going to happen Thomas Harris does the exact opposite making you not wanting to put this book down unless you absolutely have to."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After hearing much hype about Harris' latest, I gave in to my curiosity and spent the $14 on the book. I would venture to say, that Harris is one of the very few writers whose stories are more compelling in movie form. (Most likely because he will have nothing to do with the script). My advice?...Wait for the movie. I am sure Hollywood can enhance what Harris overlooked and produce another blockbuster hit."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"major letdown...highly improbable and the ending is absolutelyasinine. Save your money - or if you must have it, buy mine fortwo-bits. A real pity, too - Harris's previous efforts were real page-turners...this one is just his way of getting a payday."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A terribly disappointing effort that in no way measures up to either of its predecessors. Grotesque without being suspenseful. Proves the truth of Arendt's observation about the banality of evil. Save your money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story is simply unbelieveable, especially the end, as many readers have pointed out. Actually it could easily have been a bit MORE gruesome - why did Hannibal kill the fellow after eating half his brains? Why not just put his skull-top back on and turn him loose (still scrape the plates back into it if he wanted to get his jollies that way)? And there is NOT a large gypsy population in Australia. Clarice is unattractive from beginning to end. Mason Verger is impossible to visualise.I am grateful to the reader from Oxford of 13 August for putting me onto &quot;Telepath's Dance&quot; in &quot;The Man-Kzin Wars.&quot; As he says, a much better &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not even get through the excerpt it was so boring"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was petrified that this would be a disappointment, and clearly, the story and the ending are not to everyones liking. However, I found myself captivated, excited and amused by how the story unravels. It is a must for anyone who read Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. Although it was less believable and realistic than Silence of the lambs and Red Dragon, I read to be entertained and boy did it do that!!! It had parts that obviously would be offensive to some faint of heart, but was still one of those stories that are hard to put down. My only problem was that I finished it late one nite and had trouble sleeping for the next several hours!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had a lot of expectations when I purchased this book. Who wouldn't? I didn't read &quot;Silence&quot; but I have read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed it. Hannibal Lecter, the personification of evil, back in the world, has actually become a mild, mannered curator until he is disturbed, and then he spends the rest of the time running from his pursuors. This was not what I had hoped for. It's an interesting read if you enjoy the Lecter character, but the true nature and personality of the man is not what I thought. I want him to remain evil, not someone to be admired and respected. One of his victims who is obsessed with exacting his revenge on Lecter is made out to be the villian, leaving you to wonder what Lecter's real role is. Starling's character is juxtaposed in the story, but is not essential to the plot. If you've only seen &quot;Silence&quot; on the big screen, I'm sure you have an idea of where &quot;Hannibal&quot; is going to pick up and where it will go. But it doesn't...Harris should have stuck to what the people want."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Starling, Lecter and many other characters (especially the Italians and the Swiss, as far as I can judge) are nothing more than caricatures and cliches. Harris must have read too many books on popular psychology after The Silence of the Lambs. What a waste! (If you want vivid characters with lots of psychological insight, read James Ellroy's books!)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There are times when I'm reading several books at a time. I eventually finish all, but have not been able to complete &quot;Hannibal&quot;. A book must really be a page turner to hold my interest. And frankly, I have better things to do."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris spent too much time describing things that were not essential to the plot. The ending was ridiculous. I wish I had not wasted my time reading the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As soon as a I got to the part of Hannibel's horrifying experience as a youth, I thought something was up and flipped to the last three pages to find out that Harris lacked real imagination on this sequel. I won't go back and read the rest--I'm too disappointed. Honestly, trying to justify Hannibel and denigrate Starling so the two end up together seems like Harris just wanted this over with. Re-read Hannibel's own thoughts on evil in Silence of the Lambs and realize the character was betrayed in this sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished reading the book late last night, and I have been reading the reviews on this site with great interest. The beginning was fairly riveting, with some dragging spots in the Italian sections. But, the ending, and the lead-up to it! My, my, my. . . In the reviews on this site, there seems to be a great deal of outrage about the ending, and that the events there are &quot;out of character&quot; for Starling. I would suggest that what Harris has done is to show the *similarities* between Lecter and Starling -- after all she *does* kill 5 people in the opening chapter! And his suggestion that there *are* similarities is what is unnerving to many readers, I suspect. I thought the ending was a brillant and unsettling twist, and I think that to characterize it a &quot;fluff&quot; as several of the reviewers on this site have done is to miss what I see as Harris' main point -- good and evil exist in all of us, but both circumstances and choice enter into which one prevails. P.S. The surgical activity at the dinner party near the end of the book *is* possible and very accurately described."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What can I say, this book totally suprised me and that takes some doing. How can the readers who rate this 1 star read lines like the one above and not see the genius in Thomas Harris' book? I read a lot of fiction and here is one author who demands some intelligence from his audience. Truly a twisted work, I loved it!And as for all this garbage about how this book is somehow responsible for the horrible crime in Columbine, that is truly ludicrous. It is so easy to point to whatever, video games, movies, books to place blame rather than look in the mirror isn't it? What about the parents of the killers and the school system for not seeing the apparently many warning signs that those 2 psychos left behind?But I digress. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is an exciting and interesting book but I do think it's time for Mr. Harris to move on from his Dr. Lector period."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this purely on the strength of Mr. Harris' previous books. I should have saved my money(and my Sunday). Totally unbelieveable, especially the end. I never cared about any of the characters, too much stuff that just kind of piddled away. I'll bet Harris is laughing all the way to the bank. I wouldn't even recommend this book to BORROW."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As much as I liked Silence and Red Dragon, this 2nd rate novel is one you shouldn't waste your time with. The story never goes anywhere until the end, and when it does the result is horrible. Don't expect this to become a good movie unless they rewrite the story. Harris made a big mistake with this!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like the rest of the fans of Silence of the Lambs, I eagerly awaited Hannibal. The wait wasn't long enough. The first half of the book was enjoyable; a good read. But once Hannibal was kidnapped I wanted to throw the book across the room. Maybe it would have been too easy for Starling to come out on top, with Hannibal captured and everyone else dead. But at this point I'll take easy over completely unbelievable. I hope Jodie Foster doesn't agree to do this movie. There's no way her Clarice Starling would sell herself out that way."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Come on, how can anyone give this book a one-star rating. This is a fantastic novel. True, this book has a different style from the Red Dragon and the Silence of the Lamb, but i think the readers should be glad about the differences because how can you expect anyone in the novel to be able to anaylse Hannibal Lector, like he did to the previous two killers. If any charactor was able to do this, surely it will destroy the legend of Dr Lector. Beside, this book offered an unprecedent double climaxes.p.s. i like the 'Dinner' scence at the end, it's make my skin crawls but at the same time, it's kind of funny as well."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The thrill of the anticipation did not make up for lost time. this is the worst Hannibal series I have ever read. The characters are not themselves. It reads like the sunday paper. what a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal. Dr. Lecter. Monster. It does not matter how this man is refered to, he is simply astonishing. Dr Hannibal Lecter is, in my mind, one of the mos profound and superbly charaters ever to appear on paper. His mind will amaze you, his acts will astonish you. For those of you who felt they they could not get enough of this spine chilling man in RED DRAGON and SOTL, read this and as Hanniabal says &quot; keep an open mind&quot;!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I too must admit a bit of disappointment in a book I have anticipated for years. It was enjoyable enough reading, but deviated so far from the flow of the original stories, I found my interest waning as the story unfolded. The ending was just too much to swallow (no pun intended!)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My initial disappointment with the ending has turned to puzzlement. Harris knows the bizarre and exposes his readers to unique and terrible atrocities, as he spins variations of the standard thriller.(The garbage disposal in &quot;Black Sunday&quot; is an early example.) Our reaction to the ending measures our ability to think outside the box. Even drugged, is this how Clarice would slip into submission? Is she as strong as we remember or has the Jodie Foster performance made more of Clarice than did Harris? This is not the book we expected but Harris has always surprised us. You will not be able to ignore this installment.The monster is worth contemplating. If Clarice can succumb, would we?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not wait for this book to come out. After Silence of the Lambs, I was expecting big things from this one. The book I feel goes into too much detail about Italy. The writing at points is very graffic, sometimes gruesome. I see saw back and forth from like to dislike for this book. There were times when reading it that is was hard to pick it back up. I would say that there are sections of the book that would be rated a &quot;page turner&quot;, but not the whole book. The ending will shock. After going to all the time to read the book, I will wait and see what the movie has to offer. Although I hear that Jodie Foster has refused to play the role of Clarise Starling in the movie, so it is possible it will be a sort-of let down like the book. Still undecided on this one..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Add me to the list of people who are sorry they read this book. It was superbly written, as one expects from this author, but I wouldn't recommend it to any except those who enjoy the triumph of evil."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unfortunately you won't allow zero stars, because that's exactly what this book deserves.Not only does the far-fetched ending ruin this book, but it cheapens Silence of the Lambs as well. Harris turned his back on his characters and his readers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is a very skillful writer who told an insipid story. That is the sole compliment I can muster for his latest effort. I walked away with the distinct impression I had wasted my time reading a book in which the author became so enamored of his own creation (Hannibal) that he let the storyline spin out of control. Note that nothing bad actually happens to Hannibal. Like an evil Brer Rabbit, he is too quick, too clever. As Harris becomes reluctant to harm Hannibal in any way, he turns his pen on Clarice Starling and renders her wanton, silly and superficial -- so much so that she is no longer recognizable as the same character from Silence of the Lambs. I regret to say that as a writer of talent, Harris has slipped several notches in my esteem since his first triumph. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is a very skillful writer who told an insipid story. That is the sole compliment I can muster for his latest effort.

It kept my attention and every so often threw in a twist or two that I didn't see coming which made me want to read even more. I was tempted to turn to the back and read the end to see how it would turn out, but I am glad that I waited. I can't say that I was pleased with the ending at first as I don't think I would have ended it that way, but as the days passed after finishing the book, I grew to enjoy the ending. A more predictable or conventional ending would not have the same impact. I found myself changing my point of view about Dr. Lecter from one of wanting him to get his just desserts to one where I was pulling for him at the end. True skill by Mr. Harris in transforming the audience to root for a monster. With luck there will be another installment of these characters in the not too distant future.

Highly unbelievable and absurd."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris's earlier books depicted real killers, drawn from real cases. They took you inside the real world of a particular brand of police work, and the men and women that do it. THAT was what made them good. HANNIBAL has nothing to do with reality at any level. It's a daft, gothic fairy story that flies off into a dreary and lurid realm of fantasy, padded out with a lot of rather unfortunate and han-fisted attempts to portray high culture and sophisticated taste. It just doesn't come off. Maybe Harris is laughing at his readers, but I doubt it. I think he just fell victim to literary pretentions. Well,in so doing, I'm afraid he's only proved that a great novelist he is not, after all. Pity."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Definitely interesting and engrossing at times, but the ending was totally disappointing and unbelievable.
