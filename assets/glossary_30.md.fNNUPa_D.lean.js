Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins still bring a grin to my face when I think of their antics!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, in my opinion, is the epitome of a love story. I found myself in complete suspense to find out if darcy and elizabeth got together. Jane Austen combines 19th century wit with romance to create a book that you just can't put down. Elizabeth Bennet is a heroine that cannot be forgotten; her wit and sense are apparent throughout the whole story. Darcy is a mysteriously romantic character who, despite his cutting remarks, remains irrestistable. The reading itself can be a little uneventful sometimes, but Jane Austen saves it with a sarcastic comment from Mr. Bennet, or a witty remark from Elizabeth. This is my favorite book ever and i recommend it to anybody who can appreciate the 1800s style of writing."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book I read and after reading some of her other works, it is still my favorite Austen of all time. P&amp;P is interesting and so well written. Some people think that classics are a bit dry and something you only read in school. P&amp;P is not one of those novels...it has life and the humor in which Austen writes will make you smile and dare I say..laugh out loud! This is one of my beloved books that I reread often."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this book after seeing the movie You've Got Mail. I owned the book but had never gotten the energy to read it. After I saw the movie I was inspired to read this classic. I found the book increased my reading ability. I am an avid reader but had not read anything that required a dictionary within arms reach. I am very happy I read this book and plan to read it again(something I never do) this summer. I am sure there are aspects I missed. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Is there anything better than a sleasy romance novel. How about one from the late 18th century early 19th century? Not the literature that everyone expects but it is a wonderful window into the life and times of the people of a certain class of a certain time. Most of her works are over rated but Pride and Prejudice is absolutely not. You can relate to everything in it. Proving once again that somethings never change."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15 years old, and I loved it. Even though it took me some time to understand the old english text, the meaning was still there. Just recently (now I am 18) I saw the tv mini series of Pride and Prejudice, and fell in love with it all over again! You can feel Mr. Darcy's anguish as he watches Lizzie from afar, and you squirm in your chair knowing that Lizzie despises Darcy because she thinks that he abhors her. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet make you laugh, and you can just feel the embarrassment that the younger sisters bring to the older ones. This is the most amazing story, and I do not feel that it is in the least an ordinary one. It is a hold-your-breath romance with comedy, intrigue, a little suspense, and coincidence. A beautiful tale of old English life, and an easy to love character - Elizabeth Bennet. This is by far my favorite story of all time. I recommend to anyone - including younger people."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN.

AFTER READING THIS, I FEEL LOVE CAN REALLY PULL TOGETHER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH PERSON, AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE LOVE IN OUR MIND, THERE IS NO PROBLEM THAT IS UNSOLVABLE.

It was not only a touching love story, but also an accurate reflection of the Victorian society in that era. The story evolved heavily on the complications among different classes. The pride within each character and prejudice between them further enriched the novel. Some characters, such as Darcy and Lizzie, found themselves fighting among their pride, prejudice and their affections for each other revealed an idea that true love outweighs anything and everything. Each character in the novel contrasted significantly in terms of their characteristics. We can recall these contrasts among the five Bennet sisters, Mr. and Mrs. Bennets, and Darcy and Bingley. Another interesting point revealed by Jane Austen is that characters with similar characteristic attracts. We can see this through the two loving couples, Jane and Bingley, Lizzie and Darcy.These complications and challenges that each character had to struggle within themselves made the novel Pride and Prejudice a great masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In comparison to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Pride and Prejudice is a refreshing romance comedy which brings to life the humor of 18th century society. Jane Austen's style is so stellar. She leaves nothing unsettled or unhappy. They way each character is tied in with the plot is amazing, from Mr. Collins and charlotte's marriage, which brings Elizabeth to lady Catherine and Darcy, to the Gardeners transaction with Darcy during the chase for Lydia, proving Darcy's love for Elizabeth. Jane is a sweet character and Bingly is her perfect match. Darcy and Elizabeth as well are the epitome of romance. Elizabeth cannot marry anyone she cannot love, and to her, love is someone who she can connect with on all levels. When she and Darcy fight, it should only be taken as a sign of their compatibility because she is not afraid to answer him and he enjoys it. Lydia and Mrs. Bennet are incredibly irritating, however they do add to the satirical style of the novel, as Mrs. bennet's sole desire in life has to do with marriage, her own and her daughters. She and Mr Bennet do not share a true love because he married her for her beauty, and now must learn to live with her stupidity. Lydia as well makes a mistake in who she marries. She is too naive to understand that Wickham had no desire to marry her in the first place. She considers the whole ordeal a game, not realizing the gravity of the situation she has put her family in, ruin and disgrace. Bingly's sisters take on the &quot;wicked step sister&quot; act in trying to keep Bingly from Jane and Elizabeth from Darcy. Charlotte Lucas is an extraordinary character simply because her theories on love are profound and true for the time period. Good book, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen&#8217;s Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat. More of a powerful weapon than the extraordinary novel that it is, Austen uses the book to fiercely criticize nineteenth century society and the essence of human nature while still managing to create an extraordinary and captivating plot.Beginning at the novel&#8217;s outset, the reader becomes a puppet at the mercy of Austen&#8217;s ability to evoke any emotions she desires within her readers.By creating a diction and syntax unique to each character Austen holds the reader within her grasp. All of the characters are very different from each other in many aspects; this creates grounds for conflict and essentially propels the plot.Also, each of the characters is somewhat of an extremity of a certain characteristic that most people possess. Mrs. Bennet is the spoiled side of our personalities, Mr. Darcy the proud side, Lydia the irresponsible side, Jane the quiet side, Mary the feminist side, and so on.The novel encompasses main elements from many different genres of books such as romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and tragedy, which make for a very entertaining read. Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you&#8217;ll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen's Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat.

Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you'll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen masterfully weaves an endearing love story, with cosmic irony, and a keen awareness for social distinctions, which took us through a colorful journey of mind, body, and soul. Her humor shines through the biting sarcasm of Mr. Bennet's expected, yet amusing remarks about Mrs. Bennet's &quot;nerves,&quot; and his daughter's suitors, namely Mr. Collins. This unctuous character also provided us with a few laughs by quietly portraying the absurdity of society's emphasis on &quot;connections&quot; with the upper class.Another part of the novel, which we greatly enjoyed, was the blooming romance between Darcy and Elizabeth. Though their union was much anticipated, we were kept on our toes by the many twist and turns it took throughout the novel. At one point, we were greatly disappointed with Darcy's overbearing arrogance when he made it explicitly clear to Elizabeth that it was against his own will to love her. But then we were heart warmed by his kindness to her and the Gardiners at the Pemberley estate, exemplifying his true character.Aside from its humor and romance, this novel also prides itself in its vivid illustrations of class structures of early 19th century England. Austen clearly depicts the importance and influence of the social classes on every aspect of life, predominantly marriage, wealth, education, and values. One scene, which we believed to be a great example of Austen's comprehensive knowledge of the social classes, is when Lady Catherine rudely confronts Elizabeth on Darcy's proposal to marry her, all the while mocking her estate, her family, and her life. Yet, Elizabeth once again proves her superior attitude and strength as an independent woman, and takes Lady Catherine's comments with wisdom and maturity.Truly a classic, Pride and Prejudice exemplifies a sincere love that breaks social boundaries. Throughout its 150 years of publication Pride and Prejudice has remained a cornerstone of the literary world, and we recommend it to everyone. And beware; this book ends with a bang, in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i absolutely adore this book. i have read it 4 times and i would recommend it to anyone. it has interesting characters, a very complex and engaging plot, and you learn alot about english society during austin's time. jane austin is a very gifted writer. i have also read sense and sensibility and presuasion, both very good books, but pride and prejudice will always be my favorite."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When i read this book for the first time, i just thought that it was just same as the other love story.But after i read twice and three times, i found that it's obviously different from any other romantic books.It's the only one book for reflect of women's life in society.and i really want to be a character like lizzy:)I think that it's the only book to express feminism."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I loved the book! Jane Austen is truly a genius. I really don't know how she makes the book so interesting! I mean, the characters aren't throwing themselves at each other, and there aren't any viciuos fights or anything like that. In those times, everybody had to be calm and acceptible. But still the book is so captivating! You're just dying for Elizabeth (main character) to fall in love with Mr. Darcy!

Pride and Prejudice basically was about marriages. In old England, a man who has good fortune must need a good manner and charming wife, and a grown girl who has good education, high manner, a litter beauty must in want of a husband. That is why the whole story happen. In the author Miss Austen's book, she used very decent and nice words, and she described the emotion of the characters truely and let people feel the characters really existed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic, no doubt about it, but why should anyone read it now? Austen's humor and satire are a bit understated in today's world, but for the reader who pays attention to the details and to whitty dialog, should get a kick out of numerous scenes throughout the novel. Another gift that Austen has is being able to portray intense emotions without having to spell those emotions out. I first read this book as a freshman in high school and I didn't finish it until the second attempt.

My biggest impression is relief that I did not live in that era, when the most a woman could hope for was to be good at needlepoint and marry well. I understand that is how it was, but I still felt nauseous reading about all the silly, manipulative man hunting tactics of the women. The dialoge was sometimes very witty, but other times rather difficult to follow because of the older style English.I also could not stand Darcy; any man who has the audacity to say within earshot of a woman that she is too ugly to tempt him or to dance with him is a jerk, period. I would tell him to take a hike if he came around. I don't understand how women find men like Darcy, Heathcliff, and Rochester to be attractive; cold indifferent, sarcastic, and cruel men don't interest me in the slightest and I can't for the life of me understand how they get to be such great romantic interests in these type of novels.The main character, Elizabeth, is different from the others and is very likeable; she redeems the book from being a 1 star. I admire her intelligence and refusal to go along the societies norms. I don't understand how she begins to like Darcy, but I guess that is just me. Elizabeth's ability to spar with Darcy and hold her own was the best part of the book.This book is is not as good as \\"Jane Eyre\\" but is better than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in my opinion. A decent read, but not a rave."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I am an avid reader of English classics so naturally, I came across P&amp;P fairly soon after I discovered my love of literature. I had heard so many glorious things about this novel (that it forms young women world wide, that the characters are incredibly convincing and realistic, etc.), that perhaps I was expecting a little bit more. Sure, Austen claimed she wrote about the &quot;things she knew about.&quot; Unfortunately, there were many other authors, female artists to be most specific, who were her contemporaries and wrote far more incredibly mind blowing novels (Mary Shelly comes to my mind).I will begin by saying that this book was wonderful to read. It was witty and the story line was intriguing enough that I had no trouble completing it a few days after beginning it (I will confess, I even gave up a few nights of slee to find out if Elizabeth's character flaws would resolve). The characters were convincing, the book well developed and not extremely predictable. Unfortunately, these assets did not redeem the novel in my eyes, because shortly after finishing it, I simply could not believe I had wasted a few days of valuable reading time to devote to a relatively 'numb' piece of literature. Simply put, I felt it lacked depth, and although it was witty and enjoyable to read, I do not exactly understand why it has lasted as a classic depiction of human existance. The plot was unrealistic, the ending contrived, and besides the obvious message that 'pride and prejudice are evil and indulging in either of these flaws will cause misery' I did not receive any further enlightenment by reading it. It is an excellent documentation of courting rituals during Austen's time, as well as what I imagine to be a realistic depiction of the concerns of upper-middle-class English society, but to be perfectly honest, who cares? If these subjects interest you, I'm sure you will be enthralled by Austen's work. I appreciate her and respect her because of the history she represents, and for this reason, you should NOT AVOID READING THIS BOOK, but I do not think I will ever be able to say her work moves me. Of course, I could be missing something. I'm only sixteen, so my distaste for P&amp;P could be the result of youth and foolishness. If any of you have read this novel were sincerely moved by it, I'd love to hear from you. There's nothing I hate more than simply 'not getting' a book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I really didn't like this book because it was in the old times and I didn't understand it so yea :)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Amazon.com is amazing, so I'm not giving it one star because I hate Amazon.com because I don't.

Jane austen is a great writer."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a very nice story. However it is difficult to read because it is written in Old English. My favorite character would be Elizabeth Bennet, or Lizzy as she is frequently reffered. She is willing to let love walk out the door because another woman is interested. Lizzy definately dislikes competition. She does make her presence known. Not rudely, but can get very defensive and in that quite comical. Lizzy presents herself very well. Like they say &quot;A first impression is a lasting impression&quot;. I picture her as tall, very beautiful, and soft spoken. Unlike others she has a beautiful smell and good taste in clothing. Lizzy reminds me a lot of Emma Woodhouse in Emma and Elinor Dashwood in Sense and Sensability. Coincidently, both of these novels were also written by Jane Austen. The reason I believe these three characters are alike is because they each either search for love for other people and over-look their own need, in the case of Emma, or they simply allow other women to appear to fill in the role in the cases of Elinor and Lizzy. Another thing that relates Lizzy, Emma and Elinor is the fact that they are all very dependent and become so in the coarse of the novels. Their love interest are not a priority and they do not depend on their parents support emotionally. Lizzy grows as and individual when she spends two weeks at their friends house with her sister Jane. This seperation allows her to grow away from her parents to take care of Jane and make some of her own decisions. While there, she does not allow herself to show many emotions toward other people and over looks emotions displayed toward her by others. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, dislikes going out past their fence and that forces Emma to go out to social events on her own. In a way she becomes too dependent and doesn't realize what she may be missing out on with other characters of the book. Elinor appears to be unconcerned. Her love interest pops in and out of the novel and her true feelings are not completely revealed until the end of the novel. Her independence comes from helping her moher raise two of her sisters, Margarette and Marianne. I would reccomend this novel to someone who is enterested in branching out their reading experiences to old English romance. I enjoyed reading this book because of its interesting characters. There was always a mdest joke or disagreement, I was never bored. I also enjoyed picturing the events in my head. Some of the scenes were so beautiful. Taking place in lovely gardens you see only in your dreams, and extremely elegant mansions. Reminding me of the time I went to Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, and Montecello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. Back then people were so polite. Rudeness was severly frowned upon especially when directed at or in the presence of a lady. Very different from today's society. It is interesting to see what it was like back then for entertainment without a television or radio. I enjoyed this novel very much as well as some of Jane Austen's other works which have been made into major motion pictures that are also very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I though is was a wonderful and Romantic Book.

But level-headed Elizabeth, although unknown to her, has charmed the proud and prejudiced friend of Jane's love, and thus changes his outlook and opinion of the Bennett sisters.

This story is about a girl Lizzy ,(or Elizabeth), who had a \\"poorer\\" family who was very prejudice against Mr.Darcy who was very wealthy.The five Bennet sisters - Lizzie,Jane,Lydia,Mary and Kitty - have been raised well aware of their mother's fixation on finding them husbands and securing set futures...and keeping the family name \\"strong.\\"However, the spirited and intelligent Elizabeth strives to live her life with a broader perspective, as encouraged by her father.Mr. Darcy ,on the other hand, lived a life of luxury with his little sister,(age 15). Mr.Darcy and his friend Mr. Bingly's sister were very prideful of themselves.Mr. Bingly fell in love with Lizzy's oldest sister,Jane, and Mr.Bingly's sister fell in love with Mr. Darcy. And Mr.Darcy fell in love with Lizzy but he was to prideful to admit it.When the good-natured Mr Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr Darcy culpable for contributing to the heartbreak. But a crisis involving youngest sister Lydia soon opens Lizzie's eyes to the true nature of her relationship with Mr Darcy.It is a book about British \\"classes\\" (or ranks) in government and also society : (people were treated differently because of their \\"class\\". Many people who were poor could not even skeak or even stay in the same room with the \\"rich and famous\\" in the 1800's. It is a great peice of English literature.Each family was very close..most of the time. Lizzy's family for example, was all about marrage to a wealthy man or the family name. Mr.Darcy's \\"family\\" was more of just him and his sister who were very close. Lizzy acted the same toward everyone and \\"full of life!\\" but Mr.Darcy was only truely happy with his little sister and later, Elizabeth. Otherwise he would not dance at balls (unless he danced with Lizzy) and he hardly even laughed.In the end,(without giving it away), Mr.Darcy AND Lizzy had a differnet perspective of life and family. And, each family gets a benefit.--Jane Austen is an excellent author. She has written may books before but \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" would have to be my favorite!--"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Excellent classic novel. I loved how there are a variety of story lines going at once. It takes a few chapters to get past some of the old English language, but once you get a few chapters into it you can't put it down. It's a good novel about relationships - from family to romantic - in a setting of the early 1800's in England."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"pride and prejudice seems boring if you merely scan it, but if you read every detail then you'll find that it is a very witty, interesting, funny book. many things happen in this novel and you'll learn.this book may be confusing if you don't understand these old english expressions. i luckily knew some of them and learned the rest.pride and prejudice takes you into the world of the aristocracy in Enlgland in the early nineteenth century. You'll learn about matchmaking schemes and what was most important for a woman (marriage, of course) and how people treated their own family. I'm not talking cruelty or anything, but about pride. For ex. Mr. Darcy likes Elizabeth, but doesn't want to, since she's below his class. When Elizabeth's siter Lydia runs off with a guy their father almost disowns her in his anger. It may seem like a cruel and heartless thing to do, but when you read it, it almost seems like a perfectly sensible thing to do. women married for money and position, rarely for love. daughters were expected to obey their parents' wishes. Pride and Prejudice shows you all of this.this story takes place in England in around the early nineteenth century. here, in the upper-middle/lower first class is Mr. Bennet, a sarcastic, quiet man, his rather foolish wife, and their five daughters. Jane, the eldest, is the most kindest and prettiest. She's a goody-goody but you like her anyway, since she's also sensible. Elizabeth is the second eldest; the main character and also the wittiest and cleverest of her sisters. Mary is the quietest and most accomplished; she spends her time studying and you hear least of her in this story except when she's making some clever observation on pride or virtues from her studies.. Catherine, also called Kitty, is next, and then Lydia. They're both foolish, flirtatious, empty-headed girls who spend most of their time going to town so they can flirt with officers in the militia.enter Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. They're best friends, both rich young men, both really handsome, both bachelors. only difference is that people hate Mr. darcy, as he's a proud, indifferent man who hates to dance and critizizes things. Mr. Bingley on the other hand is charming and amiable, loves to dance and admires Jane a lot. of course Mrs. Bennet starts scheming. She hates Mr. Darcy though, since at the beginning of the book, Mr. Darcy is heard telling Mr. Bingley at a ball that Elizabeth is not handsome enough for him to go off and dance with. Elizabeth is actually very pretty, as Jane Austen puts it, but nevertheless Mr. Darcy is a picky person. Elizabeth doesn't like Mr. Darcy's personality too much herself. they seem to be destined to scorn and be critical of each other only unfortunately for Elizabeth Mr. Darcy starts to fall head over heels for her after being stunned by Elizabeth's playfully bold, unique personality.of course they don't get married at once, otherwise this would be a very short novel. neither do jane and mr. bingley. The happy endings are delayed as a result from pride and prejudice. After all, Mrs. bennet isn't the only one who schemes. everybody does, from Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte to Mr. Bingley's sister.this was a fabulous book and i definitely reccomend it. it depends on the reader's reading level, though."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This classic novel follows the Bennet sisters as they search for marriage. The joy of this book is relating it to modern day romance and marriage. Many parts of the conversations and desires are familiar to today, while many other parts are foreign. Austen also has a great sense of humor, although many times I wondered whether it was intended as funny or whether it only appeared comical from a modern point of view."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far my favorite novel. I read it for the first time in 10th grade and have read it 4 times since. Every time I get something new out of it and the story never loses its charm!Austen is an undeniably talented author and Pride and Prejudice is arguably her best work. All of the characters are wonderfully developed and full of life. The plot seems to have a mind of its own, twisting here and there. Unlike some books were the plot doesn't seem to fit together in the end, Austen has worked out every detail.I also think this book is wonderful for the social commentary that it provides. Again, some novels I have read do not do so well with balancing social commentary and plot/character development. This is not so with Pride and Prejudice. This book is a true gem. Witty, fun, shocking, scandalous, romantic, and entertaining!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Almost everything that can be said about this book has been said. It has appeared in countless other books and media. I love this book for it's wit, it's humor, it's unconventional love story and because it is almost the singly best early example of individuals rebelling against conformity. This book is amazing, and I recommended it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a superb book. Each character has a unique personality. For example, Mr. Darcy is arrogant at the start of Pride and Prejudice. While Darcy is arrogant, Elizabeth Bennett is smart, beautiful, and independent. Elizabeth is the protagonist and is the liveliest character. I rooted for her from the start to the end of the story. Miss Bennett seems to somehow always find herself in difficult situations. The plot kept me entertained. There were several times when I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened next.Pride and Prejudice is sometimes a little wordy. And because it was written in the 19th century, the English isn\`t contemporary.Overall, this book is excellent. In fact, it is considered one of the best novels in English ever written. It is therefore a classic. I recommend it to readers who want to read an engrossing book with a lot of dialogue."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is one of the best i have read in years.

I appreciate the positive reviews as they motivated me to start a classic which I may not have begun without some encouragement."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My favorite chapter was chapter eleven in volume two because I found it amusing that Elizabeth turned down Mr. Darcy's proposal. I think that Elizabeth's own prejudice against Darcy didn't allow her to see his affections for her. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of having too much pride, and she accuses him of prejudice, when in both cases they both show pride and prejudice.I think this book is appropriate for students in high school because it is not complicated to read and therefore they should be able to read it. I like the fact that the author uses a lot of dialogue to reveal ideas and personalities of different characters. In my opinion dialogue is very important because sometimes it helps me understand what the characters are like, or it can reveal a character's look, and that helps me develop a picture of that one character.I like this book because it wasn't as hard to read as I thought it was going to be. One thing that I learned was that you should carefully read the story because sometimes you might miss the important parts."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"STORY LINE:Being not very wealthy, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennet and her four sisters find it hard to find good marriages in society thirst for position and good fortunes.

Lizzie was off course mad to the handsome Mr. Darcy because of that, not to mention that Mr. Darcy is arrogant and rude to her, her friends and family.In addition, a charming yet deceitful man, Mr. Wickham told awful lies about Mr. Darcy to Lizzie, adding to the hatred she felt already for him.

Elizabeth is married to Darcy and Jane is married to Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet is happy because three of her daughters are married.Pride and Prejudice is appropriate for people 15 years and older because it is interesting and romantic. I would really recommend them to read the novel because they would really like the novel.One literary device that I appreciate was how Jane Austen uses the letters in the novel to advance the plot in the story. For example the letter from Darcy to Elizabeth told the reader that they might get married because now Elizabeth would know that Wickham was a liar. The way that she did that was when Darcy wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Wickham was not saying the truth about him and that Wickham was a liar . Another example would be when Jane wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Lydia had run away with Wickham. Lydia has to marry Wichham so that it wouldn't be a disgrace for the family.I like the novel because it makes us think about pride and prejudice against others, and about knowing people before we judge them. This novel is also very romantic for people who like romantic novels. I would recommend everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possesion of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" or so begins PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most highly regarded classical novels of English literature. More than likely, throughout high school and college, you will read this book. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is relatively short for a classic, only around 350 pages. It is a medium-difficulty reading though, as the dialouge is a bit hard to keep up with and the language can be a bit \\"sophisticated.\\"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE tells a tale of a tangled love story. The book centers around Elizabeth Bennent, the second oldest daughter of the Bennent family. Her eldest sister Jane falls for Bingley, a rich and polite gentlemen. Elizabeth meets Bingley's friend, Darcy, who is even richer but has horrible manners. When Bingley departs suddenly, Elizabeth finds out it was Darcy's doing. Elizabeth finds herself falling in love and hating Darcy at the same time. The novel concludes the love tales in a brilliant conclusion that makes everyone satisfied.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE isn't the most exciting novel, and it might be questioned why it is better than today's novels made by King, Grisham, or Sparks. It is because it is a classic, and that there is a multitude of messages in the novel. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE criticizes the social class system, as Austen also criticizes the marriage process which can be a non consensual process. The book is an excellent example of a satire. The book has lively characters, and about 70 percent of the book is the well thought dialouge.The book falls short of other classics though, i.e. A TALE OF TWO CITIES, OLIVER TWIST, CALL OF THE WILD, and a few others, but altogether a brilliant work."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"it is a nice book for all age group."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This Book is just the kind of book that I like.

If your player does not have this capacity, or if the speaker in question cannot be turned off completely, this set is useless.

Granted, there are many ommision for this two hour audioplay, but essentially, it retains the very essence of the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen has created a very believable world in P&amp;P. Although the book's official theme is marriage, it is also a statement on human behavior. The problems suffered by the characters are the result of their own folly, and no one else. The love story woven into the book is also wonderful, as it shows the characters concerned getting to know each other's positives and negatives before committing, instead of simply jumping into bed as the characters of modern novels do. This book is smartly written, with much humor. It is lighthearted and easy to read, although it was written over 200 years ago (the first draft of the book was written in the late 1700s, but not published until after 1800). I highly recommmend it to a reader of any age. It is, as Elizabeth Bennet would say, a &quot;happy thought, indeed.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It feels a little strange and even presumptuous to review Jane Austen online. I was prompted to do so when reading other reviews dismissing Pride and Prejudice as nothing more than a silly romance and a relic of a bygone era.It would be silly to suggest that the social mores and manners that Austen skewered are unchanged. Young women are no longer dependent on a husband simply for food and shelter, and I have no intention of spending my life in a drawing room trimming hats and sewing screens. But it would also be silly to suggest that Austen's tale offers nothing to the modern reader. Even in our enlightened age, young women in indelicate situations are pressured by their humiliated families into unfortunate marriages. Manifestations of social standing may differ, but money, education, and other modern expressions of social class still play more of a role in the choice of spouses than most of us would wish to admit. And to this day, young men and women alike are mortified by their families in public situations, justified or unjustified.To fully appreciate Austen's sense of humor takes a bit of effort on the reader's part, but once acclimated to the language the hilarity of the book becomes apparent. Pride and Prejudice proves that classics need not be dull; Austen had a lively and sharp wit. If you are truly put off by the language, and don't get the humor, it's actually worthwhile to find a good production on video and rent it. The BBC version produced in the 1990's is long, but a very faithful and extremely well-cast adaptation that does an excellent job of translating Austen's humor onto the screen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love this novel. It has everything you could possibly want in a book. Love, hate, comedy, and more. Every time Lizzy and Mr. Darcy are in the same room you can expect some kind of comedy. Lizzy's bizarre family (not counting Jane) would drive any man away.If Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bennet were real I wouldn't be able to understand how he could possibly stay married to this rude and ill-mannered woman. But since they're only characters in a book I would have to say that they are a perfectly matched couple. Each one posseses what the other does not.If you can get past the old English that Jane Austen wrote in, this is a great read and a wonderful romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I always love reading about romance in England. Especially in the 17th &amp; 18th century. This book was no exception. Jane Austen dwells deep into human nature. How Elizabeth's pride is damaged, when Darcy refuses to dance with her &amp; becomes prejudiced against him by Mr. Wickham. How Darcy slowly finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth.

It encompasses Austen's fabulous use of irony, wonderful examples of females subverting the economic conditions that control them through their wit, and a wonderful contrast in descripitions of landscapes that are prevelent in all of Austen's books. However, this book stands out as one of the best of the nineteenth century for many reasons. The first is that Austen's use of irony in this book is readily apparent, especially in the dialogue and actions of the characters. The wit that Lizzie exudes, especially in her conversations between Mr. Darcy, her unexpected love interest, and the Lady Catherine de Burgh provide endless entertainment for the reader. The reader develops a line of sympathy for Lizzie as she struggles to make the best of her unfortunate financial situation. Another reason to love the book not only includes the wit of Lizzie Bennet, but of her father and Mr. Darcy, which provide wonderful view into the superior workings of Austen's mind in terms of her characters' personalities. The landscapes would provide a wonderful escape for someone stranded on a deserted island because they provide many Romantic countrysides with transcendental descriptions along with wonderful descriptions of London that make the reader feel as if they really are staying with Mrs. Gardner with Jane. The description of Pemberley alone provides a wonderful example of the grandeur of nineteenth-century estates in England. Since I am supposedly stranded on this island on Valentine's Day, the love story contained within Austen's indirect ocmmentary on the hardships of economics on women in the nineteenth century, provides a hope that each person will meet not only the perfect person, but that person will also recognize them as their destined mate. This book incorporates the Romantic notions of Byron and Wordsworth into Lizzie, while allowing her to retain pieces of realism that makes her supreme to all of the other female characters. Austen also provides a wonderful sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie that has never been equalled in any book that I have ever read, and being an English major, there have been many. I have read this book many times and still find motifs, themes, images and nuances in the plot that provide me continually with enjoyment. For this reason alone would I be content with having this book as my sole company on a deserted island. The villains in this novel are also so much fun to hate because they prove to be the very foces that try to keep Lizzie and Darcy apart. The two characters, however, persevere, which would be a very important theme for a person stranded on a desert island. Perseverence would be the only way one would survive the lonliness, aside from an excellent book, of course. Austen was truly ahead of her time as critic after critic will tell you, but only after you have read one of her greatest works will you understand why it has crossed the time and custom boundries and to this day remains a wonderful piece of literature that will continue to provide enjoyment to each new reader that endeavors to read it.

Elizabeth's younger sisters are silly young girls who favor their senseless mother. Her father loves her dearly. He adds humor to the novel with his near-sarcastic views of his family. The other characters in the novel range from her completely silly and senseless cousin Collins, to the conniving Miss Bingley, to the indescribable Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's beau. Austen uses the perfect combination of humor, romance, and suspense in this unforgettable story.

Women must find men (hopefully rich) to marry them; any feelings of love or respect in marriage are wonderful, but not always necessary or relevant.

What would you do when an attractive, rich man moved in next door and fell in love with your older sister (who is the most beautiful and eligible woman in the surrounding countryside)? You would be happy for her and you would do everything you could to help her marry the man she loves...and you'd be pretty upset if his best friend stepped in and talked him into not being in love with your sister and thus removed your sister's chance at happiness and an improved situation in life. Then what if your socially inept, silly, pedantic cousin asked you to marry him after you had only known him three days? Oh--then what would you do if he proposed to your best friend the day after you refused him, and she accepted?! To top it off, what if the same person who took away the love of your sister's life fell in love with you and asked you to marry him?!Well, that is Miss Elizabeth Bennett's position at the outset of this hilarious and endearing novel which details a year in the life of a genteel English family and their neighbors. During the course of the novel, three proposals of marriage are made to Miss Elizabeth; one proposal is made to Jane (the eldest Miss Bennett); and their youngest sister (who is only sixteen) elopes with an English Army officer who has a worse reputation with the ladies than Wilt Chamberlin. Jane Austen is a masterful storyteller who is able to sketch characters through a plot that is never quite what the reader expects.

One can learn a great deal about oneself by reading this book as it examines the complexities of human relationships and emotions still valid today, almost 200 years after it was written. Other priceless titles by Austen that rate a '10' are Emma and Mansfield Park.

The story, which is set in pre-Victorian rural England, is full of elegant wit and humor fit for all ages. Though its romantic themes are directed more towards women, men too can enjoy this tale of first impressions and first loves. Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that will hold you in its grip from the first page to the last.The story begins when a handsome bachelor named Charles Bingley and his friends move into the neighborhood where the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, lives with her four sisters. Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, and Mr. Bingley fall in love at first sight. What makes this novel so captivating is that Jane and Mr. Bingley are persuaded by others to bury their feelings for each other. Throughout the novel, the reader is kept guessing as to whether or not they will end up together.Elizabeth, meanwhile, attracts the attentions of Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy. However, her first impression of his arrogant demeanor forms a prejudice within her that prevents her from returning his admiration. Likewise, Mr. Darcy's pride makes it hard for him to reveal his feelings to her. As Amazon.com's editorial review on Pride and Prejudice claims, \\"The point is, you spend the whole book absolutely fixated on the critical question: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy hook up?\\" Although the plot is built to answer that question, it contains more than just 18th century romance to keep you interested.Conversation keeps the pages of this novel flying by. Whether you're listening to Mrs. Bennet grind on her daughters, or you're in the room at Netherfield hearing Caroline Bingley talk trash about Elizabeth, you will beg for more. You'll be somewhat satisfied to witness Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy duke it out, but you will not be able to stop until you find out what happens next.Pride and Prejudice is an essential classic for teen and adult readers alike. It explores the world of love, the dangers of preconceived notions, and the negative affects that self-gratification can have on relationships. Tyler C. Powell, who posted his review on Amazon.com, stated that through Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen \\"has lived up to the hype surrounding her name.\\" I concur completely, and recommend reading this novel and others by the same author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My favourite book of all time!! Whenever I am at a loss to find anything decent to read in the modern literature I find this a real comfort. A great read!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"MY DEAR READERI cannot but be rendered in the highest of spirits upon completing this volume yet again, as I have always preferred extensive reading to trivial pleasures.Dwelling on particular passages and turns of phrase, I am reminded of how ardently I admire and love the prose that issued forth when Miss Austen put ink to paper many a fortnight ago.Neither common, nor dull, nor threadbare, each chapter engrosses completely with accounts of gentlemen of handsome countenance and ladies both sensible and silly.And though its conclusion is known most intimately to my own heart, anxiously I turn each page to venture ever farther away from the misconstrued encounters and lamentable conduct of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.When finally all is concluded and the mistress of Pemberley assured, only then can I chuse another distraction to engage my solitary hours.

Didn't think it would be an easy read, but it's so easy to get into!!! I love it!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My mother has been trying to foist this book off on me for years, but I always resisted. I thought that the stodgy language, Victorian morality, and melodramatic romance would be tiresome and trite. I could not have been more wrong. I instantly fell in love with Elizabeth Bennett, the young heroine of this novel and the \\"prejudice\\" referred to in the book's title.Of course, the \\"pride\\" is the insufferable Mr. Darcy, who looks down upon Elizabeth, her four sisters and her ridiculously self-absorbed mother. However, what begins as outright animosity between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy blossoms into appreciation and finally true love. (I hope I didn't spoil the book for anyone, but if you didn't see the ending coming, you need to read more!)The language in this novel is terse, elegant and hilarious. Elizabeth can tell anyone off in such a way as to make the object of her wrath want to shrivel up and fall off the planet, all the while using beautiful language which contains not one bit of profanity. The characters in this story are also lovable and hilarious even with all their flaws: the narrow-minded and antagonistic Mrs. and Mr. Bennett, the cunning Mr. Wiccam, and my favorite of all characters--the youngest sister Lydia.The language contained in this novel is not an obstacle to reading it but is instead an absolute delight. If you have any sense of humor and romance whatsoever you will fall in love with these flawed characters and their absurd predicaments. Definitely a quick and enchanting read that made me laugh aloud!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austin, is a story of how a girl learns that the outward appearance can be deceiving. In this story many believe that a young man is quite awful. The two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, end up effecting each others lives and changing their ways of seeing. Jane Austin's story truly tells a story with many turns in the road.With great surprises this book is not easy to put down. When things happen sometimes the least expected people are the ones who are helpful. I found this an enjoyable story with a few exceptions.Although I didn't really mind the style of writing it may be confusing to a reader. The reason is because of the style used when the book was written. In some parts it was easy to lose concentration, but it would grab my attention again.This was a wonderful story and perhaps one that would be best to read over and over. Not all people would enjoy this book. I found that it told a good story that gives the message to never judge a book by its cover.This book may be considered a love story. It truly told how being prejudice doesn't mean you are right about someone. The lesson learned in this book should be a lesson we all know about so maybe we can save ourselves from making the mistake of judging one another."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story. When I first decided to read it I had no idea that it would be such a good book. The love conflicts between the characters really make you think about how important getting to know someone is before you marry them. It also makes you realize how much your views on someone can change when you are forced to become close to them. After reading Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, I realize why it is considered to be a classic. You can imagine that you are Elizabeth, or you can imagine you are watching as Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley fall in love. I recomend this book to people who would like to read a wonderful and emotionally stimulating novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is quite possibly the best book ever written. The plot is as real today as it was when it was written. The characters are strong and vivid. Its like stepping back in time to a place you've never been. If you enjoy the book, A&amp;E and the BBC made a wonderful mini-series adaptation of the story starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Also for a more modern take on the same premise, read Bridget Jone's Diary by Helen Fielding."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen knew what she was talking about, way before a time were women had many rights. Her characters in this book are witty, charming, and well spoken. Her characters are well developed and the interaction between chacters are better then watching any movie, you are hooked from page one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"You are going to read many a review of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE [P&P;] wherein the author of said review will, with great superciliousness, state that this novel is NOT just a chick book, NOT just a piece of fluff, but instead a work of such great sociological importance that its message cannot be ignored. I'm here to tell you different. P&P; is most DEFINITELY a chick book, ...This isn't to say that P&P; has no value to its readers. Certainly it must or English instructors would stop putting \\"OPTIONAL: AUSTEN OR THUMBSCREWS' on their syllibi. But what IS its value? The great moral lessons it imparts? Its grave lessons in proper deportment? Of course not. P&P; retains its value simply in being a good read. This is perhaps the most finely crafted love story of all time. Without the aid of a tip sheet from Harlequin, Austen manages to hit all the high points of a typical romance [excepting the lamentable lack of a sex scene], & still provide enough social commentary & moral/ethical guidance that even the most unromantic among us cannot but be interested. It is in this manner that Austen has for years been able to fool Academia into believe that her work is anything but a sweet little love story, albeit a decidedly complex one.Novels are read for different reasons. Some novels are important, and they are knighted with the celebrated title of \\"literature\\", and though no one truly knows why, or what makes them good literature, there is the vague idea that such works much teach you something. That nebulous idea of imparting some great knowledge or insight into our existence is imperative-it's one of the 3 miracles needed for a work to achieve the saintly shroud of \\"literature.\\" Some novels are just ..., but are read by the masses on the sly, tucked into their laps as they ride public transportation; the half-dressed, windswept maiden & man or the bloody, dripping knife on the cover safely hidden from view. Austen's P&P; truly fits in neither of these categories, though its square peg can be stuffed into \\"literature's\\" round hole with little abrasion. It is simply an ESSENTIAL novel, a must read for every generation, owing to the fact that it is an excellent story. It doesn't have to teach us anything. It simply has to be entertaining, and PRIDE & PREJUDICE is, to the utmost degree."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a wonderful look at the customs of marriage, love, and financial and social status in Regency England.

I have never had a problem seeing the Bennetts as my contemporaries. Anyone who reads this book will immediately recognize these characters and their situations.

I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One of my all-time favorite classics and a book I have read endlessly and will read many times more, so am delighted to have this on my Kindle as well as having several print copies around.

It's about 7 1/2 hours each way (because I actually go the speed limit!!!) and I wanted to try something new while driving. So, I decided to try an audio recording.I found one from my local library of Pride and Prejudice. : Why not go with a classic book for the drive home?So, I listened to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.Pride and Prejudice is the story of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. Both are of marriageable age but do not come from the wealthiest of families. However, they live in a time when marriage to someone with wealth is of utmost importance.Since they have no brothers, when their father dies his estate will go to another male relative, as they are unable to inherit.One summer a new family comes to live nearby, and Mrs. Bennet, their mother insists that Mr. Bennet make an acquaintance with Mr. Bingley, the new bachelor who is very wealthy. At a ball one evening he is immediately taken with Jane Bennet who is admittedly beautiful, of a sweet nature, but perhaps below the standard of wealth into which he is expected to marry.But the problem really is his friend, Mr. Darcy. A haughtier more proud man has never existed, and though that same night at the ball many women did not have partners as men were few, Mr. Darcy makes it clear that he thinks pretty negatively of Elizabeth Bennet. He is cold, unfriendly, and seemingly unkind . . .Mrs. Bennet is determined to see her daughters married and encourages Jane and Mr. Bingley, but is desperate to make a match for Elizabeth, including pushing her to accept the proposal of marriage from her most insipid cousin.We follow the story of the Bennet family as others do everything they can to keep Jane and Mr. Bingley apart, and Elizabeth is forced into close proximity with the awful Mr. Darcy repeatedly.Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept? Or will their less wealthy state be their destruction?Read Pride and Prejudice to find out!This is a total and complete classic. There are over 2 million copies sold worldwide, hundreds of editions, and quite a few different audio recordings, not to mention TV and movie versions of this story.If you haven't actually read Pride and Prejudice you simply must! It's a beautiful, wonderful story full of lively characters with personality oozing from them. Mrs. Bennet is incredibly silly, a trait which seems to have rubbed off thoroughly on several of her daughters. But Jane and Elizabeth took far more after their father with much more sense. It's the story of how pride and prejudice can keep you from truly seeing another's character, and how opinions can change when someone is given a true chance.I highly recommend this book to everyone!5 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In all seriousness, this is a classic piece of English literature. Austen has amazing characters and a wonderful insight into the era. Every English speaker should read this book at some point in their lives."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This was my third or fourth reading of P&P--every; five or six years I have to go back to it to become reacquainted with Darcy, Lizzie, Lady Catherine and of course Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett. They all hold up beautifully: gloriously pompous, spectacularly arrogant, continually conniving and of course proud and prejudiced. There is so much to enjoy: language, wit, style and plot all converge to create, to my way of thinking, the best novel of the 19th century.Academicians all seem to prefer Emma, some folks like Sense and Sensibility more. But for me, P&P; is a cut above. Call it what you will--a comic novel, a novel of manners--there is such energy and joy in Austen's humor and wit. Never censorious, even the most pompous and disagreeable have a reason for being--not really harmful, they just move the plot along to its terrific denouement.If it has been awhile since you have read it, give it another read. Not only will you not be disappointed--I think you will be continually amazed that two hundred years later, Pride and Prejudice still works its magic."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! Personally I am very picky about books. And in order to get on my favorites list it has to be exeptional. And trust me this book definatly was!! The story is told from the point of Elizabeth, who is the second oldest daughter of the Bennet family. She shows awsome analytical skills, but as the story continues you realize that there has been a prejudice made in the story. And you also realize how you, yourself got outsmarted &amp; realize you made a huge prejudice too. This story is happening in a setting of old England. Whith balls, &amp; horse drawn carriges &amp; the ladies only wear dresses. It is a wonderful story of romance &amp; life in general. But always very entertaining. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I recently found out about Jane Austen and I love her. She Has a great writing style and knows what it takes to make a good book. The clashes between Darcy and Elizabeth are pricless and add zing to the book.I wish she had written a sequel though. Looking forward to reading her other books!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was originally written by Jane Austen in 1797, but it was not published until 16 years later. Jane Austen was born in 1775 in southwest England. She was born to a middle-class family, and her background greatly influenced her writing, which is evident in Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice is the story of Elizabeth Bennet and her family. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother, wants nothing more than for her five daughters to be married off to wealthy men as soon as possible. Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest daughters, like to flirt with the officers that are stationed in a nearby town. Mary is content to sit at home and read books. Jane, the oldest daughter, grows attached to Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, single man who recently moved to town. Elizabeth is a lively girl who always speaks what she feels. She begins to have a relationship with Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's extremely wealthy friend. She denies a marriage proposal twice in the book, much to her mother's dismay.The title Pride and Prejudice is an example of some of the issues Jane Austen talks about throughout the novel. Most of the characters in this book show signs of pride and prejudice in their behavior. Characters in all classes have prejudices against each other. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are prime examples of the pride and prejudice that occurs during the novel. They both have a tendency to judge harshly, even against each other. Their pride keeps them from expressing their true feelings.This was an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone looking to read a great classic. At first it seemed a little slow, but the book became more interesting as it went along and I truly enjoyed reading it. Though I don't normally enjoy such flowery language, it seemed to fit this story and the characters very well. Once I got used to the language of the book, I really got into it and it was fun to read. This book had interesting characters and a happy ending. I would definitely choose Pride and Prejudice as my favorite classic book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I just started reading Jane Austen, and already I'm a life time fan. At times it can be a bit difficult to understand, only because of the old english used in that time. Besides that it is a wonderful story. It has it all, characters you will love and love to hate. I could not put it down, and when I was finished it was bitter sweet. I felt as if I knew these characters personally, and in me ending this book was like ending our friendship. That may sound silly but ask anyone who loves Jane Austen and they would agree... All of her books are beautiful and if you are serious about reading you will love it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you haven't read the book Pride and Prejudice, it is one I would quickly recommend. I am at the moment reading classics and currently in the middle of reading most of Jane Austen's books. All her stories are delightful, but I can honestly say that this one is my favorite so far. It has a good and interesting storyline, as well as some very likable and some unlikable characters. You will quickly grow to like Elizabeth and her sister Jane, while their mother and younger sisters may annoy you to no end. All in all though it is a good book.For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is the tale of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who at the beginning of the book seem to be polar opposites, with the only thing in common being their great dislike for each other. The story also involves Elizabeth s sister Jane and Mr. Darcy s best friend Mr. Bingley, though Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are by far the main characters. Besides having quite a bit of witty dialogue, it has a few surprising turn of events that seem to make the book even more interesting. At first like Elizabeth, you too may greatly dislike Mr. Darcy, but as the book goes on he tends to grow on you, and by the end of the book, you'll be firmly in love with both of them.A good lesson can be pulled from the book as well. Elizabeth jumped to conclusions and let some people prejudice her against Mr. Darcy, while at the beginning of the book Mr. Darcy was as proud and arrogant as could be. Which can teach that we need to be careful on judging other people, because the way they act and what we may hear about them may be entirely false. It s also a good illustration on how pride can really mess up your relationships with others.If you're interested in reading this book then go for it, and don't let the fact that it s quite a long book deter you. Take the book in strides. I know I usually read very fast, but at first I read it rather slowly and I honestly didn't really enjoy it until I got to section two of the book. So even if at first you don't like it, try to keep reading, it gets better as you go on. It really does! Don t let the fact that it's a classic, written in the early 1800s bother you either, broaden your horizons a bit and learn to appreciate classic literature- it's truly a delight. After all, they had to become famous classics for a reason! So enjoy your turn at Pride and Prejudice, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Austen is undeniably important in the history of british culture and the central themes of this book fully justify her position, particularly the idea of female emancipation. That said great themes do not make interesting reads (e.g anything by Hegel). What makes this book is the writing, the prose is light and fast and you can't deny she has a sense of humour. Great book, makes it's points without bludgeoning you on the head."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you want to understand \\"relationships\\" better ( I would like to think we all do) and you have limited time, that you can use to read, say, \\"Pscychology Today\\" and watch Oprah and Dr. Phill -- or read Jane Austen's great work -- I say go with Jane. You will learn more and enjoy a classical reading experience in the process."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my mom's favorite book, which I have finally read this year after long years of her trying to get me to read it. Since I had to read Sense and Sensibility for my college course, I went on to reading all of Austen's novels. I am currently on my last one; Persuasions. Pride and Prejudice is the most popular of Austen's novel, I think, and for good reason. The characters are funny and interesting, the plot is original, and the social satire of England in Austen's time is hugely enjoyable. Elizabeth Bennet, Austen's own favorite character, is a headstrong, affectionate girl who represents the \`prejudice' of the title. And Fitzwilliam Darcy (aka Mr. Darcy, but I like his name O_O) is the \`pride' and is filthy rich, arrogant and rude. It goes without saying that I fell in love with him at first sight (or first mention of him in the story). Mr. Darcy, Mr. Knightly and that hero from Northanger Abbey are the cutest heroes of all Austen's novels!!! (=^-^=) &lt;Purrrrr)Anyhoo, enough drooling. (Mentally slaps face-get your act together--!!)The characters of the novel, though the most colorful and animated, are also the least believable. They are larger than life, great for the story, but I don't see them as flesh and blood people. Mrs.Bennet, with her obsession for marrying her daughters is perfectly understandable, but her happiness even when one girl elopes with a good-for-nothing, and the way she won't understand her husband's complete disapproval is just mind-boggling. The stupid characters are soooo stupid, Elizabeth's father- even though he is very likeable- is actually a pretty bad father concerning his duties towards his daughters and fear for their welfare, though all that changes near the end.In any case, I loved the book, it was funny and highly enjoyable. I'm glad I read it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a classic, and even those who are not. If you don't mind quaint-sounding passages and writing that is sometimes a bit confusing, try out Jane Austen. Once you get the hang of the language you can really enjoy this great book!! Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i am fourteen years old. i am an avid reader. i read pride and prejudice when i was in 8th grade. i have now read it atleast 4 times. my friend had let me borrow her book telling me it was good. i just started reading for the heck of it. i finished it in a week, which is hard considering how much work i usually have. but, anyways, the book is excellent. elizabeth is the perfect heroine for any novel. she is witty, intellingent, kind, and pretty. she is the perfect female. mr. darcy is a man. proud yet sweet in his own way. they are perfect. mrs. bennet is a character of her own. lydia is amusing. the whole book is great. it has humor, romance, wit, and a great plot, all in one book. it isn't overly lengthy like many other jane austen novels. it is has more brevity than other novels. it is certainly sweet. it allows you to relate to characters in your own way. maybe it could be the siblings, suitors, parents, loves, or anything. but it definitely worth it. if you haven't read it you must. if you have read it and don't own it, you have to buy it. i have already read it 4 times, and i can't get tired of it. it is just a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Though I have heard much praise of Jane Austen, this is the first time I've actually sat down and read one of her books. I was impressed. Though the plot would seem shallow now (it centers around marriages); then that was central to most women's hopes and desires. Besides the plot, the characters are amusing and Elizabeth is finely drawn. She is very self-confidant and will not allow others to look down on her for her ill upbringing. I don't believe men would enjoy this book, because the male figure is not drawn very realistically. I seriously doubt that all men thought or talked about were marriage and love. Walter Raleigh phrased it correctly by saying that &quot;Austen's men wouldn't be allowed in any club in England!&quot;. I didn't find it to be at all boring, rather, a page-turner to see how everything was going to turn out (though in the end it became predictable). The formal language is confusing at times, but provides a bit more color with it's detail. Though many parts of the book are obviously contrived, and I feel as if Austen is trying a little too hard to invoke emotion within me, in many ways the book is ahead of it's time, and for that, it is commendable to be certain."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"PNP was a delight to read. I'm not a fan of Jane Austen. I was in fact, dismissive of her work as being too boring and feminist (though I insist that the two are not necessarily related!) which led me to pick up this novel to see for myself. For a story so well told, it's surprisingly well paced with little attention to insignificant details and events. I would have though Jane Austen novels spent page after page describing beautiful English scenery but it's feelings and relationships that are the focus of PNP. I can now understand why it's hugely popular with women; it reads like a very sophisticated soap opera. There are handsome young men and ladies, a dodgy character or two to make things interesting, and romantic entanglements aplenty. I quite enjoyed following the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet and the enigmatic Darcy. Things change a lot in 200 years, but not when it comes to love.

She is spunky, speaks her mind and she is supportive of all of her sisters (which is very important when Lydia takes a turn for the worst). She is a great, admirable person in the story, which makes reading Pride and Prejudice so enjoyable. Jane Austin really knows how to write!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Regarded as one of the classic pieces of literature, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice does not disappoint. The novel chronicles the life of Elizabeth Bennett, a young woman pressured by 19th century standards to marry a man with favorable prospects. Elizabeth, however, is a quick witted and intelligent individual whose strong character is too valued by readers to face a miserable fate by marrying without love.The story begins with a certain Mr. Bingley and his friend who come to stay at a neighboring state of Netherfield. The eldest daughter, Jane, seems to be the daughter of his fancy, and after several balls and gatherings, the Bennets grow acquainted with Bingley, his two sisters, and his friend Mr. Darcy. Where Mr. Bingley plays the gentleman, charming, sociable, and pleasant, Mr. Darcy appears proud, introverted, and rude. Mr. Darcy's initial haughtiness towards Lizzy and his continual dismissal of those around him make him disagreeable at first, but through Austen's subtle description and dialogue of him, readers see him as a misunderstood character. The conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy at the balls or in Netherfield are where Austen's writing shines. Elizabeth's witty and charming dialogue challenges Darcy's cynicism and brutal honesty. The tension and anticipation Austen weaves merely through these interactions solidifies Darcy and Elizabeth's possible romantic relationship.As the novel progresses, Elizabeth is faced again with the prospect of marrying a wealthy man when Mr. Darcy proposes to her. Shocked, and above all, full of indignation upon hearing that he would marry her despite of his character, Elizabeth flatly refuses him. Darcy must then prove himself worthy of Elizabeth's attentions and Elizabeth must realize she was too quick to judge on first impressions.BY steffi castillo"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The manuscript for Jane Austen's best novel, originally titled First Impressions, was rejected and returned to the author. After some revisions, the novel was published as Pride and Prejudice. It has remained one of english literature's most popular novels. Pride and Prejudice did have its share of critics, perhaps one of the most notable of those critics was Charlotte Bronte, author of Jane Eyre, who called Austen's novel a disappointment. I wager many people would heartily disagree.Even people who have never read Pride and Prejudice have heard the names Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. The main protagonists of the novel have become trademarks of the British Regency era. In the novel, Lizzy and Mr Darcy appear to be the epitome of opposites. Upon their first encounter, Elizabeth Bennet believes herself perfectly aquainted with Mr Darcy's character and hopes she will never find herself in his miserable presence again. The phrase \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" aptly applies to Mr Darcy.Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest novels I have ever read. I love it not only for the romance (which is unparalleled), but also for its humor. The televised adaptations of this novel, some dating back to 1940, are excellent. The BBC version starring Colin Firth, and the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley are amazing. I don't think I could pick a favorite if my life depended on it. If I had to be stranded on an island with just one book, it would be Pride and Prejudice. If I could dream a fictional character to life, it would be Mr Darcy.

Once or twice I even caused my husband's brows to raise when I accidentally answered him in Olde English!Austen gives just enough detail (thankfully not enough to bore you), allows her main characters to be fallible, and whisks you off into a tale that is wonderfully wrapped up at the very end.

I have to admit, as and avid Austen fan, I'm a bit obsessed with this one. One cannot come upon better characters than the beautiful and witty (way to be a smart girl!) Elizabeth Bennet, and the tall, brooding, but devilishly handsome (not to mention exceptionally rich) Mr. Darcy. And of course, what better way to start off a romance than with two characters who hate eachother? And Austen does it complete justice--for we all know that they can't stay disgusted for long! However, did we ever expect Lizzy to actually refuse a man who has ten thousand pounds a year? Heck yes! And that's why we love her. I've never come across an author better able to create stunning characters than Miss Jane Austen herself. She's timeless. I highly recommend this book to every person who comes across it.

My reasoning came after my desire to have the setting be the end of the beautiful 18th Century - not the industrialized 19th. Jane Austen wrote the book in 1796, and it was published 17 years later, but it was the SAME book, and she naturally wrote about her time period. So I deducted 17 years from 1813, which equals 1796. (Note: An astute reviewer on Amazon also pinpointed the timeframe of 1794-1796 with a French action that Jane Austen mentioned, related to P&P.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you're looking for the Regency as memorialized by Harry Flashman, the regency of his father, with country house parties enlivened with chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours (as Flashy says), you've come to the wrong shop (as Flashy says).If you're looking for Sharpe roaring about Spain doing his Peninsular duty while beautiful and passionate ladies shrug off those gauzy empire gowns to reveal naught, knickers not having come in fashion, Miss Austen will give you the right about, and, if that fails, have the servants throw you out.The post-sixties restoration of Austen has I think its origin in a rejection by Western elites of the \\"spirit of the 1960s\\"...which was mostly chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours, a second Regency.It was Byronic, it was Blakean, it was mad, it was creative destruction, or destructive creation.

People must be fed, infants amused, servants chastised, houses kept up, and daughters married off.However, \\"creative destruction\\" versus Austen's faith in a serious reproduction of fortunes and daily life forgets and shuns another -tion.This is exploitation. The sensitive reader is appalled of course in a minor key by Mr. Collins' toadying of Lady Catherine. But what's unsaid is that the land on which Austen's heroes lived was stolen land.I would have killed Jane Bennet off in her first fever. In my version, John Paul Jones lands and sets the Bennet's house to the torch.

It's a wonderful classic with just the right amount of everything."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's masterpiece and it deservedly bears this title. Pride and Prejudice is the perfect love story. It starts out with the Bennet family. Mr. Bennet has five daughters of marriagable age, and a wife who is in a hurry to marry them off. When rich Mr. Bingley moves to town, bringing his even-richer friend Mr. Darcy with him, Mrs. Bennet plans to have two of her daughters married within a matter of months. Things don't go quite as planned, though, when Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the story, meets the prideful Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is unlike any other young woman of her time (except perhaps Jane Austen herself). Elizabeth is smart, sharp-tongued, and stubborn. When she meets Mr. Darcy she considers him to be the most disagreeable person she has ever met. But sometimes first impressions (which was fittingly the original title of the book) aren't always right, and the story unfolds from there.I was reluctant to read this book at first because I was afraid I wouldn't understand the language. It was a little difficult at first, but the more I read the more I got into the rhythm of the language and the more I understood. What inspired me to read the book was the new movie version starring Keira Knightley, which I loved. Watching the movie before I read the book made the book easier to understand. Not only did I love the story, but I loved the rich characters who brought life to musty, early 19th century England. Everyone in the story has more to their character than meets the eye, and that made all the characters more realistic. I also liked how the book was very decent. It was refreshing to read a book that didn't have any profanity or graphic scenes. For those who are easily bored, this may not be the book for you because it is rather lengthy and tends to drag in places. This book is probably more enjoyable for girls than for guys, but by no means does that make this novel a Harlequin Romance. All in all, I was very pleased with Pride and Prejudice, and I am glad I got over my own prejudice of old fashioned language enough to read this gem of a book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen has become of the most renown authors around the world for her witty and classic characters.

This book causes deep introspection of one's values; beliefs and mores."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This review was written by my class's literature circle group:Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, was a humorous tale of love and drama. It all starts when Mr. Bingley, a rich man moved to town. His friend, Mr. Darcy, moves in with him. When they attended a ball they meet Elizabeth Bennet, a very prejudice woman, and the story changed drastically. Will they ever set aside there differences? Will they ever fall in love...?In this book the characters vary a great deal in their personalities. Elizabeth Bennet is the very prejudice character. She often will voice her opinion but she normally won't show her true feelings when she likes someone. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is very proud; partly because he is rich and partly because he is very argumentative. He, like Elizabeth, doesn't show his true feelings toward someone. Jane Bennet is the character that is always in a good mood and tries to see the silver lining of any problem. Mr. Bingley is a rich man who is good natured and is a very welcoming person. He has very good manners and is very gentleman like. All of theses characters make this a very unique, well thought-out book. The author, Jane Austen, makes this story believable because things that happen in this story are just like real life.The plot of this story was definitely the love and drama of life. It shows the tough spots you can have in life. An example of the main theme was when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth he loves her and his affection is denied by the young girl. This book shows how life isn't perfect. There is definitely going to be rough patches along the way. That is why this book is so great, is because it isn't a fairy tale where every thing is perfect. That is why we believe this book is such a wonderful classic.The main style of Pride and Prejudice is old English. The author,Jane Austen, made this very clear early on. Some of the things that happen during this book, because of the style, leaves great pictures in your head. Jane keeps you interested in this book by making believable when she uses real life situations. That is what makes this book a one of a kind story.We rated the book Pride and Prejudice around 4 stars. The old English language in this book is harder to understand and must be fully understood. The many humorous parts in this book help make it a classic. Jane Austen helps you connect to the women's point of view in the 1800's. The author did very well on this book by showing how to love and be loved. We would recommend this book to anyone who can understand the style of Pride and Prejudice. This book is not only for the women, but wonderful for men, because in our book circle we have four boys and they each enjoyed this book as much as the girls did. This book is truly a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One of the only reason why I have read this book is because I had to pick a British Author to read about and then write a paper on. At first I didn't pick Jane Austin, I was unaware that she was British, then when my teacher passed out a list of authors I saw her name and automatically thought 'Pride and Prejudice' and I wanted to research Jane Austen. I first saw the movie when I was younger and I didn't understand it. Ever since then I have had an interest in it. When the newer movie came out with Keira Knightly came out, I wanted to go see it but ended up not going. I took this oppertunity to read the book. As I began to read this book, I had trouble understanding it. I am not good at the old English and by the end of the book, I still didn't fully understand it but I managed to get the full story. I did use Cliff Notes to help me understand each chapter because it didn't always make sense to me but after I read the summeries of each chapter I was able to understand the story.I found the story very romantic. I thought it unusual how Mr. Darcy acts in the beginning, by ignoring Elizabeth and saying rude comments about her then when she stays at the house for a couple of days because her sister is sick, he starts to like her. It is charming to read about a guy who like this girl so much that he'll do anything to get her. In my opinion that is one sign of true love. Elizabeth isn't too fond of Mr. Darcy because of what he said about her, but he goes on in the book to prove his love for her and in the end win her over. Mr. Darcy has to go throuhg Elizabeth liking Wickham, Mr. Collins proposing to her, being turned down by Elizabeth with his first marriage proposal, and the critism from other older women about not marrying Elizabeth. The book shows how much one guy can love a girl and make everything happen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One never gets tired of reading Pride and Prejudice. I cannot remember how many times I have read it, but each time I do I enjoy it more and more. Jane Austen's Books never cease to take you back to a time when people cared about good manners, and people were expected to behave politely. Of course, the emphasis placed on marrying based almost exclusively on material things shows us what a long way we have come in some respects, but how little we have changed in others. Ultimately, this story is one about the triumph of true love despite obstacles, and is timeless in that sense."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austin was a fascinating author! Pride And Prejudice is by far one of her best novels. Her characters are so enduring and spontaneous. Every reader will not be able to help him or herself from falling in love with Elizabeth and her down to earth behavior. This is a romantic comedy as I see it for I found myself laughing at the humor and humiliation through out the whole novel. You don't have to love romantic novels to want to read this book. Pride And Prejudice is filled with the \\"Battle of Sexes\\" and the \\"Battles of the Richer and the Poorer!\\" You can be 13 or you can be 35 and you will still love the novel ever more. It is a story that has stood proudly against the tests of time and will continue to astonish its readers for years to come!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Written in the early XVIII Century, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's most popular and loved novel - but not really her best. One of the first works she wrote, the novel is sometimes a little undercooked compared to her most complex works, like \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\", however, it is still a joy to read. In this book, she created her most famous romantic hero in Mr Darcy, an unforgettable stubborn who makes a perfect match to Lizzie Bennet. They were meant for each other.The only problem is that they haven't figured it our. On the other hand, any reader can realize it from the first moment the couple meet. In other words, we do know how the book ends, so why do so many people keep reading, and rereading this novel? One reason is that Austen has created some very believable characters - and also very endearing. That's because they are very human. Lizzie and Mr Darcy have very wrong first impressions of each other when they met and that's why it takes so long for accepting their mutual love.In this sense, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a story about overcoming our prides and our prejudices acquire in the first impression, and changing one's mind. Both Lizzie and Mr Darcy realize before the end of the story they were made for each other - but the problem is that their wrong impressions lead them to make choices that become barriers to their love. The path they will have to follow in order to find the fully accomplishment of their mutual feelings is the strongest plot in the novel.At the same time, the reader is fed with details about class and courtship from the time the book was written. In Jane Austen's work, her characters are sometimes like small figurines that represent the whole world - or at least England. And the writer does it with charm and style. Her books are a document of a time, tackling its fashions, moral and behavior.Peguin Classics is probably the best edition, since it has many notes and an extensive introduction, dealing not only with Austen's works in general, but also with an detailed essay on this book. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those books that will be read forever, and should be read from people in different time of their lives. We find different approaches, and understanding as we grow older."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love this book. I first read it when I was 16 and thought it was fantastic. Now, ten years later, it still remains my favorite book. I also love Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My wife is a Jane Austin fan so I gave this book to her for Christmas. We were teasing each other one night and as I lark I told her I would read it instead of the Star Wars and fantasy books that I usually read. So I actually did read it..... and strangely enough I loved it. This book is definitely geared towards women but there is more than enough substance that any man with any character would enjoy it as well.While you can tell that it was written nearly 200 years ago it's still easy to comprehend what's going on just like any modern day book. The characters are so rich and the twists and turns are so amazing that I just couldn't put it down. I really loved Elizabeth and her responses to people, especially to Lady Catherine near the end. It's amazing that Jane Austin was able to come up with all that witty dialogue. The conclusion for Elizabeth and Darcy and all the characters for that matter was just perfect. It's no wonder it's been a classic all these years.... it will be around for a long time still to come."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I am not one of Jane Austen's fans, not really. I love all kinds of books, but hers tend to bore me, with a glowing exception: \\"Pride and prejudice\\".I read \\"Pride and prejudice\\" (1813) more than 15 years ago, and I loved it immediately. I didn't have to read it for school, I just happened to buy it based on a whim. I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a \\"new\\" author. Thankfully, I found a book that was well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining, engaging enough to catch the attention of a 12-year-old and keep it without difficulty.The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England.The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, Jane (extremely beautiful and amiable) and the second, Elizabeth (witty but perhaps too proud).The dynamics of the town are changed when \\"a single man of large fortune\\", Mr. Bingley, arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy, and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how will that happen, given that Mr. Darcy is extremely conscious of his high social standing?Truth to be told, I liked the story, and the way in which Austen fleshed out the different characters through dialogues, instead of long winded descriptions. I also liked Elizabeth, and even though she was prone to mistakes, I preferred her to Jane, her extremely nice but too perfect sister. Moreover, I enjoyed reading about what sometimes happens to \\"hate at first sight\\" when time passes by, and how the main couple dealt with that, despite the fact that pride and prejudice made it difficult for them to really understand each other.Finally, I would like to highlight that I reread \\"Pride and prejudice\\" from time to time, and each time I am astonished by the amount of social criticism Jane Austen managed to include in what a first sight might have seemed an innocuous book. The author, who wrote \\"Pride and prejudice\\" in 1813, weaves in the story many themes that were relevant in 19th century England. Considerations of class are present throughout the book, and I think that the fact that Austen depicts so well their importance makes it easier for the modern reader to comprehend how constrictive they were. Austen also makes the attentive reader realize that the idea of marrying for love was a luxury very few women had then, as most had no other choice than to marry the first man that proposed. Elizabeth, who wanted to marry for love, was an exception rather than the rule.In my opinion, \\"Pride and prejudice\\" is the kind of book that never loses its charm, notwithstanding the age of the reader. All in all, I highly recommend this book as one that you will enjoy reading not only once, but many times.

I had even resorted to cliffs notes and such to help me through the book, even though I was reading it on my own accord. Now that I am older and far more wise, i read this book and love the romance, social placings and every moral connected to this book, but the male sex will turn up their noses to this amazing novel because it will be \\"too girly\\" for them. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic book. I have read it many times, and love it more and more with each reading.Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy's journey to find each other was brilliant. The witty dialogue and the entertaining characters make this book quick and so much fun to read.Jane Austen does a brilliant job of portraying the 19th centuty woman's plight in Pride and Prejudice through Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. It was a time where women were only expected to do one thing in their life: marry and marry well. An outspoken and intelligent woman was looked down upon. A woman was not supposed to think, only to please the men in her life.Jane Austen was many years ahead of her time in portraying the unjust social restraints that women had to endure. Her books were the medium that she chose to express her feelings about the social situation of women. Her writings foreshadowed and inspired succeeding generations of women as they fought to obtain equal rights."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One of my favorite books.

When marriage was the main course for unmarried ladies and how involved the entire family became in order to strive for that objective. I have wanted to read this work for a long time after becoming interested in 19th Century classics, I wasn't disappointed. Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one. The one character, Mr. Darcy was hard to understand his aloofness to the point of being extremely rude just didn't seem to fit at first meeting since later in the book he showed himself to be so totally compassionate and sensitive to Lizzie's trouble's with her younger sister's plight. All's well that end's well, loved the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Gotta love this classics. Can never go wrong with getting a book by Austen.

It is my favorite - the love story of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.

Anyway, this was to replace an old crumbling version of the book so I contacted the publisher (haven't heard back) and won't read anymore- too disappointing. I love books and cherish this one - so maybe it won't bug you as much. But to me it is absolutely unacceptable to copy a book incorrectly. Who knows how many other errors there are. Since the publisher hasn't responded I'm writing this review here to warn others to pick another version.EDIT - January 6, 2010 - The publisher just got back to me and they were phenomenal - they took the time to show me the proofs used from the original version, etc and they will be revising this in June, coming out with a corrected edition. They clearly love and care for books as much as I would hope - so do not hesitate to buy from this publisher."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"From time to time I read a critical opinion on Pride and Prejudice that, while acknowledging its excellence, wonders why Jane Austen could not in her genius provide some more gravitas. It's rather more observant and intelligent than your run-of-the-mill romance, to be sure, but a romance it is at bottom. No political savvy, no real attempt to face the role of women in Regency England, just a cute love story with an enjoyably satirical bent. Miss Jane herself seemed to agree with that assessment - she once called it \\"a little bit, two inches wide, of ivory\\". Decorative, but hardly important.Would someone please tell me what these people were reading? It certainly isn't the same book that I read. Or the one that thousands of people have fallen in love with and has produced at least four separate movie and television versions (which is a detail that allows me to give away certain plot points below, confident that most people already know them).It is indeed a very romantic love story, if by romance we mean the attempt of people to open themselves up and accept each other with their good and bad qualities - not only accept each other, but admire each other and want to be together just as they are. That process is difficult enough in this day and age, with the whole lot of us positively encouraged to be as frank as possible. Back in Miss Jane's day it seems to have been a good deal harder, what with the restrictions placed on people in the way of acceptable behavior and the disastrous consequences for breaking the social rules.If, however, we understand \\"romance\\" to mean the story of a woman who doesn't know her own mind, who has been so hurt that she can't stand the thought of love, who is too headstrong to allow anyone to tame her, and/or who eventually finds her way into the arms of a muscular hero type and melts on the spot (which is, after all, exactly what happens in plenty of perfectly good romance novels), that's not precisely what we have here. To be sure, the heroine of Pride and Prejudice does indeed begin the story entirely too headstrong to submit to marriage for its own sake, and she certainly finds her way into the arms of a man she previously despised (offstage, of course), but she doesn't exactly melt. It would be more accurate to say that she learns to think for herself. Whereas before she rejected her society's more foolish standards by reflex, she gradually comes to accept or reject what she's told by thinking it over first. And people think that Jane Austen didn't consider the place of women in her world? That there's no understanding of the big picture in Pride and Prejudice? Baloney.Now, Pride and Prejudice doesn't mention the big picture very often, although it's always present. The Bennett sisters get into trouble largely because a company of militia moves into a nearby village, and you and I both know that they're there to drill and train because at some point they will probably have to go fight against Napoleon Bonaparte, even though no one ever mentions his name. The sisters also have problems because they have no brothers, and know that a distant male relative will therefore inherit their house when their father dies. Rather than complain about these various disasters, though, the author shows us what their effects are upon the family in its daily life - the temptation to a group of young woman of handsome men in uniform hanging around, the scramble for advantageous marriages, and of course the question of whether one ought to seek a man one loves or a man with money if one can't have both. Great authors know, especially when it comes to two-inch pieces of ivory, that it's much more powerful to show the impact of great historical events than to talk about them. Jane Austen was a very great author.If she simply showed the workings of her society, though, she would have been simply a very good essayist, not a great author. Fortunately for us, she was also an extraordinary stylist, and she had an enormous gift for irony, very much on display in Pride and Prejudice right from the famous first sentence. That same twinkle remains in Miss Jane's eye right through the first sentence of the last chapter - \\"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\" Few authors would dare spend hundreds of pages setting up two weddings and then dismiss them both like that. It's positively delicious. With that kind of language, that sly inclusion of social criticism and such intriguing characters as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, you can call Pride and Prejudice a cute little romance if you want, but I'm warning you - it has hidden depths.Don't let that scare you, though. I told you, it's delicious. Dive in and enjoy.Benshlomo says, Grown-up readers deserve grown-up books about grown-ups sometimes."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

In fact, I finished it only for the sake of doing so. Since it was written by a woman and is told primarily from a woman's perspective, given its considerable popularity I can only assume that it is enjoyed more by women than by men.

Jane Austen uses impeccable, meticulous language full of long descriptions and explanations to give the reader insight into the minds of all the characters. The character development indicates the author's striking understanding of human nature and acute observation of human tendencies. The story provides an intricate plot involving the intertwining lives and feelings of a few characters and is based more on character development than on actual events. Although the book is complex and somewhat wordy, it is interesting and not all that difficult to read. The story shows how individual tendencies and personalities can get in the way of love and happiness. It also adeptly portrays inter-family relationships and the profound impact they can have. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in classic fiction, or who enjoys stories about people and their relationships with one another."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Wonderful!

Austen tells a wonderful story with side plots and interesting characters. You'll laugh at Mr. Collins' speeches and Mr. Bennet's way of looking at the world, get angry at Lady Catherine and her high handed ways, and dispair over Lydia's and Mrs. Bennet's silliness. A great book to curl up with."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is so great that if I didn't have school the next day I would read the book within a day.

If I could write well enough to do the book justice, I wouldn't be a programmer, but I can say that it satisfies my craving for &quot;romantic slop&quot; without being in the least sloppy, and it entertains with both low comedy and keen perception. But my favorite feature of the book is what I've heard described as the &quot;comic precision&quot; of the speech of the characters. It would take a week of polishing to utter a single such phrase, and the idea of a group of people bantering effortlessly in this manner fills me with delight. And to the high school kid that said it wasn't &quot;profound&quot; enough: I might have said the same thing 25 years ago, but now the books that I thought profound then seem obvious, tedious, and/or pompous.

She Writes so well, it is no wonder she is one of the best known authors of all time. Pride and Prejudice has got to be the best book I have ever read. I love Elizabeth Bennet, even more because I am also an Elizabeth myself and I feel I can relate very well to her in many ways. I just adore this book, I could hardly put it down, I finally had to stop reading when my butt started falling asleep. I is so exciting to find out who will marry who, and to see Mr. Darcy change his manners and Elizabeth change her mind. The elegance of the novel truly added to the characters and the setting.

The characters are so real- granted, some are a bit exaggerated, but that seems to be Austen's point...exaggerating the faults of society. The tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the subplots with the other characters draw together a fine novel.

The main character struggles to find her place in the world while dealing with social pressures and expectations. She falls in love with a man that is from a different rank, so the commentary on society ends up being wrapped in a love story.

I cannot see how this brilliant work could do anything but polarise opinion, there is no middle ground."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I always feel unworthy to review anything classical, or that even written a long time ago, for the simple fact it is not my place to critise the masters of the written work, or to even begin to understand what it was like to live in that era. Therefore, I am left without an option but to base a review on the level of my enjoyment, which is no reflection of how great the novel is written or what a classical piece of artistry it may be. I cannot give this novel 5 stars because I truely found my attentiion wavering, and I felt thankful that the book, which seemed drawn out to me, was closing to end. It is undoubtably a classic storyline, the 'prejudice' of Mr Darcy, the love developing between the unlikely, but I had seen the movie, and generally knew the storyline, but felt to fully apperciate this story, I must have read it. Maybe that contributed to the sense of boredom that came with this novel to a degree, particularly whilst it was winter (in the novel) and Mr Darcy and Jane's friend were out of town. I got sick of the letters in the book, and began to think about other things while reading them, increasing the time it took me to read it. Sadly, I think with a increased patience, I could have really liked this novel, but I just was thankful I had finished it. I am sorry to burst any 'Pride and Prejudice loving' bubbles, just telling it how I saw it. Then again, I don't really know that much about the classics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I liked this book, because it describes a situation that isn't weird.

The critical introductions for Pride and Prejudice in both World's Oxford Classics and Penguin, by Isobel Armstrong and Vivien Jones respectively, do follow this trend and tend to overlook the rigours of feminist criticism, as appeared in Marilyn Butler's Jane Austen and the War of Ideas. As a post-revolutionary romance, Pride and Prejudice provides a reflection of political events, but this theme is only secondary to the critique of class and gender conventions, and which is only indirectly related to political conditions.The use of silence, or the withholding of information, as a narrative strategie to produce the complications in the plot that go to make up the story, follows from this indirect association. Another important theme in the novel is the difference between public and private space. The exchanges of information (gossip, if you may) between the characters, particularly between Elizabeth and her relatives and friends, reveal a society in which individual worth and reputation is decided by rumour. When rumour is too strong, this is, shared by many, it may not be worth one's while to attempt to change it even if it is found to be false. It is for this reason that Wickham is allowed to fulfil his mania for elopement and achieve a suitable marriage.It is no surprise that a society so concerned with opinion should be given to prejudice, this is, the conversion of uninformed unfavourable opinion into a general judgement. Prejudice is by no means to be seen as a privilege of the aristocratic class. The community at Longbourn are seen to be equally capable of misjudging and misrepresenting character, in particular Mr Darcy's.Elizabeth's one aristocratic feature in her character is her general dissatisfaction with everything she sees. Her critical gaze links her to the aristocratic crew that she meets and alienates her from her surroundings. But if she wants to become one with Darcy's \\"family party\\" it is precisely this quality that she is to tame. By looking at Pemberley's grounds, she learns to express her own (sensuous) satisfaction with things as they are.Elizabeth's sensual gaze has been educated through the novel in a process of humiliation and denial. It is when she accepts the humbling experience of Charlotte's wedding and goes to visit the Collins' that she learns to appreciate the stately fixity of Rosings and starts to give the appropriate steps to becoming Darcy's consort.In the words of Isobel Armstrong in the Oxford World's Classics \\"Introduction\\": \\"it is through the uncomfortable limits of sexual signals that the novel indirectly explores a deep political question: when is it right to conceal or to reveal information; when isit right to speak out?\\" Nevertheless, this question is in the novel less political than gender and class- based.\\"Female elegance\\", according to Mr Collins, consists in \\"rejecting a man on the first application\\". Affectation is taken for granted among women, which poses a problem for women who, like Elizabeth, wish to decline a proposal in spite of their economic need. Twenty years had scarcely passed after the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women, and it is characteristic of the peculiar genius of Jane Austen that she had already produced the first post-feminist heroine, a woman capable of turning the issue of marriage into an unselfish and pleasurable conquest - unselfish, because by marrying Darcy Elizabeth establishes her family socially, and pleasurable, because in accepting the stately home of Pemberley she fully reconciles herself to the sensuousness of life -."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I thought I would have trouble getting into one of those \\"old, frilly romances.\\" Picking up this novel with great doubt, I delved into a beautiful love story with enough humor (especially directed at the character Mrs. Bennet) to keep my interest perked, as well as delicious twists and secrets among the characters that make this a stunning work of art.

Many events happen and after some of Elizibeth's lovers have been taken by other rich people who have power, she settles over a person called Mr. Darcy who has known their family for many years and seems to notice everything going around and gives an aura of some sort to other people.

She was not afraid to stand up for herself and overcame conventions, like walking through mud to see her sick sister, Jane!Perhaps I am not the most qualified to write a review of Jane Austen's work, but I know what I like.

I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring.

It is about how a great love overcomes the prejudices that two of the main characters have for each other. This novel, in my opinion was everlasting and boring. One would be able to predict the outcome of the novel from the beginning, but must spend endless hours of reading to finally see the plot unwind. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy have a great hate for each other in the beginning, but slowly, thorough out the novel, begin to bid farewell to their prejudices of each other and find a love for each other they never knew they could have. I did not enjoy reading this novel due to the fact that romance is not my favorite topic, especially when it is \\"old school\\" love. I did not appreciate this book in anyway and wish that I never chose to read it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who hates reading as much as I do and is disturbed at the fact that one would enjoy reading about love when they can just look out the window and see it happening right in front of them.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Please, this was an utterly unconvincing and boring novel. If it wa written today it would be internationally acclaimed for being a dummed down soap opera. Unfortunately, having been composed in, what, the 1830s, it has become a period drama style romance novel, where instead of foreplay, they have to bow and curtsy and everything. Althought this may appeal to worthless romantics, it will not perform well to the MTV generation. The movie starred Hugh Grant. Please........."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen, is a book about the life of a girl, Elizabeth Bennet. She has five sisters and lives with her mother and father in 18th century England. The story tells of her sisters' loves and marriages. Elizabeth's youngest sister gets married to a man of questionable character, who happens to be the friend of the man that Elizabeth herself loves, Mr. Darcy. Of course Elizabeth's love isn't that simple, since she first has to hate Mr. Darcy and then blames him for everything that her sister is going through. Jane, Elizabeth's oldest sister, falls in love with another of Darcy's friends. All the trouble that any of Elizabeth's not-quite-normal family has is blamed on Mr. Darcy.Basically, the whole book is about an 18th century girl whining about her upper middle class life. Of course, at the end, she gets exactly what she wants and everyone lives happily ever after. There is credit to be given to Jane Austen, since she wrote the book in an American household in the early 1800s, with no support from any of her family. She had to hide her writing under knitting or sewing whenever someone approached. She then had a friend publish the books she wrote, without telling her husband. Considering all that, the story really isn't that bad, but in general, if you were looking for a book by Jane Austen, Emma would be a better read. If you want a predictable love story, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i honestly dont understand why people love this book so much.. it may have a cute romance and a good plot but Austen took about five times as long to get her point across as she should have. i considered it work to read this book as it was required for school and didn't enjoy more than about 50 pages!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read the first 100 pages of Pride and Prejudice and then I bailed.I was taking some very heavy damage from several hardened missile silos down below me.

While there may be no accounting for taste or I'm just missing something, I'm not sure how anyone can enjoy reading this. It ultimately boils down to some sisters trying to marry (up, for the most part) in the world. I guess, if I try real hard, I can see some people imagining themselves in the scenes and enjoying the idea of living in the same town, wearing the same clothes, going to the same events, etc., but nothing really ever happens. It just goes on and on and on, only to lead this sister ending up with that guy, this sister ending up with that guy, etc."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I am so disappointed. Being a fan of classic literature I was looking forward to reading Pride & Prejudice. But what I got was moderately-well written chick lit. Think of Pride and Prejudice as the Bridgit Jones of the 18th Century.The story-line is predictable - you know how the whole novel is going to play out after the first couple of pages. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that there would be some little twist. Maybe Jane would end up with Darcy, or something a little more interesting. Unfortunately not.I honestly think Austen was writing a parody of women. The only concern of every female character in the book is to get married to a rich, well-to-do gentleman. Of course, some will argue that Elizabeth is different, but as she states herself, her interest in Darcy is only aroused when she sees what a wonderful estate he owns and considers that she may be the lady of it. Each of the female characters are shallow, self-centred (Jane excepted) and vacuous.On the positive side, some of the characters are interesting - Mr. Bennet is amusing, and Darcy started out being intriguing before turning into a school girl-like idiot.Perhaps, if you're a fan of straight-down-the-line, predictable romantic (semi comedic at times) novels then you might enjoy this. But don't expect to find a masterful tale, expertly told. Unfortunately that is what I was expecting (it being a \\"classic\\" and all) and I was totally disappointed. I really think this is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite reads!

What I can say is this: this is probably my all-time favorite book and seems to be the same for countless others.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are the two main protagonists and are surrounded by the ill-matched Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the fatuous Mr. Collins and his condescending patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the unscrupulous George Wickham. As the story unfolds, there are twists and turns in the plot as the reader keeps wanting Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to give up their own pride and prejudices about each other.A wonderful portrait of nineteenth century English society as well as an entertaining satire on Jane Austen's England. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Women in Regency England had few options in life except to marry well. They usually received little, if any, formal education, and their aim was to become \\"accomplished,\\" proficient in the social graces like music, needlework, sketching, whist and &quot;acceptable&quot; literature. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry in order to obtain financial security, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare. Ms. Austin writes, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" So there you have it. The men and women of the Regency period, nobility and emerging middle class alike, were very focused on the business of marriage.Our story opens in the small community of Longbourn, Hertfordshire. Word is out that the empty Netherfield Estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also.There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett, the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy, is much richer than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene, and looks down his nose at the local yokels. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She had been encouraged to use and develop her strong intellect since childhood, and she has become quite literate, and enjoys fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, with a sharp wit, much more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.The novel is filled with Ms. Austin's humor and delightful characters, including: George Wickham, a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennets, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, the quintessential aristocrat. Jane Austen weaves her plots and sub-plots with elegant prose and wit. Her clever use of irony, reveals her characters' charms and flaws. At one point, Mr. Darcy actually insists that Elizabeth is the proud one. It is pure pleasure to read her narrative and dialogue. And the characters are so believable that is difficult to remain disinterested in their lives and foibles.Mr Darcy learns more about Elizabeth with each chapter. He discovers her wit, intelligence and charm. She almost always spurns his awkward attempts to woo her. When she finally admits to herself how much she admires Darcy, he puts his foot in his mouth. He tries to tell Elizabeth of his deep feelings for her. However, he explains that his strong emotions go against his social background. He is prepared to marry someone of lower status, prepared to suffer hostility from his relations, and society in general, in order to be with her. All of this, sounds condescending to Elizabeth, and he infuriates her. It is as if Darcy is doing her a favor by loving her. He also tells her, honestly, that he has sabotaged the relationship between her sister Jane and his friend Bingley, because he fears Jane wants to marry Bungley for his money. So, once again, Elizabeth rejects him because of his pride.If the young couple would be able to understand and let go of their shallow pride and prejudice, a wonderful love and friendship could form and flourish. Elizabeth also exhibits her prejudice against her close friend, Charlotte, when she marries for convenience instead of love.Ms. Austin paints a vivid picture of various relationships, and the marriage mores of Regency England. She portrays the relationships of the senior Bennett's, of Charlotte and her new husband, and of young, frivolous Lydia Bennett who marries at fifteen. Ms. Austin stresses the necessity of compatibility in a marriage, since divorce is almost impossible. She demonstrates the various forms compatibility takes in her characters' relationships.This much beloved Jane Austin novel is one of my favorites. It reads like a dream and is difficult to put down. I can't recommend it highly enough. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"A novel I have read and re-read, and will continue to do so with great gusto - every time, falling hopefulessly in love with the characters all over again. It is by far, my favorite.Published in 1813 and premiered under the title First Impressions, Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stands as one of the most universally loved and admired novels of English literature. Not only is it a tale of rural romance, but also a witty and shrewdly observed satire of English country life.The story takes place in a remote Hertfordshire village, in George III's England. Mr. Bennett, a country squire of no great means, endeavors to marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of all this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter, Elizabeth Bennett and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy - two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to it's splendid conclusion."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Someone once said that a classic work of literature is one which everyone loves to be able to acknowledge having read but which no one actually enjoys reading. To be fair, there is some justification in this sentiment, as many classic novels are not readily accessable to readers not versed in various literary devices, symbolism, and so on. Fortunately, Pride and Prejudice does NOT fall into that category. It is a novel which has an interesting, captivating story that is easily accessible and humorous yet intelligent, insightful and extremely witty--in short, it's a novel which is a joy to read and re-read. It is also my favourite Austen novel.Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the novel, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy, a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters). Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and \\"first impressions\\"), however, does not care for the arrogant, proud, ill-mannered Mr. Darcy. It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark. I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away. Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for human nature is no different now than it ever was.Now to address the merits of this particular edition. (As reviews unfortunately are posted next to all editions, regardless of the one to which they may apply, the edition to which I refer is the hardcover Modern Library edition with the picture of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle on the cover). Generally, when one is looking to purchase a hardcover of one of the classics it is because one is looking for an edition that will be a more permanent addition to his or her library--one that looks nice and that can, perhaps, be passed on to future generations. Personally, my first choice for hardcovers of the classics are those published by the Folio Society. Having said that, this edition has a lot to recommend it. Most importantly, it is printed on acid-free paper, so it will last without the pages turning brown (unlike those nice-looking but disappointingly cheap-quality bargain hardcovers one usually finds on the sale table in one's local bookstore).Secondly, the print is beautifully crisp and clear. The print is not as large as one might hope for in a hardcover, but it is a vast improvement over the cheap \\"mass market\\" type paperbacks. Actually, I was surprised to find that it's only minimally smaller than my Easton Press edition, although the lines are further apart in the latter edition (which does make a bit of a difference).As if that's not enough to recommend this edition, it has the added benefit of being housed in a very attractive dust jacket which looks beautiful alongside the BBC/A&E; video collection--the definitive dramatisation of the novel and definitely a must-see. (This edition was initially released as a companion to the video collection).In conclusion, I give 5 stars for the story, and I have no hesitation in giving 5 stars for the Modern Library edition of the novel--it's a lovely edition. Considering the quality, it is very well priced--definitely good value for one's money. And for those who've steered clear of the classics for fear that they must necessarily be dull and incomprehensible, give this novel a try--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen is a literary genius. Her writing is full of delightful irony and witty dialogue. There are so many things that I love about this book that it is hard to know where to start. You have to love the characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Bennet they both have such a great sense of humor that they keep me laughing the whole way through. Elizabeth is such a feisty and intelligent character, and she is so full of energy and love of life that you cannot help but fall in love with her--I can definitely understand why Mr. Darcy falls in love with her despite her poor connections. I also surprisingly love the character of Mr. William Collins, who is so absurd and stupid that I cannot help but laugh myself silly over the things he does and says. His marriage proposal to Elizabeth is one of my most favorite events in the book. Another classic scene is Lady Catherine deBourgh's confrontation with Elizabeth over Mr. Darcy. She is another rather absurd character, and it is really great that Elizabeth has the tenacity to stand up for herself to that woman. There is only one thing in this book that really depresses me--the fate of Charlotte Lucas. As much as I love to laugh at Mr. Collins I would absolutely hate being married to him. I really feel sorry for Charlotte Lucas despite of the fact that she is able to arrange things so that she spends as little time in his company as possible. Also having to put up with Lady Catherine's constant lecturing and prying must also be hard. Despite this one semi-depressing aspect, this book really is as close to perfection as one can get. Another really good aspect of this book is the fact that in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I particularly love the opening sentence of this novel -- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"Indeed this opening sentence has been claimed as the greatest in English literature. It certainly sums up the central concerns of the main female characters and the tensions of the novel in extremely short order.I wish the same could be said of the closing chapters of the novel, as they are in my opinion one of its major flaws, they tend to drag. The other that always strikes me when I reread this novel is how superior and full of pride seems the novels heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. For indeed the novel is well titled, it is full of characters who display both pride and prejudice.When we first see Darcy, our hero, he is described as a \\"fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien.\\" We also hear he has \\"ten thousand a year\\" -- more than enough to raise the avarice of those that might wish to marry for money. Not enough, however, for Elizabeth who clashes with Darcy who answers his snobbish indifference to her with angry pride.From this point we have a novel that unfolds as Elizabeth and Darcy go through far reaching assessments of themselves and thier social pride and prejudices. Through this they also gain different views of each other, dragging the reader along.Elizabeth Bennet was Austen's favourite of her own heroine's, it is not hard to see why. She is sharp witted, intelligent, reasonable and a thoroughly modern woman. Her attitude to Mr Collins is a perfect example, while he praises her \\"modesty\\" and \\"economy\\" she denies these and at the same time spurns the then middle class ideal of a woman as submissive and domestic. When she tells Lady Catherine that she could certainly marry Darcy as \\"he is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter\\" she is rejecting her attitude of class through social and family connections.The novel has all of Austen's typical strengths, good characterization, compelling plot, a sharp wit and a wonderful eye for the detail of the life of English rural gentry. This novel and \\"Emma\\" compete as the favourite among readers (I'm an \\"Emma\\" fan myself) while it competes with \\"Mansfield Park:\\" among critics as her best work.When you're deciding which edition to buy I would recommend the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; edition for Vivien Jones' excellent introduction (which should be read after the novel unless you already know the entire plot from a previous read or a movie.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN.

Instead of using real quotation marks and apostrophes, they use inch marks and foot marks. It looks terrible. The margins are tiny and the text is packed onto every page, making the book only 253 long, hard to read pages (when properly set it should be at least 350 pages). Yes to Jane Austen, no to Tribeca Books, who basically are just ripping off a public domain book and typesetting it horribly. I had to walk into a bookstore and buy a different publisher's version of this book it was so annoying.

It took me about half the book just to get used to the language, but once I did, it was mildly enjoyable. The Bennet family drove me a little crazy, especially Mrs. Bennet and Lydia. But I loved the evolution of Lizzy's feelings for Darcy and the conclusion of the \\"happily ever after\\" marriages. I don't think I'm up for the challenge of Jane Austen again any time soon, but I'm glad I read this classic."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I've been a fan of Miss Austen from day one; and I firmly believe that she has a bright future ahead of her as a novelist.Don't buy all the \\"critics\\" commentary and praise regarding \\"Persuasion\\" and some of her other works as being superior to P&P.; That's pure contrary-ism at its worst.If you only read two of her books, then read this one twice. And then resolve to read more than two and check out her other novels, because they are great as well.The A&E; miniseries for P&P; is outstanding and comes highly recommended.No, I don't own stock in A&E; but I am over the age of 13... in a few weeks."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (originally titled \\"First Impressions\\") is a witty, smart, sharp, and insightful comedy/romance of the 18th century. The plot, centering around the playful, but sensible, Elizabeth Bennet and the grave, haughty Mr. Darcy is dellightful, as they both learn to overcome their pride, artificial sensibilites, prejudice against eachother, and the economic and social differences of the time. The language is not hard to understand, unless you are completely unnacustomed to good, well-written fiction. The dignified and often unwilling chemistry between the two protaganists is spellbinding, and the humour sharp and astute. The lesser characters provide much of the humour, from sheer stupidity, sarcasm, and blatant ignorance of what is sensible or dignified. This book is for any age (I read it at 12 years old and enjoyed it) and the enjoyment in it increases after several readings. I hightly recommend it as one of the most well-developed, well-written, and amusing books I have ever read.Also, if you like the book, I suggest buying or renting the A&B; mini-series, Pride and Pejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. If you read the book, watch the movie, and read the book again, it is even more enjoyable in my opinion than reading it without having watched the series."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a wonderful and timeless classic. But be forewarned that it is not a light read. Because it was written in another era, the dialogue takes some getting used to and I found myself re-reading sections to make sure that I fully understood the conversation. In any event, readers will fall in love with the characters, especially Lizzy and Jane, and delight in the many entertaining scenarios."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"What can I say about Pride and Prejudice that hasn't already been said? I read this when I was in junior high and didn't really like it. What was I thinking? It's been my all-time favorite novel for the past ten years or so. Its themes are the basis for hundreds of novels, movies and plays. Just think of how many stories you've read or seen that have the two main characters disliking each other, bickering and finally realizing that they love each other. If you just can't get enough of Pride and Prejudice, I suggest reading Pamela Aidan's series which tells the same story from Darcy's point of view."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The main plot of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen is about the relationships of people and the misperceptions we sometimes make on them. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet, an outspoken and somewhat modern girl for her time. She resides in the country with her family; her obsessive mother, quiet spoken father, and her four other sisters, her elder and loving Jane, sentimental Mary, and the two flirtatious Kitty and Lydia. When a prosperous man named Mr. Bingley arrives near the Bennets, Mrs. Bennet's first idea is that Jane shall marry Mr. Bingley. At the ball which he first makes his appearance, he brings along his friend Mr. Darcy, a man who is even richer than Mr. Bingley. It is soon discovered that Mr. Darcy has somewhat of a prideful air about him, and after saying an offensive statement about Elizabeth, she is prejudiced against him. The book goes on to show how Elizabeth and Darcy grow closer to each other, from her finding out about his past to him helping her family out when Lydia elopes with an officer in the military. The ending is probably no surprise to anyone, but the way the book progresses is so fascinating that you want to keep reading it to find out how everything will turn out.My personal thoughts on the book are thus; the characters are very involving, as is the plot. The choice of words and dialogue are a bit hard to comprehend, but that's how people spoke in the 18th century. The book is more enjoyable than the movie adaptations I've seen, although the A&E; version was great in my opinion. I think the way Jane Austen was able to capture each character's feelings and actions as she did in the book is so fascinating; mainly because she did that by observing all the people in the countryside she resided in. Personally, my favorite characters so far are Darcy and Elizabeth, the latter being a close second. I just feel I relate to both of them well in the way that I speak my mind and am misunderstood at times. I believe people interested in the behaviours and relationships of people during a certain time period would best like this book. Compared to books written today, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is totally different. It has small humour, an interesting plot with many sub-plots, and great characters where there is a type assured for anyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have read this famous Jane Austen's classic when I was a kid. I remembered I loved it so much and it remained as my favorite for a long time. This second time is even better! Can't say enough how I enjoyed reading it. The conversations between characters are so vivid, and the stoy flows so smoothly on. It was such a pleasant journey and I can't stop reading until I finished."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I must say I am not overly taken to reading romantic novels but I made an exception in this case.It was singularly refreshing to read about a female heroine, especially one as well developed as Elizabeth, written at a time when women were seen as nothing more than a means to wealth or progeny through the institution of marriage.We see in this novel the undercurrents of societal bias and the expectations put on women to marry in light of their limited role in society at the time. The novel comments on a wide variety of marital arrangements ranging from those of pure convenience to those based on love each with amusing consequences.In reading this one is rewarded with a wide variety of well developed characters written by an author who has an eerie command of the english language.I was so impressed with the attention to detail and psychological commentary ( hence the title pride and prejudice ) that I have resolved to read the other 5 novels written by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When I opened up my copy of Pride and Prejudice, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard from my friend that it was good, but I really didn't trust her taste. I am forever thankful to her.Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman in a middle class society, and her sisters must marry in order to be guaranteed a comfortable life. When Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy (two upper class men) come into town, Mrs. Bennet is determined to make the men fall in love with her daughters. This leads to conflict, etc (sorry I don't want to give away too much!)I think the main reason why I love this book is that it is difficult to put down. Austen's witty characters bring to Merrytown, never knowing what is going to happen next. This book was, \\"Impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know\\"(59)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The Bennet family has five unmarried daughters and when Charles Bingley, a rich bachelor, arrives at nearby Netherfield, Mrs. Bennet sets her sights on him as a prize catch. At a ball at Meryton everyone agrees they like the openhearted Mr. Bingley, who has developed an affection for the Bennet's oldest daughter, Jane, but they find his friend Fitzwilliam Darcy to be an arrogant and disdainful fellow. For their part, Mr. Darcy and Bingley's sisters are repelled by the Bennet's lower status and the embarrassing Mrs. Bennet. At the ball, Elizabeth Bennet, the second oldest daughter, overhears Darcy the man say she is not handsome enough to prove a temptation to him. However, when Jane becomes ill on a visit to Netherfield, Lizzy arrives to nurse her sister. Mr. Darcy is impressed with her lively mind, but cannot see himself falling in love with someone from a poorer family.The Bennet's estate at Longbourn is entailed to Mr. Collins, a clergyman who is Mr. Bennet's nearest male relative. In search of a bride, Collins arrives to consider the Bennet daughters while prattling on about his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Meanwhile, Elizabeth becomes infatuated with George Wickham, a handsome and charming militia officer, who has apparently suffered great personal wrong at the hands of Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth now considers Darcy to be not only proud, but cruel, and she is only to happy to have her own prejudice against him confirmed by Wickham. Bingley is removed to London, where his sisters and Darcy can keep him away from a heartbroken Jane and when Elizabeth refuses Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage, he is accepted by Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's best friend, who sees it as a calculated move of social advancement. Even more shocking, Elizabeth receives a second proposal from Mr. Darcy, who speaks disdainfully of her family and ruefully admits he has been unable to conquer his imprudent affection for her. Of course, Elizabeth rejects this insulting proposal as well. But then she begins to learns things that call Wickham's character into serious question, and have her rethinking her low opinion of Mr. Darcy.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is probably the most popular of Jane Austen's novels, with its emphasis on character and her comic look at the human condition where considerations of class are ultimately no match for true love and a temperant meeting of similar minds. Certainly we can point to more important novels in the history of Western Literature, but we would be hard pressed to find as important a novelist as Jane Austen, with her rejection of the tenets of Romanticism. Whereas the romantics celebrated the power of emotions, Austen's work embodies a strong belief in rational thinking, which finds no better embodiment than in the character of Elizabeth Bennet. The selection of this as the one Jane Austen novel to read if for some silly reason you decide only to read one in your entire life would be justified on that character more than the plot line."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This will certainly be a classic forever. In this book, she proves how well she can manage a story almost entirely on pure dialogue, for she isnt that very descriptive about her characters or the places they inhabit- she sticks to the basics- but wonderfully constructs all the dialogues throughout the story. Not only are the dialogues very well elaborated and the ones that keep you reading, but in them she very subtly gives a critique about society - reflecting, most probably, her own opinions about her own time and the way society worked. A good critique of her own era.And what to mention of the story itself!!! The dislike between Darcy and Elizabeth , Jane's impossible love for Bingley, Bingley's horrid sisters... she keeps you turning page after page!In any angle that you analyse it, you'll find it to be an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is the first novel of Jane Austen that I've read, and I began here because it is such an often quoted novel....and I wasn't disappointed. Granted, I am forty years old....most begin reading JA when they are girls, but I am happy to say that my advanced age did not spoil my enjoyment of the novel.Jane Austen is a superb storyteller with a wonderful sense of humor and insight into the social conventions of her era and the timeless and often humorous relations between men and women.By the time I finished the last page and saw Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy happily married, I sighed and then immediately picked up another Jane Austen novel to read....and intend to continue doing so until I've read all of her novels and hopefully the biography by Carol Shields.Other reviewers will tell you more about the plot....I want to convey the enjoyment you will recieve by reading Jane Austen. Yes there are happy endings....but there is also a lively social satire, conveyed through dialogue and narration, and writing that is beautifully crafted into plots that keep you turning the pages.

I had to force myself to read the first 6-7 chapters. By a quarter though the book, I found myself enjoying the writing and storyline much more. It was an enjoyable read and I liked the book very much, but I can't say I agree with others who say it's one of the greatest novels ever written.

Not many books come as close to perfection as this one does. Flawless prose, crackling wit, good drama, fully developed characters and a perfect plotline make this the best novel in the English language. You may argue with me if you wish, there is no other book that satisfies like this one. Jane Austen was a woman for all time and she was a genius in every sense of the word. She understood people. We are blessed to have with us this remarkable work. How did she pull it all off so beautifully?I do not write much because I think that you, dear reader, should get your hands on this one pronto and stop reading this brief, rather trite review that does not come anywhere close to revealing Ms. Austen's creativity. I have returned to Longbourne, Netherfield and Pemberley several times in my life and will continue to do so. If I have the good fortune to meet Ms. Austen in the after-life, I hope that she will give me an autograph. Or at the very least, give me a nod in my direction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I recently finished my 3rd reading of P&P;, and I cannot begin to say how much I loved it. This is one of those novels that you can read over and over and never get tired of because you find something new every time! One of the most satisfying experiences is just being able to go through it slowly and savor every little turn of phrase, though for me this was not possible until I had already read it and didn't have the urge to rush on and see how it ended. As for the novel itself, so many people have given a synopsis that it would be pointless for me to do so. All I will say is that if it sounds dull just from reading about it, I still would not give up because Austen is one of the few authors whose works are very difficult to give a plot summary for that does justice to the story.One other thing- I would also recommend this edition because it is one of the most pretty and elegant I have seen, yet still very affordable. A fan of Austen who would like to upgrade to a nicer edition of the novels should really consider Everyman's Library because there are few others that are more lovely or durable.In short, don't miss out on this wonderful reading experience!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most beautiful and well-written stories throughout the centuries. It isn't meant to be viewed as a serious tale, but is instead satirical, poking fun at the different conventions of society at the time. The heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, is well-developed and extremely likeable, as is her sister, Jane. Even Mr. Darcy, whom everyone dislikes in the beginning of the novel, is likeable in his somewhat clumsy love for Elizabeth. The struggle that Darcy and Elizabeth go through to finally admit their love is complex and draws the reader into the story even further. I must say that my favorite character is Mr. Bennet, because his off-the-wall humor had me laughing out loud several times throughout reading the book. I read this book when I was 13 and thought it was wonderful, and over the years it has become even better. This book is such a remarkable piece of literature that it only gets more interesting and more fruitful of a read the more times you actually pick the book up and read it. Jane Austen is a master of literature."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When I read this Jane Austen novel, I couldn't help falling in love with it. The romance, which I think plays the main part,was overwhelming, along with the beautiful charactirazation and the so well-thought plot. This novel contains everything it should contain to be a bestseller, and a besteller it is, even almost 200 years after it was written. This book is a true recommendation for everyone who likes his or her books well-written and full of humor, love, intrigues, social developments and such lively and realistic characters. Somehing that struck me, was the fact that Elizabeth is such an quick-witted girl that is so modern for her time: she wants to marry for love, (which girl wouldn't want that?! it really is just like a fairy-tale) and she has got a will of her own. She doesn't like to be toyed with and she has got her feminin pride that makes her so strong. Should you be considering reading this book, don't hesitate and just grab it, and you will soon see: it grabs you!&lt;BR"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; Jane Austen creates an entire universe out of the circumscribed world of genteel British society. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family, consisting of a nervous and silly mother, her indolent and sarcastic husband, and their five daughters. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her daughters to marry wealthy men, especially since Mr. Bennet's property will go to a male cousin, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.Soon, a likely marriage prospect appears in the person of Mr. Bingley, who rents a nearby home in Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet hounds her husband to call on Mr. Bingley immediately so that the Bennets can make his acquaintance. To Mrs. Bennet's delight, Mr. Bingley proves to be a perfectly amiable and wealthy gentleman. However, his close friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is quite the opposite of Bingley. Darcy is a man whose arrogance and cold demeanor make him immediately unpopular with the Bennets, especially with Elizabeth Bennet, one of the daughters whom he particularly insults.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; deals with the preconceived notions that people have about one another and how these ideas wreak havoc with relationships. Austen also casts her astute eye on the social mores of the time which made both men and women slaves to convention. Marriage was not just a pleasant state for a woman. It was a necessity, especially if her family lacked the means to support her for the rest of her life.One of the most noteworthy aspects of this novel is Austen's lively cast of characters. Elizabeth Bennet is surely one of the most vivacious, witty, and entrancing heroines in British fiction, and she meets her match in the dashing, proud, and inscrutable Mr. Darcy. Austen's portraits of the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins and his overbearing and opinionated patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are hilarious.Austen's novel is a high-class soap opera in many respects, with a myriad of romantic entanglements and much intrigue to keep the reader engrossed. However, it is much more than that. It is a masterful tale of how people deceive themselves and the traps that they fall into when they are weak-minded and easily manipulated by others. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is also a beautiful and romantic story of how men and women find their soul mates in spite of seemingly insurmountable obstacles."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If a classic is boring, then this is not a classic. If a drawing-room comedy is stiff and trivial, then this is not a drawing-room comedy. This is quite simply one of the loveliest, wittiest, most utterly _wise_ novels ever written about human relationships. Every word sparkles. The dialogue fairly dances. And Austen does this without any of the things that we often assume make for an exciting novel. The most suspenseful question that arises is whether a certain two characters in the novel have gone to Scotland or to London (this is suspenseful for reasons having to do with 18th-century English marriage laws and social mores). And this event, certainly the most sensational in the book, is really only important because it helps the two central characters make up their minds about each other. Austen's world is a world in which every detail really counts--in which the slightest look or the most insignificant word can have earth-shaking meaning. And the result of this, as of all great literature, is to send us back into our own worlds with the renewed conviction that it all really does matter. In that sense, Austen's &quot;realistic&quot; fiction is a lot like good fantasy, such as Lord of the Rings. By heightening certain aspects of our experience, Austen gives new life to the &quot;commonplace&quot; world we live in. This is a book that makes you feel alive, and glad of it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I found Pride and Prejudice an engrossing and well written novel. The book gives modern readers insight into the Victorian society, morality, and etiquette. The novel is made up of fascinating, well-developed three-dimensional characters. I loved Darcy and Elizabeth; although both were flawed people, they also had an essential humanity and goodness to them that made me root for them to get together. I thought the way Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy evolved was very realistic. I admired Darcy's love for his sister, and his strength, while finding myself frustrated by his arrogance and aloofness. I thought Elizabeth was a heroine modern women could relate to - she had fire, confidence and forthrightness.I also enjoyed the complex relationships between the various characters, be it Jane and Elizabeth, Elizabeth and Mr. Bennett, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. What I liked was that even the characters we weren't meant to like, such as Lady Catherine, were not one-dimensional (this isn't the case in Mansfield Park). I was just as interested in finding out what would happen to Lydia and Jane as I was in the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. The one complaint I have here is that I wish that Darcy and Elizabeth had gotten closer sooner, so that the conflict with Lady Catherine could have been a bigger part of the novel. There were events that I wish had occurred earlier so that more time could have been spent on them - the novel got off to a slow start.That said, overall this novel has much better pacing than other classic literature I have read (notably Mansfield Park). The author does provide a great deal of detail and description, but she is such a good writer, and the prose is so captivating, that I didn't mind at all. The dialogue is superb. The novel had a lot of charming, funny moments. The uses of satire and irony were exceedingly well done; Austen is the master of this sort of comedy of manners."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my all-time favorite book, and believe me, I've read MANY novels. Jane Austen has excellently captured human nature here, and all of her characters reflect the environment they grew up in which was determined by the social classes of the time period.The main conflict of the book is based on the interactions between these social classes, which is reflected by the title. The prejudice and pride of BOTH the upper and middle class is what the story revolves around, but it isn't the action and intrigue that mark this book, it is the characters that make this &quot;Timeless Masterpiece.&quot;Elizabeth Bennet, whose liveliness and quick wit have often attracted readers, is the main character from the middle class. Mr. Darcy is her counterpart from the upper class. These two drive the book, adding humor and depth with every word.Everyone over the age of 12, including BOTH males and females, should read this book. This isn't a silly romance novel for young girls, it is a classic masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I love this book. It has so many levels. On the surface, it's a book about 5 silly airheads who chase men &amp; go to parties. They obsess over all the single men in town &amp; how much money the men have. On a deeper level, you see that women in that time period had no rights. They couldn't even own their own home. Their very existance depended upon finding a suitable husband. Of course they were interested in catching a rich man!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It doesn't get much better than Pride &amp; Prejudice, people! A smart, witty, and sarcastic heroine like Elizabeth Bennet, a man like *drool* Mr. Darcy...and the burning question: can they overcome their first impressions of each other? My absolute favorite book!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen is one of the great masters of the English language, and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is her great masterpiece, a sharp and witty comedy of manners played out in early 19th Century English society, a world in which men held virtually all the power and women were required to negotiate mine-fields of social status, respectability, wealth, love, and sex in order to marry both to their own liking and to the advantage of their family. And such is particularly the case of the Bennetts, a family of daughters whose father's estate is entailed to a distant relative, for upon Mr. Bennett's death they will lose home, land, income, everything. But are the Bennett daughters up to playing a winning hand in this high-stakes matrimonial game without forfeiting their own personal integrity?This battle of the sexes is largely seen through the eyes of second daughter Elizabeth, who possesses a razor-sharp wit and rich sense of humor--and who finds herself hindered by her own addlepated mother, her sister Jane's hopeless love for the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and her sister Lydia's penchant for scandal... not to mention the high-born, formidable, and outrageously proud Mr. Darcy, who seems determined to trump her every card. But the game of love proves more surprising than either Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy can imagine, and sometimes a seemingly weak hand proves a winning one when all cards are on the table.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is simply one of the funniest novels ever written, peopled with memorable characters brought vividly to life as they both succeed and fail at the game of life according to the manners of their era. It is a novel to which I return again and again, enjoying Austen's brillant talent. I have little respect for people who describe it as dull, slow, out of date, for as long as men and women live and fall in love it will never be out of style, always be meaningful, and always be funny. A masterpiece of wit and style; a timeless novel for the ages."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One of the versions listed is published by \\"General Books LLC.\\" Another reader complained about the tiny and almost unreadable font - you probably bought the version published by General Books LLC - and here's the reason.General Books LLC is an imprint of VDM Publishing, (google them and take a look at the Wikipedia article on them) and they specialise in publishing books that are free of copyright without doing any editing or quality control.

Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I am really enjoying this book. I won't comment on it from a literary sense. Everyone has already exhausted that area. However, I will say that the kindle version is great except that the text does not always translate in the proper fonts. Every so often the author has emphazied a word and it shows in the Kindle as all upper case. I supposed it was supposed to be italics. A similar situation occurred in the Complete Sherlock Holmes. Certain symbols are not translated properly. The intent was still obvious. I was very reluctant to buy a Kindle at first, but I have used up all the available space in my home for paper books. The Kindle is a joy to read though and it goes very fast."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a most amusing and entertaining love story which has ever written that shows human limitations at its best. The title of the book is indeed well-named for pride and prejudice are the essence of the whole book. Pride of the hero Mr. Darcy and prejudice of the heroine Elizabeth Bennet combined to reveal what kind of character a person can be, regardless of his/her financial situation and social stature.British society under the Regency rule was exemplified and made explicit to generations of readers. The author was telling us about the everyday life of people living in rural England after the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain was on its way to become a maritime power in the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution of Charles Dickens' days had not yet arrived to upset the power of the English nobility and the landed gentry, so much so that gentlemen like Mr. Darcy, a landowner of vast estates, could live a life of luxury and self-importance, and could easily look down on the less fortunate who had to work for a living.Reading Jane Austen's work is always a pleasure. It puts me in with the characters, as if I were an unseen and unknown observer in the room! In fact, I feel that I am living in the early 1800s, doing the same things that those characters are doing, and feeling just as they are feeling."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have always loved the style and social politics of the Regency period (the time of Jane Austen.) But when I read &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in 7th grade I found the first few chapters lifeless, dull and hard to read. Two years later I was encouraged by a friend to give &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; a try. I did and have since become a complete Janeite. I am now able to peruse joyfully through &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with a new understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen. The reason? &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is fresh, witty and is a great introduction to Jane Austen's writing style without the formality of some of her other novels (unlike S&amp;S and Persuasion Austen does not give us a 10 page history of each family and their fortune.) If you have never read Jane Austen or have read her other novels and found them boring, read Pride and Prejudice. The characters, and the situations Austen presents to them, are hysterical and reveal a lot about Regency society and morality. This book perfectly compliments a great writer like Jane Austen and is essential to every reader's library. The Penguin Edition of the book is stellar and I personally recommend it not only for the in-depth and indispensable footnotes, but also for the cover that is non-suggestive of any of the characters' appearances. In summary &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a great book for beginner Austen readers and seasoned fans, and Penguin Classics is a great edition for fully enjoying and understanding the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Classics come to life under good audio treatment, as Irene Sutcliffe demonstrates by reading Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with passion and style. This is the best known of her novels, and some of Austen's less accessible descriptions spring to life under the voice of Irene Sutcliffe, who has worked extensively n the theatre."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a nice copy of the book. It has a built in ribbon bookmark and nice line drawing illustrations. It is about 3 inches wide and 5 inches long (smaller than a standard book).

I love being able to take this with me where ever I go with out carrying the book with me."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride And Prejudice, Jane Austen(This review was originally published at The Brazen Broads' Book Bash)A Timeless Classic...For anyone who has never read Pride And Prejudice, this Broad would urge you to crack the cover! If you enjoy a smart romance, sharp wit, and the humor of peering into the character flaws of those about you, you won't be disappointed. Austen wrote my favorite heroine of all time within the pages of this novel. Elizabeth Bennet absolutely steals the show!The Bennet sisters, under the hand of an often dramatic and obnoxiously silly mother and a father, who abounds with dry humor but mostly abdicates his role, face life, society, and courtship in the English countryside. This is no easy task, for the young women have no considerable wealth or lofty position to aid them in a time when that was quite important.Pride And Prejudice chronicles the romantic fiascoes of the Bennet girls. Jane, the eldest sister, wins the love of the young and well-to-do Mr. Bingley, although certainly not without trial and tribulation. But jealousy and interference leave her happiness in serious doubt. Lydia, the middle child, selfish and flighty, refuses to comply with propriety, and her actions threaten the chances of all the sisters. The two youngest, Mary and Kitty, while affected by the goings-on, don't figure as prominently in the story. This leaves Elizabeth, the novel's main female character, to entertain with her bold wit and keen observations during her own adventures in life and love.When Elizabeth Bennet first encounters Mr. Darcy, she at once understands him to be prideful and ill-mannered, founding her long lasting prejudice. Adding to her less than friendly impressions are the accusations against Mr. Darcy by the family's newest acquaintance, Mr. Wickham. Circumstances, however, continue to throw the two together, and the time spent coming to know Elizabeth begins to alter Mr. Darcy's opinions. His change in behavior leaves much to be desired, and it isn't until after Elizabeth's scathing face-to-face assessment of Mr. Darcy's character flaws that he confronts his pride whole-heartedly, and Elizabeth faces her prejudice.Strength of character, probing dialogue, and honest reflection turn their opinions of one another into something altogether different as Elizabeth and Darcy, each in their own way, dare to break with convention and hope in love.After reading Austen's original again, I am more than eager to dive into the first sequel on my list! Reading the varied takes on what the Darcy's love affair may have looked like once they married intrigues me to no end.~Moira"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I'm slightly embarrassed to say that it took me this long to get around to reading Pride & Prejudice. I don't like romance novels and I'm generally wary of anything that is too popular. And yet here I am, giving P&P one of the few 5-star ratings I've ever bestowed. Jane Austen is, without a doubt, among the wittiest, cleverest, most talented authors I've ever read. I laughed out loud repeatedly, thoroughly enjoyed many of the characters (the protagonists were refreshingly frank and the stupid ones were delightfully annoying), and don't you tell anyone but I had tears in my eyes when Darcy and Elizabeth finally sorted things out. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, and I imagine that I'll be delving into Austen's other books in short order."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing classic.

It is brilliantly written plot-wise and character-wise, set in the time of propriety and manners in Regency England (early 1800s). Jane Austen at her bestSynopsis: (WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!)The novel opens with the arrival of a wealthy young gentleman, Mr. Charles Bingley, at Netherfield Park, accompanied by his rather haughty sisters and friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Seeing the wealthy newcomers, the Bennet family of the nearby village of Longbourn, is in great excitement. The silly and impractical Mrs. Bennet thereupon aims to marry off at least one of her five daughters: Jane (the eldest and the kindest), Elizabeth (the most sensible), Mary (the most studious), Kitty (the simple-minded), and Lydia (the silliest). Almost immediately, the amiable Mr. Bingley is well-liked by the community, while his friend, Mr. Darcy, appears just the opposite. From the start, since he rejected her at a ball, Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darcy is to be arrogant, proud, and conceited. Her dislike of him is only heightened when she hears an account of Mr. Darcy, as ruthless and cold-hearted, from a handsome and sociable young officer, Mr. George Wickham. Meanwhile, despite Mrs. Bennet's embarrassing meddling, Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet begin to develop an attachment, and though unawares, Elizabeth's liveliness and intelligence grows on Mr. Darcy, who unconsciously falls for her - despite all his objections to her inferior birth status and her ridiculous mother and younger sisters. As Elizabeth, the main protagonist, eventually discovers, one of her two admirers - Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy - has all the appearance of goodness, while the other has all the genuine goodness."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The content of this book receives five stars with ease.

It did take a little while to get used to her voice, but I am enjoying the tale. You can never go wrong with Jane Austen. She is funny, witty and has a keen eye into human nature. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have, to this point in my life, successfully avoided reading any Jane Austen books, supposing them to be superfluous and archaic. I really only read this book because I wanted the foundation and familiarity with the story prior to reading the adaptation entitled ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' by Seth Grahame-Smith. Because who can pass up a good zombie book, after all?I started this book begrudgingly but was soon intrigued by the language. I amused myself by reading aloud a paragraph of flowery language to my husband and then paraphrasing it in a sentence. I proclaimed and bemoaned the inefficiency of the writing style but persevered and slogged on. About halfway through the book, I surprised myself by really wanting to know what happened next. And here I sit, 1am in the morning, having to finish the book tonight with the absolute stubbornness of having to know Elizabeth's disposition!Hands down, I loved this book. Shame on me and my ignorance for Ms. Austen's talent. I hope to read many more of her books.

Not a pure romance however, Austen offers so much more to her readers in P&P: realistic relationships, interesting characters, comical situations and compelling subplots force readers to think in many directions and entertain far and beyond boy loves girl. This particular copy of P&P would make a perfect little gift for anyone just introduced to the story or Austen through this latest movie version (or as a companion to the movie) and is a wonderful beginning to immersing oneself in the English language of 200 years ago. To be certain, this sort of old classic literature may be a challenge to peruse at first, but rest assured that it becomes easier to assimilate the more you read it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of reviews of this book, I somehow feel it important to share my thoughts. This is one of my favorite books of all time, though I came to it very late in life. During my 5th reading of it, I started musing over why this book had such an incredible impact on me. I finally figured it out. This book and almost of all Austen's other brilliant novels speak to me about the life-altering possibilities of love. This reality was completely integral to the lives of women in the 18th and 19th century. If you were a woman, your fate -- whether you became a wife, a mother, a mistress of a fine home or stayed at home the rest of your days taking care of your parents -- was completely determined by a man choosing you. But this idea, even in our times in which women actually have options and power to change their lives, is highly compelling. These books -- these characters -- capture the feeling that everyone who has every fallen in love has that in one instant their lives, if joined with another, will be changed forever and exponentially and in ways they cannot even imagine. It is that feeling of possibility that Jane Austen has put into words, and why, I believe, her books are still as influencial as they were 2 hundred years ago."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I had heard good thungs about this book from my school friends and heard great praise from my librarian the day I checked it out. I had always wanted to read a Jane Austen novel and this was my first. I had completley fell in love with it when I was stuck inside, at home, on three snowy days and could not put it down. I immediately began seeking other Austen books, but this one stuck in my mind. I have read this, Persuasion, Lady Susan, and have seen the Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion movies. I have yet to see Pride and Prejidice, but I am looking forward to it.Pride and Prejudice's main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is strong-willed, intelligent, and witty. She makes snap judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudices. She is the second youngest of five sisters and no brothers and is the favorite of her father.The eldest, virtuous Jane, is her favorite who rarely sees the wrong in anybody. Jane is considered the handsomest sister. The middle child, Mary, is principled and only lives to improve her accomplishments. The next is timid Catherine, or Kitty, who is followed by exasperating Lydia. Lydia is silly and, if you have ever read Persuasion, like the Musgroves. She is cheerful and a flirt going after the soldiers' and fancying herself always in love. Her mother is hopelessly silly and her father is sardonic. They meet this man, Mr. Charles Bingley, who is considered very rich that just moved into the neighborhood. He is a perfectly wonderful man who fell in love with a Bennet. His friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, his name even convinces us that he possesses arrogant pride, is even more rich than Mr. Bingley but is disliked by the shole neighborhood.\\"It is a truth universally acknowlegded that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife\\", the first sentance of the book, states a theme of the novel. Marraige is talked of often in the book. Elizabeth meets both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy and judges their characters. One she likes and one she doesn't. You can probably guess. But is her first immpression of Mr. Darcy wrong?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you don't fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet and her existentially endearing family, well, your heart must be made of stone.Jane Austen's best heroine is at the center of this romance that is so strong and true that it can be mined by the film industry - with good, better and best adaptations - and still manage to stand on its own pinnacle of imaginative wonder.Pay attention to Elizabeth's words--I feel that she is most often voicing the thoughts of Jane Austen. There are many occasions where Elizabeth's character shines through. She is a complicated person, and did you notice, at the center, she combines aspects of all the other Bennet sisters in herself. It is as if Jane said, \\"Let us show in the sisters, what having one or the other trait, without a balance, might look like.\\"Elizabeth is multi-layerd.What can we say of Mr. Darcy except that he is Jane Austen's ideal man. He may not be your ideal man, but there are a lot of other men with other traits to choose from in the book, so plenty of variety, there. And, we admit, Darcy comes close to disappointing at several key moments in the narrative; he is allowed to keep his own counsel to such a degree that this fine quality almost becomes his personal tragedy. Isn't it funny how our best qualities can sometimes do that to us?Also, pay attention to Elizabeth's relationship with Mr. Bennet. Parents are not supposed to have favorites, are they? Yet, in a household of all daughters, you find that the two of them have a bond of love and sympathy that is endearing even when Mr. Bennet seems to be kidding, unobservant or flippant. He comes close to being the omniscient observer, yet, like Darcy, keeps his own counsel.Mmmm. Perhaps this has something to do with how Elizabeth is able to find and appreciate in Darcy qualities she has already admired in someone else...?Darcy is so well off that the reader is tempted to wonder whether Elizabeth has the qualities worthy of a Mr. Darcy. This may be why we have the interchanges with Lady Catherine de Bourgh. There is strength of character and nobility in both women, and we get an idea that in her youth, Lady Catherine may have been much like Elizabeth. We might even push the matter to suggest that in her old age, Elizabeth could possibly become as imposing as Lady Catherine. Or perhaps not, since there is so much of love and tenderness in her.I have tried to say all of this without giving any of the fabulous twists and turns of the plot away.Replete with bon mots, tender and surprising scenes, and characters that even when they are at their worst, are deeply loved by their creator - and us - this book deserves every paean of praise that comes its way.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have read \\"pride and Prejudic\\" by Jane Austen a total of 5 times now, and it just gets better every time. This book is definately a classic. The characters are witty, and the story is timeless. \\"Pride and Prujudice\\" is an interesting love story involving a very proud man named Mr. Darcy, and stubborn beauty named Elizabeth Bennet. Together they create a conflict so strong that at one point, neither wants anything to do with the other. But their love for each other is undeniable, once they both get over their pride, and yes, prejudice against one another. They arent the only love story in this classic novel, however. Also fighting for love is Elizabeth's gentle, kindly older sister Jane. She has fallen for the very rich, handsome Mr. Bingly, and it is as if he is under a spell of her charm. Though his sisters try to tear them apart, they somehow find each other again before its too late. Still the question of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's love for each other remains, will they ever give way to their love for each other? Or will pride and strong will keep them from eternal happiness? Only time(and lots of page turning) will tell. This is one of few books that has kept my interrest and i hope it can keep yours too."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. After getting a list of books to read from my teacher, my dad said this would be the perfect one for me. I was slow to begin, but once I got started, I was quickly consumed. It had everything a great story should have. This book reminded me of a Danielle Steal novel, but written much better, and surely not a beach read. It took time and effort to complete, but in the end, the novel was worth the hard work. This book taught me a lot about myself. Even more than that, a lot about who I want to be. When I finished reading and discussed this book with my dad, I told him that I wanted to be Elizabeth Bennet. She was a great protagonist to watch grow throughout the novel. She was a very round character, who was revealed in pieces, not showing the true whole self until the end. It was amazing for me to see how much I could relate to a story written so many years ago. I feel now like the times have truly not change much. Love is still love, loss is still loss, and friends are still friends. This novel was a true untimely classic. Although this story is about love, it is not all good times. It takes Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy a long time before they become lovers. There are twists, turns, broken hearts, and shy wit along the way. This book was one of the first that made me both laugh and cry. I came out of reading this book with a slightly different outlook on life as I had before I began. At some points I wanted to just jump into the novel, rearrange some things, and come back out. It was so important to me for everyone in the novel to be happy, and everything to work out as I had it planned. The literary value of this work in unbelievable. As young as I am, and even though I have not read that many classics yet, I can tell you that this one is worth it. My favorite parts of the novel were the descriptions of the beautiful rolling hills, the wonderfully decorated rooms, and the people. Austen must have had an amazing picture in her head when creating this work! She truly moved me! This literary work was enchanting. As great as the novel was, there were some downsides you should know before picking it up. Although beautiful, the language was difficult to understand sometimes, for me at least. It was spoken in strong 18th century English, and not always easy to comprehend. This novel takes you winding through the souls of two people, both filled with pride and prejudices, hence the novels title. The long journey to love, is far, and difficult, but in the end true love prevails."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Do not waste your money on this! I thought i would get a book that looks like the original 1813 edition (ie., a scanned version of an original 1813 edition) but it looks like someone just typed the original version into word.

The only thing i miss is chapter-level TOC links for faster, easier reference and access (only the three volumes are linked). This, of course, can be amended by manaualy adding a bookmark when you reach each chapter.You can think of this enriched P&P; as a general reader's Norton edition. Or as a Warner Bros. DVD as opposed to a Criterion. Not as highbrow and stacked, but (more than) good enough. The well-set text and the supplements and notes provide a much needed added value in these times of freely available e-books of classic literature.... as for the novel. Jane Austen rocks, baby!note: somebody at amazon made a mistake, and the cover that appears up there is from the Oxford Classics edition."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.As much as I love Pride & Prejudice, I must admit that some of the words are now archaic and some of the references have become obscure due to the passage of time. ThePride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)edition provides helpful footnotes to help readers understand the nuances of the novel more completely.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a chic book, but I do enjoy reading it and seeing how the author develops the characters and the plots.

While her older sister, Jane, has her own troubles with Mr. Darcy's friend, Mr. Bingley.This is a love stories for more than one, full of marriage do's and don'ts. It is also full of wonderful dialogue and a timeless plot.This is one of my very favorite books. I love how everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong. My favorite part about it is that I can relate to the story although it obviously was not written in this time period.My favorite mix up is how Mr. Darcy is convinced that Jane does not love Mr. Bingley so he separates them, causing Elizabeth to refuse his offer of marriage. He then goes through a long process of tiny deeds with the hope of redeeming himself in Elizabeth's eyes.One of my favorite characters is Mrs. Bennett. Forever causing her daughters' grief with her thoughtless comments and impropriety, she contributes to much of her daughters' unhappiness; Although all she wants for them is to be well-married and happy.I recommend this book with a love for classics who do not get bored with a lot of dialogue (like my sisters do).E @ 3 Book BeesOriginally posted @ [...]Ima swagbucks superstar @ [...]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I bought this book because my own copy was severely damaged after years of peruse. The picture of the cover was not available online at that time. I was sorely disappointed when the book arrived and I realised that this is not Jane Austen's original novel, but a severely butchered version, probably adequate for 8 year olds.So, should you be looking for a present for a child, this is probably an excellent choice. Should you be looking for a cheap copy of the master novel, search further."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I decided to go to the library and take out the book after seeing the movie a few weeks ago. The movie was good but the book is so much better. It was well written, funny and everything you can expect from a good novel. Definitely a must read even if it is not required for class."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you only read one Jane Austen book, this is the one to pick. But if like the rest of us, you find something so completely witty and enjoyable in Pride and Prejudice, you'll pick up the rest of her books and read them all."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Who could not get swept up in the thorny romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy? And what girl hasn't fallen in love at least a little bit with the prickly yet big-hearted Mr. Darcy? This book has been made into mutiple miniseries (the A&E one is hands-down my favorite) and movies, while many modern screenplays have borrowed (and downright stolen) from this classic, romantic comedy of errors--or prejudices if you will--and for good reason. Like a fine wine, this novel just seems to keep getting better with (my) age."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Reading this book is like taking a sailboat ride to the world's best locations: exciting, smooth, tumultuous, but all in all a fantatic ride. Austen delightfully teases you in your role as omnicient reader, leaving you tantalized by the characters in all of their plots and sub-plots. You want to reach into the book and tell the characters you know the solutions to all their problems. You cheer the characters on through their pleasures and foibles. The language is as smooth as silk and as alluring as diamonds."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is Jane Austen's finest novel and one must assume that the author identifies rather strongly with the female protagonist. The book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. The novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\"The present novel is about a young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, who comes from an upper middle class family living in rural England. She has four sisters plus an interesting mother and a wise but witty father. The novel follows the romances and complications of the Bennet girls, especially Elizabeth and her sister Jane. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read..Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and many think it is her best work and it is one of the most delightful and pleasant reads. One must conclude that the very intelligent and witty Elizabeth character is a reflection of the author herself."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have always wanted to read this book and I am sad to say that I was spurred into reading it because I wanted to read \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\" and decided that to be fair to the humorous version of this book I should read the original.This was a very enjoyable book. It starts out a bit slow as Austen has to set up all the family relations. It takes a bit to keep all of the names thrown at you sorted out; it also takes a bit to get used to the manner of speaking used. There are many times when a characters is trying to say \\"no\\" but they take a whole paragraph of finely crafted language to do so.Despite the above; the language is clever and the story (after page 80 or so) is very engaging. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The plot has a lot of surprises and mis-direction and much attention is paid to characterization.It is not a quick read, you really have to pay attention to what you read. But for those who like victorian stories, this story should hit the mark. In fact this story seems to be what all the more recently written victorian fictions I have read are striving to be. Definitely a good read if these kind of humorous victorian romances are your thing; this is the original.Although I don't think I will be reading a ton more Jane Austen; I did find this to be an enteraining book. I am also looking forward to reading the spoof on it \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\\""},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Of course Pride and Prejudice is fabulous in any form, but I do like this edition. Barnes and Noble Classics are hardcover with a nice dustjacket. Pages were a nice thickness, and what I especially liked, had that cool binding effect that makes it look like an older edition book where all the pages are different widths at the side."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had seen excerpts designed to paint Jane Austen's writing as stuffy, obtuse, and generally boring. One joke says that Ms. Austen's novels are like active mysteries that engage the reader in trying to find the hidden verb in each sentence. But these criticisms are not only unfair, they're entirely inaccurate: just a few pages into Pride and Prejudice, Austen's writing style ceased being an obstacle to my enjoyment and began being a central part thereof. The manner in which she builds sentences and paragraphs is pure a delight to the modern reader, even 200 years after the fact.Austen's true accomplishment here is that she makes a novel in which \\"so little\\" happens, by modern standards at least, so darn interesting! As one critic put it, this is a 367-page story in which the central events are a man changing his manners and a lady changing her mind. But oh how the web of intrigue is weaved! The subtleties of character development and plot construction are never forced and always as natural as they are glorious. This truly is a literary triumph, and the first great novel that places women and their happiness at the center; that focuses on dialog and feelings more than swordplay and seafaring. Its interlocking characters are so rich and well-defined, unlike anything in the preceding novels onThe Well-Educated Mind's reading list. And even though the story ends up exactly as you know it will from Page 1, it's still all so satisfying!Is the book pretentious? Elitist? Maybe. But consider it a study of a particular class of people during a particular point in history. That's what it is. The heroine, with whom I agree with the author when she described her to be \\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print,\\" is bucking social conventions, but she can only do so much. She can't emancipate Woman in one fell swoop, nor is that her motivation. But Elizabeth's actions and this novel in general were one small step for Woman, at least, and an incredibly enjoyable read if nothing else. Five stars all the way!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This has to be one of my absolute favorite books of all time. I love the characters who are all written exceptionally well. I love the language and Austen's style. I love the book.I've read it 4 times including the first, which was less than a year ago. Despite that, I still dislike reading certain scenes in public because they have me laughing or smiling like an idiot. At one point, I was reading, and I had to shut the book grinning like an idiot to walk around a lose some of my pent up energy.Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent character. But she has her flaws. She thinks highly of herself and her wit, and she forgets that even she can make a mistake. Jane is the kindest character in the book, and more gentle-hearted than anyone I know. But it works with her and I have no problems relating to her. Darcy is a proud, shy man who dislikes social situations. But he is caring, just, and thoughtful. Bingly is his exact opposite.I should probably stop describing the characters. But they are what make this book a classic. Jane Austen is a master of characterization. I can relate to them centuries later despite living in a completely different country and culture. Elizabeth and Darcy leave me grinning like an idiot and distracted for days after I am done reading the book. Obviously, it's why I'm posting this review nearly a week after I finished reading it for the fourth time in full!This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good romance, and even those who don't."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is considered a classic for a reason. Some books just stand the test of time, and this is one of them. Jane Austen has an impecable manner of getting to the core of human (and especially women's) emotions.

I first picked it up my junior year of high school, and while the first couple chapters failed to capture my interest I decided to keep reading.

Most of all, it just has this inexplicable quality that keeps you enraptured throughout the whole read.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The author takes us through life in the 1800's and the lifestyles filled with chivalry and of course, pride and prejudice. It was initially difficult to comprehend due to the older style of English writing. However, once you sit with this book for a couple of chapters, it's easy to get the hang of it. It's a page turner. This is the ultimate original chick lit. Beautifully written, young, whimsical, and provocative. Will remain one of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"After seeing a number of adaptations, I finally decided to read all ofAusten's novels. Northanger Abbey was not bad, and Sense and Sensibilityis excellent. However, this is the best so far. While there is a lot ofinsightful comment on the custom of English society of the time, anddiscussion of the character's motivation, the book just sparkles duringthe interchanges between them. While those between Elizabethand Mr. Darcy are justifiably famous, I would say that many of the othersare at the same level. My favorite are perhaps the interchanges betweenLady Catherine and Elizabeth. I am very much looking forward to readingthe remaining three completed novels."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a gorgeous little edition of Pride and Prejudice.

I liked the characters in the novel and the plot. My favorite character in the novel was Elizabeth Bennet. I liked how she acted towards all the other characters with her quick wittedness and her cleverness. She was a very honest person who rose above her class bound society. She holds to what she thinks and believes in. For example in Chapter 3 she has a disliking toward the Bingley sister's, while Jane finds them &quot;charming&quot; Elizabeth still holds her feelings of dislike towards them.Another character I enjoys throughout the book was Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet was the only man in a house of six women. The women wore him out and all of them were very difficult to deal with. He would always give me a good laugh throughout the whole book by his sarcastic humor. I like him also because he reminded me of Elizabeth because of their quick-wittedness and also they were the two closest in the family since they were the two smartest. I thought the two of them were most close in Chapter 13.I enjoyed the novel's plot because of the girls and how they turned men down of proposals and the different down falls and happiness of all the girls' love lives. All the girls have disappointments and confusion with the men and people they love; yet not all of their situations work out the way some of the girls had hoped. Elizabeth holds strong and but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. Throughout all of the confusion, Jane and Elizabeth are happily married at the end."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was forced to read &quot;pride and prejudice&quot; for a high school english class...but i immediately fell in love with it...it has everything from love, humor, stereotypes, and anything else bundles into one heartfelt, lovely story. If you like anything dealing with romance, this book is a must read. I recommend it to people of all ages, races, genders because it truly emits a universal message!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I loved Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I have read it so much that the cover is worn. The BBC movie version was almost as great at the book and very very close to the accuracy of the book. I have read Emma and Persuasion and loved them both, though not as well as Pride and Prejudice. You'll want to buy it so that you have it to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I wanted to read Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice after a friend told me the book was so good. I bought a copy, and I can't say I was disappointed; this is a masterpiece. Austen did a really nice job talking about issues that you and I have trouble with--love, relationships, reputation, pride and prejudice of course--just to name a few. She did well tying in the love story with Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy with all the other characters--even the most frivolous of characters had their part in the story.I really liked the fact that Austen developed the characters/story line between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwililam Darcy well. It is evident that the two were made for each other, but Elizabeth, after first bad impressions concerning Darcy and stories by Wickham, never noticed the true character of Darcy because of her predjudice (blindness) towards him. Darcy was just too full of himself until rejection by Elizabeth brings him back to his senses--not so proud now, are we? The roads to the happy ending were often bumpy, but Elizabeth and Darcy (along w/Bingley and Jane) arrived safe and sound, concluding the novel with a sweet ending. At times, the passages are really long/tedious, but in the end, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The chapter that I liked the best was chapter one because it talks about the Bennet family and describes how the mom (Mrs. Bennet) is really desperate for her daughters to marry a wealthy man. The reason that I liked chapter one is because it gives a brief opening about the book. It was important for the daughters to marry a wealthy man because they wanted to have a better economic status and be exposed to a better society.The literary device that I appreciated more was comedy. Comedy is a story that ends with a happy resolution of the conflicts faced by the main character. In many comedies the conflict is provided when a young couple who wish to marry are blocked by adults.I recommend this book for people that like to read books and are interested in how people were in the 19th century.I like the book because it tells us how families were in the 19th century. The reason that this is important to me is because we could see and compare cultures back then and how we are now."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see Mrs. Bennett as an excruciatingly loud mother who lives only to search for husbands for her daughters. We can see Mrs. Bennett favors Jane as her first priority for finding a husband because she is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. One instance is when Mrs. Bennett found out Mr. Darcy was moving into a neighboring house. When she found out he was single, she automatically suggested/recommended Jane as a potential future wife. In contrast we start to see and understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense of his daughters. He doesn't critique his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50 because this story deals with the trouble girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, to which we can relate. The daughters were not that old, yet they were mature for their age. Teens will enjoy it because we all go through these teen stages of boys, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary device that was used in the story was analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. We are able to see their differences, but along with it their common interests start to show. For example, they both come from a different social background and yet are both intelligent, and have a tendency to judge harshly.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice, because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murder, but this story is nothing like this. It builds its own suspense through character's personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the early 19th century that reminds us of their rules and regulations that were used back then. For example women were just expected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Chapter 12 is my favorite chapter because it talks about what happens around the lives of the family, like when Elizabeth is alone with her sister, and her mother is in another place. The appropriate age for this book is 15 years up because it has words that are difficult to pronounce and comprehend.The literacy device, which l most appreciate, is characteristic because it is the way to know more about the character. This book l like because it is well written and lets you know about how entailing affected the family in those days, which means the women could not inherit property only the male or brother of them. As a consequence the daughters marry someone they don't like so their husbands could inherit the property."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a romantic novel which I absolutely recommend to readers. If one is able to comprehend a 19th century woman's role and priorities, entailment, and discover insights on characters within letters and situations, you will surely appreciate this novel. I would mostly recommend it to readers ages 16 and up.One of my favorite chapters was chapter 34. In this chapter Darcy declares to Elizabeth his love for her and proposes matrimony to her. He does this when his love for her is at a stage where he disregards all obstacles that kept him from doing this earlier. He also does it at a point where Elizabeth's anger towards him is at a crucial point.One of literary devices that I mostly appreciate was irony. For example, in chapter 34 Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being prideful while Elizabeth accuses Darcy of being prejudiced. Even though both characters have fault in pride and prejudice, I found it quite ironic how the reader may think that Darcy symbolizes pride while Elizabeth symbolizes prejudice. Yet these two characters are viewed in the opposite way, where Darcy symbolizes prejudice and Elizabeth pride.I really did like this book, mostly because it did not bore me. I hope other readers appreciate this novel as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group. I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it. There is no violence, or any misconduct. The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century. One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts. An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes. We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love. This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love. I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far. It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story. My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3. In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship. Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him. Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him. She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning. He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal. Since both Jane and Elizabeth have been proposed to, the entire neighborhood hears of the engagements, and both Elizabeth and Jane recieve congratulations. This is my favorite chapter because this is where all the conflicts are resolved, and thus begins a happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have always loved P&P it is timeless both in its writing style and it's subject matter. Like Romeo and Juliet this book's story line have been shamelessly borrowed by novelists and film makers for years.

I love the social commentary Austen makes in the book through the interactions between the Bennett family and others in the book .

But be warned, \\"Pride and Prejudice can keep you rivetted for hours..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is mainly focused on Elizabeth Bennet and her romance with Mr. Darcy, which comes about in a very interesting, if not humorous way. Elizabeth first judges Mr. Darcy to be arrogant and conceited, while Mr. Darcy finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. Another main character is Elizabeth's sister, Jane, who has a troubled relationship with Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's friend. Many exciting events take place involving the many sisters of the Bennet family in this great English story that will keep advanced readers interested.I have to admit, this was a very difficult book. I struggled through most of it, and I like this book much better now that I am finished with it. I guess that means that I like the story, but it took a while to get through reading it. One downside was that there was not much said describing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's romance. That might have been somewhat due to the time period in which this story was written. However, I really enjoyed the great detail, which allowed Austen to paint an amazing picture of society in that time period and middle-class expectations. I bought this book, which I am glad I did, because I plan to read it again. This definitely seems like it's one of those books that the reader will enjoy more the second time it is read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This plot was definitely fit for me. I am into the suspensful love stories that pull you into the story and won't let you go. This book was like that for me. I felt I could relate to a lot of it in that the girls were fighting over a guy or gossiping about who they think is prettier, or who they admire the most; something i could see my friends and I doing a lot. I think a part of the book that portrays the similarity between my friends and the girls from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is when the Bennet and theLucas women get together the morning after a ball and discuss all of the details. Mr. Bingley is the hot item in town and they are trying to decide who he likes the most. &quot;Oh!---you must mean Jane, I suppose---because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it---but I hardly know what---something about Mr. Robinson.&quot;&quot;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies....and which he thought the prettiest? And his answering immediately to the last question---Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.&quot; (pg. 20). I also love all of the characters in her novel. For each one of them i could tink of someone I knew who was exactly like them. I feel like I know Elizabeth, Jane, and Charlotte so well because they each have qualities almost identical to some of my friends. My favorite character throughout this book had to be Elizabeth. She is strong, witty, and extremely intelligent. She has a lot of the qualities that inspire me to be a stronger person that stands up for my beliefs. I love that she is able to battle with Darcy about what makes the &quot;perfect&quot; woman. Her intelligence makes Darcy drool over her. I think Elizabeth would be a good role model for a lot of girls who need to learn what the meaning of independence is, and how to use it. A quote in the book that shows Elizabeth's strength. &quot;My fingers, said Elizabeth, &quot;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practicing. It is not that I do not believe m fingers as capable as any other woman's of uperior execution.&quot; &quot;Darcy smiled and said, &quot;you are perfectly right.&quot;&quot;Another reason I love this book is because of Jane Austen's writing style. She uses such a large vocabulary that thouroughly illustrated everyone's feelings so well, that it made it hard to put the book down. Austen's wording just seemed so elegant and flowed together perfectly. I felt smart just reading her book. It was definitely challenging because of the old fashioned wording and advanced vocabulary, but it feels like such an accomplishment finishing such a great book. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy a great story and get a sense for the social status of women and men during the 19th century. It's a great book, and I have nothing bad to say about it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the original and most amazing novel of all of Jane Austen novels.The most wonderful chapter is chapter eight where Elizabeth Bennet shows off her witty and exhilarating character. She is very beautiful and has a shining personality.This novel has amazing, fantastic wording as well as chapters. The appropriate age for this novel to be read would most likely be from 16 years of age and up because younger readers aren't mature or they don't have the knowledge that has to be applied to read this novel.Jane Austen beautifully brings out irony of fate; everything is expected to go one way but ends up another. For example, when the Bennet family thought that Wickham took Lydia to London to elope. The family thought the worse. They kept in mind that Wickham could possibly try to bed Lydia and not consider that he would propose to her. They were scared for Lydia and Wickham. At last they were found and brought back to Longbourn estate and surprisingly they were safe and engaged.This has been the best novel I have ever read in my life. I have never indulged in a novel like Pride and Prejudice. I adored the truth and reality that it holds."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book based in the 19th century in England. It was based on the era when money, pride, love, and marriage arrangements had to be the best and the most important thing. In this book the major conflict was their pride and prejudice of the main characters. The book's main characters were the Bennet Family, Bingley, and Darcy. The Bennet family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, their daughters Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia. As this story starts we meet all of them along with others minor characters. We find out that they are all concerned about social classes.The best chapter in this book is when Darcy and Elizabeth become engaged. To me it is the best chapter because that shows that they overcame their pride and prejudice. These two characters were deeply in love but couldn't show it to each other not only because of their own pride and prejudice, but also because their family and acquaintances had influenced them wrongly.The literary device I appreciate is comedy. A comedy, in general, is a story that ends happily. The hero or heroine of a comedy is usually an ordinary character who overcomes a series of obstacles that block what he or she wants. It's usually a plot where two young people meet and fall in love. The young lovers must face obstacles to their marriage. At the end of the story Elizabeth and Darcy overcome their conflicts to get together and be able to show their feelings towards each other.I like and recommend this book to anyone who likes to read love books with a little comedy. This book is age appropriate for teens and older people because it gives you a chance to appreciate the differences in lifestyles and beliefs in the 19th century from those of today. This book makes you think of how people believed women had only one futurein life, and that was getting married and raising a family."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is unfortunate that most first time readers of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE see it merely as one more book to be endured in 11th grade English. However, most soon enough catch the magic of an author (Jane Austen) who can weave a spellbinding tale of love, romance, satire, and passion while all the while poking a not so gentle thrust at the social mores of the early 19th century. This book is no frilly ancestor of a Harlequin romance, even if it shares with the dim-witted heroines of Harlequin a time-honored plot of lovers who meet and find an instant dislike that later morphs into enduring love. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE starts off with that basic premise, but what sets it off as classic is what goes on behind the lovers, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. A careful reader usually notes the society in which Elizabeth and Darcy play out their little games of cross-purpose verbal repartee. The world of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a society ruled by conniving and single-minded women who see men only in terms of the size of their wallets. Whenever a new bachelor appears on the scene, the women of the novel (with the exception of Elizabeth, of course) immediately try to guess his income so that they can decide if one wishes to marry him. His age, his looks, his habits are much less significant than his income. A fat purse compensates for a fat head.Modern readers typically call such schemers 'golddiggers,' and according to modern values, perhaps they are, but these readers ought to judge the book's morality against the age in which it was written. Austen (1775 - 1817) lived in an England that prized manners and breeding over all else. It is no surprise, then, that since the reclusive author felt most comfortable only in the company of women, that she would limit her book only to the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and habits of women. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, men are never permitted to occupy center stage, nor are they shown interacting independently with other men. If a man is present in any scene, so must a woman to control and observe his actions. Men--even the eventually triumphant Darcy--are generally portrayed as vain, sycophantic, sarcastic, and totally aware that they they are prized only for their money.The world of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, especially if one has seen the fine film version starring Greer Garson, is one that seems to have been built for women to inhabit. All the women wear flouncy, bouncy dresses with huge flowered hats that Scarlet O'Hara might have worn in GONE WITH THE WIND. Even those ladies that complain of poverty never lack the funds to afford those outrageous outfits. Further, Miss Austen stages a ball in just about every third chapter that permits single women to size up eligible men. As these dandefied women and uniformed men speak to each other, the modern reader probably will be surprised at the excessive politeness and deference tossed unerringly about. This strict adherence to a surface morality ought not to fool the reader into assuming that the characters are as inwardly noble as they are outwardly polite. In fact, behind this massive wall of formal phrasing and good manners lies the same fears, jealousies, and general backstabbing that pervade a modern disco. What gives PRIDE AND PREJUDICE its perpetual charm is the biting irony that causes the reader to wonder: 'Did that character say what I think he (or she) just said?' The modern reader can best appreciate Austen's wit if she can read between the lines to sense the tone of the moment. If such a reader can see that this book is a polite if powerful indictment of a way of life that even Austen wished to poke fun of, then perhaps this reader can appreciate the charm of a book that grows with each successive reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Neither but I could not, I repeat could not read this book I fell asleep through the first chapter and could not seem to muster enough effort to read the second chapter. I do like Jane Austen movies, but I think in her books she tends to elaborate on things a bit much for my taste. I commend anyone who has read it through though. It is a wonderful classic with humour and romance this is a must read if you can get through it without dozing off."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"**** UPDATED September 30, 2012 (edited here. Extended comment at bottom) ********Pros: A great heroine and romantic story.Cons: The language can be a struggle in the beginning.The Bottom Line: The heroine of the story, Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my top 10 favorites.The story:A young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, is the second eldest of five girls (no boys as the heir). She is a very realistic woman who doesn't believe that beauty or wealth should hinder her from a happy life and marriage. While her sisters give their hearts out to people too quickly. The mother allows all five girls to be \\"out\\" (allowed to find suitors) due to her fears. She is worried that when her husband dies they will be destitute - which is true at the times lifestyle.Elizabeth takes her time in finding her ideal man. She is very proud of her family and prejudice toward the wealthy. Lydia and Kittie (two youngest sisters) are hilarious, and they believe in love at first site of a navy sailor. This doesn't go so well for one of them - i.e. a Mr. Wickham. Mary is the unfortunate middle child whom is neither gifted in \\"the arts\\" nor with words. Jane and Lizzie (Elizabeth), the older two sisters, are more reserved with their hearts. Mr. Darcy also is prejudice and proud, especially when he tries to ruin Jane and Mr. Bingley's relationship. His reasons is that he doesn't see Jane's love towards his friend. The connected relationships all fit perfectly together. Jane Austen shows a new ideal marriage when Mr. Bennet intends to marry off his daughters only if their mate was equal to them - meaning that the marriages should be equal.The language:It's a little difficult to read at first, and my only suggestion is that you should remember that it was written before our time. Most of the words are in the dictionary, but the grammar has definitely changed over the century. Jane Austen also enjoys excessively writing about one subject in the story, which can be difficult to sit through to read. But it still shows that Jane is a great author, especially during her time.My thoughts on the book besides the ones that I've already given is that the book is one of my favorite Austen books, because it has a strong heroine character that I can relate to. The family values are very modern, but yet it also gives a feminist-like style when the characters like Elizabeth are intelligent, and aren't too afraid to speak their mind. This book is a great classics book that I have read numerous times, and am still interested in reading in the future.cheersmichelle (2002)******UPDATE********So 10 years later and after an excessive amount of writing and reading classes, I feel this needs an update.Austen's writing is always a woman's point of view. It's beautifully written with rich characters so that you always feel like you're apart of the story. Austen's fan base is more popular with woman rather than the macho man because she expresses feelings. Her characters communicate to each other rather than shut their feelings away. In the case of 'Pride and Prejudice' these feelings spoken won't always help the character due to either their pride or prejudice.In my experience men are not keen to the idea of talking about how they feel. Austen not only shows this but she allowed woman of her era to have a voice - even if it wasn't etiquette. So men, you should just bear through all the woman talk. And when reading through their blabbering, think about their behavior. Are they childish (I.e. Lydia and Kitty)? Are they behaving with etiquette?The romance in this book is genuine. I can't help but wish for a Mr. Darcy for myself. Austen did a good job in \\"showing\\" us her characters love - rather than today's authors whom \\"tell.\\" This is the example of show your feelings rather than verbally giving them untill our heads are bashed in."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"All the Jane Austen books are good but P &amp; P comes up top, with Emma and S &amp; S following close behind.

And each of the five sisters represent a stereotype of women in literature in those days. The beautiful, the independent nurturer, the bookworm, the flirt, and the follower.

I found the conflict boring and without point, and the theme horribly expressed (was there any at all). Such that I find it amazing that the behaviors of an aristocratic woman in the 19th century wound actually be of interest to ANYONE. The themes are indeed NOT universal, and if anything, it should be derived from simple everyday life - there is no need to write a book about it.

In other words, I wanted to read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, but in order to prepare I first purchased and read Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice sucks. Basically, it is extremely boring, even for a character-driven story. I consider myself an open minded person and I have read and enjoyed some character driven stories such as Jane Eyre, Crime and Punishment, and The Great Gatsby. With all of those books I could tell why the books were classsic; they had well developed characters who interacted in a way that was either entertaining enough, or had sufficient underlying philosophical or social subtext, that a person could read these books with a sense of interest.The problem with Pride and Prejudice is that it essentially seems to amount to a story about a fictionalized idealized version of herself as an intelligent somewhat socially unacceptable woman in the context of English upper class society who is able to tell people off in socially acceptable ways, be smarter than her sisters, and meet a grumpy, intelligent socially unacceptable man to marry. It is boring because it basically doesn't have any social commentary or philosophical suspect besides for \\"smart chix roxxorz\\" or perhaps \\"nerds for t3h win\\" and it is basically a self-referential story which continues ad nauseum. I cannot understand for a moment why Pride and Prejudice is considered a classic and not the literary equivalent of trashy internet fan fiction with a Mary Sue lead character. Actually, I recall reading somewhere that Charlotte Bronte basically panned Pride and Prejudice in a review as being boring as hell.I would recommend reading Jane Eyre over Pride and Prejudice because even though Jane Eyre is essentially another self referential fantasy about being a slightly socially awkward smart woman in the context of English society there are actual physical events that happen in the story that can somewhat hold your interest and actual entertaining fleshed out characters besides for the main character, whereas I get the feeling that Pride and Prejudice is basically a gripe about how everyone else is so shallow. If you're going to do that at least be entertaining about it like in The Great Gatsby. Trying to finish off Pride and Prejudice just caused me a lot of stress and pain and I had to force myself to keep reading. And I've read a lot of things in my lifetime that would bore most people into depression and somnolence.Actually my real recommendation for if you want a good piece of classic literature with developed characters, but you don't want to deal with the anemic pale flabby social dissatisfaction of a book like Pride and Prejudice, you should instead read something by Alexandre Dumas like The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers. Those books are written in a convoluted classical style (read it in French for extra points!), they have real characters, they have character interaction, but they're also event-driven rather than exclusively character-driven; actual physical events, rather than conversations at dinner parties, drive the story lines. The lead characters actually do things like engage in hand to hand combat, pilfer fine wines, and manipulate international politics, whereas the people in Pride and Prejudice just bad mouth each other at a dinner table. (Jane Austen doesn't even tell us what they're eating and drinking; at least Alexandre Dumas tells us how his heroes infiltrated no-man's-land and were taking fire but had brought a picnic basket with food and wine from a specific region and were having lunch and making fun of the enemy from behind cover.) And given how busy modern life is, do you really want to spend hours of your precious time reading about pale anemic English people bad mouthing each other over dinner over ridiculous inconsequential things, and not about musketeers taking fire while making snarky comments and knocking back wine? I mean, seriously."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I did not have a favorite chapter but the chapter that I found most interesting is chapter eight because in that chapter Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at the Bingley's house and Darcy feels dumb because Elizabeth had rejected him, and they had not seen each other since that had happened.I feel that this book is for the age group of 20-40 and I think that it's more for girls then guys. I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book.

She and her father seemed to enjoy a love for the absurd, although her mother's behavior did embarrass her. Other than that there are many parallels among the characters in the story: Elizabeth and Elinor, Lydia and Marianne, Jane and Mrs. Dashwood, Wickham and Willoughby.It still bothers me that all the women think about is finding a husband, that an \\"accomplished\\" woman \\"sang and played all day\\", but I have to assume that was the world Jane herself was exposed to at the time.You know that with a family that size and all those dinner parties, there had to be some people working very hard in that household, but they are barely ever mentioned and then only in brief passing and only in their concern for the family.Fifty years after these novels were published, we see books such as \\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott depicting an American family. In this book the characters are much less one sided. Although some of the girls were still thinking primarily of finding husbands, they had to pitch in and help make the world around them.Another fifty years later, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" by L. M. Montgomery describes a young Canadian woman from a very different set of circumstances who puts the romantic side of life into perspective.Both Jo and Anne are charcters that I would encourage young girls to meet early in life. The Austen women in the books I've read so far, although they may be a study of women from a certain subsection of society in England at the time the novels are written, are not ones I'd place before my daughters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Most people will probably hate me for writing this review about a classic, but I found Pride and Prejudice a terrible bore. Everyone knows what it's about, so I won't use up my time telling you. But the book is really sort of a nightmare that never ends. It is not romantic or charming in the least bit. The main character comes through as arrogant and at times even stupid. It is a completely forgetable book, and I have no clue as to why so many people find it romantic. The writing is good, it has it's moments, but it in no way makes up for this book's lack of everything else. Wuthering Heights and Little Women, other classics that are just about in the same genre, are by far superior.

It is quite contageous I might add because I find myself helplessly imatitating the language that it was written in. I am offended by every paragraph that I read. I have never felt such contemt for any work that I read. I pasionately despise this novel and I could write an entire paper on why. The 17th century English aristocracy and the way the people cary and behave themselves and think so highly of themselves and so low of anybody who is different, is offensive and without merit. You may think &quot;that I simply don't understand this work&quot; well I don't and I am not going pretend that I understand this &quot;classic&quot; Perhaps I am incapable of comprehending this novel. I do know however that there are a lot finer book writen in the 17th centuries and earlier and after, which are better, more meaningful then this book and are also classic but some of them are notoverated enough as much as this book is."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is a classic.

The style is clumsy though the author strives to impress with an aristocratic pompousness so typical of social climbers of her day.

Commoners did not speak like that then, nor do they now. I would rather endure a daily root canal than read this book again.

Around the middle of voume two, i started screaming at the book (screaming at inanimate objects-never a good sign) because i was so fed up with it. I couldn't get myself to get really into it like my fellow peers. Maybe its because I'm 14, but I don't get it. The writing is boring, its too cliched, too old-fashioned, annoying and I know that the lovers are supposed to be in passionate love and all, but it feels cold-no love or passion, just boring. I found myself falling asleep in the middle of every chapter after chapter 16. Maybe its just me, I don't know, but I did not like this book, at all.

Life is a bit tricky for her. She lives with her overbearing mother, disinterested father, older sister Jane and three younger sisters, Mary, Catherine and Lydia. They are a reasonably well-to-do family for the moment, although once Elizabeth's father dies, their estate and any fortune he has left will go to a male relative, as he was unable to produce any sons. With the prospect of becoming destitute looming over her, Elizabeth's mother is desperate to get her five daughters, all in their late teens or early twenties, married off to wealthy men.The first man to come to her attention is Mr. Bingley, an eligible man who becomes their neighbor. Sure enough, he shortly becomes captivated by Jane, and everything seems on track for the two of them to become engaged. When there is interference from his sisters and his best friend, Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's family is thrown into turmoil.Mr. Darcy is almost universally disliked. He doesn't dance at the neighborhood balls. He doesn't engage in polite conversation or otherwise make himself seem social. After overhearing an unkind comment about herself from him, he loses any favor he might have had with Elizabeth. She goes out of her way to describe his odious nature to all who will listen. Despite his earliest impression of her, though, Mr. Darcy soon comes to find Elizabeth quite enthralling. What measures will he go to in order to change her mind and win her admiration?I liked the intertwining of lives in this story and some of the descriptions of what life was like living in the countryside back in the day. However, the story is limited by the time and style in which it was written. The plot drags along and the narrator spends far too much time dwelling on unemotional descriptions of scenery. I'm not sure if it was the intention of this story, but my strongest impression after reading it was that the life of those living in the upper class in England at this time had the most excruciatingly boring lives I can imagine. The characters in this story seemed constantly looking for anything to break the monotony of their day-to-day lives, and that impression didn't add much excitement to the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I understand that Pride and Prejudice is an honored classic. However, for me personally, I finally listened to myself and put the book away after reading about half of the story. The problem is that the characters are shallow and pretentious, and are simply not very likable or compelling. I think the novel, with all its gossipy nature, is the 1812 version of celebrity gossip television shows.I have read most of the English classics from the 1800s, including truly great romance novels such as Wuthering Heights or Tess of the D'UrberVilles, but sadly, found Pride and Prejudice to be boring and not worth my time. Full disclosure, as a middle-aged male, I may not actually be the target audience for the book. However, it should appeal to young women about the same age as the protagonists.Updated years later: Forced myself to finish reading the novel; I stick with my original \\"thumbs way down\\" assessment. The characters are all air-headed twits, shallow and stupid. A waste of my time, and I have no idea how it became a classic.

Drama starts when the young Elizabeth Bennett crosses upon a gentlemen by the name of Mr. Darcy who soon falls madly in love with her. While thats going on, Elizabeths older sister, Jane has fallen in love with Mr. Bingley, the \\"new neighbor\\" in their town. This book is full of love triangles, gossip and old fashion \\"love talk\\".I don't really like this book because, it was hard to follow because the wording was dated far back. There are also too many conversations going on in just one page! I would reccomend this book to adults and teenagers above the age of 15.

Yes, it has a simple \\"nothing much happens\\" plot, but so do some of the best stories ever written. The storyline of P&P; gets 5 stars from me.But the book...while I love and deeply appreciate Austen's vivid imagination and deep understanding of human nature, her writing style is just plain boring. I think of it as Dickens-esque, back in the day when writers were paid by the word. Descriptive detail in a book, when properly used, enhances the story. And details that give background information can generate major interest and hold a reader's attention, again, if done properly. But dry descriptions, needlessly strewn in and testing the limits of patience, detract from the plot and feel of the book. No doubt in the early 19th century, when this book was written, people were fascinated by every last little word on the page -- after all, their lives were filled with the same tedium that fills the book.The adulation for this book reminds me of a sycophantic love-fest. It is \\"known\\" that this book is a paragon of English lit, and if you disagree with that opinion, you just don't \\"get\\" quality literature, or you aren't sophisticated/educated enough to appreciate it. Well, I definitely \\"get\\" it, and I'm not afraid to say that it was dull, and say furthermore that the book could have been cut in half and suffered no major losses.P&P; stands out for me, because it is the almost the only instance where I prefer the movie ('95 mini-series, anyway) version to the book. That never happens for me, normally the book is indescribably more satisfying than the screen, but this book is the notable exception. The mini-series distills down the storyline (which, again, I think is one of the best in English literature) to its heart, and whittles away everything that is superfluous until all that is left is one of the greatest love stories of all time. Sadly, the book falls short of imparting that level of satisfaction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"People who order this cassette should be wary!

It takes place in 18th Century, Longbourn, England. The two main characters of this book are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story they do not get along at all. I think that the antagonist of this story is Lady Catherine de Bourgh. This story is about the interaction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They have several encounters throughout the book and some of them weren't so friendly. Elizabeth is witty and sarcastic, while Mr. Darcy is perceived as proud and arrogant. This book is about the both of them learning to overcome their differences and falling in love somewhere in the middle.I really like the way Jane Austen writes, it is very descriptive and you can see a clear picture in your head of exactly what she's saying. She starts out with her main character and you know exactly who they are and where they're coming from. But then you get to read and see how they change throughout the story. I think that the theme of this story is to look from other people's perspectives and not be so centered on yourself and you might be surprised what you find. When I was first assigned to read a classic I wasn't thrilled, but then as I got reading I came to find that I really loved this book and now it's probably one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"That was a very interesting audio book - I had never read the book and now I know."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride & Prejudice has turned out to be my favorite book when it comes to romance novels...and that's saying something since I'm a 21 year old who reads ALOT.Elizabeth Bennet is such a smart and kind, yet of course flawed heroine, that I felt like I actually got to know her. Austen made her characters so tridimensional I was amazed...not many writers arecapable of that.When it comes down to Mr.Darcy, I was extremely satisfied with him as well, and every time I read a scene with him and Elizabeth , I giggled at their witty replies to each other, they most definitely made me swoon.Learned from this.

This novel didn't get interesting to me until page 202. If you look above at the total page number, you'll see this is WELL into the novel.I didn't feel any tension? Any real conflict?So there's a woman living in a house with her parents (both of whom are pretty kooky, though Mama Bennet takes the cake) and four sisters (only one of whom seems remotely redeemable.) They talk, they walk, they go to parties, they get interested in marriage then get dumped, then someone else wants to marry one of them but moves away, more parties, some sewing, some cards, yada yada yada.I read this novel searching for WHAT in the world it is people like about it.Then it hit me: the tension is the life depicted.Jane Austen was living this life-an exceedingly intelligent woman (evidenced by her prose) who is made to reside behind doors hoping a man will marry her and hoping he is someone she'll respect.An insipid existence. A passive life for an active mind.The conflict isn't within the characters. The conflict is between the author and her readers.So how does Austen portray the absurdity of her life without alienating her readers? She creates an intelligent woman and then contrasts her with absurd characters. She gives us Jane, a sweet woman who is considered beautiful by everyone (though her mind is given no notice.) She gives us Elizabeth, a smart girl who is forever compared to her socially perfect sister. She gives us a mother who wants nothing but five sons-in-law, a father who can barely stand the presence of any of these women (or their prospective boyfriends), and a trio of silly sisters either buried in books or the mirror. Their ultimate life goal? Marriage.Having no money makes acheiving this goal very difficult.Wanting love? Equality? Conversation that isn't empty? Nearly impossible.Along comes cranky but rich Mr. Darcy.Somehow Austen has to find a way to make the rich guy see the poor woman's intelligence, and the poor woman see the rich (arrogant) guy's shrewdness.Both of them are trapped in an absurd game. Both of them know it's an absurd game but neither of them can say it's absurd, and Austen daren't let on she knows it's absurd because everyone buying the book is trapped in the very same game.She displays her novel as a light-hearted love story. In truth, I think it's a firestorm. She's shouting, as loud as she dares, \\"Does anyone else think this is stupid?\\"If you're reading for entertainment, it starts around 202. If you're reading to see Victorian society laid out on a surgical table and diced with style, it starts at page 1.4/5 for Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Published in 1817, twenty years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, this novel allows the reader to travel through time to a bygone era where the pace of life was much, much slower than what we experience today. News came only through the mail or newspapers; travel was by horse-drawn coach. Listening to this work is thus a truly refreshing experience.In addition, the main characters, the Bennett sisters, have limited interests. With no educational, professional or political concerns, their only concern is to get married, what will guarantee their future social and financial status. They lead simple, sheltered lives and apparently have no notion of the work and efforts put in by servantsto produce dinners, balls, gowns, etc.The writing style is congruent with the times. The work itself is very long, meticulously written with very slow, restricted action.The audio book's narrator is truly excellent and succeeds, while remaining unaffected, to add dramatic interest by very astutely modifying her voice for each character.All in all, this novel is heartily recommended for a worthwhile escape from our hectic 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is amazing and perfect for anyone just being introduced to Austen.

Even those who haven't read it surely know the name Mr Darcy, and how he's the romantic ideal of every housewife around the world. Everyone knows that he and Elizabeth Bennett are one of the most famous examples of a dislike-at-first-sight acquaintance that gradually matures into mutual respect and understanding, and I'm sure a healthy portion of that generalized \\"everyone\\" also knows that the novel also contains Austen's requisite commentary on class, marriage, wealth and families. Witty, self-deprecating Elizabeth is one of the most beloved heroines of all times (to this day, I find that I will always like a female protagonist if she reminds me of Elizabeth) and the novel itself begins with what is one of the most famous opening lines in English literature: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"The true meaning of this line is obvious, and sets the tone for the entire novel: that it is not young men who are on the search for wives, but young women who are in want of eligible husbands, and that it is only society and decorum that dictates that the search should be undertaken by the men. Like all Austen's novels, the story is told from the point of view of a young woman, just beginning to find her place in the community and the world, and who is expected by everyone around her to be on the look-out for a husband. Yet this is not the first thing on Elizabeth Bennett's mind - as the second of five sisters, she's more preoccupied with keeping her younger sisters in check and making sure her beloved elder sister Jane is well matched in life. And if it's to a wealthy bachelor, then so much the better! Although reasonably well-off, the Longbourne estate is entailed on a cousin of their father, and so the girls face grim futures if they do not marry well before their father's death.A cynical and sarcastic recluse, Mr Bennett spends most of his time either baiting or avoiding his vacuous wife, whose most pressing concern in life is to marry off her daughters. Her prospects are suddenly promising when news comes that the neighboring estate of Netherfield is being lent out to a young man by the name of Mr Bingley: pleasant, wealthy, and immediately smitten with Jane. However, society is considerably less impressed by Bingley's companion. Mr Darcy is cold, arrogant and snobbish, who, on being invited to dance with Elizabeth, says of her: \\"\\"she is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Elizabeth takes an immediate disliking to him, an attitude that is only enforced when she meets the charismatic Mr Wickham who tells her he was the son of the late Mr Darcy's steward, and that the present Mr Darcy robbed him of his rightful inheritance as stipulated in his father's will. A further black mark against Darcy is drawn when Elizabeth learns that he (along with Bingley's spiteful sisters) has deliberately forced a wedge between Mr Bingley and Jane, in the attempt to \\"save\\" his friend from a bad match.It is to her utmost astonishment then, when Mr Darcy tells Elizabeth that he's in love with her and proposes marriage. Telling her that he's struggled against his will, reason and character in order to take this action, (and pointing out obvious disadvantages of the match - on his side), Elizabeth is hardly impressed by his assumption that she'll accept him, and takes the opportunity to tell him exactly what she thinks of him.And yet after this disastrous encounter, Elizabeth begins to learn more about her rejected suitor and his circumstances. Perhaps she's been blinded by her own prejudice against him, just as his pride initially made him so un-gentleman-like toward her...One misconception concerning \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the belief that Elizabeth and Darcy are an early example of the \\"belligerent sexual tension\\" clich&eacute;, in which two characters hide their secret attraction to each other by pretending that they dislike each other. This assumption has always bugged me, as it is certainly *not* what is at work here. Austen is not only poking fun at the notion of love at first sight, but more importantly, is riffing the idea that two people would try to hide their passion by pretending that they don't like each other (the foolish Mr Collins believes that Elizabeth deliberately refuses his marriage proposal just because women often pretend to reject their suitors to hid their true feelings). Elizabeth and Darcy are legitimately unimpressed by each other at the start of the novel, but it is their growing understanding and desire to become a better person for the sake of the other that makes up their storylines. Both of them have to change in order to deserve each other: Elizabeth to overcome her prejudice, and Darcy to realize that he \\"has been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.\\"In a similar vein, it's important to note that Elizabeth - although prejudiced - is not entirely mistaken when it comes to accessing Mr Darcy's character. Although there is more to the Wickham story than meets the eye, her perception of him as arrogant and proud is indeed correct. It is her words to him after his proposal that force Darcy to reassess all that he's learnt in his lifetime; yet when she learns the truth and cries \\"till this moment I never knew myself,\\" we can see just how shaken she is to learn that her judgment is not as infallible as she thought it was.Different readers take different things from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - at its most simplistic, it's a Cinderella story about a worthy young woman who marries the man of her dreams and by doing so elevates her social standing. On a more contextual level, others approach the text as a vigorous satire of the social norms and expectations of Austen's day, in which the desperate hunt for a husband to ensure a woman's future has to be hidden beneath the constraints of civilized society.Although the novel may seem deceptively small in scope and content (in regards to the setting and general theme of marriage) this is a story that explores the depth of human relationships and the need for personal growth; a simple story about complex characters. Though it is not widely thought to be Austen's best novel - that distinction often goes toEmma- whichever way you look at it, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is considered Austen's lightest and most entertaining read, and is certainly her most famous.

Visits are exchanged between the households and Bingley falls in love with the eldest Bennett daughter ,Jane.The second daughter ,Elizabeth, and Darcy circle each other warily.There is much verbal sparring and Elizabeth-clever,witty and ironic-finds herself intrigued by Darcy while being repelled by his apparent aloofness and seemingly arrogant demeanour.She also hears negative things of him from other people.Events conspire to keep the pair apart and a mix of social snobbery,self-will and just plain misunderstandings are other barriers that must be overcome if true love is to triumph over its enemies -pride and prejudice.I have concentrated above on the relationship between darcy and Elizabeth but while this is the key relationship in the book it also has some well drawn supporting figures such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh ,a monster of snobbery and self-satisfaction personifying the aristocaracy at its worst and Mr Collins ,the oleaginous and toadying clergyman whose true colours emerge in his cringe worthy proposal to Elizabeth.The book is popular as a romance and while recognising this dimension to it have to say that for me it works best as a social comedy and an acute dissection of manners and relationships.It is among the great literary comedies as well as romances and is very clear eyed and unsentimental about such matters as marriage and social convention .This is not just a museum piece and deserves its wide readership"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This was an assigned reading book in 7 grade.

I admit without pleasure that I am partial to romance novels from the same time period. I also admit that it was very refreshing to read a less formulaic and shallow, meaning more creative, intelligent and worthy book set in this time.My favorite character must be Mrs. Bennet. Can anybody be more delusional, obnoxious and wacko? I laughed and cringed each time I heard her voice which I really did hear as I listened to the book on my mp3 player. And then there is Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine. Right at the beginning of the book she meets Mr. Darcy and it's dislike at first sight on both sides.Since her sister and Darcy's best friend fall in love, Elizabeth has to encounter Mr. Darcy repeatedly. Other events force the two to meet again and again and Elizabeth almost laughs out loud when finally ... but I don't want to spoil your question of \`what will happen if anything between Elizabeth and Darcy?'.I really liked Elizabeth' character development.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Austen wrote PRIDE and PREJUDICE in the mid-1790's and it is definitely a reflection of it's times. She speaks of an era where 'true' gentlemen did not engage in 'trade' (a term encompassing what today would include professions) and doing so would definitely lower not only him but his extended family's social status. Women were considered educated if they could play the piano well, or sing, or draw or were skilled at decorative needlework. The only acceptable occupation for a gentlewoman was marriage, an enterprise that her extended family was commited to helping her achieve for the alternative was spinsterhood as a dependent to some family member.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE centers on the Bennet family, a quiet country gentleman of modest means who lives with his wife and five daughters in southern England. As the story begins his family is in an uproar over the news of an eligible gentleman moving to the neighborhood. To the delight of Mrs. Bennet it quickly becomes apparent that Jane, the eldest daughter, has caught his eye. This is of special importance, since at 22 Jane's prospects are beginning to fade. The romance is not without obstacles which are further complicated by the romance of her next younger sister, the outspoken Elizabeth and the outrageous behavior of Lydia, the youngest daughter. In the end though, love, or at least matrimony, conquers all.The story begins rather slowly but the descriptions of the characters alone make it worth pressing on to the finish. Austen manages to bring them to life to the extent that the reader will probably be able to describe each in detail. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been called the first comic romance, and, although subtle by today's standards, some of the comic scenes are hysterical.If this novel were written by a 21st century author it would probably be about a third shorter, not a better novel but a more accessible one to a modern reader. The 18th century style with it's long, complicated sentences filled with detail make for slow reading, frustrating for a reader who is anxious for some action. It is also a bit difficult for a modern day reader to comprehend the culture that Austen is describing, one where a young woman walking alone is considered improper, where having a lawyer in the family is an embarrassment, where a wealthy country family could select the local minister. For a reader unfamiliar with this time period, particularly for a younger reader, an annotated edition would probably be helpful."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is probably my favorite classics. I don't devote too much time to reading classics but I've read some good ones before. They are not really my style but I do like the ones I have read. The different style is refreshing.The book is written much differently than books are written these days. I was reading the begining of the book while I was tiered. I realized that I hadn't understood anything I'd read. I had to go and read again when I was completely awake.It was enjoyable. I loved the characters; they were smarter than so many characters in other books and were very well spoken. That may, however, been how most people were in the 19th century.It was fun to watch Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go on with their love hate relationship. Until the end it was a lot of hate.I thought it was a good classic but having not read many classics I'm not sure how it compares. Better than Wuthering Heights and not as good or as good as Great Expectations.-cdm"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"After reading Northanger Abbey and enjoying it so much, I decided that I would take another stab about Jane Austen and I am very glad that I did. I chose Pride and Prejudice because it is one of her better known novels and has been turned into numerous movies as well as a recent adaptation titled Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. The story is about Elizabeth Bennet who is a strong willed and outspoken young woman as she tries to find her true love. The most interesting aspect of the story is not Elizabeth's hunt for love, but her relationship with her parents. Mrs. Bennet is a flighty woman whose main goal in life is to have her daughters wed to wealthy men. While, Mr. Bennet is a sarcastic and cynical man with no interest in martial affairs. Elizabeth's contrasting parental figures is detrimental to all of the daughters and even places them in danger.Most people identify this novel with the relationship between outspoken Elizabeth and cocky Darcy. However, there is much more to the story than their love.Still, I am looking forward to reading Linda Berdoll's sequel titled Darcy Takes a Wife."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"For the first time ever, I liked the movie (w/Colin Firth version) way better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I'm not really qualified enough to give the comments for this wonderful classic book.

I am fascinated with the society and culture of the past, and find that only through reading can I visit this era. I found the dialogue very amusing as well as the characters mannerisms and behavior. As to their behavior, Ms. Austen could not have captured the essence of human nature any better than she did. She is able to show people's tendency to be insecure; selfish; arrogant; judgmental; opportunistic, and overly passionate. Elizabeth Bennet, was refreshingly unconventional with her frank and direct honestly and her wry humor. The conclusion satisfies the thirst for an outpouring of emotion, for Ms. Austin establishes a good degree of tension, which increases the farther in the story one goes. What I found unfavorable was the plot's slow progression and its tendency to drag. Mr. Darcy is rarely heard in the beginning although I admit he does appear more during the end. I also feel that Elizabeth's dislike of Mr. Darcy lasted too long, which resulted in choking the romance out of it. Along with its slow progression, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. This is due in part to the language that I find simultaneously charming, as well as to the characters' tendencies to go on and on about a subject of no particular importance."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a satirical commentary on nineteenth century society. Austen uses dry humor and irony to show the absurdities of her time. Extreme characters such as Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet are used to accentuate the sexism of her society, and characters such as Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine De Bough are used to show the culture's obsession with wealth and power. Austen uses the character Elizabeth Bennet to counter these negative values. Elizabeth does not conform to the society's beliefs of how women should act, and she believes in marrying only for love. This novel is enjoyable to read, although it is at times wordy and somewhat predictable. The general plot is not overly exciting or suspensful. However, the problems of sexism and egotism examined in this work are issues still prevelent today. Therefore, readers, especially young women, can relate to this novel. As an AP English student, I would not highly recomend this novel to other AP students. While I did enjoy reading it, I did not find it to be on the same level as the other books I read this year. It took little analysis to find the &quot;deeper meaning&quot; of the novel. Although it was not as chalenging as other books that I have read this year, many of the themes would lend nicely to the final thematic question on the exam. I would not replace another AP novel with this, but I would read it as a supplement to the AP curriculum."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The book was recently read by my mother who recommended it.I loved the movie and knew I would enjoy reading.

The period was one of war and revolution that severely threatened upper class privileges. Conscription at home and reports of endless damger can never be comfortable news from across the channel and on the seas of the world. There was also the threat of invasion that Napoleon planned but was ultimately unable to execute. Yet war is never mentioned in the novel. There are soldiers, officers only of course, but their sole military duties are flirtation and to supply dance partners.The true conflict, in fact the only conflict of the Bennet family, is the struggle to marry off the eligible daughters before their father dies. Primogeniture is the evil djinn of the plot and Mrs. Bennet and the daughters are never unaware of the perils of their situation. They live one heart beat away from being thrown out of their estate by the male heir, their cousin Mr. Collins. Their only options are marriage or a life of dependency on a relative's charity. The girls are untrained. They can never earn their livings and the only skills they possess are those required of a wife, a companion, and a homemaker. Here I am thinking of Jane and Elizabeth. The youngest, Lydia, runs away with a scoundrel officer and almost brings the family to ruin. The other two daughters, Mary and Kitty, are mere bookends of little note, useful perhaps to illustrate the unlimited production of Bennet daughters, and to highlight the misfortune of never having produced a son.Every unattached man the family encounters is defined by fortune. Darcy has an income of 10,000. and Bingley 5,000. Once these two are corralled, the fate of the rest of the family is secure and the novel ends with satisfaction. The great peril is that these two wealthy bachelors will not be induced to perform their assigned tasks, finding and wedding two suitable wives from an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family. Among the great delights of this novel are the nuances of character displayed and the modulations of the central personages as fortune and misfortune threaten and abate.Loss of place and social ostracism run behind every line of text and the wonder of Jane Austen's novel is that the threat of material want is ever present and yet is rarely noted. In polite company such matters are never discussed, but they are implicit in every second of existence. The stress is desperate and the courage of the characters immense. Since it is never expressed, it is possible to imagine it lies hidden in their minds but never given place in speech.Dialectical materialism can understand and find clarity in the situation of the Bennet family. A rereading of Das Kapital might be a useful sequel to this great novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Irene Sutcliffe is fantastic.

After all, I am a guy and disposed to guy-ly things like action movies and bbq ribs. Pride and Prejudice, on the other hand, is a quaint British novel about a group of daughters and their various courtships and marriages. The main plot concerns whether one of these daughters-Lizzy-can or cannot overcome her initial dislike of a good man who subsequently falls in love with her. The device by which this plot operates, and extends into over three-hundred pages, is that everyone is either too scared, or too proper, to say what they really feel. The novel is conversation, conversation and more conversation, and almost all of it in an affected upper-class British speak where one talks around things, never about them. It does not entail much action-when it does it is usually characters traveling to a new locale to talk some more, and there is no bbq to be found at all, and so as I say, it is not, and by its nature cannot be, my favorite novel of all time. And yet, it is a testament to the skill of the author (and this is the first Austen I've read, and she has lived up to the hype surrounding her name) that, despite my lack of inherent interest in the subject matter, she managed to sustain my attention and, what's more, I can say that I completely enjoyed the reading. I would even be willing to read more of the same by the same. Her characters are interesting, distinct and likable, her dialogue true, and her descriptions sparse, witty and to-the-point.I give the novel 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed it, liked the characters and thought it well-written overall. It only loses its one star for being about things that do not compel me particularly; I'm sure that those who are predisposed to like conversation-driven British literature about social mores and marriage will rate it the full five."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My first experience with Jane Austen was an unfotunate one since, like many people, I had her prose rammed down my throat by a dodo high school English teacher. To make matter worse, the instructor, Ms. Z was a retired hippie who wore burlap sacks to school and worshipped Freud. At one point she had me write a paper comparing the three principle characters to the id (Lydia) the ego (Elizabeth) and the superego (Jane). At the tender age when a youth's mind is ripe for absorption and exploration, mine was already acclimated to the professional academic practice of ideological regurgitation of canonical literature.But years later, I saw the mini series and really enjoyed it. I promptly reopened the novel after many years and discovered the intensely liberating sensation of rereading required highschool texts without pedagocical intrusion.Austen's portrait of Victorian society is a sociological gem. And this time instead of taking my teacher's word for it, I actually found the book enormously funny. Much of the language, environment, and social circumstances are completely out of date, but in order to appreciate them, one must read the book in context. Some argue that it is too verbose. But there were no malls, cars or televisions in Victorian England. People entertained themselves, among other ways, by reading and writing and corresponding with each other. Words played heavily in the day to day lives of the middle class and aristocracy.I recommend that anyone who detested this book in high school, reread it and enjoy it. And I recommend that educators present this book in context so that students can appreciate it's humor, language and historical perspective."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates. Set this one aside and pick up The Scarlet Letter if you are looking for a classic worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Read this and many of Jane Austen's other novels as a teenagers.

Timeless and a must read for the sad romantics amoungst us."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have been reading classics, but this did not rate for me. I read half and stopped. I found it extremely boring, the descriptions went on and on, and the book was hard to read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"What makes a book a \\"classic\\"? Is it the language? The fame of the author? The date of publication? Or, as my high school English teacher used to say, is a book a classic \\"because it still says what it needs to say\\"? In the case of Jane Austen's masterpiece, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", I'd venture that it is all of the above. Though it was one of her first published novels, it's probably her greatest, and features some of the greatest characters ever written in what is quite possibly one of the oldest stories ever told.The plot itself is timeless. The Bennet family of Hertfordshire has five daughters, and with no sons and an estate entailed along the male line, it is important that the girls find good husbands if they don't want to be turned out of their home upon the death of their father. As is common in most families, each child is very different. Jane, the eldest, is quiet and serene, and always sees the good in everyone. Elizabeth is intelligent, while Mary is preachy and a stuck-in-the-mud. Catherine (Kitty) is a follower, and the youngest, Lydia, is an out-of-control flirt. The story begins, rather famously, with the arrival of new neighbors at Netherfield, a home a few miles away. The house has been taken by a young man with a large fortune, and almost immediately, Mrs. Bennet begins scheming that the as-yet-unknown Mr. Bingley will marry one of her daughters - preferably the eldest.As luck would have it, Bingley and Jane hit it off right away. The same cannot be said for Bingley's socially-awkward friend, Mr. Darcy, and Jane's sister Elizabeth. Almost immediately, the two get on each others' nerves, begun with Darcy insulting Lizzie within the hearing range of the latter and continuing as the Bennet family (with the exception of the two eldest) make fools of themselves at every opportunity. When a regiment of soldiers comes to town, Elizabeth is quick to enjoy conversing with a Mr. Wickham, one of Mr. Darcy's least-favorite people, and eagerly believes everything Wickham says about his former childhood friend.Of course, not everything is as it seems. Darcy and Elizabeth continue to meet over the course of the next year, while she is visiting a friend near his aunt's home, and even on his estate at Pemberley. The more they get to know each other, the more they realize they may have been mistaken about one another. And when Lizzie's youngest sister does the unthinkable, the Bennet family's misfortune may end up being the shove Elizabeth and Darcy need.The greatest thing about this book is its characters. Jane Austen was a master of the absurd, and she has captured it beautifully in the obnoxious Mr. Collins, the haughty Lady Catherine deBourgh, the foolish Mrs. Bennet, and so many others. Everyone is drawn to life, and as you are reading it, you realize that, even though the book came out two centuries ago, these are personalities that still exist in all of our lives. The dialogue is witty and to the point, and though the novel is relatively short, the action never lags. There's a reason the 1995 BBC miniseries adaptation clocks in at close to five hours; a LOT happens in this book. With the 200th anniversary of the novel happening this year, it's definitely time to take an enjoyable look back at one of the most famous - and well-loved - books ever written."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I had seen the films, and knew what was going to happen.

For Lizzy to do that in that kind of society was very brave of her and i admired her for it. Since then i have read this book so many times it's unbelievable and it still interests me greatly. i never get bored with the storyline and i live along with the characters and feel for them as if i was reading the book for the first time.

If you find yourself unable to keep up with Georgian style of writing (or if you are guy), however, this may not be the best book for you. ;)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Being a student (10th grade), I feel obliged to relate to other students not only how much I enjoyed this novel, but also that it may not be right for everyone. It seems that many other students do not particularly like the novel, especially the male crowd. If my class was ever assigned P&amp;P I am sure that there would be many complaints from my classmates... but they complain about every novel we are assigned, and therefore I can never really trust their opinion. If you are a student looking to read P&amp;P I highly recommend it. My own ideas on this novel are quite favorable. I am sorry that not everyone has a taste for Austen. I consider her one of the best authors who ever lived. I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice as well as other Austen novels. Her novels, especiall P&amp;P, are quite funny and I have often found myself laughing outloud on many occasions (which is not an easy feat). Pride and Prejudice is not a novel to be over looked."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest of Jane Austen's work. The novel centres around the Bennet family, who are the principal inhabitants of the village of Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is a marriage obsessed mother, whose dearest wish is to see her five daughters married and settled. As it is, the Longbourn estate is entailed on a distant male cousin, for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet lack a male heir. This makes the five sisters, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia, increasingly dependent on husbands to provide for them, if their father was to die. We see the different personalities of the five sisters, but the two that stand out are the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the novel, challenges and changes the established rules of class barriers. Her marriage to Mr. Darcy, an aristocrat who has an income of \\"ten thousand a year,\\" allows Elizabeth to climb the social ladder and cross social boundaries, despite the strictly stratified class lines of Austen's time. Elizabeth's eldest sister Jane, also makes an advantageous match with Mr. Bingley, a member of the noveau riche. Times were changing even as Jane Austen was writing. Although Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, lamented over her nephew's and Elizabeth's engagement, her angry objections were overruled. The ancient aristocratic voice became faint and was silenced as times changed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it so many times that the cover is falling off and the spine is incredibly damaged. Basically, Pride and Prejudice focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, a young and independent woman whose mother is trying to marry off her and her sisters to the highest bidder. They have several suitors, including Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham. At first glance, Pride and Prejudice seems just like a regular Regency romance (making you wonder why it is such a widely acclaimed book); however, it is much more than that.In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen offers social commentary on a wide range of subjects, including corruption of the Church, marriage, and women's rights. In addition, each time I read it, I realize more and more that not only is Jane Austen a genius, but she also has a great sense of humor (this can been seen through Mr. Collins, the wordy church leader, Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's social-climbing mother, and many of the other characters). Several of the minor characters are used as stereotypes in order to get Austen's point across (for example, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, one of the snobbiest rich women in all of literature, and Lydia, Elizabeth's flighty youngest sister).Even if you don't care about Jane Austen's views on the society of her time, Pride and Prejudice still offers a lot. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have perfect chemistry, as do Jane and Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth is way ahead of her time--no women of her stature were expected to be picky about who they married, but Elizabeth is not willing to settle for anything but the best. Then of course, there's the idea that you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of your opinions about others (hence the name Pride and Prejudice).This book is great for everyone-it contains romance, comedy, and even politics of Austen's time. Although the language might be hard to understand at first, it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the best book I have ever read.

I highly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you like this kind of story...Pride and Prejudice is the best relationship story I have ever read. There have been many off-springs, sequels, movies etc. in the tradition of P&amp;P. Jane Austen is the master of interpersonal relationships and her tales take us back to a gentle era where things not being equal, women have to make the most of whatever situation they are born into. Austen introduces us to Elizabeth Bennett, a strong woman who is a devoted sister and daughter and very honest with her heart. She has become one of my favorite heroines in Literature not only because of her heart, but also for her ability to grow. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book was watching as the main characters are transformed throughout the telling. Mr. Darcy, who is perhaps one of the more idealized men in fiction, recognizes his weaknesses through Elizabeth and she in turn learns from him.The cast of characters are some of Austen's most unforgettable. Mr. Collins the dim-witted cousin who thinks he is quite a pious man and a good catch for any women. The annoyingly cheeky Lydia, Mrs. Bennett the nagging mother with not much upstairs, but good intentions none the less, and many more. They all held my interest throughout the book and left me wanting more of them. I highly recommend this book to be read and re-read many times. You will see how great characters are developed and a great relationship is formed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride And Prejudice, two of the worst things in our society (since like...forever). Elizabeth Bennet is a strong, fiesty, witty and attractive young woman who, with her five sisters and onlooking snobbish mother, finds her unexpected true love. At their first meeting, Mr. Darcy, a very wealthy very arrogant young man, shuns Elizabeth unintentially. But later, he begins to admire her and her frankness to him.

When I was young, I read Nancy Drew, Perry Mason, and Agatha Christie novels like food. I found the titles of such classics as Pride and Predjudice, One Flew over the cuckoos nest, The Great Gatsby, Death of a Saleman, and Wuthering Heights, to be pretentious; and if they didn't have murder and suspense, I didn't bother opening the cover. But one day while watching A&amp;E, I saw a glimpse of the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, and I was hooked. I was amazed that a book written way before my time could be of any worth. After watching the movie, I picked up the book, and read it from cover to cover. I found that Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett were intriguing characters, and I was utterly surprised when Mr. Darcy confessed his &quot;ardent love&quot; for her, also when he wrote the long letter of rebuttal to her claims to his bad character. At first, you despise Mr. Darcy, but as the book progresses, you find yourself liking him more and more. This whole book was very well-written and interesting, and now ranks with my favorite novels of all time, along with the classics listed above. For those who don't see how special and unique this book is, I suggest that you watch the video (starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth), because anyone who has ever seen it that i know of has turned into a huge english literature fan."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book gets better with time.

That's how my favourite book of all time begins, and it just keeps getting better.This novel deals with the pride and prejudices of the main characters Miss Elizabeth Bennett, and Mr. Darcy, as they try to find true love in pre-Victorian England. Elizabeth is a gentleman's daughter and Mr. Darcy is a gentleman, but Elizabeth, along with the rest of her sisters, are not good catches because, their inheritance is being entailed away to their cousin Mr. Collins, leaving them with very miserable looking dowries. Along with poor family connections, they stand little chance of marrying well or at all; they only have their charms to help them.That is until Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood along with his sisters, and accompanying them his close friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley becomes captivated with Jane Bennett, Elizabeth's eldest sister, and Mr. Darcy has an eye for Elizabeth herself, but can he see past her poor conditions, and can she see past his pride in order for them to get together? That's the question that keeps the audience captivated right up to the end.I try and find time to read this book at least once a year, and I've been doing that for a few years, and yet, it's always fresh when a get around to reading it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I was 12 years old and had the rare privilege of going shopping alone with my Mum. (With 2 sisters and a brother, this event was EXTREMELY rare.) I asked if we could browse in the book store. Half an hour later, we emerged. I was carrying a paperbag in which was enclosed my first copy of 'Pride and Prejudice'. As soon as we got in the car I started reading. I finished the book that night and I started it again the next morning. Even at 12 years old, I knew I was experiencing a masterpiece. In the 15 years since that day I have revisited the story of Elizabeth and Darcy numerous times. It just keeps getting better and better. Elizabeth was my idol. Darcy replaced Prince Philip, (from Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty'), as the man of my dreams. Mrs Bennett's nerves began to irk me as much as they did the long-suffering Mr Bennett. I love this book and I can't even begin to praise it, and the wonderful Jane Austen, enough. If you haven't read it - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? If you have read it, I think its time to get it off your shelf, or get down to the library and relive the magic of 'Pride and Prejudice' all over again."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although it has to be called a romance, I personally feel that the fascination is much more about the rules of behavior and courtship in Victorian society. The same story set in the modern day would not be nearly so interesting because you no longer have the rules to navigate that are present in the time in which it is set. It is the compliance with these rules and the reaction when they are not followed properly that makes the social structure of the time (as it is presented here) more like a chess game than a simple romance story. This given with characters and settings that have a feel to them that reminds me of Little Women made this book a great deal of fun to read. It was fast paced with plenty of intrigues.The back of my book puts the entire plot into one short paragraph. I was at first concerned that this would take the fun out of the reading since who marries who in the end was spelled out right there. However, in reading it I realized that it is not WHAT happens in this book as much as it is HOW it happens and in this Austen is a true master. Essentially the story is of the five daughters of the Bennett family. The addle-brained mother has no other concern than to marry her daughters off and the detached father generally just makes fun of the whole situation. Jane and Elizabeth are the two eldest daughters and Jane forms an attachment early on to Bingley, a gentleman who has leased a house/estate nearby. When a pompous Mr. Darcy interferes in Jane's attachment to Bingley, Elizabeth is turned vehemently against him - a sentiment further deepened by aspersions made by Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy's father's godchild. As fate would have it, Mr. Darcy develops an attachment to Elizabeth and has to redeem himself in her eyes, despite his feelings of social superiority and her many resentments.I don't know if the title is to reflect the pride of Mr. Darcy and the prejudice of Elizabeth against him. At one point she says the following: \\" Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\\" I see her really exploring this in the character of Mr. Darcy and his relations and feel that the title may have more to do with the exploration of this sentiment than in any of the individual characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"For the typical male, the only thing worse than reading a romance novel is reading a two-hundred-year-old romance novel. So why'd I bother? Because I'm a firm believer that serious readers should occasionally expand their horizons and sample books from other genres, especially those they'd normally pooh-pooh. Because that's when we get pleasantly surprised.Pride and Prejudice fell into this category for me. I wanted a break from the mystery/suspense genre and had heard good things about Jane Austen. As I dug in, my expectations were met early on: plodding, expository chunks of Old English describing landscapes and feelings. Ugh. But then she got me.Like peeling an onion, Austen uncovers characters and a story that are simply genius. Like Shakespeare, she proves again that time and technology have no impact on basic human impulses and the complexities of love. This book will be just as popular in another two hundred years. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My 13 year old daughter and I just finished reading this book and LOVED it! As we read the book, we kept noticing that many of the characters remind us of people we know! It was funny, and really says a lot for Jane Austen's insight on human nature. Her characters are very realistic in my opinion.We learned from the book that in Jane Austen's time in England, it was very important to say and do the right things and to be excruciatingly polite. P&amp;P can be tedious to read until you get used to the way they talk, but once you do it really makes it even more amusing to read.I tried to read P&amp;P once before a few years ago, but I only got about a third of the way through the book. I just couldn't understand it well enough. I would recommend to anyone who was put off by the book to give it another chance. See one of the excellent videos first if you don't understand it, and then come back and literally FEAST on the book, which is so much better! I know that reading it has expanded my ability to appreciate good literature, and I know I will read all of Jane Austen's novels now."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In case you are wondering, the novel it tied with is Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.I have read this three times in three sittings.

I once stayed up all night long to finish it.Actually, I read it a fourth time, aloud to my then 8-year-old daughter Elizabeth (who was delighted to find an Elizabeth in the book). She liked it so much that she in turn read it twice. Just one of the great, irrestible book in the English language."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most-beloved novels by Jane Austen. Words cannot do it justice, but I'll try anyway, since I love it so much. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is absolutely timeless. From the opening line, which is my all-time favorite opening line- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large portion must be in want of a wife,\\" we are drawn into this superb love affair, one which it is difficult to pull ourselves away from. I've read this book numerous times now and I always wonder what's going to happen.Here Jane Austen uses a sufficient amount of wit to satirize the social graces and foibles of the middle and upper classes in Regency England. From the modest Bennet family, with its five daughters, to Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, to whom social class is everything, we are given a superb picture of life as Austen saw it.There's also an undercurrent theme in which not everything is what it seems to be. Darcy is not the proud, cold gentleman he seems, nor is Elizabeth as feisty as she appears to others. And, while Elizabeth certainly understands the intents of others, she does not necessarily understand the workings of her own heart."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Not bad overall, but missing punctuation and some half sentences serve to pull the reader out of the story. Unfortunate, as this is one story in which the reader hopes to get perfectly lost."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally \\"learnt the language,\\" and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Let me tell you about my first impression of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. At the age of thirteen, it was one of the most amazing love stories I had ever read. Five years later, it became one of the most wittily crafted stories I had ever read. By the time I was twenty-one, it was the finest work of literature I had ever experienced.Elizabeth Bennet is a byproduct of genteel poverty. The second daughter of five, she possesses the most sense, tact, poise, and sound judgement of the family in general. On the other hand, she is also irreverent, daring, and judgemental. She stretches the envelope of what might be construed as &quot;polite&quot; society. She also acknowledges the limitations of her gender even as she subtly tries to defy them.As a part of the landed gentry, Mr. Darcy is the embodiment of all that is dignified and honored. He is a gentleman who was born to privilege and money. His kind make up the &quot;polite society&quot; Elizabeth dares to flout. His pride, his disdain, and his arrogance make him unappealing to the people of Longbourn, as well as the community surrounding it. It is his interference with the relationship between his friend and her beloved sister, however, which is a personal affront to Elizabeth.It is fortuitous that Austen retitled her book because First Impressions does not begin to touch upon the complexities that Pride and Prejudice, as a title, connotes. In Darcy and Elizabeth, Austen has drawn two very complex characters who, on the one hand, seem simply drawn and characterized, but on the other, are so much more than they seem. It would be easy to say that Darcy is arrogant and Elizabeth is willful. The truth is, looking beyond my own first impression, as a reader, Austen has deceptively crafted two characters whose thoughts and actions make it clear that they aptly straddle both of the title characteristics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Love this book and have read it many times and will read it again.Ifirst read Pride and Predjest in the 40st when I was in High School.

Also, there were a couple additional characters and some of the dialogue was switched between characters, which made more sense than even in the more recent version of the film.

Amazing story, beautifully written."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"O.K. I would call myself a well-versed reader in popular books. I would also call Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen quite possibly the most well-written book in the past 300 years.As soon as you pick up this book, your mind is forming hypothoses about the rest of the book. The weird thing is that ABSOLUTLY NONE of them happen. Yet, at the end, you are not only as happy with the conclusion as you would have been with your own ideas, but happier. That kind of literary psycological euphoria cannot be and has not been acheived by any other author that I have ever read.This book leaves you with a feeling of absolute feclicity. I cried with joy the first time I read it, and had to reread the ending twice. In other words, it has a very happy ending! That has certainly been attempted by every tale from Cinderella to the Harry Potter books, yet Austen's ending is unique as her ending is perfectly real. It not only seems realistic, but, in hindsight, any other resolution to her book seems ludicrous.Her characters are vivid. They are complex yet you see them as if they could be you own mother, sister, father, brother, friend, foe, or aquaintance. You not only warm to her heroes and heroines, but Austen leads you to feel a fiery hatred of her vilains and vilainesses.Her writing is intricate. You are left feeling not only perfectly satisfied with this book, but want more. She is not only an excalent writer but a perfect one. Thius book is her masterpiece. It has comedy, tradjedy, richness, irony, love, and loss. It many complex facets gleam like diamonds. I am in awe of this book. I beseach you: READ PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"In college, Iw as supposed to read this book. But I never did because I just assumed it would be boring. Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.I think my vision of reading Jane Austen always has me curled up in a chair while it's snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on. That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: &quot;Guns and Ammo&quot; and &quot;Field and Stream&quot;. Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea. I brought the book with me to read, but didn't really think I would get all that much reading of it done. True, I was reading it for fun, but it was Jane Austen after all, and I wasn't sure if I could really concentrate on her. Well, 200 pages later, bringing that novel with me was the best decision I ever made. 4 years later, I still rememebr how into this book I got. (I even had to take a walk around the block before I read the last chapter just to prolong finishing the story.) Once the story did end, I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends.This book is riveting, it's fun, it's hysterical (wait for the rewarding confrontation between Lady Catherine deBourgh and Elizabeth...it's not only a battle of tongues, but a great clash of the &quot;refined&quot; yet uneducated upper classes, and the middle classes of Regentry England. This is by far my favorite Austen novel of the bunch (with Emma coming in a close second). So, this winter, wait for a snowy day (heck, choose any day, you can't have a bad Austen day) and get ready to be taken away. And no.. this book is not solely the domain of high school etachers and academians.. you'll be surprised how much you may enjoy it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"&quot;~Though only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion.&quot;~ table, class and late into the night, I read my beloved Pride and Prejudice.

I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in every essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice is a beautifully written love story, full of humor and life-like imagery. The characters Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are both carved out nicely, with Austen's acute sense about how both men and women think and perceive beauty, love, society. The novel is a compelling read, and for diehard romantics like me, it is irresistable to the end. While Sense and Sensibility moves more slowly, and likewise also dwells on stories of two sisters, there the love stories are presented with maze of other matter. Here the hero must overcome his pride, the heroine must fight a battle with her prejudices, and both then discover not only love in each other but their real selves. Additional stories and people appear perfectly developed in their own roles of lovers, parents, friends, envious relations, grumpy grandmothers, lively teenagers, etc. The drama of a great movie or a soap opera is all here, with Austen's simple and elegant story telling.Many sequences and sentences are purely delightful or extermely hilarious, making the novel one of those reads where you are caught laughing aloud or smiling with twinkle your eyes alone, as you are relishing the new turn of events. While the story is set in Victorian era, the characters, emotions and humor is timeless. The novel is an easy read, fit for travel reading as well as for fun, and trust me, the romantic in you will be raving about it for a long time! In fact, two movies compelled me to reread the novel recently: Gurinder Chadda's Bride and Prejudice that reinvents the classic in a Bollywood flavor and Tom Hanks- Meg Ryan Starrer You've got mail. In You've Got Mail there are repeated references to the novel, and to the extent the opposites attract, and essential elements of novel are concerned, the movie is like a reincarnated version of the novel.Citation from You've Got MailConfession: I have read Pride and Prejudice about 200 times. I get lost in the language-words like thither, mischance, felicity. I'm always in agony over whether Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are really going to get together. Read it - I know you'll love it.Meg Ryan's character, to her anonymous email friend, Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail.(the reference to the movie is for those who have seen and like the movie, else the novel is intrinsically enjoyable, and even for those who have seen this movie or the movie based on the novel, worth spending a fun-filled reading time with.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, follows society's elite through the trials and tribulations of love, pride, money, and marriage negotiations. This novel takes place in 19th century England and revolves around the slow development of love found between two characters. The first of these characters is Elizabeth Bennet, a clever, beautiful, and spirited young woman. Pride and Prejudice begins, when Mrs. Bennet asks Mr. Bennet to call on their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley has an income of 5 thousand pounds a year and is not married, so Mrs. Bennet hopes to marry one of her 5 daughters to him. Jane, the eldest daughter, and Mr. Bingley begin to like each other during a ball. Elizabeth, the second oldest, meets Mr. Darcy at the same ball. Darcy initially does not care for Elizabeth, and refuses to even dance with her.However, as Elizabeth grows to dislike Darcy, Darcy starts to become very fond of her. She and Darcy meet again when she stays with Mr. Bingley, because her sister, Jane, has taken ill at their house. Ms. Bingley, the sister of Mr. Bingley, herself hopes to wed Darcy, and seeks to make Elizabeth less appealing to Darcy. After Jane's recovery she and Elizabeth return home. There they welcomed to their home by their cousin Mr. Collins, who, because of the inheritance customs of the times (the Bennet girls had no brothers), was the heir to the Bennet family home. Together, Elizabeth and her family travel to town, where they met Mr. Wickham. Mr. Wickham notices Elizabeth, who he found charming, and describes to her a terrible deed he alleges Darcy had committed against him. Wickham claimed that Darcy owed him money and had denied him of a promised avocation. This new information causes Elizabeth to despise Darcy even more.Soon Mr. Collins, the rather odd clergyman, proposes to Elizabeth. To her mother's dismay, she refuses him. Instead, her friend Charlotte Lucas marries Mr. Collins, and Elizabeth goes to visit them and their neighbor the great Lady Catherine De Bourgh. During her stay Elizabeth sees Darcy again, and he proposes. Elizabeth refuses, reciting all the terrible things he had done, including the mistreatment of Wickham. In response, Darcy writes Elizabeth explaining how Wickham had tried to elope with his sister because of her money. Elizabeth is forced to rethink, her opinions relating to Darcy and Wickham.That summer Elizabeth traveled to Pemberly on holiday with her aunt and uncle, and while there her aunt and uncle wanted to see the beautiful Darcy estate. While visiting, Darcy showed up. Darcy and his sister heartily welcomed Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, and invited them to dinner. Elizabeth began to grow fonder of Darcy. Dreadful news arrived during Elizabeth's stay at Pemberly. Her frivolous younger sister Lydia had run off with Wickham. Upon learning of the circumstances, Darcy sought out and found Wickham and Lydia, forcing them to marry. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle returned to the Bennet home.Bingley and Darcy together visited the Bennet household to call upon Jane and Elizbeth. Jane became engaged to Bingley, and when Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, her heart had changed, so she said yes. Elizabeth had fallen in love Darcy. They had both seen past their pride and past the prejudices that they had learned from society. Elizabeth and Darcy were happy in marriage, and remained forever grateful to Elisabeth's aunt and uncle for uniting them.I would recommend the book Pride and Prejudice. It forces each of us to think about our roles in life. The novel also makes us think about our own pride and our own prejudices against others, and the need for us to learn more about people before we judge them. This book is also one of the greatest Romances of all time, bringing to life the love that a man and a woman held for each other from another era. It provides meaningful messages that all of us should learn. The characters are also interesting. This book is good for people who understand the use of language in the 19th century. Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel that I love, and believe everyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I bought the set of audiotapes with no particular expectations, and I am pleasantly surprised. Ms Sharon Williams's reading is amazingly smooth, natural, and she depicts the personalities of each character with the intonations of her voice so perfectly that it always sound like there's more than one person reading, even though she doesn't alter her voice. I am particularly amazed by her rendition of Mrs Bennet. I can almost see the woman when I hear the talk!As an American, I am not fond of British accents, and I am happy to hear that Ms Williams read with some British influence, but it is overall pleasant and easy for me to understand. (In contrast, I dislike the accents on the Harry Potter movies.)I highly recommend this product.(If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice yet and is wondering if you should, the answer is yes! The classics are usually a drag to read, but not Pride and Prejudice. It moves fast, it is witty, insightful, and the language is easy to understand. I think it is the best book among the classics.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is viewed as one of the finest novels ever written, and rightfully so. Despite being only 22 years old when the original manuscript was finished, Austen displays an astonishing mastery of the English language that has rarely been equalled. The prose is so expertly constructed that the book maintains a brisk pace throughout and never becomes dull. Being so heavily dialogue-based, it's critical that the conversations in this book keep the reader interested. Fortunately, the snappy dialogue is what makes this book really shine. The characterization is nothing short of brilliant, from the silly Mrs. Bennett to the intolerable Mr. Collins. Despite the fact that nothing truly exciting ever happens, you'll find yourself desperate to turn the next page. I could not possibly recommend this book more."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This classic Jane Austen novel is one of my all-time favorites and I loved the novel on my Kindle as well.

This CD version is much better and I would highly recommend it, except... Normal audio CDs have tracks that correspond with the chapters. Not this one. The tracks were in random places (in the middle of a paragraph, even in the middle of sentences!) so trying to find the right chapter to start on required some detective work.

The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist.

I\`m that sucker who is always looking for a great romance novel or movie to captivate me and make me fall into the wonders of love overcoming all obstacles. So, yes, you could say I have seen and read my fair share of love stories, but this is the best.I first read this book when I was 12 after hearing incessesantly about how it was such a classic and a must-read (and of course I heard it was a romance, so that little fact right there solidified any scruples that I may have had at the time). I was mesmerized.Yes, of course it was rather difficult to understand the language at first and I did expect that. Instantly, though, I read it a second time and I locked in with Austen\`s flow of words and the sensations that I went through while reading her novel were incredible.Elizebeth Bennet is such a fantastic and relatable character and I believe any woman can relate to her. She\`s dignified and witty, but at the same time she\`s shy and believable. She\`s never ridiculous or over the top. Mr. Darcy....where do I begin? The changes in him and Elizabeth are just incredible and no matter how many times I read this book I can\`t help but fall in love with them all over again. Mrs. Bennet is truly ridiculous, but she means well. Mr. Bennet is a man who always settles and never really has determination to go ahead. He keeps to himself, sometimes it seems like he even avoids the truth of things unless it becomes dreadfully grave. Nonetheless, a great character. Mr. Collins; What a man! He will keep you laughing at how absolutely ridiculous he is. And Elizabeth\`s younger sisters are truly precious. Jane and Bingley are sweet and endearing. Miss Bingley is the perfect &#34;mean girl&#34;. Mr. Wickham is delightfully decieving and really supports the phrase, &#34;Looks are decieving.&#34; And lastly, the Gardiners are easily my favorite characters after Elizabeth and Darcy.The whole plot is wonderfully paced, and I will confess that first time reading it that it may seem slow and boring. But, when you really take the time to delve into Jane Austen\`s world and understand the truths that she expresses with such precision that still resonate in todays society, you really become intranced. You really feel like you know the characters and maybe even recognize the truth in them and recognize people you know. Austen was insightful and really understood people and characters and the morals of her time. She was brillant and I really wonder what it would be like to have met her if she was alive today. Pride ad Prejudice is my favorite novel and I really hope this review has done is justice. This is the best of the best and it will forever remain my favorite novel.Thank you Jane Austen for sharing with the world your characters and your truths."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"love this classic!!! only, what's with the incomplete names/titles? eg: ----shire ?

I like Jane and her shyness. I LOVED Bingley and his charismatic charm. I also really love Mr Bennet and his sense of humor. Mrs Bennet & Lydia Bennet on the other hand were those characters you alway wanted to smack in the face for being so stupid...like so:And then there is Darcy.... At first, like everyone else, I wasn't very into him. He was standoffish and he insulted Elizabeth behind her back mere moments after meeting her! Seriously, what is wrong with you dude? I was fuming as much as Elizabeth...but then you realize that he is shy and awkward when conversing with people he doesn't know and he does all this amazing stuff just to help Elizabeth. I followed Elizabeth right down the rabbit whole when she started to fall for Darcy.My only real complaint, oddly enough, was the prose. I truly did not expect the way it was written to bug me. I am an historical romance novel fanatic so you would assume that this would be right up my alley, no?But it really wasn't. Apparently I only like to listen to them speak this way, not read it. When I hear them speak, it's like aw! He is paying her an extreme compliment and using all these pretty words. When I read it, the dialogue I can handle, but the entire page of description that basically amounts to \\"they lived in a large house called Longbourne that had many rooms and a lot of land with woods\\"....well I wasn't so into that. And when Mr Collins spoke, I had the biggest urge to just yell at him to spit it out already! Seriously dude, pull your head out of Lady Catherine's ass and speak for yourself! Stop paying Lady Catherine compliments every other word! Trust me, we understand that you think she is the awesome.Wow...this is probably the crappiest review I have ever written, but seriously there are tons of reviews out there that really explain what this book is about as well as several films, so if my review has left you confused, please go consult one of them (or just google it) and they will answers your numerous questions."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"There's not much new to say about Jane Austen though in my experience readers of classic novels either love her or hate her.

She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be hard to put down,"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"who doesn't love this book?

Now that I have a Kindle and many of the classics are free I couldn't resist. I recalled that the dialogue in the series was almost verbatim from the book but I hadn't read the book in so many years that I couldn't recall how well the rest matched up. They are different because the book does a lot of narration that in the film had to be shown by activity, so it gives a different insight into your favorite characters. I was delighted to find so much in the book not in the series.The book is a perfect delight and it obvious why this treasure by Jane Austin ranks so high in the lists of English literature. Austin's skill at dialogue, character and plot development are unmatched. I had intended to just skim the book to pick up the pieces I wanted but I read every word and was delighted with the extra sections in the book not in the series. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I just finished reading the book about half an hour ago. I read it in almost two weeks, since the complexity of my life's schedule did not let me finish it in less time. Let me assure you that it is a good title, and I look forward to reading more on Jane Austen. I enjoyed the reading so much in my Kindle that one day was reading at the University, waiting for some Registration assistance, and I began laughing on the occurrences of Lady de Bourgh at Longbourn.I gave this title a 4 star review since some formatting problems on the Kindle edition; including capital letters where there was no need, word and line spacing, and not coming with a list of the Chapters to be read.Although I found these errors sometimes annoying, I enjoyed quite much the experience of reading this ebook, since I never thought I would enjoy an 1800's title.Enjoy your reading!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this book because I have been trying to catch up on some classics of literature that I haven't read. I expected to find it to be boring and stuffy, but I vowed that I would read it. To my great fortune, my prejudice against the book turned out to be completely wrong. It is wonderful book and a great read. It is witty, funny, and perceptive, with great insights into human relationships and the structure of society during its era (late eighteenth century England)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I've read this book so often, I can actually quote word for word. Within the first few pages you forget which century you're in, and really feel for Elizabeth and Jane as their sisters and mother embarrass them in society. You feel poor Darcy's bemusement at falling in love with someone from a (perceived) lower class, and you ache for Lizzie to unbend a little and cut the guy some slack. When they finally get it on, I breathe a huge sigh of relief that everything's turned out so wonderfully. Yes, even though I must have read it over a hundred times. And that's timeless fiction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Please note that this review is on the hard cover edition offered here via Barns and Noble. Amazon, for reasons known only to themselves, have chosen to lump every review of the classic piece of literature together no matter the format. As I go through these reviews I find that hard cover editions, e-books, books on tape, unknown bindings, paperbacks and I don't know what all have all been thrown into the same bag.Let me be perfectly honest and tell you that as far as Austen's work itself, I would give it ten stars if that were possible. This is NOT a review of her work though, rather a review of this particular edition...as stated above. I recently went of a book buying spree for my wife to replace worn out, lost (she is a great loaner of books and many of those loaned books never find there way home), and simply misplaced books. She, like me, is a big Austen fan.Anyway, the Barns and Noble edition book described on this product page is a very fine book when you consider the cost. It is difficult to find a decent paperback book these days, much less a hardback version of anything that does not cost an arm and a leg if bought new.Now so with this printed hard back version. The book is well made. The paper, while not of fine are quality, is certainly nice enough. The binding appears quite good...I know about such things and for a mass produced books this is about as good as you are going to find anywhere. The cost is more than reasonable . (Hey...a supersized extra value meal will cost you more), and font used is extremely readable and easy on the eyes.If you order this book you must pay shipping charges; something to consider. I personally bought mine, along with a number of the \`classics' in this series directly at a B&N; store, (We drive to the big city at least every other month), thus saving the cost of S&H.;For a big bang for your buck, I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this one.As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so. You are in for a true reading treat. If you have read it before, then read it again! If you are one of those that simply do no like Austen's work...well, don't read it at all!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I consider myself a moderately well read person, as I have read a few of the must read classics, yet I had not embarked on one of literature's most celebrated journey, the journey into the land of Longbourn and Pemberly as seen in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. A few years ago I selected the book to attempt to read it, but I became immediately bored with the literature and tossed it aside, deciding against finishing it.I came across a book claiming to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice (and a bad sequel I must say) and I decided to give the classic another try.I cannot ascertain why, but this time, something was changed. Before I finished the first chapter, I was completely entranced in the story of the Bennet's and later, Darcy and the Bingelys.At first, I was completely ignorant of the time period's lingo and I was flailing, reading slowly to completely understand the richness of the grand words. But by the middle of the book, I was fluent in the old English tongue and my native tongue, American English, was past.The plot and dialogue was like no other book I have had the pleasure of reading. The sheer brilliance of Austen's artfully crafted words and wonderful plot left me wishing the book would never reach its finish.But it did.I nearly cried when I bid farewell to my newly acquainted friends, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, Georgiana Darcy, Mr. Bingely, Charlotte Lucas, and the laughable Mr. Collins. An emptiness accompanied me, as I put the book the down, the aching, despairing emptiness that makes you wish that you were in the book, and lucky enough to know the characters.And this is why I encourage you to pick up Pride and Prejudice. You may be like me and either be intimidated by the vast use of vocabulary or have sampled the book before and found it not to your taste.I urge you to try again. All it took was another try and just like that, I was in love with the book forever.Look past the hard words or the moderate length and look directly into a charming book that is sure to captivateyou and draw you in as it did me.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless classic, full of eloquent words, beautiful romance, and a few twist and turns. Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite book and will always have a hallowed spot on my bookshelf.Is anyone else in love with Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I can't even begin to tell you all how much I loved this book (I loved it most ardently!). It was sweet, heartfelt and real! I felt connected to the characters in a way that I have never been connected with a character before, and that's saying a lot because I'm a very intense reader. I ususally grieve when I finish a book I love, and this was no exception. I think I'm still grieving a little, and It's been almost a week since I've read it!Jane Austen is one of the most if not THE most admirable writers of all time. You can't stay out of her stories. SHe grabs you and pulls you right in there with Elizabeth and Darcy and everyone else, making you fall in love with each and every character deeply."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have always loved reading a good book but I am a romantic at heart and when I started searching for Kindle freebies I came across many different categories of authors. (My mind likes to organise and categorize things). There are the Christian romance authors who explicitly introduce concepts of God and his love for us as they enfold and develop the love story between the main characters. There are the Sex-driven romance authors who give you great details on the physical attraction between the characters and then give you a front row seat (in your imagination of course) to all or some of the sexual experiences in the story. There are the sci-fi based romance authors whose love stories are mystical and many times quite unthinkable. And of course there are the action based romances where the hero is invariably going to end up in some situation (like a fight or car chase) where his machoism will be displayed to the full appreciation of the heroine. And then there are the Historical romance authors who may take any of the aforementioned slants but just given from a historical stand point. Their stories tend to have lot of substance since their work is more often than not well researched and offer detiails and facts of how society and life in general was in the past.Jane Austen's work in Pride and Prejudice falls into none of my categories. You see although she mentions that the characters went to church, she never quite gave us a sermon. Even the value of sex within marriage was the standard of the day and as she dealt with this topic it was in no way an attempt to be \\"preachy\\". It is not sex-driven for there are no sex scenes and quite frankly many physical details on the characters are missing and instead an overview of the person's features are simply stated as \\"Mr. Darcy was tall and handsome\\". There was no mysticism or any element of science fiction and the greatest action any of the characters indulged in was taking a walk. The men did not even work hard but rather spent a lot of time reading in their libraries or playing indoor games (like cards). And while we read of carriages and horses and an England of long ago, the truth of the matter is that this is neither the work of a historical romance author because Ms. Austen wrote about her own time and the dependence of women on marriage for economic security and as a means to escape social ridicule and shame. And yet it is a wonderful and probably the best romance story I have ever read (even though I hace not yet categorized it) and not because of its quite ancient philosophies of women but because it is so frank and honest when told through the eyes of the female protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet.It is a pure work of art and Ms. Austen not only transported me to a different time but to a different place and I was amazed at how enthralled I was at this very \\"wordy\\" books. Yes I love words too but there is a definite art in the way she strung words together with witticism and/or sarcasm for the various dialogue scenes.When held up next to this masterpiece, many modern day romance stories look so immature and hurried. Their creators would do well to read literature such as this! This book has stood the test of time!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I absolutely adored the movie Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightley. I then thought it would be fun to read the original novel on my new Kindle. Even though it took me three days to read it I was not dissapointed. I had the movie running in my mind the entire time I was reading so I was able to compare the movie with the novel. I must say it enhanced the experience. I so loved each time Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy communicated in any way. Just reading their conversations was such a delight. The book really filled in all the conversations that didn't make it into the movie.This story reveals how it is possible to go from hating someone to loving them completely. The journey Elizabeth must go through to love Mr. Darcy is fascinating and complex. There are many letters exchanged and gossip Elizabeth must sort through to find the truth. The reader really feels the hatred she feels and then feels the warming of the heart as each page goes by. Truly this is one of the best romance novels ever written. I'd recommend you watch the movie first and then you will have something to compare this to.

I think that this is most definitely one of the best novels written in the English language. Jane Austen explores the relationships between different sets of people. At the age of 16, I was never really into the \\"Classic novels\\", but when a friend recommended the book, and I saw the movie (which does not do the novel justice), I decided to try. I instantly fell in love with the characters and Jane Austen's works.

The articulate language and complex characters draw the reader into the story of sisters trying to find their place in life. The way in which it is written is rare to find in today's society, creating a sense of mystery and the unknown about society of the past. Elizabeth Bennett, the heroine of the novel, is a character that is easily relatable to for women both in the time that it was written and for modern women today. She struggles internally to find where her heart truly belongs, and leads the reader to question whether they themselves are actually proud and/or prejudiced."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"As a high school student I was not sure I would like this book at all. This book was an easy read because of how well it was written and how much the story grabs on to you. Ever since reading this book I have gone on to read all of Jane Austen's book and found that they were equally as good."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel that explores how love fits into a society consumed by an obsession with marriage. As expected from a nineteenth century British novel highlighting upper society, Jane Austen's writing uses a proper and sophisticated syntax. Working with the dignified tone, the syntax often coats the characters' bluntness and turns them into seemingly kinder remarks. These situations tend to be the most humorous, because the readers and the characters all know what is being said beneath all the comments. These dialogues also add important dimension to all of the characters. For example, Elizabeth is very witty and can uphold amusing and complex conversations with Mr. Darcy, but afterward her reflections show that she has insecurities despite her verbal strength. Without the depth of Elizabeth's character as well as the depth of the other characters, the novel would seem much longer and more dragged out than it can be at times. If the readers have the patience to get through some of the slower parts and can focus on the brilliant interactions between the characters, then they will be incredibly satisfied at the end of the beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I first read this book this past school year (11th grade), with a teacher who is an active JANSA Member (The Jane Austen Society of North America). The one thing I will always remember from him, was that in this book the characters are so real that you can see them in your everyday life. Along with my teacher we took a trip down to memory lane and saw all of Jane's characters in his High School (he wrote this as an essay he read at a JANSA congregation). And of course he ended by finding his Elizabeth, who's name is actually Jane (ironic isn't it?).I TRULY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Meet the Bennet sisters: demure Jane, witty Elizabeth, bookish Mary, impressionable Kitty, and lusty Lydia. It's the usual story: they don't have much in the way of dowries but need to marry upstanding English gentlemen...Elizabeth Bennet quickly emerges as the heroine with her wry sense of humor and take-no-prisoners attitude to social life. She puts all twentieth century heroines to shame when she tells off Mr. Darcy (while maintaining perfect decorum). Unusual twists and turns spark up the &quot;marriage plot&quot; of the book. There are some great villains, too."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Let this serve as a warning that at least one of the reviews below details most of the plot developments of this most endearing of English novels.

I was suprised because a lot of people said it was boring. It was boring at first, but if you stick to it and make yourself read it it will get better. I recommend this book to people who like to read romance. The characters are very well developed and the theme of the story is good."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"With pride and Prejudice Austen has at last created a heroine that does not go to pieces at the first sight of an eligible young man. elizabeth Bennett's mind rules her heart not the other way around. thus Mr. Darcy who is attracted to her must first prove his love and loyalty before Elizabeth will consider him. this novel is one of austne's finest and I found myself captured by the story. In those days marriage was essential to a woman's happiness and thus she strove to do all in her power to find a suitable match. it is a task that frankly has not totally died even today despite all the social change that has taken place since this book was written. One has to wonder what Austen would think if she was alive today. the main message of this novel is not to rush to judgement in regards to others. A notion wich still holds great importance. Though at times a little too lighthearted this book nevertheless is an enjoyable read or in my case a listen. Naxos did a great job in making Austen's novel come alive. the narrator read the text with the right amount of tone and intonation and the classical music breaks between scenes was a nice touch. When it comes to audio classics noe one does it better then Naxos. I will have to buy more of Austne's work done by them.this audiobook contains 3 CD's and is abridged; yet i do not think i have missed anything in regards to the overall story. I found listneing to the book very pleasing and will be a fine addition to my audio library."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is only the second Jane Austen book that I have read, but certainly not the last! Though the numerous characters and complex sentences provide the reader with a challenge and requires some concentration, the end result is definitely rewarding. Complicated characters and complicated relationships leave the reader constantly on their toes, and you never know what to expect next. What's so wonderful about this book is that the characters are so real. There are so many memorable characters in this story about Mrs. Bennet attempting to marry off her five daughters, and these characters aren't perfect, merely human, making them easy to relate to as well as laugh at. In reading this book, you see yourself in the same tough situations and awkward moments as them and realize that we sometimes forget that we don&iexcl;t have to be flawless. Everyone is proud and prejudiced at sometime or another; we aren't perfect, and it's okay!Though perhaps an easier read than Emma, Pride and Prejudice is similar in that it is also full of the same brilliant dialogue and subtle humor. This book is great for anyone who is interested in a romantic comedy that will that twirl you around with its genius and surprises."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It seems like a simple statement. Mr. Darcy, the hero of our novel, simply doesn't have time to write to his overbearing aunt to inform her of his engagement to be married. But, like most things in Jane Austen, it has more meanings than one.I will be the first to admit that the plot of the novel is transperent. Anyone who has read a romance can see from the outset that Darcy and Lizzy (a.k.a. Elizabeth Bennet) will end up with each other. The only question is how, why, when, and who will be affected. To find that out, you'll have to read the story. I don't believe I'm giving anything away by saying that the seemingly sub-human Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's got quite a name, has he not?) will thaw eventually, and that Lizzy will warm to his new, altered state. For, simply put, the point of the novel is not the story, but the beautiful prose and dialogue. The deliciously satisfying banter of the newly-engaged Darcy and Lizzy in Chapter 18 of Part Three (some versions are not divided into parts, but I trust you can find this chapter) leaves you tingling with glorious anticipation of their soon to be union.The reader will thrill when he calls her &quot;Elizabeth&quot; for the first time (as opposed to a cold &quot;Miss Bennet&quot;), and the effect is somewhat heightened by his adding a passtionate &quot;dearest, lovliest&quot; before the name. For Darcy, despite his reserves, is a deeply passionate man.Back to my original point. There is something deeper in Jane Austen's seemingly silly and pointless escapades. The novel is an examination of human foibles (sp?) and follies, a critical probing of the pitfalls of society. Austen's points are timeless, for some things never change. In any case, when Darcy says, in response to Lizzy's inquiry as to when he will find the courage to write to his aunt, the despised Lady Catherine DeBourgh, who greatly opposes his marriage to Lizzy, that he is more likely to want time than courage, it means more than it seems to. He is saying, subtly perhaps, but he's saying it all the same: he treasures his time with Lizzy, and he hates to darken it with a cloud of impending doom. Besides which, he loves to talk to his fiance, and wile away hours wandering the country lanes in a state of happiness beyond that which he has ever known. Why waste the precious minutes writing to that stupid Lady Catherine, anyway?As you can see, a philosopher like myself can find reams of meaning in a simple sentance of Austen. If that isn't reason enough to read her novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, I don't know what is.--Child of the Burning Heart"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The most striking feature of my experience with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the sense of overwhelming changes in society in the last 200 years.

Each reading brings out subtler shades and makes you nod your head delighted as the new facet presents itself!Pride and Prejudice has to be one of my most favorite books of all time. I can read it any time and love it all over again. You are missing out on a real treat if you have not read it yet - go get it :-)!Another note: I think because the protagonist is female, women tend to enjoy this book a whole lot more than men!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Of all of Austen's novels, and I've read them all, Pride and Prejudice stands out to me as the most dynamic. The characters are richly developed and the plot woven skillfully in and out of the quirks of society. This book can be boring and tedious to read if you let it, but with a little imagination and an enjoyment of the language it can take flight and transform. I have read the book five or six times and studied it in an English analysis class, and each time I find something new to discover and relish in Austen's witty commentary. Read it once for the plot, then read it again for the social critisism, and it will blow you away!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. (By the way, in case you think I'm someone who thinks a 'good time' is a trip to the museum or a riveting game of chess, I'm not. I take sick pride in my love of the uncultured, but even I can't help but love this book.) Once more, with feeling: Don't avoid this book because of the time period it's written in."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"When I first started to read this book I thought that it would have alot of old time english that I couldn't understand and that there would be alot of slow spots and bore. But as I got into the book (which didn't take very long) I found a REALLY great novel.The plot is amazing, it's one of those books that make you think about it when your done.I have read alot of romance novels in my life and this is by far the best one.I also think this book gives an important message: You should get to know a person before you jugde them because for all you know they could be your true love.If you are looking for something a little more than just a silly romance. Look no further than Pride and Predjudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Nothing short of excellent. This book appears on most top 100 books of all times lists.

This was it. If you want to buy a new version of this classic book, I'd highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, Jane's most well known work and for good reason. This book is a must read classic. It is a light hearted humorous novel that tells the story of how two people, Mr. Darcy, a conceited man of a much wealth, and Elizabeth Bennet whose family has no wealth to brag of and insignificant connections, fall in love once they each cast their prejudices and pride. This book overall was very much enjoyable from my standpoint."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I'm so glad I finally took the time to read this classic. I thought the language and different spellings (staid instead of stayed, for example) would be a hindrance at first, but I soon became so accustomed to the rhythm of it that it became a part of the story's charm. I thought the slower pace would be a turn-off, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed discovering the nuances of the relationships even more this way. I'm looking forward to reading more of Austen's gems, as well as other classics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my first experience reading one of Jane Austen's stories. I am only 1/3 of the way through, but am a huge fan already. Cannot wait to get back to the story. I have viewed dramatized versions of the author's stories on PBS and always loved them. I feel like I found a treasure chest full of gold! Thank you Amazon for the free Kindle downloads."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Each time my daughter and I read this novel, we discover more evidence of what an exquisite blend of entertainment and precision it is. Austen simultaneously captivates the casual reader with a page-turner, while amazing the serious reader with her knack for meticulously echoing earlier details when elaboorating on them in later pages."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a lovely story. All of Mrs. Austen's books are great classics. I didn't find anything wrong with the format or TOC. Easy to follow."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of my favorite books. I have read it many times in print form. The dialogue between the characters is fabulous. The exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are spicy and clever. The book really illustrates the class issues of England at the time. It really sheds a harsh light on the opportunities or lack thereof for women. Even Jane Austen's personal story is a classic one for that time.

I can't wait to read more Austen!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"A beautiful novel. You can not find better writing than in this book. The words flow together so beautifully. While the romance is barely tangiable throughout the book, it still feels overwhelmingly strong. Proof that less can be more. I am thoroughly impressed with Jane Austen's writing style and only wish we would all speak in such a poetic tone.I have stated the obvious about such a wonderful classic, but this, by far, is my favorite novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One of the best novels I have ever read. Jane Austen speaks out in mild but effective comical terms on the stupidity of tradition throughout the eighteenth century. Her main themes address the problems of true love, money and the importance of family life. She does this through the narrative of her highly regarded heroine Elizabeth Bennett. Through the love and devotion to her eldest sister we see Elizabeth at her best fighting for the interests of her family and connections. A wonderful novel of two sisters and their struggle for true love in a society with pecuniary worries and stations."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is certainly a great love story and will survive for generations.I would like to point out something. Perhaps some British peope or people familiar with British society will be able to give me a satisfactory answer. While Mr Darcy abhored people who are ill-bred, unsophisticated and mediocre it is diffcult to see how he could put up with people like Lady Catherine, Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst who are just as bad as Mrs Bennet, Kitty Bennet and Lydia Bennet. The latter group had less money and social status. Is this the reason ?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Why is Jane Austen's work so popular even today? Because she was just the best! This is on my personal top ten list. I've read it at least ten times and probably will read it several times again. It's funny, it's smart, it's romantic, and Elizabeth Bennett is my all-time favorite fictional heroine. You can read this book when you're 16 and every ten years after that. All of Jane Austen's books are good, but this is her best - and a classic that should be part of every woman's education and every woman's personal library. It's also proof that a book can have sizzle without any explicit sex."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time. Jane Austen writes with impeccable wit and creates characters who are likeable, laughable, and very real. Pride and Prejudice is an absolute delight, Jane Austen at her best. Read it. If you are anything like me, you will be in heaven."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have read this novel several times, peeling away the layers looking for new meaning. As someone else stated earlier, P&amp;P is not Austen's deepest work; however, it still contains many levels of meaning. Superficially, there is the charming and *credible* romance. As one digs deeper, one can find lessons on how to read properly (as Elizabeth learns) as well as the layout of a new meritocracy based not on rank, but taste and intelligence. This is not a bland love story, but a quiet, faintly smiling attack on pride, tastelessness, vanity, prejudice and obliviousness. The portrayals of Mrs. Bennet, Caroline Bingley and Lady Catherine de Bourgh are masterpieces of sweet viciousness.Overall, Austen's late 18th century (*not* Victorian) work is a lovely balance of comedy and commentary, romance and drama. Fun, witty, but not swoony or saccharine, Pride &amp; Prejudice should please all but the most proud &amp; prejudiced reader (or the utterly unintelligent), for it is a charming novel, near to perfection."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY NOW AND EVERY TIME I NOTICE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND GET MORE OUT OF IT. I WAS COMPELLED INTO READING IT BY MY MUM ABOUT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND REALLY ENJOYED IT. FROM READING THE BACK OF THE BOOK IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH IT IS ONLY SERIOUS AND A ROMANCE TOLD BY THE HEROIN OF THE STORY , ELIZABETH,ABOUT CURTSHIP AND SCANDEL, BUT I SURPRISED MYSELF BY LAUGHING AT THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE AUTHOR THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. JANE AUSTEN WAS OBVIOUSLY NOW AND AGAIN PICKING FUN AT THE IDEAS OF FASHIONABLE SOCIETY OF THAT TIME, ESPECIALLY ON COURTSHIP AND MARRIDGE AND MANY TIMES AT THE CHARACTERS SHE INVENTS. SHE ALSO MAKES MANY OF HER CHARACTERS REALISTIC AND WRITES HER BOOK COMPASSIONATELY SHOWING AN UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLES EMOTIONS AND THEIR OWN OPINIONS. I WOULD RECCOMEND READING THIS BOOK EVEN IF ITS VERY DIFFERENT TO YOUR USUAL TYPE OF GENRES AS I UNEXPECTANTLY ENJOYED IT ALTHOUGH I USUALLY STICK TO THRILLERS AND HORROR. THIS WAS A GOOD AND AMUSING CHANGE."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"because nobody does it like Miss Austen. Even the minor characters are immortal -- Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennett, Lady Catherine in particular -- these are characters without which our imaginations would be the poorer, would they not?As to Elizabeth, one can only lament that she is fictional, and not a real woman one could fall madly in love with...New readers of Austen, please note: although she writes about a period when women were in certain ways subordinate, she makes it clear that at least some women considered themselves to be essentially free and equal, and succeeded in holding their own, or more than their own, in their relations with the other sex. If I may venture to say so, her best women are both quite feminine and quite strong &amp; spirited. Her best men respect those qualities. So my recommendation is to read her with an open mind, and not let the social customs -- so different from our own -- prevent you from seeing the real human virtues (and vices) of her characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"jane austen has been my favorite author since i was required to read pride and prejudice in high school. her character development of the bennett family as well as the darcys and other characters is phenomenal. the tension between elizabeth and darcy drives the story forward and there are so many subplots inerwoven within the story that the reader will never be bored."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I am a little anxious about clasics because they includes a lot of detailed descriptions which I can't give myself easily and their language are hard to fallow whos native language is not English....EXCEPT JANE AUSTEN's... She is marvelous, funny and kept you suspicious at the end. Although her language is hard to me , I like it very much. Luckily I have seen the BBC series of it ,then I decided to read it... How fortunate I am for that decision, it is captivated me from the first page ... recommend to everyone who loves 19th century stories..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"And that says a lot! Elizabeth Bennet is the second of five daughters in the Bennet household. She is a lively and good-humored young woman of high understanding and an open mind. However, she has one defect, she is too quick to judge. Especially so when Mr. Darcy comes to her neighborhood. Darcy appears to be of a reserved, haughty and proud disposition owing to his large fortune and noble birth. Lizzy adopts an immediate dislike of him. Mr. Wickham, whom Lizzy judges to be an amiable man, gives her further evidence of Darcy's unworthiness, and she is prepared to accept and believe it (She is prejudiced!). Darcy notices all the defects of her rather embarrassing family, low-connections and inferior wealth in comparison with his own (He is proud!). Just when you think it's a dead end, however, the barriers begin to crumble away as more and more of Darcy's real character is revealed. Through more dependable sources, she learns that he is in fact a good-hearted, charitable, just man, and the most surprising and unexpected revelation, that he has more than a strong regard for her.My favorite thing about this book is Austen's portrayal of society through her characters: the greedy and self-interested (Mr. Collins), the rich and snobbish (Lady Catherine de Bourgh), the small-minded and ridiculous (Mrs. Bennet and Lydia), the decietful and immoral (Mr. Wickham), and the kind-hearted and easily victimized (Bingley and Jane). The novel is one of the funniest I have ever read, and so entertaining. Mrs. Bennet seldom speaks of her 'nerves' or complains without making you laugh. It is not a slow read either, despite the popularity of the novel there are plenty of unexpected turns to keep you going. Beneath the entertaining quality of the novel there are lessons to be learned. Lizzy misjudges Darcy, Darcy misjudges Lizzy, she misjudges Wickam, Mr Bennet misjudges Mrs. Bennet when he married her, and Jane (Lizzy's older sister) misjudges Miss Bingley. It is perphaps eight months since the beginning of Lizzy's acquaintance with Darcy that she learns his true character, and every moment proves more and more how good a man he is. I liked Sense and Sensibility, but I love Pride and Prejudice. Lizzy and Darcy are positively the most adorable couple I have read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I thought this book was magnificent. It gave me wonderful insight into old England and early authors. But what makes me give this book 5 stars is the fact that it was truly enjoyable. Pride and Predjudice can easily be called a vintage classic but also a modern classic. The book is easy to relate to on certain issues, let alone very amusing some times. READ THIS BOOK! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I started to read this book for AP English expecting another dry, boring, and hopelessly long novel. However, I was soon pleasantly surprised to find that I was absolutely enthralled in it. It has a timeless plot involving the survival of love when experienced by two different people, each in a very different social status. The utilization of wit and sophisticated humor along with an intricate plot kept me fascinated with the subject matter the entire time. Jane Austen is indeed a wonderful author who's witty and exciting plot will most likely more than keep your interest."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience. Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events. I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my favorite book ever. I have read it many times, four to be exact. Jane Austen is so witty and does a great job at telling this love story. As you read you begin to really know the characters. You begin to relate to their fears and desires. It takes great story telling to bring characters to life. Every lady who reads this book will dream of their Darcy...will wish that they were Elizabeth. No one can escape the enchantment of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"An amazing book! I thought this was one of those &quot;girly-girl&quot; books that was mushy and stupid. Yet this isn't some Harlequin romance. In fact, it pertains equally to both genders. Elizabeth Bennet, Mr. Darcy, the characters are amazingly created by Jane Austen. A wonderful book, definitely worth the time and effort spent trying to understand it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"...I also strongly recommend that an interested reader try listening to the audio version of this novel. If you think the prose of Austen dry, I assure you that you will find a good reading of it a revelation indeed. Among the versions I recommend strongly are the version read by Irene Sutcliffe (Audio Partners/ Cover to Cover, or Chivers in the UK), and that by Kate Reading (Books on Tape, available from them).I found the Reading version very good overall, and outstanding for the portrayal of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mrs Bennet. The best scene, in my opinion, was that of Lady Catherine confronting Elizabeth in the garden at Longbourn. However, I found Elizabeth less easy to distinguish in certain other scenes from her sister Jane, and the men done not as well as I would have hoped. Mr Darcy was a disappointment, in that Kate Reading read his dialogue in a less stately manner than I had expected. However, the reading of the novel was overall very good as I have said. I noticed many little details and phrases that I had overlooked in many readings of this novel, and that I had also ignored in my stay at the Republic of Pemberley (a website dedicated to Austen).I have not yet had the pleasure of listening to the Irene Sutcliffe version, but I plan to buy it very soon. ...If you are rushed for time, or spend a lot of time in your car (or listening to tapes), or if you want to experience Austen in a different light, do try either reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This was my second Austen novel, my first being Sense and Sensibility. I liked the first, but was blown away by this one. I adored all the characters, and although I knew (like everyone else) the whole time what would happen in the end, I was still overjoyed when the novel was resolved. However, I was dissappointed. I didn't want it to ever end! That's the mark of a good book. When you're done with it, you wish you had never read it just so you could read it for the fist time again. That's exactly how I felt with this novel. I could read it forever. I would reccomend it to anyone who remotely enjoys reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story? Jane Austen's novel enables the reader to embark on a journey with moments of laughter, suspense, frustration, and delight. Although Pride and Prejudice may seem like a love story on a superficial level, a deeper look reveals the complex themes of reputation, class, stereotypes, and first impressions.Exploring characters from different walks of life, Jane Austen effectively and passionately develops the personas of her characters, enrapturing the reader. First impressions can be dangerous and the author implies that society must discard preconceived notions and, in turn, explore beyond the surface. Elizabeth Bennett, the novel's protagonist, captivates the reader with her independent, free-spirited, and quick-witted nature. An anomaly of her time, Lizzy refuses to marry solely for status, for love is essential and she will not compromise her values for power and wealth. Her character is refreshing as compared to her marriage-obsessed mother, materialistic and pedantic sisters, and pompous aristocrats. However, no matter how much the reader hates these characters, he or she realizes that Austen has accomplished her goal of exposing these diverse individuals for who they truly are.The development of relationships and the characters themselves also enthrall the reader. First appearing as a pompous snob, Darcy initially repulses the reader, but through the progression of the novel, the reader begins to see Darcy as the kind, generous man that he is. On the other hand, Wickham appears to be the helpless victim of Darcy, but this false impression is quickly erased. Appearance versus reality is a reoccurring theme throughout the novel which forces the reader to resist deception and search for truth.The reader laughs with Mr. Bennett, cringes at Mrs. Bennet, sympathizes with Jane, flinches at the haughty remarks of Caroline Bingley, and wants to knock some sense into immature Lydia. The strength of the story lies in Austen's depiction of love as an element that can surmount class boundaries. Taken through twists and turns, the reader experiences love ignited, love broken, and love rekindled. But is this is a typical love story? Although Pride and Prejudice ends like a typical enchanted love story, Austen's development of the characters, storyline, and her shattering of class shackles enables the reader to acknowledge that the story serves a deeper purpose."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story?

But I might have more to say than I think.This is my first Jane Austen book, and, while I'd wanted to read it for a while, the main reason I finally got around to it, was because of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Which, if you aren't watching those, whether you've read the book or not, you should. It's... simply amazing. I love it.But I'm talking about the book, so let me get back to that.When I started the book, I was afraid it was going to be long and droning and boring, given the time period it was written, and it kind of was, in parts. There were a lot of dry parts in this book, a lot of slow points, and the language was rather boring at some points. There were long sentences, huge paragraphs, not nearly as much dialogue, and sometimes it was a bit hard for me to follow. There were, though, some scenes, some chapters or plots, that I really enjoyed, and those went by really fast, whereas other ones took way too long to get through.My main annoyance with the writing was how tell and not show it was. There were countless times that the reader would be told about something that had happened, some scene we didn't get to see, and sometimes even some kind of characteristic that a character had. And the one reason I'm even a little okay with those things is that, with the characters, it was made apparent in their attitude that what we were told was true, and with the scenes, if we were shown them, the book would have been longer, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed that. It still annoyed me, though; is probably the thing I least liked about this book.Next, the characters. I liked Elizabeth enough, I suppose, but didn't really care too much about her either way. The same with most of the characters, actually. I liked Mr. Bennet. I liked the romantic relationships. I wasn't too big a fan of Bingley, most of the time, because he just seemed too prideful and full of himself (which I will talk about again in a minute). I didn't think I got to know Lydia very well. Jane seemed alright. I didn't like Caroline, because she was... not a nice person.I liked Darcy at first, but then later on was kind of iffy about him. I knew what was going to happen with him and Lizzy, but somewhere in the middle, his attitude bothered me. I think it just seemed like too big a jump, from him being standoffish to really nice to her. But, thinking back on it, it wasn't too bad, actually. I did like their relationship, so there's that.Now, the pride thing. After reading the book, I understand what the title means, and I'm kind of okay with it. I don't mind the prejudiced thing. But the pride part just annoyed me so much. All of the characters were prideful about one thing or another. Bingley was rather full of himself. As was Darcy. And I just... I guess I feel like some development should have been done there, instead of it just continuing to be that way. They aren't the only characters that were prideful, a lot of them were, but they just made the biggest impression on me.I think that's all I have to say, really. The book wasn't horrible, even if it was droning and boring at times, and had way too much telling. The rating is really so high because of the story line. The plot was good, what with what happened with Lydia, and Jane's change in attitude halfway through, and the ending, and even how some of the characters acted. There were some parts that I really enjoyed.I don't plan on reading any of Austen's other books, though. I do plan on watching some of the Pride and Prejudice movies, and am at the moment watching the miniseries, but that might take a while. They're just so long, and kind of boring to me. I know that most people love this book, though, so don't take my word on it all.I would suggest watching the web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, though, because it is amazing, and I honestly think it's better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Loved this book, I have lost count of how many times I've read this book.

That leaves you in tears. Some might say its in a old time theme, but I would like to think the romance in this story is so typical every 2000 kinda day. We live in a world where men and women play the \\"I don't like you card.\\" Even when we have already fallen for that person. Instead of realizing right of the bat they were meant to be.

It tends to focus on other people's affairs just as mush as the main characters, and at one point I skipped through some of that extra jazz. It makes for a good read though, and gives really good insight to how society was way beck when."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This book is a pandora's box of characters. Best friend, worst enemy, love of your life, and the one you love to hate, all found caught in a romantic tale that combines all the elements of human nature into a realistic struggle between true love and social status. The characters are phenominal. I don't think Jane Austen missed a single type of person, or disposition in her novel. As you learn of her characters and begin to relate to them you will run the emotional gamet. From anger to tears this book will take you into the perspective of multiple people. You will not only see through their eyes but feel what they feel. I don't think there is a single person who couldn't relate to someone in this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"After reading BRIGID JONES: A DIARY and knowing it was a modern version/take on PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, I decided to read P&amp;P again. It is a beautifully written, carefully crafted story of an English family with five daughters, and they may be on the verge of losing their home and means of support. The main character Elizabeth is a very focused, honest, caring person. She says what needs to be said and does the things that need to be done. She is very observant of peoples personalities and what drives them, at least she believes she is until she meets Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy. That the daughters must marry due to their impending financial situation is never questioned, but who will the future husbands be? What makes Mr. Right, Mr. Right? How can one sister's Mr. Right be so wrong for everyone else but her? With all the social customs and duties is it possible that two people can actually find each other, fall in love and marry? There are characters you will love and characters you will love to hate. It is filled with humor,romance and drama, and enough twists and turns to create a wonderful and very enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is Jane Austen's best, except maybe Northanger Abbey. I wouldn't know, I haven't read it (yet). I couldn't like the characters in Emma, in Persuasion it was depressing, all that worrying it would have a sad end, in Mansfield Park, she was so meek(and no reason for him to fall in love), Sense and Sesibility was meatless, but P&amp;P sparkles. Likeable characters, romance, social commentary, everything."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I previously wrote when I was only Half-way through. I would like to update on what I read since then, now that I have finished the book. It is very well written, with a great plot. Plus, Jane Austen keeps you in suspense, but not TOO much suspense as many books are now. I hightly suggest that you read this book!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The two meet. They are completly wrong for each other, or so they think. Mr. Darcy has too much pride, he thinks he deserves the best of everything, including women. Elizabeth Bennet is prejudiced against him; she believes the gossip she hears about him. Who would ever think the two could ever get along, much less fall in love with each other! Meanwhile, Elizabeth's sisters try desperately to find the men of their dreams. I started reading this book a little timid. My mom told me that I just had to read it because it was a classic, but mainly because she read it and loved it when she was my age. So I had my doubts; my mom and I have different tastes in books, and I didn't trust her opinion much. I started reading it because I didn't have much time before I had to finish my book report. I found I loved the book more than I imagined I would. This story is romantic; it leads you in and out of the complicated minds of the Bennet family. Through the hearts of the many men the Bennet girls tend to take lightly. Then into the souls of two lovers destined to be together."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Although I am only half-way through this book, I am finding it very interesting. It IS a romance, this fact may turn people off, but (as far as I have gone anyway) there is much more to the story! So far, it is very enjoyable, and is teaching me a lot about that time period--what it was like for women in England then. I suggest you read it! Even if you feel that you are a little young. I am 15, I read a lot, and perhaps I'm not understanding everything, but it is enjoyable nontheless!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a story that graps you by the heart and does not ever let you go. If you have never read this book, YOU MUST!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is my favourite book of all time. Not only are the characters perfectly sculpted into lifelike images (both charming and deceitful), but the romance is original, heart warming and honest. Darcy is not only dashing, but mysterious and compelling. Elizabeth is simply charming and delightfully strong willed. The supporting characters are simply wonderful; the mother's sillyness to Wickham's deceitfullness, Miss Bingley's almost comical bitterness to the absurb notion that Darcy could ever marry Lady Catherine's pitiful daughter. It all comes together to make the most wonderful book of love, social commentary and humour. I read this in one weekend-I couldn't put it down. If you have never read a &quot;classic&quot; and love romance read this. It'll charm your socks off!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I cannot express in words how much I loved this novel! Austen's wry humor and perceptiveness shine through in all her characters. I know it sounds cheesy, but I still do get excited over whether Elizabeth and Darcy will ever see eye to eye. Elizabeth is one of the strongest and most admirable female characters in literature, the book is worth it just for her!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen is incredibly witty, which makes this book just a delight to read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I am ashamed to admit it, but, yes, I have been reading for over 25 years and this is the very first time that I have ever read Jane Austen. None of her novels were required in high school, no literature class that I took in college used any as a text, and I had never thought to pursue her for sheer entertainment. It is quite sad, actually, for I find Austen much more accessible than some of the classic that I did have to wade through, including Wuthering Heights and The Scarlet Letter. Austen has recently seen a resurgence in popularity, likely due to the recent BBC and Hollywood adaptations of her books, including the Emma Thompson vehicle Sense and Sensibility.Pride and Prejudice was Austen's second novel, following the success of Sense and Sensibility. Its original title was--and I'm not making this up a la Dave Barry--First Impressions. To my taste, this would have been a much more apt title, but it had been used by another author before Austen could get this book in print. The story is about the five Bennet sisters, who, while not orphaned or penniless, have few choices as to husbands because their father's estate is entailed on a male heir, and they have no brother. The father seems to have resigned them to their fate, but their mother wastes no opportunity to arrange a good match for her daughters. The two oldest--Jane and Elizabeth--are level-headed and quite understand the position that they are in, but the youngest three are flirtatious and giddy, a bad combination in winning society's eye. Disasters ensue when eligible bachelors Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to town, as well as the officers of the ---shire regiment.The reason First Impressions would have been a better title is that each character--not just the main two, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy--is constantly assuming things about other characters based on their initial reception of them. Mr. Darcy, in the country, is too proud to dance with any of the young women because of his mistaken impression that they are all declasse; Elizabeth forms her prejudices about Mr. Darcy because of her first meeting with him and this dance snub. The townsfolk think the best of Mr. Wickham because his first impression on everyone is quite favorable. And on and on and on.Very interesting, but it goes on forever, as the characters can never be quite direct given the mores of the time. That does not mean that they can not be insulting, as a particularly vicious exchange between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth shows. I'm glad that I have now broken my Austen fast, but I think that I can wait awhile before digesting any more."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"The Bennet girls are having a problem with primogeniture. They feel that it isnt fair that the first male in the family gets to inherit the estate after Mr.Bennet has passed away. Since there are five girls and no men there cousin Mr.Collin's gets to inherit the estate. Mrs.Bennet takes it apon herself to find gossip on all the men in the town that are making a reasonable amout of money and hook them up with one of her daughters. This continues on thoughout the movie. Mrs.Bennet and all of the Bennet daughters get tangled up with all of the gossip and mishap,and this complicates everyones lives.Towards the middle of the movie one of the Bennet daughters(Jane) gets introduced to one of the wealthies men in the town, his name is Mr.Charles Bingley. Mr. Bingley has his eye set on her and they begin to like each other. Mr.Bingley's best friend Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy also takes a liking for one on the Bennet daughters(lizzy). Mr.Darcy is hard headed and does not show his liking for lizzy at first. He is rude and does not show much respect for her, in lizzy's eyes. Mr.Darcy is jelous of something and tries to break Mr.Bingly and Jane up. This creates lizzy to have more dislike for Mr.Darcy.The actors that were chosen to play in this movie were very perfect. They understood and comprehended what they had to do and did the job quite perfectly. I really admired how well the plot and characters where chosen. The scene designers and director chose the perfect places to shot the movie. I liked how the two wealthies men's estates in Pemberly and Netherfield Park were placed. This made it seem very realistic. I would defintley recommend this movie to others. It kept you wondering thoughtout the whole movie whether or not Mr.Darcy and lizzy , and Mr.Bingly and jane were going to get together. I feel it was more a chick flick,but would also suggest it to males as well. It might teach them a thing or two on how to approace a woman, and make them feel wanted and loved dispite what others say.Throughout this movie &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was a really wonderful message. I feel the message was not to give up hope and try to persue your dreams. If something was ment to be it will always work out at the end."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"My sister's been raving about this book for years. It's not until months ago did I have the guts to pick it up. It's been sitting in my mini-library since I got it too... Then my sister once again kept asking &quot;Have you read 'it' yet?&quot; So, to stop this question from coming up in every turn, I decided to read it. I honestly expected this book to bore me to death considering the author is from the late 17th century. What fun could a writer be of that time, huh? Oh not to mention, the author was unmarried. What does she know about romance, right? Well, I was mistaken. I enjoyed this book sooo much, I ordered the DVD movie of it. There was some &quot;slow&quot; moments in this book however, I think it's the over-description of everything. But once you got through that, the book flows with lots of humor and intensity. I liked Elizabeth from the start. Mr. Darcy was kindda hard to like in the beginning but as soon as the book progress, you would love him and would want him for your own :-) The Dialogue in this book was my favorite of all. Uppity, Humorous, Lyrical, Heart warmer and truly of its time.I have read more than 80 historical romance novels in this year alone and I honestly think most of the ideas and formulas (marriage mart) were derived from this book (did i dare say that?). I couldn't believe this book was actually written at that time period. Amazing!

How is it possible that this adorable, timeless love story is now almost 200 years old? I read this book while in high school and could not admit to anyone how much I loved it. There weren't a lot of Jane Austen book clubs for high school boys back then and white-bread suburbia did not lend itself to those types of disclosures. However, reading it and EMMA and JANE EYRE and Dickens spoiled me forever for good storytelling. To this day, I am drawn to novels of eternal themes: love, sex, family and friends. I don't mean to trivialize Jane Austen with my pithy Candace Bushnell nod, but Pride and Prejudice has all of the intrigue and sex and love of Sex and the City--we just can't see it.

I can't imagine I understood most of that as a fourth grader, but anyway a few weeks ago I found it along with a few other adbandoned books from my elementary years. Now, as a 7th grader and a hopeless romantic devoloped through the years, I figured I could give it a shot, though my expectations weren't high. Well. This book was very good. I have to say I oly got up to page 110, I think, but what I have read was fantasticly (sp?) written. However, I'm more of a sci-fci, fantasy, adventure kind of reader, preferring classics like Black Beauty (did I mention horse nut?) and Watership Down, though I don't kow if that's considered a classic... Anyway, I also don't think I understood it as well as I could have and I seriously did not want to blemish my idea of this book, so I ould strt fresh in maybe another year or two. Who knows, maybe I'll even give it another go before 7th grade ends!

It is an amazing piece of literature, and I never cease to be amazed how many people can call it boring. For a story where surprisingly little actually does happen, with each read I cannot put it down. Each time I wonder if Mr. Darcy will be able to capture Elizabeth's heart, and I am always tickled when he does. I still get as choked up, and laugh just as much as I did the first time. Even compared to Austen's other brilliant works, I find Pride and Prejudice far superior.I also beg all lovers of its adaptations to actually read the novel itself.

I happen to love Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic novel. However, this abridged version lacked some of the best aspects of the original story. They cut it down to 3 hours (can't be helped, I guess) and, therefore, the story really only deals with Elizabeth, Jane being a mere afterthought. The other sisters are barely mentioned. I am looking forward to when someone realizes that there are customers out there with CD players in their cars and they would like to hear the UNABRIDGED version of popular and classic books. I also felt that Jenny Agutter did not distinguish that well between characters, Mr. Bennett sounded just like Lady Catherine. I have listened to Sense and Sensibility with Juliet Stevenson and the difference between these 2 readers is amazing. You are really able to appreciate the acting skills of Ms. Stevenson versus Ms. Agutter on these CD's."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It's a legendary and outstanding claasic but let's discuss not the novel itself but the book and it's quality.

In general all classic novels are not easy. However, ever since I saw the movie, I couldn't help wonder what screenwriter has omitted from the original book. I decide to buy the book. To my surprise, I kept reading on. Usually when I read a book, I read a couple of pages then something came up. I never went back to finish the book. This book is different. The desire to know more about Elizabeth Bennet who was played by Kiera Knightly and Mr Darcy kept me going. During my lunch time at work, I read. At home, I would read until 3 or 4 am.

I admit that if I had been assigned this novel in high school or college, reading it would have been an ordeal and I would have cursed the teacher or professor all the way through. Maybe it's my relatively advanced age or the fact that I just saw the movie that caused my mind to open and made Pride and Prejudice difficult to put down and exhilarating to read. Besides the seemingly stilted language of the period, Austen leaves much, including emotions and dialogue, to the imagination. The former lessens more and more as the pages go by and the latter actually makes the story more sensual and exciting. I found myself rereading chapters for the sheer enjoyment of trying to get in the minds of Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Jane, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Collins and all the others. The characters are unforgetable and I will revisit them from time to time during the rest of my life.

Her main character, Elizabeth Bennet, portrays an independent, headstrong women acting out against her duty as a woman to get married in a time where men are the dominant sex. Her eventual love with Mr. Darcy creates a novel that is both humerous and romantic.

But I was so wrong! It's an amazing story of...well pride and prejudice! Jane Austen is very witty and I found myself laughing and sighing and worrying as I read. Elizabeth is a wonderful heroine that you find yourself relating to and wishing to be! What a life those young women must have led! And Darcy, well I fell in love with him immediately. You can't get any better than Darcy when looking for a man who would do anything to protect and help you. I loved reading about the cynical Miss Bingley and her sister; silly Lydia and Kitty; obnoxious Mrs. Bennet; and hilarious Mr. Collins. This book is my favorite classic! I strongly recommend reading it BEFORE watching the movie!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I have read many, many novels including all of Jane Austen's; and still there is nothing to compare to \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is unquestionably my favorite novel of all time, and what I consider to be the 'perfect novel.'and I've decided to break down the aspects that I think make it so.The Characters:Elizabeth Bennet is my favorite literary heroine of all time, for the simple reasons that she is probably the most consistent, well-rounded character that I have ever come across. Not to mention that she is extremely likable. Mr. Darcy, though not a very intricate character compared to Elizabeth, is undeniably well thought out, and perfectly drawn. But, for anyone who has read this(I think I can speak for just about everyone)there are three particular characters that are memorable, and even lovable, just for their perfectly delightful absurdity; Namely Mrs. Bennet whose \\"sole object in life was to get her daughters married; and it's solace was visiting and news.\\" Then there is Mr. bennet's pompous cousin Mr. Collins, whose proposal to Elizabeth is one of the best scenes in the book. Finally, there is Lady Catherine, Mr. Darcy's haughty Aunt, whose class consciousness, and condescending airs are wonderful!The Plot:A simple love story, and a Cinderella story at that. Though there is no really important issues covered, no intellectual depth to fathom, it remains one of my favorite plots, becuase it flows so easily, there is no awkwardness, is tied together so well in the end; there is nothing I would ever dream of changing.The Diolouge:This is it's absolutely flawless point; the diolouge is perfect; perfect and consistent with each character, it moves the story along, and charms the reader non-stop.Language:Who can resist a novel that makes frequent use of the words:folly, felicity, ductility, oddity, and every other charming \\"ity\\" Austen uses.I really can say nothing else. I have read this book so many times I have so many different perspectives, so many opinions on it, have so much to say that I could not possibly say it all, so I decided to take the literary view, and build on that. All I can say in conclusion is go out, buy this book, and read it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I really don't need to say much about this, do I ?

I read at night before bed... and there were some nights I stayed up until 4 reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"No piece of literature explores the turbulent journey of a young courtship better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The novel centers around Mrs. Bennet's feverish efforts to marry off her five daughters to the wealthiest and most well-suited men as possible. Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the story and the second eldest Bennet daughter is a truly genuine, captivating, and refreshing character. In the novel Elizabeth encounters the most horrible creature of a man named Mr. Darcy. His haughtiness is outweighed only by his pride. On the flipside, however, Darcy is extremely attractive and wealthy to boot. The odds are definitely against these two throughout the book-especially because of disapproving family members and some ill-timed, hurtful comments. The reader's biggest question throughout is, will it work out for these star-crossed lovers? Sharp, well-developed characters and a beautifully woven plot coincide resulting in nothing but greatness. The 19th century-clad and somewhat frilly language could be considered tedious to some readers, but I believe it completes the effect of the novel. Subtle, witty dialogue constantly adds intrigue and humor. This novel guides the reader through the ups and downs of a love story with wonderful class and style. To say Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and a great work of art would be an understatement."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"\\"I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\\"When first hearing the title Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen one might think that it would be another dull romantic book written ages ago. When in reality, Pride and Prejudice is a book that I could say I have actually enjoyed so much that I have read it myself several times. Pride and Prejudice is the type of book that draws the reader in deeper with each chapter, giving you new characters and personalities to make the book so compelling.The book starts off with a family known as the Bennets who have five daughters all with intentions of marrying to a young man with good fortune, except for one. That one is Elizabeth Bennet who wants to marry for love or to retire an old maid. It causes a great stir when a young man of great fortune, Mr. Bingly, has just bought a large estate in Loungbourn. This brings high hopes for Mrs. Bennet who has intentions of one of her daughters to catch his eye and to marry him. With surprise and great excitement Mrs. Bennet later finds out through gossip that Mr. Bingly has a friend whom makes twice as much as Bingly, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingly very quickly notices the eldest daughter of the Bennets, Jane. Mr. Darcy on the contrary refuses to dance with Elizabeth at their first meeting. In return this shocks Elizabeth of how someone could be that proud and that sets her opinion of him very low. Elizabeth reassures herself that this opinion of him could never change, but what if she is mistaken?Throughout the book Jane Austen never lightens up or falls short of her humor. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have many amusing conversations about how she believes he is proud and how he believes she is prejudice. This classic book will always remain one of my favorite books with the distinctive way Jane Austen writes."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I read this book to meet page requirements for my sophomore English class.

The story is based on the Bennet family, which consists of a mother, a father, and five daughters. Mr. Bennet is a country squire who is not very wealthy. Mrs. Bennet is a house wife and her goal throughout the book is to marry her daughters off to wealthy gentlemen. The main plot of the story is molded around Jane Bennet and Elizabeth Bennet finding their husbands, through both 'trials and tribulations.' Jane marries the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and Elizabeth marries the handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy.Jane Austin did a wonderful job of writing Pride and Prejudice. She wrote so that you could feel the love that Jane was feeling, and you could feel the hate that Elizabeth felt. She also wrote descriptively so you could imagine the storm that Jane went through, and you could see the gorgeous house that Mr. Bingley lived in. Whenever I read this book I wished I had admirers like Mr. Bingley. I must admit that while the book had a happy ending, it made me sad because I wanted to be in Jane and Elizabeth's shoes.When I think of classic books, I think of stuffy old libraries where stuffy old people go to read books that were written back when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. Reading this book made me realize that these old stuffy books are called classics for a reason.This book was not a boring read! I am the sort of person who loves to watch and read teen stories. You know, the stories where the guy and the girl meet each other and fall in love. Jane Austin did a great job of keeping my attention. Reading the book mixed up the same emotions as Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook did in \\"She's All That.\\"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that everyone that believes in love should read.

I suggest that no civilized person can read these without a smile and a committment to finish the piece."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Of all of Austen's works, this is her most polished and important accomplishment. Pride and Prejudice masterfully blends excellent humor with a very strong social critique of many of the follies and vices of her times. Within its pages, the reader will find characters that are loveable, and characters that he will love to hate. The ending, while typical of a romance, is brought to its conclusion through the effects of a very tightly spun plot.

Austen uses beautiful language and intriguing characters to tell this story of courtship in a time when reputation was everything. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is a clever-witted woman who manages to gracefully glide through the lines set up by society. Although she does not always come off as lady-like, her charm and confidence demand the reader's respect. She is surrounded by a cast of diverse characters, creating a riveting plotline. Her mother is a rather quirky character who wants nothing more than to see her daughters wed. Her father, on the other hand, is a sarcastic and intelligent man who favors Elizabeth for her wit. These characters are brought together with the Bingley's when Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley. Here, we are introduced to the stubborn and proud character of Mr. Darcy. He seems to be above everyone else and completely opposed to the idea of love.When Elizabeth Bennet catches Darcy's eye, however, a battle between the mind and the heart begins. These two chracters are faced with the obstacles set up by a strict, Victorian society. Their largest obstacle, however, will be to overcome their own pride and prejudice, and discover their love for one another. Is this a battle that the heart can win?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most superb novels in English literature. This novel includes love, lies, and lively characters. Austen's style of writing is superb, her use of the English language is music with words. Austen is able to give the reader an all around view of each character, since it is written in third person omnipresent, but through the many letters, the reader is able to understand each character in a personal way.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett is an exception to the typical women of her era. Her lively wit and determination not to marry for money is a model for women of all time, these qualities allow her to transcend time. Elizabeth stands up for herself and in the end is rewarded for her steadfast constitution, by marrying the man she loves. Although this situation is not typical in everyday life, that same quality is what makes this novel loved by all. Pride and Prejudice feeds into the illusion of true and perfect love. The man comes to rescue of the woman he loves and in doing so saves her and her family. He goes against his family's and societies wishes to marry the woman he loves.The unique way Pride and Prejudice is written enhances the story. The reader is able to get an inside look into every character's personality. The reader is able to see the flippant way Lydia writes as she decides to run away with Mr. Wickham, how truly ridiculous Mr. Collins is, and how sincerely Mrs. Gardiner loves Elizabeth. Through the letters we learn about some of the most important event in the novel. Mr. Wickham's true character, Lydia's elopement, and even Darcy's involvement in fixing the scandal.It is every woman's dream to be Elizabeth Bennet. To marry the man she loves become rich and live happily ever after. This novel plays on everybody's want to find true love despite all the obstacles in life. I loved Pride and Prejudice because it transported me to another simpler more beautiful place, where love conquers all."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Being the first Jane Austen novel which I have ever read, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Pride and Prejudice was nothing at all as I had expected. Full of wit and humor, as well as a romance both entirely innocent and mature (a virtue sadly lacking in much of this age's romances), Pride and Prejudice also conveys the polished skill with which Austen writes. I was most surprised to find that Austen, with her sophisticated style, was in her late teens/early twenties when she wrote this novel.I could easily go on about her style, vocabulary, and intricate sentences (I had a little trouble following her sometimes), but the main focus should always be given to the story itself. Insightful and often hilarious characterization gave texture to the story, as did the complex personalities of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bennet's off-hand remarks and Mary's deeply celebral, pompous observations on morality brightened up the scenery considerably. Jane Austen exercises expert storytelling to catch (and keep) interest until the very realistic, very satisfying, conclusion.Pride and Prejudice has earned its way onto my \\"feel-good\\" list of books, and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it for many years to come. Don't be discouraged by its old-fashioned front. Pride and Prejudice is one story that no one should be deprived of.Oh, and if you haven't seen the movie, go see it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great classic and should be read by anyone who enjoys Victorian Romance. The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy. Their tumultuous romance is extremely humorous and delightful to read.Although Jane Austen was a talented novelist, she was harshly criticized during her day for writing about marriage and the social life of well-bred, 19th century British women as opposed to more serious topics such as the French and American revolutionary wars. I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago. In fact, You may notice that this story is very influential in modern films and books, most recently in Bridget Jones's Diary. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"OK, maybe the title was a little much, but from what i have read...it is. Elizabeth Bennet is a young, satirical, young woman who is prejudiced against Mr. Darcy, a charming yet snobby man. The two argue throughout the entire book but when she realizes her misperception of him, they finally begin to love one another. This is perhaps one of the best parts of the novel, in my opinion.The characters are amazingly sketched out and Mrs. Bennt takes the cake! I had a lot of fun reading her comments as well as the sisters.Even though I am only thirteen, I believe that I fully grasped the novel.

I still enjoyed it, as the story is a romantic comedy that I feel has a little something for anyone that enjoys a good romance. It is definitely more subtle than the kinds of things one reads these days, but that seems to be a good thing. The BBC televised version with Colin Firth is also very good."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It's been awhile since I've read any literature involving flowery language and staunch manners but I'm so glad I came back to it!!! Pride and Prejudice is extremely well-written and the characterization is fabulous. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy create delicious sparks with their constant head-butting and romantic tension. Elizabeth can probably best be described as someone who embodies the best manners, heart, and intentions without being sappy or spineless; she is incredibly intelligent and strong-willed. It's interesting to read this book and think of how women of the time had to play the love &quot;game&quot; and marry above their station to progress in society. It also sheds light on Jane Austen's own independent state of mind that her most darling character was a total fireball! This book will give you constant butterflies and provides a nice glimpse into the comedy and pettiness of the society of the time, all the while, weaving a charming tale not soon to be forgotten."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"i loved this book the moment i started reading it. each and every event in it beacame my very own; Jane austen definitely knows how to weave her stories into the hearts of the readers. elizabeth bennet, the heroine, is a vivacious spirited young woman who speaks from her mind and learns from her heart. mr. darcy is uniquely unfolded as a man of principles and convictions. he starts to make you think of what you truly stand for. this is a story full of warmth, tenderness and love from the heart. you'll enjoy every moment of this scintillating experience."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Well, I first readthis book last week and I think it's amazing.

I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the \\"plot.\\" The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy.

Egerton, Whitehall, and is a classic tale of love, hate, and heartbreak. Its realistic fiction genre makes this 360 (or so) page story able to relate to today. You can imagine some of the emotions throughout and although there are no illustrations, you can use your own mind to picture the story. The tale takes us on turns and elaborates on the drama in the lives of Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, and their romances with the men in the book. Jane Austin, who is a widely recognized author today, was not recognized much during her lifetime. She was born in 1775 and unfortunately passed away 1817 because of an illness. In that time she wrote many books, one being Pride and Prejudice. Her family was compassionate of her writings and took it into their own hands to try to get them published. Only a few managed to get published, however. During the 20th century Pride and Prejudice, and many of Austin's other works, finally became recognized and were seen as great novels by many readers. They were published and became best sellers among many companies. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most read books today by adolescents and adults of many ages. Many people enjoy this roller coaster tale and it's occasionally comical characters.The characters in Pride and Prejudice have very distinct personalities, which contribute to the ups and downs of the story. However, to truly understand the customs of the four main characters in this book, you must put yourself in the beginning of 1800's, during the Napoleonic Wars (1797-1815), in the town of Hertfordshire. The setting explains the way in which the characters act. The characters personalities make for many moods; including love, hate, passion, loss, and urgency. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet and she is also the narrator of the story. She is the second eldest of the Bennet daughters and her smart, quick wit sometimes makes her perceive people too quickly. Elizabeth occasionally fails to dig deep into a person's true story and she keeps her guard up at first impressions. Jane Bennet is the eldest of the Bennet daughters and is known to be the most beautiful. She is pressured throughout the story to marry soon because of her age and her relationship with Mr. Bingley shapes the book. Mr. Charles Bingley is a young man of wealth and looks, who comes to Hertfordshire. He owns the Netherfield estate and when he meets Jane he falls in love with her. The last main character is Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. He owns the Pemberly estate and is seen throughout the story as a proud, judgmental man. Towards the end of the book these portrayals change and we find out Mr. Darcy's true character. Some other side characters include: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the other Bennet daughters, Mr. Darcy's sister, Mr. Bingley's sister, Mrs. De Bourgh, and Mr. Wickham. All the characters have elements that are special to their part in the book. They are all unique.The beginning of this love story starts out with the arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley, in the town of Longbourn. He moves into the Netherfield estate accompanied by his sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, and his friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. The Bennets, another family of Longbourn, hear this news and they set their hopes high that Mr. Charles Bingley will marry one of their daughters. Throughout the first few chapters, we see how attached Mr. Bingley becomes to Jane, who is the eldest of the Bennet daughters, and that Mr. Darcy, too, shows a strange attitude towards Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Bennet daughters. In the middle, the conflicts arise that shape the ending of the book. The Bingley residence surprisingly moves away to London and Jane is heartbroken. Elizabeth goes to visit her friend there, that summer, and although she does not see Mr. Bingley, she does have a few interactions with Mr. Darcy. Darcy's stubborn, selfish behavior unfolds at these points and we learn that he is actually in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth does not feel equal love towards him because of her own stubbornness and failure to look at a person's true identity. Towards the end of the book, Elizabeth realizes how blind she had been about Mr. Darcy and begins to love him back, realizing that they are actually very similar in character. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come back to Longbourn and Mr. Bingley confesses that he still loves Jane. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth reunite confessing their love as well. The rise and fall of the different emotions in the plot make for many exciting climaxes.Sometimes the difference between what your heart feels and what your brain thinks can make things confusing. That is what happens in Pride and Prejudice. A good theme for the book would be that you shouldn't judge a person or come to assumptions about them until you know their real story. Poor Elizabeth feels a roller coaster of emotions towards Mr. Darcy throughout the book, from love to hate, then back to love. She just doesn't understand why he acts the way he does. He's confusing to her. He acts as though he is very proud of himself in the beginning and he is not very kind to people who he doesn't know. Later he warms up to Elizabeth; however it may be a little late for him, since she has already established her feelings towards him. The turning point of the story, when we really see how the theme fits, is when Elizabeth goes to Pemberly while the thinks Mr. Darcy is away. She realizes that her feelings have changed because she knows his real story. She read Mr. Darcy's letter, which explained a lot, and she knows then why he acts the way he does. It begins to make sense to her. What Elizabeth originally thought about Mr. Darcy was all different now. She just needed to know the real him. The theme really makes for an exciting realization at the turning point of Pride and Prejudice.Have you ever been on a kiddie roller coaster, that had its ups and downs but those hills were really not exciting? That's how I felt about this book. It was slow moving at times and it never had an enormous climax. Rather, it had a few small ones, which were very predictable. While reading the book, I discovered that I felt as though Pride and Prejudice had a little too much description and narration, instead of dialogue. The lack of dialogue made it difficult to truly feel the characters emotions. I had a hard time putting myself in the characters shoes. The love story was not portrayed as very romantic because the characters never really connected on that level. Overall, I did not care for the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin, who was born on December 16, 1775, is a classic novel that is loved by many because of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. The book was published in 1813, but Miss Austin actually intended it to be published in 1797, but sadly, it was rejected. Jane Austin has also published Sense and Sensibility, a story about two sisters with a meager amount of money, Mansfield Park, and many others. Although Miss Austin produced many great works, she had to leave the world sometime. She died in 1817 by a sudden illness. Even though Jane Austin died many years ago, her books are regarded as some of the best books ever written.In a town called Longbourn, sometime in the 19th century, Miss Elizabeth Bennet lives with her family, Mrs. Bennet, a foolish woman who only cares if her daughters marry, Mr. Bennet, a sensible man who runs the house, but is in an unhappy marriage, Mary, Caroline, Lydia, a snooty girl who only cares about herself, and her favorite sister, Jane, who is madly in love with Mr. Charles Bingley, a wealthy man who purchases Netherfield, his estate that is close to the Bennet's house. Elizabeth is a sensible young lady in her mid-twenties, but sometimes let her pride makes her think in prejudice ways because she likes to ponder on the character of others. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is one such person that Elizabeth believes has a bad character, although she doesn't know him very well. With so many characters about, sometimes it's hard to remember who is who, but after a while you get quite used to it.The main conflict in Pride and Prejudice is the feelings that Elizabeth has for Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story, she utterly hates him, but near the middle, she starts doubting her way she views character. Because of the interchanging turmoil in Elizabeth's heart, she isn't sure what to feel about Mr. Darcy. Another conflict is Mr. Bingley's feelings for Jane, who isn't even sure of his feelings for her. The plot pretty much centers around those two main conflicts. Although, there are many other mini conflicts that the plot focuses on also. One example would be Mr. Collin's conflict with Elizabeth. He wishes her to marry him, because he is supposed to take over the estate when Mr. Bennet dies. Mr. Bennet, a cautious and humorous man, is not so happy that his cousin is going to take over the estate. Even though this is how I perceived the book, I'm sure it's very close to what the critics say.When Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, the whole book starts getting more thought provoking. Will Elizabeth say yes? Or will she say no? Either way, there is more than just her answer. Why did she say what she said? Well, I guess you'll have to read to find out. While you are wrapping that around your head, let me tell you about the theme of the story. There are several themes in Pride and Prejudice but a main one is reputation. Reputation really matters in this book. Mrs. Bennet, with her obnoxious manners and comments, disgraced the family several times throughout the story. And when a certain someone runs away, the family is in danger of being condemned forever in disgrace. And while the Elizabeth endured all of this, the family hardly noted that any of this was occurring, maybe because they only care about getting their daughters married, since that would bring them money. Either way, reputation really matters in this book.All in all, I really didn't like this book because it was really boring. I know the book is a classic, but it made me go to sleep. The book is written beautifully, don't get me wrong. But it didn't keep my attention very well. Yes, I did finish it, and let's just say I could see the finish a mile away. While the beginning was slightly compelling, it just wasn't something I was willing to read. I had to forcefully work my way through this book. Elizabeth, who was an interesting person, made too many prejudices that it got on my nerve after a while. I will say though, that maybe if I tried harder, I could've eased into this book much better if I wasn't rushing to read it. On my scale of buy, borrow, or skip, I would say borrow, but only if you are really into classics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"It took my third try to finally get through Pride and Prejudice. I'll start with the good: the writing is fantastic. I can't argue with that...I love the language. You can pretty much diss someone or compliment someone in so many different ways that I wish our language wasn't so abbreviated. In a few years we'll all be talking in acronyms at the rate we're going, but anyway, back to the story. I understand that women during that time really didn't have a place in society except to stay home and make babies...but what I couldn't stand from the book was that it was a bunch of people sitting around just talking or singing around a piano. It's a love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, but I really couldn't see the love. It was more infatuation or a little crush so the fact that they \\"SPOILER ALERT\\" got together in the end seemed so forced. I didn't even like Elizabeth because she had this holier than thou sort of attitude, but I guess that's just her pride and prejudice. I guess a book about a bunch of women trying to find husbands doesn't interest me."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"I haven't read the book yet but what I wanna say is the book is too new and they were in a hurry of making or cutting this book which is result unsqare or imperfect cut.The letters don't look straight and lean to the right then left when you turn to the next page. It's quite funny and make me a little unhappy about it.Anyhow, I'm sure the story is as sweet as it has been. But next time, check your book shape!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a thread of ammunition in today's literary cannon. Being that it is, I felt I should read it. The plot in the book is very straight forward. Having been produced in the 19th century and entailing the reader with a striking and classic love scenario gives it historical leverage. What other 19th century novel can intertwine social class, love, and crazy parents?Austen's portrayal of social class played a responsibility in the novels greatness. Binding social class and love conveyed it to the current time. I especially enjoyed when the book started to occlude and Elizabeth was confronted by Lady Catherine regarding her love for Mr. Darcy. That moment was significant because it showed that social class does not dignify a person's love. Imagine you were teaching this tale to high school students: They could feed off of it in so many ways.I will admit that this work of fiction was complex at times, but the more I asked questions, the easier it was to understand. I watched the movie (2006 version) after I finished the book. Everything that I had envisioned the book to be about was correlated directly in the movie. The benefit of watching the movie was that it sufficed some of the minimal elements in Austen's book I was unsure of. I may read this book again, and if I do I would like to have a group to read it with. It always helps to talk out-loud distinguished novels like Pride and Prejudice so readers can pin-point missed segments and unlock blocked thoughts."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"This is a pleasant classic with a wonderful story. The book was at times difficult to understand; however, I especially enjoyed the mother character."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the book that I chose for my amazon.com report. I liked the book a lot more then I expected myself to. I think that it is a book that should be required to be read in one point or another in the sixth grade. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, New American Library, 1989. I gave the book a five star rating because it teaches you what love is and what it was like for the people back then. For them to fall in love with one another and have all the regulations and rules. It was probably hard for them. Everywhere in this book is love. Whether it is from mother to father or from daughter to mother or father.In this book a family of seven welcomes Mr. Darcy. He is a very rich and hasome man. Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet try constantly to get one of his five daughters to marry Mr. Darcy, but Elizabeth has other plans. For she is in love with Mr. Wickham. It turns out that Mr.Wickham is in love with Elizabeth. They begin dating and cannot stand a single day without each other, so they decide that they should get married and soon they become engaged. But then Elizabeth realizes that she does not love him anymore. She soon comes to a conclusion of why. She loves Mr. Collins.I am not going to give away a good ending because it is so exciting, but they all live happily ever after. Meanwhile Mr. Darcy is having trouble choosing who to marry. I will not spill the beans on who he decides to marry because I would write too much and then it might give all of it away. The other three girls do find their true love and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are happy because their daughters are happy.My opinion of this book is wonderful and outrageous. I think that this book is just like Jane Austen said, \\" it is like your own darling child.\\" Her version of this book has made me want to read more of her books because I think that they will be somewhat like Pride and Prejudice but I would never know till I read another one of her books. I also agree with the old saying, \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" because I picked up this book and said, \\"This does not look like something I would want to read.\\" I read it and said, \\"WOW! This was a really excellent book.\\"I think that the theme is a very important thing when you are trying to rate a book because basically it is what the book taught you about life. So the theme for Pride and Prejudice was that no matter how much you love someone you can't possibly be satisfied unless they love you back, and that love has no boundries. You can love someone and they can love you but you will still love that person no matter what happens. Even if that person leaves or passes away you will still love but you won't know it because it is just from the bottom of your heart."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"One can easily be mistaken by pride and prejudice, which can later lead to foolish misunderstanding. Throughout this novel the reader can observe how a marriage can secure social status and economic security. Mrs. Bennet would do anything to guarantee both for her daughters. Pride and Prejudice is a story of love, drama and life at England during the 19-century. The author of this classic of literature is Jane Austen. Jane Austen is the seventh daughter of eight children. Being daughter of Rev. George Austen and Cassandra, Austen was born in December 16th, 1775 at Steventon, Hampshire, England. Austen died on 18 of July 1817 at the age of 41 in Winchester, Hampshire, England. Jane died unmarried as well as her sister Cassandra Elizabeth who was 2 years older than Jane. Jane wrote several books before her death including Pride and Prejudice who's initial title would be First Impressions.The arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley to Nederfield Park, caused quite a scandal. Mr. Bingley was a young single man with a huge fortune, and the perfect candidate for husband for one of Mrs. Bennet's daughters. Mr. Bingley's sister and closest friend, Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy had arrived with him. Mr. Bennet paid unwillingly a visit to Mr. Bingley under order of her wife with the purpose of causing a good impression. Mr. Bingley encountered the Bennet's at a ball and was allured by the oldest Miss Bennet, Jane. Not only once did Mr. Bingley ask her to a dance with him, but twice. Miss Bingley became an acquaintance of Jane and became very fond of her.Throughout the novel we are able to observe how society was back in the 19th century. A woman's priority was to get a wealthy and high ranking husband who would be able to provide a good social status to her and their children. The fact that Mr. Collins would inherit the Bennet's property after Mr. Bennet passed away allows us to see further into women's rights. Women were not oppressed as they used to be but they still didn't had the same amount of privileges we do in the present. Mr. Bennet could not leave their daughters any inheritance because they were all women and the property was entailed, meaning that only males could inherit it. The book is so well written with so much detail that it turns one from an outsider into an insider.One is able to observe what a typical day would be in the old days, especially for women, how would they travel and how long their visits would last. I found it quite peculiar how in the past people used to be guests for months and in the present it is less likely, one usually is more busy and just stops for a while and moves on. In the novel Elizabeth spends four weeks at Hunsford with Mrs. Collins and she is still begged by Lady Catherine to remain. Jane also spends around three months in London in her aunt's residence. We can see and advance in the way Mr. Darcy thinks. Many would have believed that Elizabeth's imprudence would be considered of bad taste and rude, but Mr. Darcy admired her for all the reasons someone else may dislike her. Elizabeth didn't accepted Mr. Collins proposal and she still declined Mr. Darcy's proposal not afraid of remaining unmarried. In contrast Miss Lydia Bennet was so desperate in getting a husband. On her way home Lidya commented to her sisters the following,\\"Let us hear what has happened to you all since went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should of not married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy should had better have taken Mr. Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! How I should like to be married before any of you! And then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\"I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride. Sometimes we may judge too fast or too harshly and that no matter how bad something seems it may not be the absolutely true. Elizabeth judged Mr. Darcy too quickly, being blinded by prejudice, she believed completely what Mr. Wickham had said and didn't confirm it with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy was sometimes too proud that he acted foolishly, he didn't show any signs of his feelings towards Elizabeth till the last minute, he didn't tell the absolute truth about Mr. Wickham in order to avoid judging and to conserve his pride. Even though Jane Austen is not here to see the impact her stories has had, this piece of art specifically will always be remembered as one of the classics of literature."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Gave this seller a poor review for slow shipping and a book in poor condition. Happy to report that they quickly responded to my complaint email and issued me a refund."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen is known to be one of the greatest classic female novelists. Her stories contain strong heroines, who rebel against societal norms in order to achieve their full potential as women. Pride and Prejudice, Austen's most well-known work, does not fail to contain this familiar element of Austen's writings.The novel follows the story of the Bennet sisters, primarily the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth, and their misadventures in love. Jane is the sweet-tempered, docile, and beautiful daughter, making her Mrs. Bennet's favorite. On the other hand, Elizabeth is independent, hot-headed and sarcastic, making her Mr. Bennet's favorite. Mrs. Bennet's main focus in life is to have her five daughters married to wealthy men so Mrs. Bennet can live a life in comfort.When wealthy Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy move in to Netherfield, the estate next to that of Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet is elated at the possibility of at least one of her daughters marrying one of the men. Mr. Bingley is almost instantly taken with the innocent Jane, while Mr. Darcy manages to insult Elizabeth within moments of meeting her. This starts the rocky relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Blinded by pride and prejudice, both parties must face hurt and heartbreak before finally receiving their happily ever after.Despite strong characterization, especially of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice does not make my list of favorite books. The story is flat, with no interesting plot elements outside of the occasional use of verbal irony for some humor. As it is a romantic comedy, it is predictable and lacks the depth of most great classic novelists such as Dumas, Dickens, and Leroux.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted easy-read. However, if looking for a book that is engaging, it might be best to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library)","review":"Appropriate for children, this book has excitement, history, and christian thinking in the ways of social behavior.

I guess not, since the subsequent refs are to the instrument. During the time of P&P's writing and for a few years thereafter the English Scarlatti cult was in full swing, so the CD \\"Scarlatti as chosen by Clementi\\" is worth while listening for hardcore JA authenticity fans. Clementi was associated with the Broadwood piano manufacturers and the album contains pieces chosen from Clementi's influential English edition of 1791.

Her mother is determined to marry off her five daughters to the highest bidders, but Elizabeth refuses to look for a marriage of financial convenience. She is hopeful that her sister Jane will marry the amiable Mr. Bingley, but she has no real matrimonial ambitions for herself. She has a particular disdain for Mr. Darcy, from which comes the \\"prejudice\\" of the title. He is a prideful man, thus supplying the other half of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".

I have read all Ms. Harris' chapters in the life of that interesting woman. But I had only read three pages before I became lost in the world of Jane Bauer, a new and thoroughly likeable new heroine. This is not a bloody book, not a violent book, although people do die. But I like Jane (with maybe a reservation or two about her romance with a married man, although I'm sure this part is rather true to life) and I like Ms. Harris' writing style. You enter Jane's world and you could be walking right along beside her. You wll enjoy the journey and you won't have nightmares at night.

As devoted fans, we were delighted when Harris set out to give us a new heroine, NYPD Detective Jane Bauer. Bauer is nearing her 20 years of service, with every intention of &quot;pulling the pin&quot; (retiring), but is given a special assignment with several other detectives to solve an old case from years earlier. When Jane discovers that in addition to the murder victim, a few other folks who lived in the same building are also dead, she launches a sequence of investigations that eventually flush out the truth, mostly from clues that were never worked the first time around. Her male sidekicks Defino and MacHovek help her with much of the legwork, but it's Jane's trip to the Midwest that really brings things into focus midway through what turns out to be a fairly complex plot.While much of the form of this book -- the cold case, the New York setting, and a female lead with both smarts and a winning way of dealing with people -- reminds us of the other Harris series, we have here more of a police procedural without having to rely on &quot;helpers&quot; to track clues from official sources. Jane is a likable gal, as a couple of men that warm up to her in the story find out. Meanwhile, all of Harris's skills are on display, including a plot with just enough intricacy to engage, enough characters to provide variety, and a solid writing style that pleases us from start to finish. We not only recommend this new entree, but will also no doubt anxiously await another outing with Bauer.

Doug suffered from boughts of clinical depression which resulted in his struggle with alcoholism. He attempted several financial ventures, including opening gyms and producing physical fitness equipment, however when he appeared to be at the brink of success, he would be foiled, frequently by his deteriorating mental state.The book also comprehensively details Doug's strength training routine. It is a methodical approach, definitely worth attempting.

It ought to be required reading for young athletes.But Thurston's book is much more than a training manual, or dry recitation of weights lifted and contests won (although the book has all of these statistics). The raw honesty of its narrative coupled with the astonishing achievments of its subject combine to make it make it a compelling read. It's a page turner as hard to put down as a best selling novel.And yet it's all true, often painfully so. This is no mere homage or whitewashed \\"Biography Channel\\" version of Doug Hepburn's life. Thurston depicts those qualities of spirit which determined Doug Hepburn's greatness as an athlete, while at the same time letting us see those aspects of his life and character which were at odds with his natural gifts and self-determined destiny.In short, a great read even if you don't care about weight-training, or other athletic achievment at the world-class level, and a must read if you do."},{"Title":"Strongman","review":"Hello!

This book is nothing more than an honest look back at a life lived to the fullest, through ups as well as downs, on and off the lifting platform.Some nice information on Doug's simple yet effective training methods are included as well.HAIL DOUG!!!"},{"Title":"Strongman","review":"Strongman - the Doug Hepburn Storyby Tom ThurstonTom Thurston's aptly titled biography of Doug Hepburn, Strongman, is a telling tale of one man's aspirations to greatness, while struggling with the material world. For me, this book represents a very humanizing portrait of an inspiring boyhood hero from the fifties. Doug wrestled with the temptations of being exploited into the image of a larger than life, plastic fantastic, comic book like action figure. It is the story of one very human being. Combining insightful sensitivity with brutal reality, Tom delivers a penetrating study into Doug's indomitable spirit.This book is a must read, from those casually interested in fitness to the competing athlete. This is the story about one man who actually did live by the creed: no tricks, not gear, not drugs.Bill OwensComox, BCCanada"},{"Title":"Strongman","review":"STRONGMAN, THE DOUG HEPBURN STORY was a book I could not put down once I started reading it.I was aware of world champion strongman Doug Hepburn and was excited upon noticing his name and freight-train physique upon the attractive book cover. What was fascinating about Hepburn was that while the world was aware of his physical strength, it was his mental strength and determination that was even more paramount. What could fuel such an obsession? A deformed leg was an insecurity he fought to overcome.When Doug first traveled to New York City to display his power to the American strength community I found myself visualizing that I was riding in the train with him. In New York it was one thing to witness the poundage this massive man could lift, but even better watching the look of awe on the faces of the strength crowd watching as they realized this man had no match. This trip to New York City was a necessary confidence step in Hepburn's climb to winning the World Championship in Sweden in 1953.The insecurities to succeed to the top of the weight-lifting world continued to enigma Hepburn as his life continued. I thank Doug for his illumination as he explained how his LSD therapy in the early sixties made him aware of how negatives from childhood stay embedded in a person's conscience and it is up to each of us to attempt to eliminate these adversities as best as possible.I found STRONGMAN, THE DOUG HEPBURN STORY both entertaining and motivational, a great read."},{"Title":"Strongman","review":"Impossible to read \\"Strongman: The Doug Hepburn Story\\" without coming away both drained and inspired. Thurston's approach to the telling of Hepburn's life is as remarkable as the great man himself. Hepburn should have died long before he did. That he beat the odds to once again become the champion he once was, is the stuff that makes a legend. A fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Strongman","review":"This is quite a frank story of a young man, who rose by hard work to the top place on the podium, for lifting weights. He had a few strikes against him, an alcoholic father for one, which worked pain into the family, and, he had a withered club foot, and crossed eyes.As one reviewer says, Hepburn seems to have wanted the story to be told 'warts and all'. Thusly, it seems, Hepburn is trying to tell us that we need find what natural gift we have, and what we dream and desire to achieve, and that while we may have to carry on on our own, that by hard work, we can achieve wonderful things. He wanted his personal struggles and darkness told, to demonstrate that these may be faced, albeit with help, and that even if it takes years, these sort of struggles of the soul may be overcome. Faith in God and in Jesus, which gives a sense of purpose is vital in this, but so too is perseverance. Or, as a pastor used to say \\"By the grace of God and a fast outfield, we shall prevail.\\" We must admit that we need help.I was a bit put off at first by all of the details of the struggle that this man had, but looking back, it seems that the book was written as he wanted it to be, and I think this is quite a good thing.Hepburn replaced John Davis, who had been undefeated in international competition for many years, at the top of the podium in the 1953 world championship. He had to pay his own way to the world championship too, and he didn't have a coach with him.In a writing of his found elsewhere, he says that he sought to follow the pattern of pressing that John Davis used, Hepburn thought that Davis was the best presser he ever saw. He had one more triumph in his young weightlifting life, in terms of medals won, which was at the British Commonwealth Games. Besides this, he set many world records in the military press, my goodness there were press records that he set.This book has a good deal of information about training, at the end it has Doug Hepburn's own course. He is encouraging to us, seeks to give us a longer range view of training for strength, from someone who was there, he gives us a view. Very sensitive and resourceful human being, and he wanted to help people, that was one thing that he wanted best to do.Hepburn liked to use the barbell curl. For one thing, it helped him in the press, he felt, in that when he got the bar cleaned to his shoulder, he found that if his bicep were thick, that it gave him additional base for some oomph in his press. He also held the bar a bit farther out, as he felt that he used the pectorals in giving him more of a push or boost from resting on his shoulders. He liked to bench press as an assisting exercise. Interesting thoughts from one of the great pressers of all time, and who did this without the help of any chemicals. Milk and squats were part of his training, and bananas.Well, may he enjoy the fact tha he was of a good deal of help to those who came after him. Thanks Doug Hepburn."},{"Title":"Strongman","review":"You don't get to read about athletes like Doug Hepburn much these days. I'm talking about the kind of athlete who makes it to the top of his sport with no motivation other than the pure love of the sport, and the outright desire to just do it. In Strongman, Tom Thurston has captured the essence of Doug and I found the book to be a great read.This book is a 'must read' for anyone trying to uncover the secrets of success in sports, or in life itself. I knew Doug personally, and I recall a conversation I had with him regarding the mental barriers that can prevent regular gains in weightlifting. I asked him specifically what to do about that. Doug put it simply, \\"it depends how badly you want to lift the weight\\".That succinct statement eludes many athletes. They get so caught up in tactics and theory, they forget about the human spirit and the power of the mind itself. Doug wasn't advocating anything silly, like pushing through serious pain. He was referring to the little tricks the mind can play to set up a barrier to improvement. We're talking about sucking it up in order to get to the next level. Doug was a master of that and Tom Thurston captures that indominatible spirit in his book.I thought I knew a lot about Doug until I read Strongman. Through Tom Thurston's painstaking research I now realize there was a lot more to the man. Doug was a humourous, self-effacing, likeable character and the last thing you'd see in him was a man who destroyed world records and won Olympic Gold Medals. What I had not realized was the incredible struggle behind his success.That makes Doug all the more amazing in my mind and I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Strongman","review":"This auto biography was dictated to T. Thurston who did a nice job writing it down. It is a good read for any strength aficionado. However, upon completion, I felt profoundly sad for the man. Doug Hepburn, although a world champion at one point, never attained anywhere near his potential. He was never an Olympic medalist, never attained an education or a profession, failed to reach any modest financial success,never had a normal personal relationship with either of his divorced parents or with a woman, never married, never had kids. He suffered depression and self destructive tendencies most of his life and fought alcoholism.Doug attained only two titles: gold in the 1953 World Weightlifting Championships in Stockholm and gold in the 1954 British Empire Games in Doug's hometown of Vancouver. In Stockholm he set a new world total in the heavyweight class and therefore was considered \\"the worlds strongest man\\". From there it was pretty much downhill, although he did eventually stop drinking.Doug was a figure to admire due to the fact that he was born with a clubbed foot yet still managed to become a great lifter and athlete. However, I completed the book with a profound feeling of sadness."},{"Title":"Strongman","review":"I picked up this book out of nostalgia, as I was once a serious weightlifter, and was born in Doug's hometown of Vancouver. I remember the impact he made when he won the '54 Olympics. When I read the book, I found it revealed a man with a magnificent will to win against all odds; a man who knew how to make demands on himself. The self destructive impulses that Hepburn reveals are latent in all of us, and particularly those who attempt to excel. Hepburn confronted these fully, and as a result achieved maturity and self knowledge. He is a man of great strength and great humility, and that combination is rare. Like so many other of the reviewers, once started, I couldn't put the book down. Best wishes Doug (wherever you are) and thanks for the book, Tom!"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks was a very interesting novel. The author Louise Erdrich has a style about her writing. The book is written from two different points of view. A young woman and an old man tell a tail that kept me reading on. The story starts with the introduction of one of the main characters Fleur. Fleur is found almost frozen to death but is nursed back to health by Nanapush on of the narrators. Flue grows up surrounded with rumors and bad luck. Fleur has a few accidents involving water and after that she changes forever. A few males that try and court her wind up drowned. People start to wonder about her and she is thought of as surrounded by dark magic and dangerous. This is just a demonstrating of how complex the plot is.The novel is very action packed and full of surprises. The novel has a lot of talk about magic and superstition. The way that the book is narrated is the most impressive thing. The two different personalities of Nanapush and Pauline the two narrators are what make this novel great. You hear what Nanapush thinks and sees and then hear the same for Pauline. The two different personalities make me think about which one is right and I find my self thinking along with one of the narrators.This book is not for any quiet reading; it jumps out and shows you a side of Native Americans that you don't hear about. You also see the difference between the Native American culture and the white American culture. The plot is well developed and makes for some complicated reading. I liked Tracks and would like to read one of Louise Erdrich other novels. Tracks is a dark book with all the magic and superstition but it had moments of passion, anger and surprises. I would recommend this book to almost any one who posses the reading ability."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"My husband had to read this book for a history course on Native Americans several years ago. When his eyes were too tired to read, I often read sections out loud to him. Those small glimpses of the book were intriguing and I have long intended to read it fully.It is the story of a people on the edge of cultural and physical extinction. The characters are so alive and the story, told in first person by two alternative narrators, is vivid, mystical and entrancing."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Louise Erdrich writes with an articulate, to-the-point beauty. She creates a compelling and heart-wrenching story in TRACKS by following the daily tribulations and struggle of four Native American women. This story is divided into several smaller tales. Each woman's story reveals her adventure and strife. Erdrich brilliantly meshes points of contact between the characters to create a powerful novel centering on the search for identity and the struggle of the Native American woman to survive in an unforgiving world."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I found this to be a wonderful book. I read it for a women's novels class in college and could not put it down. Erdrich has really shown the importance of Ojibwe culture. Nanapush is the respected elderly member, Fleur is the free spirit and Pauline is trapped between white society and the culture she grew up in. This was a truly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"What an inspiring story. Once you read one of Erdrich's books, you have to read the others. They are so accurate and respectful of Native culture."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I first read a short story by Louise Erdrich in an American Literature class. Her writing immediately captured my interest. Since then, I've read several of her books (all excellent) and &#34;Tracks&#34; did not fail to live up to my high expectations of this author.Erdrich continues to focus this story mainly on the Kashpaw and Nanapush families of Ojibwa people. Her beautiful writing drops you right in the middle of the ancient tales of tribal elders, sometimes making you wonder if this is really a work of fiction or a compilation of the oral history handed down through the tribes."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"This made me want to seek out Louise Erdrich's other books. She has an excellent style that blends humorous, sad, and political."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is an a very good book. It gives you in site of the Native American culture. Pauline was a favorite character of mines because she is crazy and has an imagination of her own. I really love how Fleur was such a mystery throughout this book which captures the reader's attention. Sometimes, the book can be a bit confusing to read, and you may have to re-read some parts to get a better understanding of what is actually taken place during the story line. I think this book is a pretty good book to read, and it is very interesting."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I made two mistakes in reading this book. First, I read it very quickly, and I think that's why I tended to get the relationships of the characters confused. Second, this book is one of a series, and, although its events occur first, it was written later. Therefore, perhaps the author intended for the reader to be already familiar with the characters. The book has alternating narrators. One is Nanapush, a Chippewa elder, who is telling Lulu her mother's story. Lulu's mother is Fleur, the central character in the book, a beguiling woman whose parents died from a white man's disease. The other narrator is Pauline, half-white, vengeful and somewhat crazy, who becomes a nun bent on self-flagellation, perhaps attempting to assuage guilt from having lured Fleur's lover toward a young, beautiful girl. I was somewhat puzzled that Nanapush seemingly so easily forgives a huge betrayal by his lover, Margaret, and I was amused by Fleur's wily act of trickery at the end."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Great book-- I don't see why a couple of other respondents said this book is lifeless, etc. The plot is excellent, and the dual narration adds to suspense. Certainly worth reading, and a must if you are into Native American literature."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"A general look at American history between 1910 and 1920 will mostly focus on America's involvement in World War I. In Erdrich's work that is placed in this time period, the focus is on another American event: the displacement of Indians from their land. The tale is carefully crafted and the magical realism allows the reader to feel like a part of the story - like he or she is taking part in it. If you want a quick read, or a really thoughtful read, this book provides both."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is such a complicated novel that it is difficult to briefly describe. Like most other Native American Stories there is the main conflict of the Indians versus the white man and Christianity. However, Erdrich's story goes beyond that. Her novel seems to mystify everything. The characters are so complex: throughout the story you wonder if Fleur actually has magic, if Nanapush tells the truth, or if Pauline the masochist is actually inflicting all of these punishments. There are several motifs/ themes in the novel: Christianity versus traditions, elusive money, family pride, and the supernatural. Lastly, the point of view alternates between Nanapush telling his story to Lulu and Pauline telling her story as a confessional. The book is not easy to read, I would definitely not call it a page turner. However, it is interesting and Erdrich has a way of pulling you into the story."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks jumped out at me in a bookstore in Northampton, Massachusetts 12 years ago. I was just browsing the shelves and I randomly picked up and bought this book. I have read it several times since then and keep reading Louise Erdrich's other books following the same characters trough generations.I fell in love with Nanapush, Fleur and their way of life. I feel uneasy about Pauline and everything she represents. Louise Erdrich has a way of weaving together dreams, smells, present time and past time. She has a way of writing poetry I can understand in the form of Nanapush and how he sees the world around him.This book is one of my most treasured books and I keep discovering new things in this and following books as I grow older and change perspective on things. It is not just a book about Native Americans but about life."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I first read this book for a high school multi cultural lit class. I was fascinated by the story then and almost 10 years later this is still one great read (at least to me). It take a little brain power to get through, this is not an easily read novel, but if you enjoy challenging reads that focus on the non-white perspective of America (like Push, or The Bluest Eye) then you will appreciate Tracks"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is a brilliant rendition of early Native American culture and the different conflicts within the Ojibwe society, as well as conflict Native Americans experienced with the imposition of white Europeans. Waves of varying emotions swept over me with each different short story, which were contrasted in an effective way through the narratives of Pauline and Nanapush. Nanapush's desire to retain traditional Native American culture is juxtaposed by Pauline's inherent need to be white and her great determination to spread the Christian faith through the reservation. Through these and other characters, Erdrich takes the reader on a journey through 12 years of Native American pain, hardship, and cultural struggle."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I was assigned the task of reading Tracks for a college English class. Though I was weary of what the novel would resemble, for I had not previously read Erdrich, I was pleasantly surprised by the ever-changing story line.This story is told in an alternating point of view by two characters, Nanapush and Pauline. The changing narrators made the novel that much more interesting to me, for I was able to see two different story lines and thought processes because of this. Another reason I recommend this novel is because of the action packed plot. Each chapter brings a new, exciting event to life. Erdrich constantly provides new twists and turns in the story for readers to contemplate. She definitely leaves her readers fully satisfied. Because I had never read a Native American novel of this sort, I felt Tracks provided a wonderful example of authentic Native American culture. I was able to enter a world besides my own, observing a lifestyle completely different than that of which I am used to. This was an honor to be able to do.Though I have given much praise to the novel, I will say that this is not a book I will read again. However, that is simply because it is not my favorite style of reading material. While I feel it is an extremely intelligent, well-written novel, it is not something that I found great pleasure in reading. It is a heavy, sometimes hard to read novel. However, if you're looking to get an insight into the true life of a Native American while reading a legendary piece of work, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is another one of Erdrich's amazing novels. Combining Ojibwe and Catholic beliefs, she creatively portrays the events that have been detrimental to Ojibwe for hundreds of years. This novel has many twists and turns in it and is very hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"This is my all time favourite of the books of ErdrichI have read. It has a special poetic feel to it. It is subtle and interesting at the same time. It stayed with me long afterI finished reading it."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"TracksThis my first book from Louise Erdrich. The setting is North Dakota and the timing of the story is early 20th century. People in the story are mostly Indians living on reservations. The main characters are Nanapush - an elderly wise man, Fleur - an odd character who was supposed to be a witch and Pauline - a mixed bred woman undergoing penance in a nunnery. The story is told from multiple first person points of view, alternated by Nanapush and Pauline. There are other characters like Kashpaw, Morriseys, Margaret (Kashpaw's mother).Fleur is supposed to have an influence on the water monster living in the lake Machimmanito. This book depicts the struggle of people to make a living in harsh winter, trying to pay taxes to keep their land, Indian folklore, politics and cultural clashes, internal feud between two clans - Pillagers and Morriseys.The narrative voice for both Nanapush and Pauline is different but in some chapters Nanapush is telling the story to someone and I couldn't figure out until few pages later on that Nannnapush is telling the story to Lulu. Erdrich has succeeded in building interesting characters. I don't recall I had come for a long time such a masterly prose. Almost every sentence is a gem. How does Erdrich do it?But if you read this book and I strongly recommend you do, you need to keep the dictionary nearby. I had problem understanding the meaning of some of the words she used.I am sure to read her next book \`Love Medicine.'"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"When I used Love Medicine in a university level English Literature course I thought I'd hit gold for getting my students to open up to literature with Erdrich's book. Lipsha's quest for identity connected with the young men and women alike. But Tracks was even more efective. Fleur's fight against the loggers and land developers turned 32 college sophmores into hardy land conservationists. The incredible transportating of a successful hunt with the meat tied to the hero's body struck a cord of awe at having been given a view of survival that took them beyond their trips to their local grocery stores. Erdrich opens windows to another culture, different values, and to history in ways that made my students begin to &quot;see&quot; the world beyond their dormrooms. What other author writing today can do the same with such poetry?"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"The story focuses around the lives of an Indian man and a little girl who are sole survivors of disease that run rampant through their tribe. The man forms a kind of grandfatherly relationship to the little girl who lost her family. The locals believe that this girl has supernatural powers. Underlying all this is the struggle of Indian tribes in the early 1900's to keep their land.The story is told in a Falknerian way. It switches between the narratives of two people, who tell the story in their oral tradition of telling a story, so vividly, so profoundly that as a reader I kept catching myself wanting to share the story orally."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"The book is set on a small Indian reservation in Wyoming, where the winters are deadly, and the summers are looked forward to. The time period is between 1912 to 1924. The author has picked an amazing setting for the book, with an equally amazing plot. The Native American culture is threatened as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Ancient rituals that consisted of a sacrifice now consist of drinking and gambling. New religions are introduced onto the reservation, and many Natives lose their faith that the chieftains have tried so hard to preserve.What I loved about this book is that the main character always changes. I found it very confusing to decipher whom was talking, but I liked re-reading what I didn&#8217;t understand. Although there were many main characters the most important one was an old man named Manitou-geezis. The story is told from every character view, but it only makes since when it is explained by Manitou-geezis, then it is fun to look back and with knowledge of what has happened see it from the view of every character. The main dilemma of the book is that a young man named Eli falls in love with a wild woman named Fleur. Since Manitou-geezis comforted and befriend Fleur when her family died as a result of the measles, Eli goes to him for advice on how to &#8220;tame&#8221; her and get her to love him. Manitou-geezis feels that Eli is the right person for Fleur even though he&#8217;s very foolish so he tells Eli about his experiences with his wives. Eli sets out to find Fleur and Fleur excepts him so they fall deeply in love. Yet when Fleur produces a baby as a result of their relation ship, Eli heads for home. Eli then has an affair with a young girl named Sophia. Eli decides that he was better off with Fleur so he returns to her but Fleur rejects him. Eli then goes to Manitou-geezis for help. Manitou-geezis and Eli are trapped in Manitou-geezis cabin due to a snowstorm and Eli eats all of the food. The storm clears up but it is to cold to go outside, but Manitou-geezis kicks Eli out.

This is partially because it switches narration often, and it is difficult to grasp what exactly is happening because time doesn't flow in a consistent rate. However if you can get past this, it reads pretty well.The novel is an allegory for the plight of the Ojibwe people as they amalgamate into, or resist the urge to conform to modern society, through the eyes of a few key characters representing different aspects of the culture.That being said, it's not the most entertaining story. I found that I was only interested in the half of the novel focusing and narrated by the character Pauline, whereas the half from the point of view of Nanapush drug on tediously.While my Professor simply adored this novel (as well as the rest of Louise Erdrich's work), I guess it just didn't do much for me."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I did not receive the other book that I also ordered by the same author, Louise Erdrich.

The problem with Tracks is that the narrative and imagery don't enhance the story. Instead, they confuse it and drag it down, slowing down the pace and making me wonder if it isn't just an attempt to flesh out what should really be a short story. Sometimes, more is just more, not better. I kept wishing Erdrich would stop playing with words and just tell the stupid story and get it over with. Just another great example of how Fiction has lost sight of storytelling in favor of novels that are so bogged down under the weight of their prose that they fail to engage readers."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I very seldom not finish reading a book but I could not take more than half of this book.

It started off hard to follow, and then as it progressed, it became more and more difficult to comprehend. There is a lot of old people sex and sexual inuendos. The plot is slow and to be honest, i am really not interested in reading any more books about indians. I'm not racist, just sick of all the indian books! I do think that the book was written well and it was interesting how Erdrich switched narrators.

This was quiet possibly the most wretched book I have ever had the misfortune to lay my hands on, since I am an avid reader it took alot to earn that position with me. The story line moves horribly slow. The narration flips back and forth with each chapter between a wise old man, and an illogical, mentaly ill future nun who engages in strange practices of self torture. The parts narrarated by the nun do not make sense, do not enrich the plot and break the flow of the book since it is mostly nonsense taking place in her head. To much nonsense and unneccesary sex. Don't waste your time on this book, your time would be better spent watching grass grow."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a piece of \\"literature\\" before. I really couldn't believe the fact that I had no connection with these bizarre series of events or any of the characters. Not only that, but I didn't just start counting pages, I started counting paragraphs, and then sentences and then words. If I didn't have to read this book for an English class I think I would've ripped all the pages out and then burned it, okay, maybe not something so dramatic.I guess now that I've given my initial review of the book, I'd like to explain myself.First of all, I went into reading this book expecting something great. Perhaps this is one of the reasons as to why I was so dissatisfied with its content.For the first time, in a long time, I was given something besides African American and Hispanic/Latino literature for a multi-ethnic literature class. Going into this book I was all excited that we were going to discuss something different in class. I was happy to be learning something about a culture that I haven't been that exposed to.Unfortunately, this book was not the book I was looking for.The book had two narrators and they would switch off with every other chapter. The first narrator was this older gentleman who had lived a long time and experienced a lot, but may have been slightly senile. His name was Nanapush. The second was a slightly insane, self-hating, hypocritically religious, crazy woman (because I don't think bad words can be said on amazon.com) named Pauline. These two, were able to put together the most deranged story ever, leaving you with a skewed series of events in your mind that really left you with nothing but confused.One thing that I would say I liked a little bit about the book was that in Nanapush's sections Erdrich was able to slip in some important information about the compromising situations that the Native American people were put through. The book actually starts out with Nanapush describing the \\"spotted sickness\\" and the way it was killing off so many of his people. Being one of the stronger men on the reservation he saved a girl named Fleur from the disease. Fleur was this mystical character that had some strange connection with the water, because she was so beautiful that the water monster wanted her. Basically the story was about Fleur. She was beautiful, she was strong, and in some ways powerful.Pauline would explain her perspective on the way she saw Fleur, but she loved fleur and hated her at the same time. Pauline was jealous of Fleur and angry that the men loved her, but at the same time she loved Fleur because that's what she wanted to be.Nanapush had kind of turned into an uncle to Fleur ever since he saved her from the sickness and they became part of each other's lives.All this may seem a bit vague, but it's only because this is what the book leaves you with, bits and pieces of vague stories that are hard to make sense out of."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"we had to read this book for english class, and it is awful. I dont believe i can repeat the things that i think about this book in this forum, but i think you guys get the idea. If you enjoy boring stories about non-relavent things, feel free to bore yourself with this boring novel."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"After reading several different Native American authors, I finally had the privilege of reading Louise Erdrich. TRACKS captured my imagination as I listened to Nanapush and Pauline tell their stories. Erdrich brilliantly has the two narrators cast doubt upon each other's tales- a tactic which makes the book all the more enthralling to read. Pauline's zealous quest for sainthood, filled with sacrifices that border on ridiculousness, contrasts with Fleur's relationship to nature, embodied in the forest and the lake creature, Misshepeshu. Erdrich's characters endear themselves to the readers with their first-person revelations, their bawdy senses of humor, and their uncanny strength. The sexual banter between Margaret and Nanapush brings the characters to thriving, realistic life. TRACKS presents these characters against the backdrop of a dwindling forest, which government agents consume piece by piece, selling to American logging companies. As Fleur and Nanapush's homeland disappears, their struggle to control their own future becomes present and touching. Each of the characters reaches out in a different way to attempt to determine their future in some way. TRACKS deserves several reads, and Louise Erdrichs deserves high praise for an incredible and entertaining work."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"\\"Tracks\\" of Fleur and through her the end of a way of life for a Native American tribe in the early 20th century. Her story and the tribes story is told through the eyes of two people, Nanapush an elder who is sympathetic to Fleur and the Native American lifestyle and through Pauline a woman twisted with a sort of love/hate obsession with Fleur and a repulsion of her own heritage.Nanapush tells the story to his \`granddaughter' Lilly, Fleur's child. He does this to explain her incomprehensible mother who seems to have abandoned her for no reason as well as a way to explain the politics of the tribe. He wants to save Lily from what he sees as an unsuitable marriage and reunite her with her mother and fully with her Native American heritage.Pauline, narrates to who knows what or who or for what purpose. Her madness is captivating and is a manifestation of the sickness, literally and figuratively, that the alien (white) culture brings to the Native American people.At the same time this is a story about women. Fleur, is an incomprehensible woman who breaks the rules of what it is to be an Indian woman and is feared and respected as a consequence of her actions. Her beauty and fierceness make her a force of nature. Pauline is a woman who is treated without worth as a woman. It is this, and her soul sickening envy, I believe, that drives her madness. Margaret, Lily's grandmother represents the traditional strong Native American woman I believe, and while her methods for survival are of the Mac tuck variety she ends up surviving and living the best of all three of the woman.The book covers 12 years and is a lyrical look at a culture's struggle to survive."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"In keeping with the development of Erdrich's rich, fictional Native American saga, &quot;Tracks&quot; takes her characters one step closer to reality. Contrary to initial impression, the novel does not limit itself by cultural lines. Erdrich's work provides an insightful and engrossing tale, which highlights the struggles of a frayed culture. However, spoilers abound and surprises go unappreciated for those who haven't read her previous works first. Erdrich makes brilliant use of alternating narrators. One speaker is a highly spiritual grandfather named Nanapush, and the other a crazed and confused Indian woman called Pauline, retelling the life of protagonist Fleur. Both offer differing slants when shedding light on Fleur's troubles, including passage through a suicidal youth and falling in love with shy Indian boy Eli. Rich imagery, and the short-and-sweet figurative way of Native American storytelling may be a bit much for some. However, the manner of speech fits the novel beautifully for those so inclined to a book of this type. Interesting, not mind-blowing, it is an honest and sufficient work in the representation and preservation of a culture."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I read this book in a Native American Literature course about 12 years ago. My father is full blooded Native American and my teacher was white and I thought he couldn't teach me anything. I had a chip on my shoulder and my teacher knocked it off of me with this book. He told me he wanted ME to teach this book to the class so I had to read this book like I had never read any book before. Perhaps my unique connection to the book made me enjoy the book more than these other reviewers, but I think that it would still be one of my favorite books even if had not read it for class. I teach high school English and have read A LOT of books - all kinds of books, not just classics. Even if you read this and find that you can't fully understand it, that's OKAY. Part of the problem with my students is they are always looking for the AUTHOR\\"S interpretation or the TEACHER'S interpretation - just enjoy your own interpretation. The book is not that hard to understand, but the imagery and symbolism is deep. This is an important book, as pretty soon there will be no Native Americans left to tell our stories. Less than 1% of this nation is Native American and it's important to read these stories. The mixing of Christianity with Native traditions is particularly significant in this story. In fact, I based my Master's thesis on the themes in this work. I met Louise Erdrich a couple of years ago at a book signing and I wanted to tell her this book changed my life, but how cheesy would that be?"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"In all of her work, Louise Erdrich writes with rich visual language, and always from the heart. Until I read Tracks, I held up Love Medicine as Erdrich's best, and one of my all-time favorite novels. Tracks surpasses Love Medicine in scope, personality, and drama. The early lives of Erdrich's legends - Fleur and Moses Pillager, Eli and Nector, Lulu Nanapush,the Morrisseys, and even Sister Leopolda unfold in the despair and heartache of the early part of this century, when the Chippewas were just begining to lose their land and their lives to alcohol, disease, and other pressures from the ever-encroaching whites. What I love about both Love Medicine and Tracks, more than, say, The Beet Queen is the amazing number of characters Erdrich can master, and the way she interweaves their lives. Tracks does Love Medicine one better by making the circle of voices a bit smaller, and the stories more intensely personal. This book made me cry at work and laugh out loud on the subway. If you love the way Erdrich creates many varried personalities to tell a story, you will love this book. If you've never read any of her work, this is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Louise Erdrich has written I don't know how many novels featuring Fleur Pillager and her still-increasing North Dakota Chippewa clan. Tracks remains my favorite, mostly because of Nanapush, surely one of the most wonderful characters ever to inhabit the pages of a novel. \\"Talk is an old man's last vice,\\" Nanapush says. When he gets ill, he says \\"I got well by talking. Death could not get a word in edgewise, grew discouraged, and traveled on.\\" You won't, you'll sit at Nanapush's feet and never want to get up, not while he's still talking. My only complaint about Tracks is it's too short.The Beet Queen: A Novel (P.S.)andLove Medicine: A Novel (P.S.)are about the same characters, not really sequels or prequels, just more stories about the same great folks. You'll be happy you get more than one visit."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Erdrich is an amazing weaver of words. There are two narrators in this book, each chapter alternates between Nanapush an older very traditional Ojibwe man and Pauline a contemporary of our main character Fleur, who is shunning the traditional ways.I had a hard time with this book because I really enjoyed Nanapush's narration, he is funny and wise and insightful. But then I would get to the next chapter that was narrated by Pauline--who in a way reminds me of Elphalba from \\"Wicked\\" she is determined to be always right, essentially destroying herself and those around her. She is a selfish and mentally deluded character.The twin narration follows the life of one character, Fleur. She is like and adoptive daughter to Nanapush and a sort of sister/rival to Pauline. While Pauline is rather homley Fleur is beautiful and other worldly. Her tribes people suspect her of a liason with the monster that lives in the lake.Its the story of people being pushed off their land by the government and some of their own people. Ultimately the story is a tragedy with some mythic elements and great dashes of humour (courtesy of Nanapush--he is a brilliant character, I'd almost reccomend reading this book on the strength of him alone)."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"A story of an elusive woman(Fleur Pillager) entangled in the larger event of the Native American peoples' loss of their homeland. Erdrich is masterful in her ability to express both Fleur's human and mystical qualities through the voices of two narrators, each revealing complex lives and relationships of their own. A perspective is presented so that the new white order, who wield &quot;this method of leading others with a pen and piece of paper&quot;, becomes a foreign way of thought(though it is of course our modern Western way), which consumes the Native American culture as fast as it wipes the trees from its landscape."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"This is a beautiful novel that captures the mystic qualities of the lives that Native Americans lived. Yes, I too read this in college, but count it as one of the best books I read during that time. It is a book for discerning readers who have learned to appreciate the skill it takes for an author to re-create the ethereal nature of the characters she has dreamed."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Erdrich's Tracks offers a new and intriguing perspective on Native American life. Rather than following conventional writing techniques, Erdrich offers a short story cycle narrative in which two characters, Nanapush and Pauline, tell a story from two very different perspectives. I will have to admit though, the story is confusing due to this feature, but it also adds a personal touch that sets it apart from other novels. As unique as the novel may be, the tale is clouded with imagery that often leaves readers confused as well as frustrated at certain points. Moreover, the descriptions of Native American life and the events that unfold in the novel seem almost mythical and very unrealistic. This seems to suggest that Erdrich has a certain reverence towards Native American culture and views it with awe and vivid imagination."},{"Title":"George Bush: The Life of a Lone Star Yankee","review":"To me as a non-American it has always been a puzzle why George Bush is generally regarded as mediocre and after reading the thoughtful and very complete biography by mr. Parmet I have not found the answer.Bush has been a succesful businessman after a distinguisged service in the Air Force during the war. He has served as a Senator, as head of the CIA, as the Ambassador to China in an extremely interesting period in Sino-American relations and, finally, as a Vice-President to a very succesful President. What more can you ask as preparation for the most powerful job on earth? It is true that he failed to get elected twice, but is it not a credit to any man when he overcomes defeat to embark on such an interesting career?The view which I get from this biography is on a balanced man who understood politics very well and also had the gift of personal integrity unmatched by most of his predecessors and certainly not by his successor.It is true that he was not the greatest of communicators and PR guys, but there one should not forget that he had a very difficult, if not impossible act to follow. It is to his credit that he did not even try to imitate Reagan, but that he led the country in his own personal style.One should forgive for being biased, as a European, to his Foreign Policy, since my understanding for and interest in the domestic scene is limited.Bush Presidency can be characterised by formidable leadership in two distinguished events. His conduct of the events of the Gulf War was exemplary. Powell get's a lot of the credit, but I feel that is, partly, undeserved. It was the President's deciding leadership which effectively stopped Saddam's adventure in Kuwait. Of all the wars in which the US got involved after 1945 the handling of the Gulf War was the most succesful. It has been an act of extraordinary diplomacy and brinkmanship to get e.g. Saudi Arabia and Israel on one line. Haven't we all been worried about the Tel Aviv reaction after the first scud missiles hit the country? Personnaly I will not forget the relief I felt when, in the middle of the night in Europe, I saw and listened to Bush anouncing the invasion. This was clearly a leader who believed in what he was doing and who felt to be in full control, aware of the risks of his venture.A second event has been the unification of Germany. After all the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, it was under Bush that this extraordinary process was done swiftly and with great succes and, most astonishing, without bloodshed. I am aware that the prime players were Kohl and Gorbachov, but it could never have been done without the full support and the tacit agreement of the US. Indeed, by taking a silent and , overtly, modest role Bush did exactly the right thing. I don't think under Reagan, it would have been as smooth.All this is reconted in this book in fine scholarly detail, which distinguishes this author from the many, more sensational, political writings one sees so often these days.I think this is a fine book about a succesful Presidency and a man of integrity one could only wish would emerge more on the political scene."},{"Title":"George Bush: The Life of a Lone Star Yankee","review":"The Life of a Lone Star Yankee provides an interesting and thoughtful look a George Bush Sr. and how his life impacted his presidency. Parmet provides a balanced look at Bush looking at not only his presidential time but his personal and business life as well. He traces Bush's role as a man who makes money and then enters public service and approaches it as a family way of life. By taking a family approach and showing how the eldest Bush impacted his son and grandson the 43rd president a pattern does begin to emerge. Barbra's role as a mediator and show piece of family values is also apparent throughout his life. George Bush Sr. seems to relish being President and strove to make the best decisions possible within each of the decisions he made as President. From war with Iraq and Panama to social decisions such as Supreme Court nominees and tax hikes he gave careful thought to each decision. His skills as a campaigner were impressive and well detailed and his rise was largely through the talent of Ronald Reagan's teams and not his own.Parmet shows the successes in school, business, and marriage, his time at the CIA and his accomplishments as President. On the other side he shows the struggles in campaigning, in his role as vice president and reconciling his beliefs with Reagan as well as the trials and tribulations as President. If one is looking for a biography that bashes the president this is not it but it does point out his faults and despite what other reviews said it is not simply the greatness of Bush but a fair evaluation. Overall this book provides a look at if you want an excellent overview of George Bush Sr than this is the place to start."},{"Title":"George Bush: The Life of a Lone Star Yankee","review":"The biographer was a distinguished scholar at the Conference on the Bush Presidency at Hofstra University in April 1997. Although this book was essentially finished by the time of the Conference, there is at least one footnote (Steven Burgess) referring to a paper presented at Hofstra. This reviewer suggested that Parmet look at the critical books by Jack Matlock on Bush's foreign policy and Monica Crowley's book on Nixon's devastating appraisal of Bush, but there is no evidence that this occurred. P More importantly, Parmet is weak when it comes to explaining the Bush stagnation. Despite the Persian Gulf War, there ensued the slowest four-year growth period in the postwar years. Thus, it is more appropriate to refer to the Bush stagnation rather than the Bush recession. P Whereas it is possible to describe Reagan's supply-side economics as a version of &quot;commercial Keynesianism,&quot; there would seem to be no Keynesian bones in George Bush. Bush raised taxes in 1990, in collaboration with Tom Foley, as the economy headed downward. Later he refused to sign a reasonable tax cut coming out of Congress in March 1992. Instead he relied primarily on a change in withholding of income taxes which produced a brief upturn in the fourth quarter followed by sluggish growth in early 1993 when the tax rebates were smaller due to the previous tax cuts in 1992. P Readers interested in a critique of Bush's economic policy may want to read the contribution of Timothy Canova after the publication of the proceedings by Greenwood. 92.

Prep school- and Ivy League-educated son of an aristocratic, rich Connecticut US Senator, he transplanted himself to Texas and (with a resounding lack of success) tried to re-invent himself as an old-school Texan. He lost two consecutive attempts to become a US Senator himself, and would have been a completely forgotten political wannabe had it not been for the charitable help of Presidents Nixon and Ford, who appointed the &quot;wimp&quot; to some key positions, which obviously made Bush think he was competent enough to become president, because he then ran in 1980. After being destroyed by Reagan in the primaries (and denouncing Reaganomics as &quot;voodoo&quot;), he then received some more remarkable charity when Reagan picked him for his running mate. After eight years as Vice President, Bush finally won the presidency (although he never would have won if he hadn't have been Reagan veep) and soon proved as incompetent at that job as Dan Quayle at a spelling bee. In short, Bush was a politically unsuccessful, rich New Englander who happened to have been picked for the right jobs by a couple of America's other worst presidents, and was then able to become President himself.

Viorst describes in a series of poems the progression of unHipness after marriage in the 60's.

There are still some who maintain this book was not produced in 'ancient times' at all! In fact some will maintain that nearly ALL of our 'most cherished' classical works are not 'ancient' at all...but I digress. Most translations do not include all of the book and give an unnecessarily rosy depiction of horsemanship at the time. I'm not sure it really is the beginnings or foundations of dressage at all, though that is what is repeated over and over these days. I was told quite firmly years ago that Xenophon invented the Levade, which is actually a relatively modern invention and may not go back much more than a hundred years. But there are other very interesting books on horses as well - such as the one published about 1250 that includes instructions in how to create a five gaited horse (walk-trot-canter-stepping pace-rack, a la American Saddlebred). Even so, despite every effort, it isn't really all that clear that the riding in 1250 or Xenophon's time really looks like what we imagine or is that similar to what we do - or would be able to stomach! Even so, an interesting ready and something any student of riding can enjoy."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"This was a cute, well witten classic.

No unnessecary drama or gratuitious anything.Will increase childrens and adults vocabulary."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"I loved this book when I was girl! And as a parent, I loved reading it to my own kids. The children in the novel have exciting adventures and develop real and honestly portrayed friendships. They face hardships, difficult choices, and loss, and we watch them grow and mature with the help of loving parents and mentors.As a girl I was entranced by the descriptions of this long-ago world: taffy pulls, \\"theatrical\\" evenings organized by young people, \\"going Maying,\\" . . . And what an eye-opener to find out what a \\"Temperance Club\\" was! But the best thing about JACK AND JILL is the friendships, so lovingly and completely depicted.This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"A five star story.Jack and Jill has been one of my unsung favorites for many years. A stand alone story not one of a series. It is a good quick read with many of the time period's nuances. I am an Alcott lover and my favorites are not the Little Women series, but her other caricatures of young women. Eight Cousins, Rose in Bloom, An Old Fashioned Girl and Jack and Jill are all ones I re-read often. Simple tales of growing up many years ago. They are not the farm/wilderness tales of Laura Ingalls, but the precursors to the American Girl type books and in my opinion, much better.A one star edition.My complaint is that this particular edition is billed as a High Quality paperback edition. My original copy was my mothers many years ago and I was looking for a paperback to use as my re-read copy. This edition is in a horrid courier font with no formatting and the paragraphs are split by a return. To get to know and maybe love this story as much as I do...find a real book copy of it not this pretender that would put even those faithful to the story off. I am don't even want to give it away lest I teach someone to dislike a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"I read voraciously as a child, and this book was one of my favorites.

But I read it off the Gutenberg project and loved it so much I bought it off Amazon. It's so sweet. Storyline similar to What Katy Did by Susan Coolidge, girl is stubborn, injures herself (well and jack), may be paralysed, after a bit of preaching, she decides to be good and she eventually heals but is better for the lesson. Sounds boring, but the characters are interesting and sweet. And they're believable. Loved it."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"While this is not my favorite Alcott novel, I still enjoy reading it as a portrait of the responsibilities and amusements of boys and girls in the 19th century. While Jack and Jill recuperate from their injuries sustained \\"coasting\\" on the \\"lulla,\\" they mature and change, as do their friends, whose small projects to make their life better result in, if not in unimportant monetary wealth or fame, happier times to last them the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"Alcott has the amazing knack of entertaining while educating at the same time and you don't know you've been given a good moral to digest until its too late.

The story of the two friends never rises above the mediocre.The characters are so roughly sketched in that they certainly do not live in the book though the reader may be able to find similar characters in Alcott's other works. Rates high on my list only for the good, old fashioned values it tries to express but would probably be rejected by todays readers as being too preachy, a fault that does not plague Alcott's better efforts. On the whole a must only if you are a staunch fan."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"I'm sorry to see that this book has been so poorly received by other reviewers. It is not a family book like Little Women or the Rose Duo, but this is a Louisa May Alcott classic that should not be ignored. If nothing else, the interaction between social classes in America, represented by the mothers of Jack and Jill is endlessly fascinating. Also, this book could appeal to both genders. Both boys and girls will be entranced with the train and mechanical images, and it's unusual to read a child's book and have such fresh descriptions...something perhaps owing to the newness of trains at the time. The three girls, Jill, Molly and Merry, and their plans for self-improvement can be seen in almost every young adult book marketed towards girls. What's refreshing about this one is that they're self-improvement is not for the benefit of their peers or to &quot;get a boy&quot;, but rather, Louisa May Alcott has them develop for their own personal growth. In an age when self-help books are on the best seller list, this book shows how it was done before it was a science. In addition, it's novel for it's intrerest in health fads and regiments, new school ideas, and the imporance of an American youth culture. Give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"While Jack and Jill might not rate as one of the best Alcott novels, it is not worth dismissing out of hand for that reason. As usual, she crafted a thought provoking and enlightened book that teaches as it entertains and comforts.Jack and Jill are fast childhood friends who find their lives interrupted by a terrible sledding accident which leaves both of them invalids. As they recover and heal, they and their friends learn important lessons about responsibility, giving and friendship. Jack and Jill should be an immensely satisfying read for pre-teenagers. The sure Alcott hand with character keeps even the most obvious moral lessons from feeling overly preachy.While the book is ideally suited for younger readers, grown ups will be interested in the larger issues raised here. Alcott firmly asserts the need for individual growth, gender equality, and personal responsbility. Historical discussions about temperance and higher education for women should additionally make this book a good read for history fans."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"This charming, old-fashioned children's story begins by mirroring the nursery rhyme. Two friends, Jack and Jill, go up a hill to go sledding. They come tumbling down, and Jack breaks his leg while Jill injures her back more seriously. The book tells the tale of their recuperation and also of their and their friends' journey into young adulthood. The book is slightly moralistic, in the way that Little Women is; the young people earnestly want to become &quot;good&quot; and to help their friends become &quot;good&quot;. Although this style is not in fashion now, it still makes for a sweet, hope-filled story. Very enjoyable. Also recommended: An Old-Fashioned Girl by Louisa May Alcott."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"I've long been a fan of the lesser Louisa May Alcott books and now my daughter has discovered them too. I was pleased to find Jack and Jill available in this handy paperback by an on-demand publisher. My seventh-grade daughter pounced on the book first, in great excitement. It was a bit deflating that there was no book-specific cover art or back cover material--it is a standard, rather ugly cover and the back text advertises the publisher itself. But I guess there's no arguing with that part. Far worse, my daughter found a minefield of typos in the first few pages, which proved very distracting. Then she found that about 1 1/2 pages from 3-4 were repeated verbatim on pages 5-6. She showed me both problems and she was absolutely right: the printing process had gone completely haywire. There was no reason to expect these issues were confined to the first few pages, and we had lost faith in the whole edition. Regretfully, we have sent the book back."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"This book is an interesting improvement on the clasic nursery rhyme.With its twist of humor and sadness, Jack and Jill emphasises the value of friendship and the comfort that simple creativity can give.In spite of all these good qualities, I would rate this book as far from Alcott's best. It is too predictable and rather disapointing. Although less &quot;preachy&quot; than many of Alcott's books, the sermons are more direct and lack the pleasing maturity that gives such works as Little Women, An Old Fashoned Girl, and Eight Cousins their originality.All considered it is still a sweet, cuddle-up-by-the-fire book. I recommend to any of Louisa's most-devoted fans, esp those between 9 and 12."},{"Title":"Jack And Jill","review":"This has a sticky, preachy quality about it -too sweet. but although the beginning bears a resemblance to the rhyme, the story is for young adults and adults.

I could hardly put it down until I finished reading it!The great things about this book are the same in the rest: the author has a gift for description, from the character's attire, post-Civil War mannerisms and etiquette, to the setting the book takes place in. It really makes the reader be able to acurately picture exactly what is going on. Also, each character is very well developed with their thoughts and emotions and you find yourself curious about every single one.\\"There is a Season\\" includes almost all of the main characters from the previous two novels. Cheney and Shiloh, of course, but also Cheney's parents, Dev and Victoria with their 3 adopted children (Dart, Solange, and Lisette), Bain Winslow, plus our favorite hired help like Sketes, Fiona, and Jauncy. The plot was different (murder wasn't really something Cheney had experienced until the last novel) and intriguing.The only disappointment I had was that there is not very much about the relationship between Cheney and Shiloh. Cheney didn't even personally enter the book until a few chapters had gone by. Maybe the first two books of \\"Cheney & Shiloh: The Inheritance\\" had more relationship development simply because it was the beginning of the Irons-Winslows' marriage. Dev was also absent until the end of the book, so there was hardly any information on the Dev-Victoria relationship or what Dev thinks of his new introduction to parenthood with his adopted kids.Overall, it was a great read and I will read it many times again.

Bravo to the Father and daughter novel writing team! Great historical and fabulous characters. There was never a character too insignificant or great that I did not have a clear understanding of who they were or what they stood for. As both medicine and Christianity are strong interests in my own life, I thoroughly enjoyed the history of medicine evolving and the faith of several of the characters. I loved that Cheney and Shiloh acknowledged that medicine and the love of Jesus can not be separated, and their concern that a dying patient have the chance to call on the LORD Jesus to be saved. Excellent! I actually learned something about the chemical Thallium and the spectroscope. I took the time to google it for myself. I'm sorry to see the series is done but after 11 books, it is time to move on, I guess. These books, as all of the Morris books, are worth your time. Thanks to the Morris's for many, many hours of entertainment. Reading sure beats sitting in front of a television! And no commercials.

A real goldmine of treasure will be found in this book. The book is not intended to teach the language (i.e. American Sign Language), but presents how research proves that it is indeed a language in its own right--apart from English. Recomended reading for any serious student of the language."},{"Title":"The Signs of Language","review":"This book is and was intended for use by linguists, educators, and others such as anthropologists who were in the 1970's and the 1980's beginning to realize that ASL was not a manual gesture system mimicing English, but rather a language in its own right. Dr. Bellugi and Dr. Klima have been working on exploring this language for the past 30 years, both in studying native signers (the prelingually deafened of deaf parents) and also in studying aphasics in the deaf community in comparison to aphasics in the hearing community. This particular book sticks mostly with elucidating the grammar, the lexicon, the syntax, and all the other components which make up ASL.As a Deaf person whose first language was English, and who was required in college to take a foreign language I had to, of course, learn ASL. I started using ASL when I totally lost my hearing to get information in my classes which I couldn't get through lipreading. As I progressed in Neuroscience and Science education for my Ph.D. I found that I needed to know more about ASL and the grammar and syntax of it. This particular book was required for one of my classes studying English versus ASL grammar. Because the book is so heavy duty, I did not read enough for the book or language to make sense. It wasn't until I read the book over summer vacation, very slowly, that I gleaned the vital information which I needed as both an educator and a neuroscientist.This is not an easy book to read. Many of the best books never are. This is not to say that the authors did not try to make the information accessible. They did, but the topic is very confounding. I recommend this book for anyone sincerely interested in learning accurately about ASL, no matter what their field, but with the warning to give yourself time to assimulate the information, and read the book. I personally would not require reading the book partially for a class, because it is only in starting from the beginning and going to the end that you can view the language as a whole. This is a book that should be used and read over a period of two semesters, with a lot of discussion.

Whereas the propaganda system wants us to believe that the media is pluralistic and open to opposing points of view, the reality is that the media is heavily tilted towards espousing corporate interests that are at odds with the interests of the general population. The result is that democracy is greatly weakened because a functioning democracy depends on an informed public to make decisions. This current state of affairs stems from the simple fact that the media is owned by wealthy individuals and corporations who only allow us to hear and see what is in their interests. In addition to exposing the corruption of the media, if you will, this book gives some guidlines as to how citizens can make the media more responsive to our needs."},{"Title":"Our Media, Not Theirs: The Democratic Struggle against Corporate Media (Open Media Series)","review":"The key issue today is media reform.An aggressive and adversarial press is crucial to our democracy.Much of the apathy and disappointment that people express with the state of the world is due in no small part to the media. In my opinion, Americans have always been somewhat self-absorbed and apathetic. Also, there is really no such thing as &quot;objective&quot; journalism. Never was, and unlikely there ever will be. Everyone has their own biases and assumptions, especially journalists. What's different today is that media consolidation has reduced the number of competing voices to a very small, advertiser-focused group of companies, who are trying to deliver news as cheaply as possible. That.s why you know more about J. Lo than about, say, the fact that the US is giving no longer giving any aid to Afghanistan -- after eviscerating their government and decimating the country. There's just no profit in telling Americans the real news, or so it seems.What's the usual problem with &quot;lefty&quot; type books, especially those written by academics? They usually spend an inordinate amount of time trying to prove their thesis correct, and by the time they have beaten you over the head with facts and statistics, they peter out on any suggestions for solutions, and the reader is left feeling helpless, angry and more depressed than when they started reading. That's a recipe for the marginalization of progressives, especially during these conservative times.McChesney and Nichols don't fall into that trap with this book, however.

The authors have demonstrated well that there is absolutely no business entity that our trusted congressmen cannot penetrate and control, and the most important to them has been our national media. While other corporations have just given campaign cash in return for taxpayer assets, sometimes even policies affecting national security, politicians have sealed the deal with media cash PLUS the ability to control their lifeline to the voting public. Not only do they get Big Media cash with this deal, they get a media that is not very likely to report on the daily corruption by them or their party. Sure, the Tom DeLay campaign's $500,000 payments to his wife and daughter will get reported (how can they cover that up?), but the meat of our corrupt moneyed political system will sit on the shelf. Why? Because Big Media is now a major player in the political system.With the blessing of congress (in return for cash), big media conglomerates have been able to acquire most of the local broadcasters and press with a hands-off policy by the FTC, and there are no longer checks and balances.

George Harrison has warned us all about the media with his very last album - BRAINWASHED. Jerry Mander warned us years ago when he wrote: FOUR ARGUMENTS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF TELEVISION. Now, Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols are warning us yet again with OUR MEDIA, NOT THEIRS. ... Read this book if you're angry enough about the media in general to begin to DO something about it, because this book does not stop at complaining about what is bad about the media; it offers us all multiple solutions to how we can actually confront the situation and create viable alternatives to this BEAST that is devouring everything in its path like a rabid Godzilla on steroids!... This is SERIOUS business! Look what they write on pages 91 and 92: \\"As in the United States, a striking and important consequence of the global commercial media market has been the attack on journalism, and the reduction in its capacity to serve as the basis for an informed, participating citizenry. Let us be clear here: We are not blaming the global media system for all the flaws in journalism. Establishing a media system that fosters a freewheeling, independent, wide-ranging, and vibrant journalism and political culture is no easy matter, though it is something that all democratic societies should aspire to develop. National press systems prior to - and in conjunction with - the global commercial system were and are sometimes adequate at this job, but many were failures. Frequently, the media have been owned by wealthy individuals or firms that have clearly censored journalism to support their usually reactionary politics, as is the case in Turkey today. Both public and commercial broadcasters in many nations have often been handmaidens of the dominant political parties and interests. In places like Mexico, Peru, and Brazil the dominant commercial broadcasters have tended to be in bed with the dominant pro-business political parties, and to use their media power aggressively and shamelessly to maintain the favored parties in power. Editors and reporters from dissident media who courageously bucked the system and reported on those in power have often found themselves arrested or on the receiving end of a beating or a gunshot. These practices continue today across the world.\\" ... Not very NICE!... But there is hope! Read on, from pages 123 and 124: \\"Yet as important as this work is, there are inherent limits to what can be done with independent media, even with access to the Internet. Too often, the alternative media remain on the margins, seemingly confirming that commercial media conglomerates have become so massive because they \\"give the people what they want.\\" The problem with this disconnect is that it suggests that corporate media have mastered the marketplace on the basis of their wit and wisdom. In fact, as we noted earlier, our media system is not the legitimate result of free market competition. It is the result of relentless lobbying from big-business interests that have won explicit government policies and subsidies permitting them to scrap public-interest obligations and increase commercialization and conglomeration. It is untenable to accept such massive subsidies for the wealthy, and to content ourselves with the \\"freedom\\" to forge alternatives that only occupy the margins. How , then, can we force a change in the media systems that dominate the discourse and misinform the debate? By organizing the media democracy movement to make a great leap forward.\\"... As Jesus said, resisting evil is not the way. Focusing on fighting fire with fire merely draws you into entangled engagement with illusory duality and conflict. We must IGNORE THEM TO DEATH! We must create a critical mass as a viable alternative that totally ECLIPSES the beast that has dominated our path to the pursuit of happiness, a fulfilling life, and true liberty. Only this way, can we find our way out of this mess - by all joining together, in spite of the powers that be, in order to build a new media that does not merely entertain or misinform but one which truly educates and enlightens our whole society and culture. ... YOWZA! - The Aeolian Kid"},{"Title":"Our Media, Not Theirs: The Democratic Struggle against Corporate Media (Open Media Series)","review":"'Our Media Not Theirs' is one of two or three books that convinced me that the gulf between conservatives and liberals in the United States is relatively small while the one between powerful corporations and the majority of American citizens is enormous. In this refreshing, intelligent, and down-to-earth book, McChesney and Nichols provide an astute analysis of increasing corporate media consolidation and its harmful impact on life and democracy in America. As this trend continues, according to McChesney and Nichols, media content is increasingly geared toward profit and provides no significant analysis or factual reporting. As a result, Americans are left with massive advertising whose requirements not only displace news content but actually begin to shape it. The news, according to McChesney, and Nichols is evolving into a massive infomercial--a trend that is deeply opposed by Americans on all ends of the political spectrum.McChesney and Nichols dispel many commonly held myths of the American media including the notion that it merely 'gives the people what they want'. The authors demonstrate that media content is not determined by popular demand but by corporate and advertising requirements. Many well documented surveys, hearings, and town meetings indicate that Americans of all political stripes hunger for a real media, for one that provides objective reporting of facts, meaningful analysis, and an examination of different points of view.The authors also explain the puzzling myth of the media's liberal bias. Conservative zealots such as Rush Limbaugh and Anne Cultur often accuse the media of excessive and, in their opinion, offensive liberal views, while many liberals view the media as the propaganda wing of the political and economic elite. McChesney and Nichols trace the myth of media liberal bias back to the Reagan era when any questioning of the president's character or competence was immediately labeled a liberal bias. But when it comes to the most significant stories of the past two years (The dysfunctional 2000 presidential election, government and corporate corruption resulting in the collapse of major companies such as Enron, and the causes of 9/11 and the resulting 'War on Terrorism') the media refuses to provide meaningful, fact-based, and analytical coverage of events. This is especially evident in the case of Enron and similar companies, in which the media simply categorized the phenomenon as a bad business problem and ignored its massive implications of political corruption. In the case of 9/11, the media desisted from any meaningful analysis of the facts and instead produced paean after paean for President Bush.Does the media deliver any meaningful content to anyone at all? McChesney and Nichols argue that, sure, they provide round the clock business coverage for a tiny minority of bankers, traders, and corporate executives. But when it comes to operating a free press that provides a variety of coverage that is essential to any functioning democracy, the media doesn't deliver. Most media legislation such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is performed behind closed doors and almost always results in increasing consolidation.This book would be pretty depressing if it were only a critical analysis of the corporate media, but fortunately there is more to it than that. McChesney and Nichols chronicle both the dissatisfaction that Americans of all political persuasions feel toward the media and the burgeoning movement for media reform. In asking concerned readers to get involved with media reform, the authors compare this situation with reform movements of the past to illustrate that it is difficult but by no means impossible. At the end of the book the authors produce a very practical list of required events for media reform and of things that the average person can do. They point out a significant number of existing media watchdog and reform groups and urge them to pool their efforts in the coming months. Personal involvement in media reform can, according to the authors, stem the tide of increasing corporate media consolidation, diminished reporting and analysis, and of the ever increasing intrusion of commercials and advertising in every facet of American life.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants more out of televised and printed news than massive commercials and meaningless coverage of events. Excluding the political and economic elite, I suspect that as much as conservatives and liberals disagree with each other, both would rather see their difference reported and examined by the media in a meaningful fashion instead of in a superficial, branded one. The title of this book, 'Our Media Not Theirs' in no way refers to political distinctions such as liberal and conservative. Instead, it refers to the fact that the media should reflect the needs of the majority of Americans, not its ever-shrinking handful of corporate owners. When this happens, America will truly have a free press instead of the current institution that masquerades as one."},{"Title":"Our Media, Not Theirs: The Democratic Struggle against Corporate Media (Open Media Series)","review":"We will discover how we the people can take back the airwaves but this book makes you realize you better open your eyes, realize &amp; respond to the truth. This is but one of the struggles of these days as we stand to guard the last of the forests so families have trees to breathe. Our Media, our earth, peace; this is our reality. VOTE."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"This has to be one of the best of Louis Lamour. What makes this one stand apart is that it is less predictable than his other novels, in that everyone doesn't end up riding away into the sunset. It has been years since I read this novel, but I can still remember it vividly."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"I've read all of Louis L'Amour's westerns, and appreciate the straight-arrow ethics of his heroes and heroines, the starkness of the environment and their responses to it, and the appreciation of the men and women's appraisals of each other. Most are truly love stories, with action/adventure wrapped around them. This is also one of his saddest stories.Told in the first person, Tell is shot, and by the time he's able to recover and get back to where he left his wagon and bride, all traces of them are gone. He finally finds her grave. Anyone who knows Tell from previous books knows his determination and that he should not be underestimated. It's similar to movies such as \\"First Blood\\" in that a man who seems like any other man can step beyond others' comprehension in his ability and willingness to inflict the same measure of carnage on his enemies. As his attacks and the rancher's reprisals escalate until the odds are 40 to 1 against him, word reaches other Sacketts of the war, and they gather as well. The messages of justice, family, love, heartache, and duty all resound throughout The Sackett Brand."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"When I read this book I got a rush because I could tell it was a good one from the beginning. The Idea of the book was what got me interested in the first place. I had read some of the other Sackett books by Louis L'Amour and this one got me jumpin. It is just the Idea of every one coming to Tell's aide when he needs it the most. It has the makings of becoming a classic if more people would recognize it's greatness. I read it almost tree months ago and I can remember every bit about it. I am Seventeen and if I can like this book so much I am almost positive that others my age, older, and Younger would love it too. I loved reading it so much that I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"Louis dates this book between 1875-1879, with the action taking place in the Mogollon (muggy own) Rim and the Tonto Basin of Arizona Territory. The Apache wars are still in progress as we visit Camp Verde and while there are exposed to Al Seiber. Camp Verde was originally named Fort Lincoln in 1861 when established to protect people from the Apache, the post was originally manned by volunteers, and then later by regular Army in 1866.Al Seiber, 1844-1907, is a name immediately recognizable to any reader of the Apache Wars period. Al was of German ancestry who scouted for the Army, later being chief of scouts over the Apache scouts. Earlier he had fought at Gettysburg, among other civil war battles, receiving at least two wounds. History still holds Al, or \\"Sibi\\" as he was known by Apaches, with great respect. And his times with both Tom Horn and the Apache Kid remains in the mind of any reader spending time with Dan Thrapp's 1964 biography of Al Seiber.This western novel assumes a somewhat strange storyline in that Tell's wife, Ange Kerry Sackett, comes to harm, and is actually murdered. Not just murdered but strangled to death. It seems very much out of Louis L'Amour character in that in all his other novels he continually reinforces the thought that a woman alone would never be harmed by a man, no matter how bad that man may have been. It is therefore somewhat hard to accept, at least for me, that this is the storyline Louis chose to begin one of the Sackett novels. But there it is, and one has to deal with it to try to understand this book.As stated in other reviews, I have all of the L'Amour books in hardcover and read them over from time-to-time. In all my reading of his books over the last 40 plus years, this is one of the more unique Sackett books. If you have not read that much L'Amour it may not strike you in that manner.One interesting aspect, however, of this western novel is that Louis continually mentions the manner which the Sacketts will come to the aid of any Sackett in trouble. Well, in this novel he shows exactly how that would happen, using the word-of-mouth grapevine the fact that Tell is surrounded by at least 40 gunmen in the Tonto Basin area quickly causes any Sackett hearing of it to ride to Tell's assistance.And it is always pleasant to encounter Cap Roundtree in the Sackett books. And I will let Louis himself describe Cap Roundtree: \\"A salty old customer, a mountain man, trapper, cowboy, all-round western man. Dry as alkali dust and twice as bitter. A tough old mountain man who had hunted gold and fought Indians and had the scars to prove it\\". That pretty much not only describes Cap Roundtree but can safely be applied to all the Sacketts as well.This book will afford its readers a couple night's reading pleasure. Let'r rip!Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"Somebody ambushed Tell Sackett and left him for dead. It takes more, however, than cowardly sidewinders to kill a Sackett. Even worse, Tell's wife is missing. After Tell determines that somebody of Lazy A ranch is guilty, he launches a one-man war against the cowboys. Word spreads of the conflict, and Sackett brothers and cousins come out of the sagebrush to even the odds.Typical of Louis L'Amour, this novel is a quick hit of Western action. The Sackett tales stress family solidarity. L'Amour is adept at writing of the lure of distant trails, the freedom of the big sky country, and the Code of the West. He breathes new life and spirit into the usual elements of Western fiction. This is good downtime reading. Enjoy the ride. ;-)"},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"I read this book for the first time in the 4th grade. My dad gave it to me and said \\"You are old enough to understand what Louis is saying here.\\" It was my first book without pictures, and it lead me to read everyone of Louis' books!The message I got from the book was: \\"Doesn't matter what has happened in the past or who the person is, if family is in trouble, you help.\\" As I grew up, I added to it, certain friends, (Like Cap Rountree, and the Tinker) are family. They deserve the same support.I had my oldest son read this as well for the same reason. He may never read another western, but he understands the message I was trying to pass on.If you have ever wanted to read one of Lamour's books, this is a great place to start. If you want a good action book, with excitement, this is a great one as well. I have just downloaded this for my kindle so I can reread it at my leisure. I hope you will too."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"Hey, I'm all over the place as far as what I'm reading, and by golly I sometimes enjoy reading a good ol' cowboy story. It doesn't take allot of brain cells, they're usually a fast read, and usually the good guy wins in the end. That sounds pretty good to me as this world is a pretty serious place sometimes. Westerns are pure escapism for me. The Sackett series, and probably all L'Amour novels can be enjoyed by young readers and adults alike.This is the 16th (and next-to-the-last) book in \\"The Sackett\\" series of novels that L'amour published. The series is basically a collection of stories about the fictional Sackett family who were some of the first settlers to come from England to America in the 1600's. The books follow the lives of multiple Sackett family members through several generations. The first 5 books are set in the early 1600's, and then all of the last 10 books have been cowboy stories set in the time frame of the 1870's. All-in-all I've really enjoyed the series, but some are certainly better than others. The books are also written in a way that you can pick up any one of them and read it, without ever having to have read any of the previous stories........ but it's really more fun to go through them as a series as there are always places, characters, and situations that the author refers to in a previous book, and that makes it kind of fun.Anyway, in this story Tell Sackett is ambushed and left for dead. All of his belongings are burned, and his wife is murdered. That doesn't set well for any Sackett as they're all John Wayne/Clint Eastwood clones........no matter what........the bad guy is gonna get it. This story was extra fun as many Sackett brothers and cousins from the previous books came together to help Tell out on his quest to take care of those dastardly sidewinders. He Get Along Little Doggie......I liked this one better than many others in the series. A quick read and just some good old fashioned cowboy escapism."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"One of the hallmarks of the Sackett novels is the consistent concept of family members coming to the aid of other family members. In this novel, Tell Sackett, one of the roughest and toughest of a very tough family, gets in trouble. He needs help, and the word gets out. This is L'Amour's chance to really highlight that theme of family and he tries...but just misses the mark. There are scenes in the book of Sacketts that were in other books (Orlando, Logan, etc) getting the word about Tell and leaping into their saddles to join the fray. The Sacketts are gathering, and you just know that the bad guys have no clue about the storm that is about to break. But alas, that storm never breaks. The book ends with all the Sacketts lined up, ready to draw, and the fight never comes off. This is very disappointing. His other novels don't hesitate to bring about the fight - why not this one? All in all, it is still a very good book, and if you are a fan of the Sackett series it is one of the top five. Tell's anger and sadness, and his measure of revenge, are all very well handled by a master storyteller. I just wish he would have allowed his characters to mop up the floor with the bad guys!"},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"This is one of Louis' classics. In addition to being a great adventure read, it will definitely pull your strings in a lot of ways. It is at first sad (when the event that is the fulcrum of the plot occurs), and then eventually very uplifting and satisfying. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"This book builds superbly, holding one's interest throughout. One can easily sympathize with Tell Sackett, being generally hassled for no good reason, and the hard confidence of his kin as they ride to his aid sets up two or three of the best scenes I've ever read in a Western, period. By the time they get there, you wish that you were yourself a Sackett--of whatever occupation--with the right to stand as one of the family when your relative is being ganged up on.While the Sackett series is generally accepted as one of the best Western series out there, this one stands above the others. Words are used economically to portray the characters; L'Amour doesn't waste your time. I've probably read 200 Westerns in my life (not many, I realize), and if I could keep only one, this would be it."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"\\"The Sackett Brand\\" starts with a bang--almost literally--and doesn't let up. Six paragraphs in and Tell Sackett is falling off a six-hundred-foot cliff. \\"Fear clawed at my throat, and I heard a wild, ugly cry...my own cry.\\" This is action from the get-go. We are off and running and we are hanging on Tell Sackett's every move as he finds his murdered wife Ange and then, pumped full of determination, tracks her killer and takes all the steps that are necessary to extract revenge. When he finds Ange's body he digs a grave up on a mesa and burns words into in a \\"crude cross\\" using the heated edge of a shovel. (Bet that took awhile.) Sackett thinks: \\"Now the chips were down. They would be hunting me, but I would be hunting them too, and there was no mercy in me. There was only the desire to hunt them down on their bloody trail, and give them a chance to try killing somebody who was not a woman alone.\\"Loaded with motivation, \\"The Sackett Brand\\" rockets along. There is precious let-up. The greater Sackett clan, even the outlaws, get word and come to Tell's rescue just as Tell is cornered and counting his last minutes. Yes, family rules. \\"The Sackett Brand\\" is straightforward, punch-to-the-gut action interspersed with the occasional thunder of guns on fire.I agree with at least one other reviewer who thought L'Amour should have shown us more of the bad guys going down, but by this time we know how it ends and feel quite satisfied nonetheless."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"Tell Sackett is only wanting a life of his own with his wife Ange, then all hell breaks loose. Ange has disappeared and a big cattle rancher wants him dead for some reason. This is an absolute good read, packed with action, emotion and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"This novel sticks to your fingers and is difficult to put down. Join Tell as he struggles to survive. His future destroyed, Ange murdered, hunted and harried he eventually reaches safety. As soon as able he continues searching for her killer. A few letters from a friend bring other members of the clan riding to his aid. An explosive finish grips you by the seat of the pants. Family values at their best and a great story."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"Taking place several years after The Daybreakers, this book tells of the adventures of Orrin and Tyrel Sackett's oldest brother, Tell. In this story Tell Sackett and his wife are moving to Arizona with everything they have to establish an outfit and a new life. But when Tell leaves the wagon for a few hours and goes scouting ahead he is shot in the head with a grazing bullet. He immediately plummets down the near vertical hillside hundreds of feet but miraculously he survives. Of course, since somebody's after him for a reason that he finds to be a mystery, he escapes pursuit and gets away for the time being.He eventually manages to return to the site of his wagon. There he finds it virtually gone and burnt to pieces. And his wife Ange is missing. Eventually Tell makes it to a fort and finds aid for his wounded and battered body. He also discovers that he is being hunted by an outfit of forty men hired by Swandle and Allen. After having mostly recovered from his fall, Tell returns to look for the body he hopes he'd never find but he does. After giving his wife a proper burial he swears to hunt down the man that murdered her, and get revenge. But the odds of 40 to 1 aren't good. Tell eventually finds his luck running out along with supplies and places to hide. But an occurrence such as this is not common so the word gets out. And eventually another Sackett hears about it. Shortly afterwards there is a large group of Sacketts running to help Tell, including his brothers, Orrin and Tyrel. But some of them fear that Tell will kill all forty men before they get a taste of the action.I thought this was a relatively enjoyable book. I don't think it was as good as The Daybreakers but it was better than others. It had a lot of good action and gun fighting in it and I liked that they included Orrin and Tyrel. I also liked the part in the book where Tell is being pursued by hired guns up a high ledge when he comes face to face with a mountain lion. I think I will continue to read the adventures of the Sackett family in further books."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"If you like Louis L'Amour, I can't think of a better narrator than David Strathairn! He's able to play multiple roles to the point you feel as if you're listening to a larger cast. And not many folks can do \\"local/period piece\\" accents without sounding forced...this sounds as if you've been eavesdropping.A hearty round of applause for a quickly shipped product which was as advertised."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"A pair of young men once pulled Louis L'Amour out of a fight in Tucumcari. They told L'Amour that their opponents steered clear of them because they had over a dozen brothers, and whoever might beat one of the family would be attacked by all the others. L'Amour modeled the Sackett clan after his Tucumcari benefactors.Knowing this, I was puzzled to find that this defining feature of the Sackett family had never come into play in any of the five Sackett stories* I had read before. A Sackett in trouble rarely gets help from anybody, and when he does, it's only from one or two of his kin. But now, I understand. In The Sackett Brand, the family's power finally is fully mustered against one of its enemies, and the sight of a bunch of Sacketts dogpiling the villain turns out to be flat boring.And that's a shame, because the setup of The Sackett Brand is damned good. \\"Tell\\" Sackett and his wife are on their way West to start a new life with the wealth they won in their last novel. While they stop to rest, somebody shoots Tell in the back, he falls down a cliff into a stream, their wagon is stolen and his wife is kidnapped. In the first two minutes!From that point on, Tell has a desperate nonstop struggle to evade a whole gang of merciless, skilled killers, not knowing who is behind them or why they want him dead. Victory is out of the question for the moment; mere survival is going to take everything he has. He also needs to find his missing wife, and even though you know he'll succeed, the scene where he does so is surprising and original.And then, alas, all of Tell's efforts and suffering are pounded into irrelevance under a thundering avalanche of Sacketts, who set the course of the whole final act. The villain is unmasked, and turns out to be dull. The only glimmer of entertainment in the denouement is from Parmalee Sackett, who fights the family's enemies with his wallet instead of his gun. But a lot of Parmalee's charm comes from David Strathairn's voicing of his Tennessee accent, and may be lost if you read the hardcopy.For the Sacketts-all-come-running idea to work, L'Amour would have had to come up with an enemy that actually could give the whole Sackett clan a stand-up fight - something like the consortium of Wyoming cattle barons who started the Johnson County War, or San Francisco's Big Four train tycoons with their army of Pinkertons and railroad detectives. Maybe something like that lies hidden in the big pile of L'Amours that I haven't read yet. But such a concept doesn't play to L'Amour's strength. He was at his best when he was telling the story of a man alone who defines his manhood by struggle: struggle against other men, struggle against the environment, but most of all, struggle to maintain his own integrity.*My previous experience comprised Sackett, Sackett's Land, Lonely on the Mountain, Mustang Man, and the short story The Courting of Griselda."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"Everyone of Louis L'Amour's books deserve 6 stars"},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"After reading this book and thinking back to it then I realize how much I really liked it. The main thing that I like about it so much was not the plot but how accurate the story was portrayed. The author did a great job of portraying how cowboys lived and felt back then. He showed the type of men they were and described in detail the way a man would go about things in the old west. This story had a great start that grabbed your attention and had suspence around every corner. It left you woundering what would happen next and if the main character would live or not. I enjoyed every part of the book except for one. The only chapter I did not like was the 9th because all it did was tell about the brothers of Sackett finding out what happened to him. Other than that borring chapter I would recomend this book to anyone that likes an old western adventure book."},{"Title":"Sackett Brand,the","review":"Not one of Louis L'Amour's best. He stretches credibility too far. How can a single man, make a woman, a wagon and a team of mules vanish while mustering cattle with his forty cowboys , in country where everybody is an expert tracker. Also our hero, Tell Sackett, hides himself out in this wild country, but gets himself discovered with great regularity by the searching bad guys, not to mention a bad woman. The rest of the Sackett clan are given a great build up, but play disappointingly minor parts.

Sunnie grows up in a stubbornly backwards and strictly religious rural community, ignorant of just about everything except his own difference from others. Things go wrong, then an outsider rescues him for less than altruistic reasons. Sunnie has to come to terms with the world outside his own, narrow society. The process is pretty realistic, by the standards of slash at least. So far, so good, but from here on the novel is less well developed. We don't see too much of the guy Sunnie will end up with, nor is there much of their relationship when it finally comes about. Still, I enjoyed reading this and I thought Sunnie was a well-developed character, even if the others tend to be a bit vague. I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"The Angel Within","review":"This book is as wonderful as her other fiction has been. I am very glad to have invested in this book.This story is an insightful look into the human psyche, societal constraints and religion in our society. The story weaves a tale of love and passion interwoven with lies and deceit that is bound by the laws of God and the community.Kracken's tale of the life of a young, abused boy, Sunnie, learning to be a man in an alien world, and adapting to the changes of a different society, is a mirror to this world, where people different from the norm have to escape or be persecuted by their communities. Sunnie has to take refuge in an alien society with a complete stranger, who tells him all the things he learned were sinful as a child are normal and acceptable. Sunnie is dependent on this new stranger who has turned his world upside-down, but has to learn to understand the world through his own eyes. The reader sees Sunnie's struggle to adapt his religious beliefs with the rest of his new society.I hope that others enjoy this book as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Angel Within","review":"I'd found this book almost by accident and, encouraged by the reviews, I took a chance on it. I've never left a review before, but I really felt I should this time.This book was such an utter disappointment; if I could give it zero stars, I would. I followed up on this author a little and it appears her background is in fanfiction and I now suspect that the previous reviews were done by her fanfic followers. Be wary before you choose this book.Characterization is a huge catalyst for a story. A character who interests you, who you care about, will pull you into a book, keep you invested and even forgive a few technical writing errors. It took me a long time to finish this book because I've never read a more annoying main character. Sunnie (the uber-repressed, yet with an irrepressible smile) is supposed to be male. You wouldn't know it if the author didn't tell us. The argument might be that he's been abused and, therefore, fearful, but even with that background you still want to read about a character who, in spite of those abuses, is interesting and finding his bravery. There is nothing interesting or brave about a man--even a gay man--who covers his face in embarrassment at the sight of women's breasts--covered breasts, no less.I wish I could say something positive, but there's nothing to say. As far as the writing itself goes, it's at times clunky and confusing. Some descriptions had me laughing out loud and I'm quite certain that's not what the author intended at that moment.I'm always looking for quality gay fiction and this wasn't it. Unless you like your main characters as dynamic as a wet rag (and your dialogue as absurd as a President Bush speech), then don't waste your energy on this book."},{"Title":"The Angel Within","review":"I was quite relieved that I didn't shell out a single cent for this horrid piece of trash. While I love the idea of slash fanfiction authors branching out into original fiction, some authors just don't have the ability to craft original characters or a fictional world with any degree of talent.There was not a single decent character in the entire novel. Sunnie, our supposed protagonist, was so completely laughable I thought I was reading a parody for the first few chapters. Scott Rohan (brilliant character naming, too) is just bafflingly terrible. Even the knight in shining armor is nothing short of a caricature. I can't say much of the story other than it was trite, boring, and slogged along with the worst narrative I have ever seen.I thought it may be worth it for the sex. Not even. Bland and boring. No sizzle, no interest.If you're curious enough to read this thing, try to con a friend into buying it for you. Actually, I would almost seriously recommend getting yourself a copy, as a perfect example of what not to do when writing an erotic novel."},{"Title":"The Angel Within","review":"In the grande tradition of Ursela LeGuine, Kraken has created a whole new world that is fantastical and very familiar all at the same time.

The story is beautifully rendered and immensely moving, at times poignant. I love Sunnie and this lovely character certainly deserves more in life. \\"The Angel Within\\" is much more than a rommantic sci-fi fantasy. There is a harsh reality in it which sounds all too familiar in this world of ours when a society rejects and hates those who does not fit into its norms. Heart felt and deeply touching, Sunnie and his story will linger long in my memory. My only complaint is that it is too short and I am not able to find another story by Kracken."},{"Title":"The Angel Within","review":"I absolutely love this original work of fiction. It's a dazzling tale of angst and pain and the ability to over come it all. Sunnie is a delightful character that is very realistic and I can't help but feel sorry for him throughout the story. Jhai's compasssion helps Sunnie see there is more to life than abuse and his love for Sunnie shines through and makes Sunnie see how beautiful he really is. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a story that has no bounds when love and friendship teach life lessons and teach us to accept what we truly are."},{"Title":"The Angel Within","review":"This book was everything I expected of Kracken: solid storytelling full of detail and emotion. Though there were a few missed typos, it was easy to see past them and enjoy the interaction of the characters, as well as seeing the main character flesh out from a boy to a man."},{"Title":"Code of Honor","review":"Just two minor quibbles, the first being the slightly cartoonish Lane character who was predictable and stereotyped every step of the way despite some attempt to flesh him out, second being a hurried ending that closed the court martial with a footnote rather than the big bang that it was building up towards.However, these are small issues. Coyle's take on the Colombian drug war is arguably superior to its equivalents in Tom Clancy's overplotted Clear and Present Danger and Ralph Peters' Twilight of Heroes. Other than Lane, all other characters are well-realised and the gripping narrative is tinged with an affecting touch of sadness. Emotions practically exploded off the pages after the tragic fiasco in the jungle.I regard this novel as one of the best post-Cold War technothrillers, if it can be called that. Although the genre effectively lay down and died due to the paucity of credible sparring opponents for the might of the US, Code Of Honour shines like a rare gem in the overall decline. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Code of Honor","review":"Harold Coyle was a military officer and thus knows how to protray military action and the reactions of the men and women caught up in the organized chaos that is war. He also shows how in a peacetime military a talented rank climber with decent admin skills and good performance in war games can get command of a frontline divivsion. No imcompetance here folks, just the Peter-principal in action. Cpt. Kozack's actions are not unusual givin the circumstances nor would be Gen. Lane's but to be fair to the Dog-faces (I'm a Jarhead) I believe that once Lane's incompetance was shown, the good captain would get off easily. Sure, she wouldn't get a medal but her career would survive and Lane would become a glorified gofer in the puzzle palace. The interplay between a hero-general, his protage, and a well connented politician in uniform is very well played out if ending in a bit of a anti-climax. But it must be said that these things often end this way.Were Coyle again goes wrong in on his political background (he did the same in TEN THOUSAND: seven barely adequately trained divisions vs. even one crack US division and the USN, USMC and ASAF air wings (who would have been brought in)? Come on!). First of all FARC (as pretty much everyone, even THEM, admits) is the worlds largest single suppliers of cocaine in the world (70%). They also engage routinely in massacres, kidnapping, and extortion. Sure the right-wing paramilitaries also do these three things, but even Amnesty International admits that FARC has them beat. Thus to my mind making FARC so bloody pure is a stretch to astound Mr. Fantastic and bit insulting really, not to mention odd for such a Army veteran. I chalk it up to literary stretching for sake of story (as I did for the TEN THOUSAND) but I hope that in the future that Major Coyle will change the names of his background organizations enabling readers to suspend belief easier."},{"Title":"Code of Honor","review":"Code of Honor is a cautionary book on sending American troops to other countries without a clear objective. Not too different from Vietnam. I think Coyle romanticizes rebel life a little too much. This romanticism is shown from the eyes of a former teacher-now-turned FARC rebel. The book could have been more objective in that the rebels are nowhere morally better than the government. They'd actually be into kidnap, and extortion.After the previous book, The Ten Thousand, the tension between mainstays Dixon and Jan Fields is much less. And not much is explored with Capt. Nancy Kozak and her beau. I shall miss one of the familiar characters in the series. The story feels lacking and it could be due to limiting the story to about 500+ pages."},{"Title":"Code of Honor","review":"it's a book that will leave you frustrated and yet somehow elated at the results. Two U.S. Army Generals face off behind the scenes of a ficticous quagmire war based in Columbia, with the lives and careers of Army officers at stake."},{"Title":"Code of Honor","review":"Code of Honor wasn't too bad. It had some action, but mostly it centered around a U.S. General named C.B. Lane who is a cowardly bureaucrat and the main character's of most of Coyle's previous novels who are fighting a guerilla-type war in Columbia. There wasn't nearly as much action as in the author's previous books, and the end left a lot of business unfinished, but it was still an acceptable read"},{"Title":"Code of Honor","review":"This was the most disturbing of the Coyle novels tracing the path of the modern military through the major characters. Since Coyle is a professional soldier, his stories ring true. This makes this tale of the betrayal of field soldiers by opportunistic military beurocrats worrisome, evoking memories of the Vietnam Breakdown(see David Hackworth and Anthony Herbert), which we were assured had been corracted. Since Maj. Coyle is now retired and writing Civil War novels I infer that this is the case.

This book also shows all the ways that he should not treat me.Every chapter is a letter to Philip from his dad giving him lessons on how to be the best husband he can be.

The famed Sakata Eio is a lively exception, and this is evident in the Killer of Go, the most popular go book ever published. The book is an entertaining monologue about the subtleties involved in killing groups of stones, and throughout the book he makes his points by comparing the 'Killer of Go' to the gunslinger in western films.Although it is a fun read, the Killer of Go is not a work book with problems to study. The book's lessons are given in terms of high order concepts, like &quot;don't swipe the honey pot&quot;, and &quot;fatten the calf&quot;. As such, it is not a book that will necessarily make one any stronger. If reading it book changes your go game, it will be a change in style, not strength."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Well-written, occasionally pedantic, insightfully predictive of America's current circumstances.

It is the first of the dozen or so books that I have read by Mencken, but still my favorite. Mencken has opened up a whole new world for me. His irreverent debunking of favorite quacks have prompted me to look anew at a few of my own. His incredible knowledge of the English language has raised the standards I expect others to meet, not a little. And my vicarious contact with his world has made me work to improve my own.Mencken, I am convinced, was a genius whose writings will live long even into the next century. His writing is the only one that I feel compelled to read aloud to my wife, arms raised in excitement and for emphasis, daring her to contradict the glory of his prose.What contemporary American writer can match his mastery? I've read a lot, but I can't give even an approximation. His style is elegant, distinctively American, and a joy to read. Something like listening to a singer who you know has an absolute control of her material, a voice that does exactly what she intends, and the aesthetic sense of an angel."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Since Mencken was writing at the turn of the Century, some of these brief essays are a bit dated (duh!), but still well written and quite clever.

Lincoln was America's first dictator A man who \\"knew\\" that he had to destroy freedom to save it from its excesses. Mencken's pen is like Luke Skywalker's light saber in eviscerating the likes of Lincoln, yet he devotes equal attention to the sheepish masses who elect these swine. Some suggest was Mencken a racist? Perhaps, however he used his influence to get black writer's work into leading publications at a time when no one else did.Gibbons Burke on Mencken:The most prominent newspaperman, book reviewer, and political commentator of his day, Henry Louis Mencken was a libertarian before the word came into usage. His prose is as clear as an azure sky, and his rhetoric as deadly as a rifle shot. Frequent targets of his lance were Franklin Roosevelt and New Deal politics, Comstocks, hygenists, \\"uplifters\\", social reformers of any stripe, boobs & quacks, and the insatiable American appetite for nonsense and gaudy sham. But his life was not defined by negativity. He was positively enthusiastic about to the writings of Twain and Conrad, the music of Brahms, Beethoven and Bach, and the victuals offered up by Chesapeake Bay.-- All in all, this work an outstanding example of iconoclastic criticism and style."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"so many topics so little time. i found quickly the time to delve into the genius as presented. humor,candor,insight going lightly before you."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"\\"but my sense is that his times were really the last 1900s, not even the times when he wrote.\\"-- Bruce ApplebaumDoes the man who wrote this presume to judge between good and bad writing?Mencken was, in a literal sense of the term, a prick. He seems to have surveyed his society for inflated egos to deflate with his acrid pen. Mencken is dead, but the sensitive stuff of which Mr Applebaum's ego-baloon is made is easily punctured. Even Mencken's ghost can do it, and has. As his deflating ego sqeeked out its last whine, Mr A. became indignant, set out pugnaciously for revenge on Mencken by writing his blurb, and tripped over his shoelaces.If you are the kind of nitwit that flings words like \`\`racist'' and \`\`bigot'', like an angry monkey throws his poo, at any white man bold enough to suggest that the different races may have different attributes, than you need to read this book. The prick of it may send you howling from your tree, but you may find your way out of the jungle."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"There was a renewed interest in Mencken over the last few years, partly because of the release of the remainder of his literary estate. Along with that, came a couple of biographies, one by Hobson and one by Teachout.I've read both biographies and made my way through about half of this self-collected work. It boggles the mind that Mencken had (or had he?) the impact that he was supposed to have had during the 1910s through 1930s.He was wa racist and a bigot. Many of the pieces in Chrestomathy are culled from his \\"Prejudices\\" series. Prejudice implies having some experience to base an opinion on. Here is a man who rarely set foot outside of Baltimore, except for regular trips to NYC to meet with his publisher. He said pretty nasty things about Jews (despite Knopf, his publisher and alleged friend, being one), and blacks (at one point claiming that the only intelligent blacks were those who had some white blood introduced by the massa during the good old days of slavery). He lived at home with mom and his siblings until she died, and lived in the same house except for a five year period when he was married (in his 50s). Oh, he did visit Germany a few times -- his family was of German origin and Mencken seemed to have the idea that the master race was reflected in himself - this boozy, narrow-minded fireplug of a man.Not having a basis in fact for many of his prejudices, that leaves him a bigot. He was ignorant. He was smarmy and thought himself (and those like him) better than just about everybody. He wrote nasty things about his \\"friends.\\"So, why is everybody interested in what he has to say? He was considered an iconoclast because he wrote what he thought. But once the shock value is gone, all that is left is some great writing (vocabulary, grammar, style) with some crappy content. What he thought might have reflected his times, but my sense is that his times were really the last 1900s, not even the times when he wrote."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"H. L. Mencken is perhaps (along with many of the adherents who pay him more attention than he deserves) the responsible for the creation of the figure known today as \\"intellectual snob\\", a person who merely devotes his existence to judge the work of others and who deems himself equally important (or even superior) to the own writers.I have always thought that this pathetic guy had a recurrent wet dream in which he imagined that he was the author of \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\". Unfortunately for him, Ambrose Bierce was one and only. Bad luck, Mr. Mencken.His taste in literature was nothing out of the ordinary and left something to be desired, as shown by his appreciation of a repellent racist troglodyte like Jack London and other mediocre authors. He even dared to say that Bierce's experimental fictions were useless; this last judgement being quite paradoxical, if we take into account that Mencken always ludicrously tried to imitate Bierce's mordant style for his own sake.Who cares about this Mencken? He never wrote fiction. He's just a critic... Why bother reading his out-dated and erroneous assessments and his insufferable mental diarrhoea? You'd better be spending your time in real literature and learning to draw your own conclusions about it (I know it's difficult, but you can do it if you try). Use your brain if you have one and forget \\"the crackpot of Baltimore\\"."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"If you love Mencken, trust him to select his best writing.

I did not know what the heck a chrestomathy was, but it seemed to refer to books that were very large. As a Southerner, I resented Mencken's Sahara of the Bozart, and resented it all the more for the truth of it. But I figured that any man who admired James Branch Cabell couldn't be all that evil. After all, I had been born in Richmond and Cabell was from Richmond, so any friend of Cabell's was a friend of mine. On once again reading the Sahara of the Bozart (it had taken me some time to get the beaux arts pun), I am struck by the blatant racism of his mocking references to smaller European countries, such as Albania. But in those days there was no political correctness, and he would have lunged at it like a hyena if it had existed. I was disturbed by his vicious attitude about the death of William Jennings Bryan, who was guilty of attacking evolution. He was a mortal foe of Prohibition, inhibition and every other breed of 'bition that you can think of. He apparently slept with a cigar in his lips, a neat trick, but I am sure he managed it quite well."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"HL Mencken was one of the greatest journalists of his era in American history, perhaps of all of American history.Any American who aspires to consider him or herself educated, must read this book, which is his collection of his all time most trenchant essays. The vast majority of his opinionated insights are correct; all of his essays are extremely well written, and very amusing. Even if you don't aspire to consider yourself educated, this book is full of life lessons that most many people have to learn the hard way.One of the five best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"600+ pages of biting criticism, and to Henry Louis Mencken there was much to criticize, from the \\"yokelry\\" and do-gooders to religious hucksters and parasitic quacks.As I near the end of this collection of essays, I am sad since my moments with his sharp and articulate -- if somewhat rigid -- mind are nearly at an end.(I still chuckle when I recall him writing that America's backwoods are infested with chiropractors. His critique of Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class is a masterpiece of career-destroying mud-slinging bordering on defamation.)View the war from H.L.'s trench, and you'll see that it's eerily like the war we fight today.Though human nature is but human, Mencken expected more, unfortunately."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"\\"Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people.\\" Who in the hell said that? This is the quote that started me on a life time of collecting books by and about H. L. Mencken (HLM) and \\"A MENCKEN CHRESTOMATHY\\" is the first book by HLM I bought. Since I am one of HLM's greatest scholars and admirer, I keep three or four copies of \\"A MENCKEN CHRESTOMATHY\\" around for people who seem to take an interest in the greatest American writer of any century. Mencken says things that I and a lot of people have thought but cannot put into words. (Whoever has my first edition, please return it!)I was overwhelmed by the insightful and honesty of his comments about almost everybody in American life: The Husbandman (farmer), The Physician (Is he a real Medical Doctor or a Hygienist), The Pedagogue (Who's the best teacher you ever had?), the politician (the only work he does is to get re-elected) and much more. Six hundred plus pages of Mencken's best by his own admission.The back of this book is filled with \\"one liners\\" you will want to memorize:\\"A puritan is someone who is unhappy that someone, somewhere is having a good time.\\" \\"A liberal has many tails and chases them all.\\" \\"Every bachelor is a hero to some married woman.\\" \\"Making money is almost as easy as losing it, almost, but not quite.\\" Most of the one-liners were written while Mencken was the editor of the magazine named \\"THE SMART SET\\" under the name Owen Hatteras.Your bookshelf deserves a copy of this \\"starter\\" of Mencken's writings.

Many people don't realize how many idiomatic phrases in common usage were originally penned by this brilliant writer. He was confrontational but he presented his unorthodox views with biting wit. In these times where we are awash in a sea of nasty commentary, politicians and columnists should go back and read how a master could communicate sometimes unpopular ideas. It's sad that so many people have no idea who this man was.A Mencken Chrestomathy: His Own Selection of His Choicest Writing"},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Mencken, a reporter, editor and columnist for the Baltimore Sun from 1908 until 1940 wrote on a range of subjects during his journalistic career. A cynical contrarian and what we might today refer to as a Libertarian he was definitely not possessed of the need to adher to \\"politicaly correct\\" opinions. Hence, his writings will probably not warm the cockles of a Liberal's heart. But, then again, they might benefit from some exposure to enlightment.With a firm grasp of the English language and a fitting vocabulary, Mencken will send poorly educated college graduate illiberals scrambling for their dictionaries.Penned to reflect the nature of his times, his observations are as germane to today's conditions as they were 80-years ago.For a reader unfamilar with Mencken, this annonated collection of essays is an excellent start towards the comprehension of tolerance and critical thinking."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Mencken's writings will appall the politically correct and delight those who enjoy masterful English prose. I started this book by choosing an essay at random, and luck must have been with me on that memorable day, for the essay was \\"In Memoriam: WJB.\\" That particular gem was my introduction to this inimitable writer, and I've been fascinated with him since.Of course, it is impossible to write a review of a Mencken-authored volume without mentioning some of his questionable views on race and class divisions. But readers ought to hesitate before condemning his unpalatable verdicts on Jews, Armenians, Poles, Greeks (and so on), for Mencken, what with his all-consuming contempt for Homo Sapiens, was willing (nay, eager!) to go after ANY group with his formidable pen. And remember, too, that good writing is not the sole domain of the morally upright. Mencken was certainly not that, and yet his style surpassed the ramblings of many of his kinder contemporaries. Ah, if he were alive and writing today!

Mencken's prose and unflinching attitude is like no other author I have read. I don't know if they used the middle finger in the early 1900s but if so, then HLM was its personification. If you were to tally his word usage in the book I believe \\"idiot\\", \\"imbecile\\", \\"buffoon\\", \\"moron\\" and \\"mountebank\\" would be near the top.This book contains one of my favorite essay and the single biggest reason to own this book, his piece on the critical process. It's only a 10 page essay but it's probably the most eloquent. For whatever reason he put it around page 450, but I would recommend reading it first. It puts a reader in the right frame of mind for reading Mencken's essays. He explains a worthwhile critic is not so much concerned with truth or detail. Instead a truly great critic takes the target of the criticism and uses it to develop his own original ideas. It separates those who would just be archivists with those who would be artists. Clearly, Mencken was not concerned with the former, he was concerned with art and he was an artist."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"H.L. Mencken worked for newspapers for 50 years, living and working in Baltimore the entire time. His niche was criticism and commentary, at which he excelled. There is no one to match his wit and style. H.L.M. was not a reporter, he was a stylist: it's the way he said what he said that is important.This book is a collection of Mencken's writings, mostly from previous books he wrote: the &quot;Prejudices&quot; series, &quot;In Defense of Women&quot;, &quot;A Book of Burlesques&quot;, et al. Some of the offerings are from the magazines he edited: &quot;American Mercury&quot; and &quot;Smart Set&quot;, with a few newspaper articles for good measure. The copyright listings go back as far as 1917.Mencken discusses everything from men and women, government, morals, religion, music and history, to odd fish, quackery, pedagogy, psychology and buffooneries.Listed under the latter rubric, one will find a work entitled &quot;A Neglected Anniversary&quot;, which started the famous bathtub hoax, explained by the author in his notes, for those unfamiliar with the Great Man and his life and times.A second of Mencken's commentaries, which seems to have gained more fame than some of the others, is &quot;The Sahara of the Bozart&quot;, page 184. The American South is H.L.M.'s subject here, thus: &quot;Down there a poet is now almost as rare as an oboe-player, a dry-point etcher or a metaphysician. It is, indeed, amazing to contemplate so vast a vacuity...that stupendous region of worn-out farms, shoddy cities and paralyzed cerebrums...it is almost as sterile, artistically, intellectually, culturally, as the Sahara Desert. There are single acres in Europe that house more first-rate men than all the states south of the Potomic....&quot; Ouch!One may not agree with his opinions, but one must acknowledge that he expresses them very well, and that reading his writings is great entertainment.H.L.

I don't mind- I have read a good couple thousand books in my lifetime, and I have reviewed a few dozen for Amazon.com. Yet this is the one I keep coming back to read, year after year. As time goes by I find myself revising the scale of Mencken's achievement upwards and upwards, especially knowing that the only comparison is to other mere mortal writers.What makes this book brilliant is its terse structure- it is fragmented and in short pieces, and this produces his intense compact wit in wave after wave of the finest observations and thoughts to come out of mortal man since Tom Sawyer. A Mencken Chrestomathy utterly fails to do badly at every turn.If you have glanced at this book, and have even a tiny thought at not buying at least two copies, shoot yourself in the foot for punishment, then go buy a dozen copies and pass them out to your superior friends as rewards for their sagacity and charm and as a reward for their loyalty. But if you have little humanity and wish to punish a friend or make their lives more miserable, do not tell them of this book, and leave it right where it is.I give no book this high a regard. But I give this one my complete, unconditional support. If you have the means, I suggest buying a thousand copies and distributing it among the hungry of mind for the wonderful elixer of an effect Mencken has upon the mind.The only thing bad about this book is the covers are too close together."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This book, like all of Mencken's writings, is a lesson in delivering devastating criticism in the form of highly literate and beautifully flowing prose. It helps, of course, to be able to side with the author on his opinions, but is no impediment to enjoyment if you can't -- unless, I presume, you're one of his targets. Basically, no one writes like this anymore. Many believe that if you're going to insult people, crass and vulgar expression is the way to go. Mencken not only shows a better way, but demonstrates the level of intelligence necessary for harsh criticism to have an impact -- it's very difficult to fault someone with such obvious gifts. It also helps to have a dictionary to hand while you're reading, preferably a large and perhaps old one. Mine doesn't have &quot;buncombe&quot; in it, although the way it's used leaves little doubt as to what's meant. Also, the sheer variety of subject matter both here and in the Second Mencken Chrestomathy allows you to jump around freely. I couldn't find a duff article in either book, whether I agreed with his opinions or not, and I couldn't possibly recommend it any higher."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Can you imagine life without Henry Louis Mencken? I, for one, cannot and shudder to think of even one single day deprived of the Sage's coruscating wit, side-splitting humor, and vituperative angst. The joy and satisfaction gleaned from reading Mencken's essays can be likened to the appreciation expressed by an ailing patient, being adminstered a generous dose of morphine, to an understanding and avuncular physician. Mencken's serrated prose soothes the itching scalp brought on by an excess of sentimentality; assuages the burning ulcer brought on by a surfeit of political correctness; lances the boil exacerbated by the stupefying rhetoric gushing from the mouths of disingenuous and media-savvy politicians. In short, this volume of essays will act as a restorative agent on your enervated soul and bolster your mental stamina tenfold.

It would also make a great holiday gift for that Bolt fan you know. If you have seen or heard any of the recent San Diego media coverage on this book and heard the story behind its making, you can understand why I'm so jazzed about it.The author, who was being treated for advanced Hodgkins lymphoma at the time, spent 4 years delving in the Chargers archives and interviewing players for this definitive work. The book is filled with never-before-published photos (330 in all) and stories not only of well-known AFL Charger players and coaches, but also lesser-known and obscure players who spent time in the Bolts Powder Blues during the 1960s. In many cases, the author says these were some of the most interesting stories to share. Even former Charger players from that era have expressed amazement at the author's comprehensive efforts at recapturing the feelings of what it was like to be a player in the old AFL.For those of us oldsters who grew up in the 1960s with the Powder Blues, it will take us back to very fond memories of a bygone era. For those of you who weren't around then, you'll be even more proud of the Chargers legacy that we all now share as fans of the team. The book has been so popular the first printing is already sold out and is now on order for the second run. But it's worth the wait for all fans of the old AFL and those curious about what the \\"glory years\\" were all about! Tobias says his next project may be a history of the Coryell years of the Chargers. If his present book is any indication, that work will also be something to really appreciate. Go Bolts!"},{"Title":"Charging Through the AFL: Los Angeles and San Diego Chargers' Football in the 1960s","review":"Until this book came out, I hadn't had any luck finding a quality book on the history of the San Diego Chargers. This book covers the first ten seasons of the San Diego Chargers- the American Football League years.With its glossy pages and dimensions of just over 12 inches tall and over 9 inches wide, the book is well-suited for presenting photographs. Just about every page has at least one picture.The book consists of four main sections:The first is a 15-page chronological narrative history (with photographs).The second section consists of 16 pages of nothing but photographs. Eight of those pages have at least one color photograph. The only color photographs in the book are in this section. By far most of the book's pictures are in black and white.The third section is 76 pages and is where the bulk of the reading is for this book. This has the author's interviews of 59 people connected with the Chargers- players, coaches, and one beat writer. Each interview is written up separately and lasts about a page or two.The last section is 93 pages of San Diego Charger statistics and box scores of every regular and post season Charger game of the 1960's. And, like the rest of the book, there are plenty of photographs throughout this section, too.The book is well-written. The photographs are enjoyable too. My main complaint (or wish) is that I would have liked a longer chronological narrative of the team's history than the 15-page one provided. However, the interview and statistical sections flesh out much of that history but just in a different format.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in San Diego Charger history of that era. And I thank the author for writing a book on a much overlooked slice of football history."},{"Title":"Charging Through the AFL: Los Angeles and San Diego Chargers' Football in the 1960s","review":"A great book. a fun read. by a great author, filled with interviws and awesome pictures galore...A must have for any NFL or AFL fan of any age...Alex"},{"Title":"Charging Through the AFL: Los Angeles and San Diego Chargers' Football in the 1960s","review":"This is the perfect book for fans of the Chargers and the AFL.

Author Todd Tobias was very thorough in his research. The first chapter which was about the history of the AFL Chargers was probably my favorite part of the book. I also enjoyed the interviews that Tobias provided from former players and coaches. The game by game statistics are very important to me as well because they provide me with references. I am a stat freak so that was an added bonus for me. The only problem that I had with the publication was that Ralph Anderson was not listed in the section that contained all of the members of the Chargers from 1960 through 1969. It was obviously just an oversight. I also wish that there would have been more information on Anderson since he led the chargers with 44 pass receptions in the 1960 season. Anderson died tragically of a diabetic seizure in November yet still led the team in pass receptions. I would like to learn more about Anderson but there seems to be very little information available about him. But overall it was a magnificent job by Tobias and I really enjoyed reading it. The Chargers were without a doubt the finest team in the AFL throughout the early years as evidenced by playing in five of the first six AFL Championship games. But this book makes you understand that they were the classiest organization in the AFL as well, all the way from the top with the ownership of Hilton, the outstanding coaching provided by Sid Gillman, Chuck Noll, Al Davis, Jack Faulkner and Joe Madro. Just a super book and I would recommend it to any Charger fan, any AFL fan and any fan of pro football in the 1960s."},{"Title":"Charging Through the AFL: Los Angeles and San Diego Chargers' Football in the 1960s","review":"The book would have received 5 starts, but for not having enough color photos.

Thank God I caught the last year of the Chargers playing in the AFL.The author of this book could have done a better job editing some of the lengthier interviews but that's a minor criticism. I watched many of these guys play and heard about most of the others so it was a real hoot to read their take on the early years of the Chargers, the flagship of the AFL.As another reviewer stated, there's been hardly anything published on the history of the Chargers so this book fills a real void. Last year the Chargers celebrated their 50th anniversary with a DVD from NFL Films but no book. Incredible!

It is scholarly, fascinating, and yet easy to read and to understand. I imagined my being in a small Paris cafe and talking with her over a latte. She has a wonderful conversational style, and covers in-depth subjects and ideas with ease. I never realized how many aspects there are to the world of stripping. Professor Roach is not afraid to discuss her own misgivings, questions, and thrills with the reader. Her sense of humor is palpable and I frequently laughed out loud at her comments which she inserts into her main topics with ease. This is a must-read for any woman who has wondered about the world of stripping, any woman who is morally opposed to it, and any man who wonders what really goes on in those sultry, sirens' minds. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Stripping, Sex, and Popular Culture (Dress, Body, Culture)","review":"Professor Roach manages to keep the topic interesting while actually exploring it intellectually. She is an engaging writer as well as a serious academic. She moves way beyond stripping into deep issues affecting all of us. Her point of view is unusual in a book of this type as she has never been a stripper herself and yet brings a very open mind to the subject. She shares with the reader how a close friend became a stripper and that began her interest in the subject. The book is very well researched and intellectually stimulating. I particularly liked the chapter on stripping and the Goddess, called \\"At the Feet of the Goddess\\". I imagine that anyone with an interest in Feminism, sexual ethics, sex work, patriarchy or that enjoys original and creative thinking in general would enjoy this book and it would be a \\"must read\\" for any real inquiry into stripping."},{"Title":"Stripping, Sex, and Popular Culture (Dress, Body, Culture)","review":"In short: Roach's presentation here is insightful, informative and still quite entertaining.In not so short: I have found that when reading a book rooted in academia, meaning rich with research and depth, it is not often a fun read. Not the case here, the reader gains tremendous insight about the culture of sex work, yet you are almost always entertained. Roach is candid in her experiences and thoughts throughout her research and process. If the book seems interesting to you, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Stripping, Sex, and Popular Culture (Dress, Body, Culture)","review":"The \\"prostitute myth\\" was best portrayed by Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in \\"Pretty Women.\\" The movie resonated with men and woman viewers to the extent that it grossed an estimated $463.4 million. Richard Gere is charming, rich, dresses like a male fashion model and is just plain lonely. Julia Roberts has had a tough life. Her mom locked her in the closet. However, through it all, she is charming, dresses iconically, and happens to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. What starts out as a business transaction turns into true love. The handsome prince whisks Cinderella away from everything and they live happy ever after. Everybody wins. Happiness has no limits and everybody wins. Everybody loved it. However, it begs the question: If prostitution is so great, why is it illegal?The short answer is that in real world, the endings are not so happy. Obviously, as much as we all want Cinderella to find her prince, she probably won't find him in a strip club or working on a street corner. However, is there any acceptable manner where a woman can get paid for making herself sexually attractive to men? Professor Roach addresses this question in a quasi-academic manner. She indicates that her \`study' went through Institutional Review Board approval. From my reading, I can break her inquiry down into two general parts. For the first 130 or so pages, she describes her journey of self-discovery into the lives of strippers and prostitutes. She states \\"Strip clubs, I've discovered make me nervous. This whole book is in a sense my attempt to figure out why\\" (p. 67). This early potion of the book is more personal; told in the first person and describes, at a very slow pace, each deliberate step she takes to become acquainted with the world of strippers and prostitutes. She tries on their clothes, talks with them at clubs, learns about tipping, and explores the emotional baggage of a lady that sells fantasy for a living. The second part of the book, Professor Roach introduces the reader to Cosi Fabian, the Holy Whore, and the Wondrous Vulva. From that point on, she lets her PhD show. Rather than deliberate sentences about her tentatively trying on high heel shoes, she become more epic in her voice and describes woman as an archetype in light of pagan rituals. In this last third of the book, she comes across as a little ivory tower and aloof. Clearly, she is much more confident and competent at discussing Mother Nature imagery than strip clubs. Roach is a tenured professor of religious studies at University of Alabama. She graduated from Harvard University in 1998 with a Ph.D. in the Study of Religion. Her dissertation was on environmental ethics and Mother Nature imagery.Professor Roach makes the argument that society seems to reward individuals that do their gender right and punish those who do it wrong. One of Roach's points is that much of \`gender' is socially constructed. Unfortunately, in modern United States, the judgments of women are characterized by sexual puritanism while men can get away with anything if they have the money. So, Dr. Roach seems to want to come across as a modern feminist. As she states on page 112, \\"Sex positive feminism argues that woman in particular have been sexually constrained and punished for far too long and that they are sexually adventurous beings, with an equal right to explore their sexuality and pursue their desire.\\" Professor Roach really wants to dispel puritanical constraints on woman sexuality. She really wants to adhere to the principles of COYOTE (Call of Your Old Tired Ethics). She does not want to come across as \\"sex-negative.\\" Unfortunately, her attempts to advocate for stripping and prostitution come across more as rationalizations. For example, on page 131, she asserts that much of work is \\"forced by economic need\\" and that, in this context, \\"sex work can be potentially \`better' than many other entry-level, women's labor jobs\\" (p. 131.) as long as the conditions of discretion, privacy and consent were met. It seems that \`sex-positive' gets real complicated when money is involved. For me, her application of sex positive capitalism to the strip club is the most interesting part of the book.Sex positive capitalism is the effort to apply microeconomic analysis to the sex market place. Seemingly, strip clubs would lend themselves perfectly to economic analysis. Lust is unlimited while sex is scarce. Across many different studies and measures, men have been shown to have more frequent and more intense sexual desires than women. No contrary findings (indicating stronger sexual motivation among women) have been found. Why God made men so much hornier than women must have some evolutionary purpose, but in recorded history, the discrepancy has amounted to men paying for sex. In the modern era, that transaction for sex is usually illegal (prostitution), so the transaction is a black market (unregulated). On the other hand, strip clubs are commercial establishments, a marketplace of flesh regulated by local ordinances. A dollar gets you living labor, fantasy, lust; a value which is socially determined. But at different clubs (markets with varying levels of regulation) the return per dollar changes. So you have consumers comprised of overly exited men guessing at what a woman will do for a dollar. The producers (women) are desperate to make money and unsure of what other producers will do for a dollar. Strippers, acting as independent contactors, are in excruciating competition among each other. If one girl will prostitute herself in the champagne room, will the others have to follow suit? To what extent is a club (marketplace) motivated to set prices and values?For sex-positive feminists, such as Professor Roach, she would like to be able to view a strip club or a prostitution arrangement as one that could be potentially empowering for woman. She spends some time, again, mostly sounding like rationalizations, explaining scenarios where prostitution or stripping could be a situation that allows a woman to explore her sociality and purse her desire. However, she has a difficult time making the argument, at least to my satisfaction, that the strip club or prostitution arrangements are ever egalitarian. In the sex marketplace, someone always seems to come out on top and someone on the bottom (pardon the double entendre). The hand holding the money has the power over fading beauty. After years of sex trades, I think it is hard to argue that stripping or prostitution has increased women's general experience of egalitarian sexual satisfaction. Even less likely is that stripping or prostitution has in any way subverted or dispelled a historically constraining patriarchal expectations (chastity, sexually available, demure). As Professor Roach points out, \\"Such a definition of subversion, or requirement for it, poses difficulties for the stripper since her purpose at the club is to make a living and not subvert patriarchy (P. 85).\\" For a striper or prostitute, her financial success is based on her perpetuating a flawed, male-centered culture, not overturning it.I appreciate Dr. Roach's effort to tackle a tough topic. As a feminist, she doesn't want to come across puritanical but also does not want to sugar-coat the exploitative realities of prostitution and stripping. She would love to say a woman is free to be a feminist and a seductress, a hooker and a princess, all at the same time. However, unlike Vivian Ward, I do not think working in a brothel or strip club is the path to a \\"happy ending.\\" The best that can be said is that it is a place for a young girl to play dress up and try to make some money for as long as horny guys are willing to pay her. As Professor Roach put it: \\"Much of stripping and striptease culture simply comes down to not trying to change the world, but trying to make it work for you, to get the most out it as it exists(p. 86).\\""},{"Title":"Showdown at Yellow Butte","review":"JUST LOVED THIS BOOK , MR LAMOUR LETS US DELVE INTO THE MIND OF HIRED GUNS AND THE DECISIONS THEY HAD TO MAKE.

In 1999 I read that President Carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to North Korea (must have been a success, since the propaganda stopped).Could the double murders in Brentwood have been well-publicized as a distraction? Isn't two murders a day the usual LA statistics? How many other waiters (just from Mezzaluna) were murdered each year?

Worth the look, but be sure to look before you buy."},{"Title":"250 HTML and Web Design Secrets","review":"I skipped over the first chapter because obviously the tools of 2004 are much different than the tools of 2011. I first skim over the content and read only what I believe is relevant to today's web design. Although some of it is obviously common sense for any web designer even a beginner. I am still in college and am doing web design on the side and found some of this stuff very helpful. There is a lot of strategic planning and good tips in here that still apply. For 4$ including shipping you really can't go wrong. I am sending this to a colleague that will do some work for me part time as well. Highlighted and underlined the important stuff which I believe was about 60% of the book. 60% of a 2004 book I believe is still a very good percentage of good material. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a helpful cheap book for web design. There are some helpful html tips too in here.So the just of it,Cons,Quite a bit dated.Some common sense tips.Advanced designers wont get too much out of it.Pros,Great book at a great value.Some concepts and tips still pertain to today's web design.VERY CHEAP, I would buy this book again for 4$.Good for beginners and intermediate web designers.PS. I should be saying experienced rather than advanced."},{"Title":"250 HTML and Web Design Secrets","review":"I was slightly disappointed as the material is rather brief in coverage. I was looking more for a how too with examples. It does cover a large range of topics and has good reference for things to do but thin on how to do them.But under $10 bucks is still worth the price."},{"Title":"250 HTML and Web Design Secrets","review":"This book is ok and has a few decent tips in it, but for the most part there isn't anything in here that you couldn't find with a few minutes and Google. I keep it on my desk with a couple pages marked but that's really about it."},{"Title":"Nihongo Daisuki: Japanese for Children Through Games and Songs","review":"This is a wonderful teacher's manual with all of the memorable songs, games, and exercises that I remember as a child learning Japanese from my grandmother. It's definitely on the right track! For fluent teachers and those literate in Japanese culture and folk songs it's wonderful. There are complete exercises and photo-ready material for making visual aides or flash cards. For others less fluent or uncertain of their Japanese, there are gaping holes in the material. There is no Japanese - English translation of any of the vocabulary used. Also, there is no music to accompany the lyrics included for the songs. These are unfortunate gaps for an otherwise wonderful book."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Husband: How to Find and Marry a Great Guy","review":"I found this book in the church library, and PROMPTLY had it removed...the church librarian was horrified that it was there. Not a Catholic text by any means. Sexist,awful, nasty and disturbing. But great for a laugh!This book preaches sexual \\"purity\\"....but is written by a man who did not even KISS his wife until after engagement. He is however a compulsive masturbater and \\"pornography addict\\".This is NOT sexual purity, or healthy, or what God wants for us.This book advises women to not have a career, and to find a man who will \\"provide\\" for them. This book advises that all contact made with a woman should first have the permission of her father or brother.This book says to find a man who will have ultimate control over your life. This book does not show you how to find a \\"great guy\\"...who truly respects you as a member of Christ's body, sees you as a partner...an equal...If you want an abusive, sexually backward, unhealthy relationship,closet homosexual relationship...this is an excellent guide."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Husband: How to Find and Marry a Great Guy","review":"On the whole, this is the most ridiculous book I've ever read on this topic. While Wood provides some respectable advice (for example: have a clear understanding of loans and finances before marriage, know of his family and their background, watch out for addictions...), it completely counteracts any good with its outrageous and utterly insipid advice. It's an unrealistic, counterintuitive set of rules that demean women and mechanize something (Catholic Church says God=Love, kiddies!) I always understood the Catholic Church taught as blasphemous to anthropomorphize.This book offers ridiculous guidelines with fraudulent statics to finding a successful husband, all the while ignoring the likelihood that following these guidelines will properly fulfill the necessity for love to accomplish a successful marriage. Wood throws these ridiculous and stringently conservative rules down and insists that these will make for a healthy marriage and a happy family while citing his own relationship, awkward statistics, and general slander of modern society as conformation for his strategies.If I recall my freshman theology at my Catholic high school correctly, marriage is a union intended for the proper fulfillment of persons in the mission to get them to heaven...doesn't the duty to get your husband to heaven stay valid no matter the awful family he comes from (Wood advises against a guy from a troubled home), his sexual experience (Wood votes for virgins that don't even kiss until married), his religious background (Wood says marry other Christians), or his \\"earning potential\\" (Wood says to stay home and let hubby bring home the bacon while you act as a baby-factory. Don't consider getting a job even though modern economy requires it to support an 8-child Naturally-Planned Family that Wood also advocates).This was the most fallacious, indoctrinating piece of brain-washing conservativism that I've touched in a long time. If you love your potential husband-and I mean really love him-don't back down from the challenge of marriage because a stupid book picking on his human flaws told you to."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Husband: How to Find and Marry a Great Guy","review":"This book is for those who have a good working relationship with their families and want a guidebook to the old fashioned ideas of courtship. I was a little skeptical of this book at first only because I've grown up in this modern ultra sexed society. When I had the chance to read it I found myself highlighting practically the whole book. If you've read books like \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and wished that you too could engage in the gentle courtship Anne received in her Victorian society, this book will help guide you down that path. This is most definately not for everyone. Most people I know could never give up their way of dating and cohabitating together before marriage. We live in a selfish self centered world. For those who are fed up with these modern ways and long for the old, give this book a try. And remember, 75% of all married couples who cohabitated before they were married, get divorced. This is a terrible statistic. Fight the trends and go for the road less traveled."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Husband: How to Find and Marry a Great Guy","review":"If young men and women would read and heed this book we would probably have less divorce. I know that if I had read this book before I got married we would have had less &quot;bumps&quot; in the road during those first few years. This book helps you ask the pertinent questions to see where you may have the problems and correct them before you get married. I recommend it highly for anyone who is even thinking about the dating game. It's a great alternative. The younger the reader the better!Pre-teens would be my suggested audience. Moms and Dads - you will be glad that you purchased this book early and save yourself and your kids a lot of heartache."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Husband: How to Find and Marry a Great Guy","review":"Hi, This isn't just for teens! Yes, there maybe some references in the book that seem more like \\"teen\\" kind of things. However, even an adult looking for a true husband is able to glean something out of this book. I find that \\"courtship\\" is a better word for true \\"dating\\". Usually, it takes a few months to one year to get to really know someone even if you live long distance. If you really think that person is Mr. Right, then its time for the \\"courtship\\" stage where you get more serious and this is still before engagement. It's like a pre engagement stage. Once you are engaged--you shouldn't have to be thinking \\"what if I am wrong\\". You should KNOW once you follow the advise in this book. That way the engagement stage is REALLY the time to Prepare for Matrimony and not have to worry so much. So, give this book a try even if you are an older adult looking for the \\"perfect\\" husband. He's out there--just give it a try!"},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Husband: How to Find and Marry a Great Guy","review":"I'm not sure quite how to evaluate this book. Is it consistent with the Catholic Church's teaching? Yes, in that way that something that contains nothing that contradicts the faith. Is it the type of book that probably warms the heart of any parent who is, frankly, not eager to give up control of their children's lives? Yes, since it practically advocates that your father pick your suitor. The book contains a lot of good and understandable advice. Much of it runs counter to present-day culture (e.g., no kissing before marriage), but that doesn't inherently make it wrong.Yet, there is something just off about this book. If I were to try and pin-point my objections it would be this. First, it's written as a rule book. It literally says in the introductiont that if you follow these rules A-Z, you will end up with a great guy. Umm.. no. That's not guaranteed. He has a cute story of why the A-Z by looking at some Proverbs, but there's a world of difference between the merit of divine Scripture and the merit one ought to give the words of a professional Catholic apologist. So my first objection is that he tends to over-universalize what are his own preferences. Where he does best is when he is citing evidence from studies for why co-habitation and pre-marital sex is destructive, etc. If the book weren't largely marketed or targeted to what one would assume is already a largely practicing Christian audience, I'd say maybe it has merit just on that. But his writing style tends to exaggerate his conclusions, trumping up his preferences (which may be prudent things to adopt) as if they are fundamental rules, even citing ridiculous fake statistics like, follow my advice and your chances of a good relationship will improve by 75%.It also seems to suffer from a problem rampant in the EWTN wing of American Catholicism. And that's a too close of melding of American conservatism and Catholicism. I am a conservative, so I have no objection to many of the things favored by conservatives, but I would for once like someone to stop treating as if those are dogmas of the Church versus the way some people have chosen to live out the faith and potentially open to mistake in implementation or also not the full universe of possibilities.Finally, I note that the book contains nothing that actually helps one determine whether a person is the one for you. Obviously, that's an incredibly personal discernment process and not one to reduce to some schema. In some ways, I should be thankful the book gives this area short change; at least he didn't introduce some over-generalized formula. But the book is primarily focused on finding good candidates, not on discerning whether an individual is really meant for you. Much of the focus is on moralism/behavior. Which is fine, to a degree. I just think it could have used a discussion on the nature of love as a judgment, an act of the will, in the midst of all its lectures on drinking, swearing, holding hands, asking a father's permission to date the daughter, etc.Lastly, I really must ask what Steve Wood's credentials are. I note that the book is published by the institute Steve Wood founded, making it essentially a self-published piece. He apparently didn't submit it for a Impramatur or Nihil Obstat review. The description of the author states he is a member of the American Counseling Association, but says nothing about any academic training (i.e., university degrees) in marriage counseling.Overall, I'd say the book, read by someone who is a critical thinker, has some useful things to say. And the chapter with recommendations of some marriage communication tools that couples should try out, if these tools are good, is probably quite a valuable resource. But I would be quite fearful of handing this book to a person who lacks the sufficien self-confidence or self-awareness to use it critically, who might just adopt it whole cloth."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Choosing a Good Husband: How to Find and Marry a Great Guy","review":"I thought this was a very good book, one that should be shared with your daughters in their teens and early 20's.

It is one of the few in print which includes both classic and contemporary essays by both philosophers and artists, and &quot;covers&quot; the basic topics. Unfortunately, many of the texts are cut down to such tiny snippets that major parts of the essential arguments and even some widely-quoted passages (e.g. in Plato, Bell, Bullough, Kant), are missing. On the other hand, there are long essays reprinted, with virtually no cuts, which are not only not &quot;classic&quot; but which strike me as quite absurd. For example, there are only 9 1/2 pages from Kant's Critique of Judgment, but 8 pages of nonsense (or, &quot;postmodern paradoxes&quot;) about &quot;The Fine Art of Rap.&quot; Disappointing!"},{"Title":"Aesthetics in Perspective","review":"Received this order just as expected and in the same condition as listed, got it just as I needed, no downfalls."},{"Title":"Aesthetics in Perspective","review":"This book is good for people that want to understand aesthetics in art.

Why does Tarasov completely leave out The Soviet Olympic Team losing to the US Olympic Team in the 1980 Olympics? Herb Brooks was an avid student of Tarasov and would often track him down with a bottle of vodka and pry the master for information he could use to develop his US teams to emmulate the great Soviet squads.

Ziegler-Otero's honesty through out the book should be applauded. It's natural to side with the underdog, but ONHAE has made some critical mistakes since their founding and has had to learn many hard lessons about capitalism and politics.

In this audiobook, her words are conversational but there are some very profound insights about Femininity and our roles as women in society.While there are lots of books on Female Wisdom (including much recycled knowledge), what Sobonfu Some reveals about women in her culture is more specific and rather unique. Hardly any indigenous women have revealed the secrets and understandings of their culture to the Western world. (Men like Malidoma Some and Martin Prechtel have made some inroads from the male perspective.) I found her views helpful in bringing a richer dimension to being a woman in our culture that expects women (and their concomitant biology) to conform to expectations set by spiritual amnesiacs.Don't expect her to sound like a scholar or a deep-throated wise woman.

Apparently, Antonia did not read Belloc's earlier work, she simply has a similar sensibility (no surprise, both being Catholic). Antonia is a great writer, and her treatment, being the more up-to-date (such as deciphering exactly why Louis XVI could not &quot;do the deed&quot;) deserves the nod. But Belloc is always entertaining and worth reading. Here, his judgments do stand up to the test of time; and he clearly had fun writing this rollicking biography. An overlooked gem."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette","review":"Belloc's erudite, opinionated and symphonically dramatic biography of the ancien regime's last, maligned queen feels like the work of a lifetime, yet it is only one of many dozens of books the author wrote during his very long and productive career. A social critic and Catholic apologist attuned to the notion of civilization in decline, Belloc is a wonderful temperamental fit with his heroine and her milieu. As you would expect, Belloc is at drawn sabers with the frivolous sophistication of the Enlightenment philosophes, and finds in the royal couple unlikely, indeed rather unintentional martyrs for what he usually calls \\"the Faith\\". His sense of the pair's underlying humanity only helps him, however, to place their acts of indecisiveness and overreach in a more alarmingly dramatic light. With every chapter one feels the underlying beat of Destiny's drum, marching us inexorably forward in the Queen's footsteps to the guillotine. Each apparent reprieve of fate, each seeming change of fortune only serves to tighten the coils even more. Belloc also has a great appreciation for the splendors of the time-- exonerating the Queen of most of the foolish exaggerations of her expenses that found such perilous belief in the minds of her subjects, he can still evoke the splendors of a ball, the rituals of the Court, the relief of an extravagance indulged, with terrific and memorable economy. That does not contradict, however, the luxurious Late Romantic template of his prose. Though Belloc, like his great friend Chesterton, is the sort of single-minded religionist who many persons, even of faith, might regard suspiciously as a \\"crank\\", his \\"Marie Antoinette\\" is, as historical writing, scrupulously scientific in its approach to evidence, though it is overlaid with a prominent, indeed firmly explicit, metaphysical agenda. For me, Belloc's assertiveness is one of his charms, and while I must firmly decline to believe some of his broad contentions, I am very happy that he has woven them into his work. There is hardly a page of \\"Marie Antoinette\\" without a substantive claim about broader humanity-- about education, economics, military affairs and their impact on events, public opinion, the theatre, the arts, the art of living, and of course on religion and philosophy-- and these are extraordinarily ponderable and noteworthy. Belloc finds in Marie Antoinette a tragic heroine for the 18th Century-- an era which, as he notes at the very beginning, was quite at odds with the very notion of tragedy-- and thus implies that Fate can choose to write us out a tragedy whether we will have it or no. In limning the life and downfall of this glittering princess, Belloc finds an Everywoman who yet remains, surprisingly, a Queen to the end."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette","review":"Hilaire Belloc tells the tragic tale of the storied Queen of France with style and a proper sense of wonder. Most particularly fascinating about Belloc's narrative is his detailed and clear description of the famous, or rather famous, affair of the diamond necklace. Here we see the true villians of the plot as the scheming La Motte and the nefarious Cagliostro, the dupe as the foolish Cardinal Rohan, and the quite uninvolved, but nonetheless tarnished target of the fraud, Queen Marie Antoinette. Belloc illustrates here quite clearly that the propaganda surrouning this rather absurd, and yet critical episode, emanated from Masonic London, the great enemy of thrones and order.In his preface, Belloc records his philosphy of writing history, which explains volumes about his unique style and his peerless position as a popular historian. Here, he writes thusly,\\"But undigested detail is of the very essence of academic or university history, as it is still conceived, because such an accumulation give the uninstructed reader an impression of prodigous learning in the writer. Now, in my conception of the way history should be written, not the writer but the reader comes first; it is the instruction, and even the pleasure, of the reader which should be the aim of historical writing, not the reputation of the writer for prodigious reading.\\"How remarkable! Writing in the early twentieth century, Belloc then correctly discerned a trend which has become ever so much more profound over the years. As a history undergraduate at a great American university in the third quarter of the last century, I could certainly attest that university historical writing was then so encumbered with meaningless detail and devoid of literary value as to drive the most motivated of students to other disciplines. We needed then, and still need more so now, historians in the great tradition of Hilaire Belloc.Read this excellent book. And be both enriched, hugely entertained, and well informed by the experience."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette","review":"This product was in great condition when I received it. Also, I received it in a shorter time then I expected."},{"Title":"THE WINDOW AT THE WHITE CAT.","review":"For decades Mary Roberts Rinehart was the queen of mystery thrillers -- the American Agatha Christie. Rinehart's special gift was in the evocation of an overlying and unremitting atmosphere of unease and potential danger and it is under such an atmosphere of apprehension that she spins her stories. The Window at the White Cat was the first Rinehart mystery I read (The Circular Staircase was her first published novel) and I liked it so much that I began to read virtually all of her mystery novels -- many of them more than once. The White Cat in the title is the name of a seedy political hangout in which a killing occurs and the story is a mixture of political shenanigans, romance -- and, above all -- mystery and suspense. The Window at the White Cat is a terrific mystery novel and a very good introduction to the mystery novels of a master of the genre."},{"Title":"THE WINDOW AT THE WHITE CAT.","review":"With her trademark skill at telling a story rich with ominous portents and foreboding, Rinehart recounts a dark tale of a crooked politician's disappearance and subsequent murder, into which John Knox, a bachelor attorney, is drawn when he falls head over heels in love with the politician's engaged daughter. Clues, like suspects, are everywhere - from missing pearls to switched cases and strange notes scribbled with the numbers \\"11-22\\" - but none seems to fit together to fully explain the murder. Nor do they provide answers when the dead man's sister-in-law disappears and his death is followed by a slew of others. Are the events connected in any way? Only after a bumbling investigation full of wrong turns and oversights does John find the answer to both the mystery and his courtship of the politician's daughter, beginning when he looks into the window at the sight of the murder, the political club the White Cat. This absorbing page turner is a must read for all fans of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers!"},{"Title":"THE WINDOW AT THE WHITE CAT.","review":"There are so many twists, turns, false leads and perplexing clues in this plot, that I made no attempt to solve the mystery myself. I just went with the flow of the investigation.Yet the investigator does not inspire confidence. Jack Knox is a thirty-five-year-old lawyer who abandons his office work to track down the murderer of Allan Fleming, a corrupt politician. Foolish of him, but he's fallen in love at first sight with Fleming's bereft daughter.Jack's main asset is doggedness. He's constantly getting bruised and battered stumbling around in dark buildings pursuing intruders. Eventually he learns the trick of having a theory or two, and secrets reveal themselves as well.Political corruption is a constant presence in this novel. Everyone warns Jack to watch where he steps. But a man in love knows no fear.The Window at the White Cat is a feast of murder, suicide, break-ins, bank failures, peculiar robberies, sudden disappearances and characters behaving out of character. One inexplicable happening follows hot upon the next.This novel of detection was published in 1910 and has a very vintage flavor. I'd recommend it to Rinehart fans and readers who enjoy a good old-fashioned mystery."},{"Title":"THE WINDOW AT THE WHITE CAT.","review":"I rate this book highly because it is so well written.THE twists and turns of the plot keep me interested from beginning to end."},{"Title":"THE WINDOW AT THE WHITE CAT.","review":"It was a good mystery- especially if you like stories from the early 1900's era. Don't think it was as good as some of her others but nevertheless it will hold your interest. Read it for yourself."},{"Title":"THE WINDOW AT THE WHITE CAT.","review":"I have been a big Mary Roberts Rinehart fan for a long time, and had never come across this one. Written in first person, as she often does, this time the narrator is a 39-year-old lawyer whose life is turned upside down when a young girl asks him to search for her missing father. Of course he is smitten, despite that fact that she is barely out of her teens and engaged to be married on top of it. Her father turns up dead, strange things happen at the home of the girl's maiden aunts, and another character disappears under odd circumstances. I should also mention the Tammany Hall type politics that pervade the story and are the impetus for much of the plot. Rounding it all out is some missing (valuable) pearls and boatload of money that gets stolen. There are many red herrings, some interesting clues that go nowhere, lots of oddball characters included in this very fun mystery. It isn't perfect, since the setting is over a hundred years ago and feels a litte dated here and there, and not all of the characters get fleshed out as well as I'd like. I was left with a few questions at the end, too, since not all the elements felt resolved. The romance, although predictable, isn't too sappy, the dialogue is snappy, and not everything turns out as you might think. Not a \\"deep\\" book by any means, but getting a peek back into the bad old days of back room politics was a fun way for me to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon."},{"Title":"THE WINDOW AT THE WHITE CAT.","review":"Still liked reading the Window at the White Cat after 60 years.

I was trained as an occupational therapist at the London (UK) School of OT many years ago. I currently work in Pediatrics in the US. After a fall caused by autonomic abnormalities - orthostatic hypotension - or sudden loss of blood pressure, Peggy was admitted to Queen's Medical Center in Nottingham for her injuries. Her ability to participate in meaningful activity was eventually assessed using the Jackie Pool Activity Level Instrument for dementia. I was intrigued. Was Peggy at the Planned Activity Level, the Exploratory, the Sensory or the Reflex Activity Level. This book is written for and can be understood by carers of people with dementia. It's possible that my training in occupational therapy gives me a greater understanding of background and context for use of the instrument but it is very accessible to the general reader. I am using it to help Peggy's extended family know what she can and can't do and what supports and accommodations she would need to be able to take an interest in as well as participate in a meaningful activity. Peggy's awareness of her situation is greater than her physical abilities so we are discussing age-appropriate activities such as cooking, gardening and self-care over more child-friendly activities such as glueing and sticking. I wanted to help relatives and carers see Peggy's strengths and abilities so she wouldn't overhear comments such as, she's lazy, clumsy, bored, disinterested or self-absorbed. I have found the book extraordinarily helpful in this respect and hope you will too. Peggy's niece."},{"Title":"Handbook of Forensic Pathology","review":"This small, spiral-bound handbook of forensic pathology is an accurate and concise manual containing all topics dealt within the forensic pathology/medical examiner setting.According to the author, the book is intended for pathology fellows, residents, and medical students to aid in their instruction. In my opinion, the book would be quite useful to trained pathologists, medical examiners, and primary care providers (especially emergency room physicians exposed to forensic cases). The principal author is well-known in the field of forensic pathology.All aspects of forensic pathology, including blunt force injury, sharp wounds, asphyxia, gunshot wounds, fire deaths, environmental deaths, electrocution, deaths in custody, intraoperative deaths, and natural deaths are covered in this small handbook. Many useful diagrams and tables are included, such as firearm pictures and related diagrams, body area charts and tables for thermal injuries, and several classic illustrated injuries which are encountered in a forensic practice. The forensic toxicology section is quite useful with a very handy table of various drugs with therapeutic, toxic, and fatal blood levels.This excellent handbook compiles the most useful information found in the better known textbooks in a well-organized, easy to read format. This book will be my first source to answer a forensic question before referring to a full size textbook."},{"Title":"Handbook of Forensic Pathology","review":"This work is not a reference textbook in the normal format of text photographs and graphic illustrations. It is written n a telegraphic style, with clearly defined headings, subheadings and lists of the important facts of every division of forensic medicine. It is in an easily manageable format with wire back-binding, which facilitate: the opening of pages without the constraints of the traditional hardcover binding. It is amply illustrated with simple graphs and line drawings to clarify the adjacent text. As a handy vade mecum this publication is ideally suited for under and postgraduate medical students.In summary, an excellent manual on forensic medicine and pathology, recommended to all students and doctors interested and working in the field of forensic medicine and pathology. It will also be of value to lawyers who appear in inquests and trials, either as prosecutor or defense lawyer, where the understanding of medical facts and processes may be of paramount importance to ensure that justice is carried out in a fair and proper manner."},{"Title":"Handbook of Forensic Pathology","review":"The authors are both doctors with an extensive background in medical pathology. The book is well organized and any person who may be a first responder to a murder scene (or death of any kind) will find this manual invaluable. There are 20 chapters and terms used are intended for basic studies, from handling bodies to methods of analysis.As one peruses the annual you will find suggestions based on the doctors' examinations to expertise. Too often even the experts may come to the wrong conclusion by missing a step, during an investigation. Investigators should welcome this handbook as a checklist. It is an exceptional handbook well worth its cost."},{"Title":"Handbook of Forensic Pathology","review":"I completely agree with the review of the reader from Jonesboros, GA. As a forensic pathologist, I found it useful for board review and also refer to it in my daily work for a quick glance at a topic. The section on gunshot wounds (chapter 8) has excellent illustrations of weapons with parts of the weapons clearly illustrated and named. This is especially nice for readers, like myself, who did not teethe on guns and may not know where the recoil spring guide rod is located to correlate with patterned injuries seen at autopsy. This book is a very solid, easy to read review of forensic pathology."},{"Title":"Handbook of Forensic Pathology","review":"As a detective officer studying for a post graduate diploma in Forensic Medicine I found the book extremely useful, not only from a theoretical point of view but also from a practical stance in relation to daily police operations. The text is well laid out and each chapter provides easy reference. I would certainly recommend this book to any detective officer who for the most part, deals with violent crime."},{"Title":"Handbook of Forensic Pathology","review":"The book is an outstanding reference for the criminal investigator and certainly those involved in the investigation of violent crime. The structure of the book is in an outline format, with twenty chapters, an index, all totaling 249 pages. This format is quite effective, presenting sufficient detailed information to allow the reader to understand the subject without drawing them into an extensive narrative. To support the text, the authors provide a number of drawings and photographs that effectively demonstrate underlying concepts or ideas.Chapters Six through Nine are the true meat of the subject. They deal respectively with blunt force trauma, pointed and sharp-edged trauma, gunshot wounds, and asphyxia. Having taught death investigation and patterns of injury in college classes, I found reading these chapters delightful. Each chapter was well organized and concise in detail. What I liked best about this book, was that the format lets the reader quickly re-familiarize themselves with any given forensic pathology issue. Of all the manuals and publications I've used to prepare myself over the years, Dr. Di Maio and Dr. Dana's handbook is the best I've seen. For those of you teaching death investigation, if you have yet to find a functional text on patterns of injuries for your courses, I would certainly suggest this book as a solution. The bottom line is whether you've attended a single autopsy or a hundred, this book is a concise, easily read and detailed reference for the criminal investigator."},{"Title":"Handbook of Forensic Pathology","review":"In my work as a paralegal, I have had the need to research many different aspects of a forensic autopsy.

The current edition (black cover) is the same as their previously published edition (red cover) -- only the cover has been changed. The book addresses all major fatality categories providing clear, explicit text with a wealth of photographs and illustrations. The layman in any field of medicine and/or law research or your novelist needing a background of medical information will need to add this book to their library. I have consulted and used passages/information from its pages many times and will continue to do so, as it is the only book on forensic pathology that provides concise, yet thorough, answers to all questions pertaining to this field."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"This book was a great lesson in the \\"rules\\" of style.

It really defined my sense of classic men's style, and gave me an appreciation, previously lacking, for -- and an ability to recognize -- a truly well-dressed man.Alan Flusser, a dandy to the core, makes a great case for his argument that men's style (as distinct from &quot;men's fashion&quot; -- yuck) changes little over the decades. The &quot;look&quot; that worked for Fred Astaire or Cary Grant still works today. Tab collars, rounded collars, suspenders, monk straps, French cuffs, handkerchiefs (aka &quot;pocket squares&quot;) no tassel loafers with suits! ... the man who absorbs &quot;the principles of fine men's dress&quot; presented here will be well armed to do battle with a world where &quot;dressing down&quot; has become the sad and sorry norm.If, as Oscar Wilde said, &quot;A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life,&quot; Alan Flusser will help you take a great many paces down that road.

I eventually bought a copy from an auction site.If you manage to buy this book elsewhere, you'll find it a pleasure to read. It has been adequately summarized in other reviews, so I'll simply relate two features that I especially liked: first, a fold-out section with pictures describing various shirt fabrics; and second, Flusser's tips on quickly discriminating between quality and standard merchandise.If you are interested in reading about fine men's clothing, I recommend Bernhard Roetzel's _Gentlemen: A Timeless Fashion_. It offers much the same information as Flusser's book and features color photographs on every page (Flusser's does not)."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"This is probably one of my two favorite books on Men's style, the other being Gentlemen Style by Bernhard Roetzel. This book has very useful information for male fashion basics and is well illustrated. It is devoted to true male classic style so don't look to it if you want trendy or the lastest. I would say it is a sigificanlty better book than Style and the Man by Flusser, though, the text of the two books is fairly dupliciative - this one is better illustrated and goes into more detail."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"While some of the criticism of Flusser on this site is well placed, overall, this book should be the Bible for anyone wanting a sound, basic introduction to men's style. It is especially useful if you're interested in how men's dress evolved in this country. While some of the book is dated, it gives a good overview of almost anything a man could want to know about style. As someone else has pointed out, this book is not about fashion, it's about style. As such, it's a starting point for someone interested in developing their own, not the be all end all of men's dress."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"This is a quick, one-day read, but a lifetime keeper for reference.Mr. Flusser covers all the essentials in detail: suit coats; suit trousers; sport coats; blazers; dress shirts; neckties; handkerchiefs; hose (socks); shoes; hats; and jewelery.He covers sportswear such as cable-knit pullover sweaters and cardigans very briefly.Mr. Flusser asserts the lines, look, and feel of all fine mens wear can be traced to the timespan of the 1930s - 1950s. This was the Golden Age of Hollywood when men dressed well (Cary Grant; Fred Astaire; Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.; Adolph Menjou; and England's Edward, Prince of Wales). Mr. Flusser's point is that if you want a suit that will not be out of date in five or ten years, ensure it is grounded in 1930s - 1950s style, with emphasis on the 1930s.The only thing I disagreed with in the entire book was his reverence for the four-in-hand necktie knot in all settings. This knot is asymmetrical and does not belong in the boardroom or office. It is a knot that is to be worn casually to a club or in some other social setting. The Windsor or Half Windsor should be worn to the office.This is somewhat a digression, but there is more to fine dressing than just the fabric against your body, or the leather upon your feet. Care must be taken to groom the hair inside your nose, so that it does not protrude outward. The hair on and in the ear must be cut. Nothing looks worse than looking at a man in fine clothes and seeing he has a thick patch of hair growing out of each ear cavity. Andy Rooney eyebrows are also verboten. Hair, beards, moustaches, eyebrows, ears, nose, teeth...all of these must be groomed/maintained properly to accentuate the look of fine clothes. Without these grooming basics in place, no suit is going to make you look good. Mr. Flusser elected not to cover grooming as essential to the \\"total package,\\" yet he devoted many areas of the book to items that were not strictly related to clothing. I feel it was a mistake to neglect grooming.Clothes and the Man is now 21 years old. It is as relevant now as when it was written. This book is a timeless masterpiece, fully deserving five stars."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"I have read this book several times with pleasure and refer to it often. (I even reached for it on my wedding day for advice on pocket squares.) Flusser combines detailed information about fabrics, tailoring, and color with his own wonderful sense of style, based on 1930s and '40s models that have remained classic. A beautiful book and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"I happened to watch a re-run of Shell's Wonderful World of Golf this morning featuring a match at a country club in Belgium during the 1950's. Former King Leopold was among the thirty well-dressed people observing the play, and most of the men could have walked up Park Avenue this year and been in style.More useful than Flusser's later book, Clothes and the Man reminds us that, ignoring the excesses of the 1970's and the general absence of style in Silicon Valley in the 90's, the well dressed man evolves slowly. We may wear driving moccasins and eschew opera pumps in the new century, but the well turned out 1920's man is recognizeable today. That's important because it's the long lives of Anderson & Sheppard suits and Cleverly shoes that makes them attainable by people of less than extraordinary means. And, at least for me, the pleasure of proper fit and great fabrics is the reason to pay attention."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"Flusser's Clothes and the Man is a must have for any person serious about menswear, and any man who cares about dressing well.

Once you read this book, shopping trips will never be the same."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"I purchased this book several years ago and still find myself reading it. The reason is that the clothes and principals spoken about in this book never go out of style and are enduring. For everything from picking out a suit to buying ties and socks and folding linen and satin Mr. Flusser has written the first testament. He followed with a New Testament with Style and The Man. For any man who wishes to improve his looks as well as his wardrobe this book is the place to start. Men should learn how to dress themselves and this book will teach them how."},{"Title":"Clothes and the Man: The Principles of Fine Men's Dress","review":"Everything you need to know about the right attire, and how to wear it is there.After you read this book and you go to buy a suit you'll be able to request a proper fit of it and not whatever the tailor thinks it should be.

Upon investigation -- it seems Haha Lung may be a cover-name -- and half of Haha Lung's work may be from the creativity of this semi-hidden author. What may matter most to some folks is the self-defense as presented by a particular work -- beyond apparent \\"true authors\\" or \\"real tradition\\". Now this reviewer prefers ALL of the above -- when possible. It SEEMS to my best impression that some kind of \\"Kung-Fu\\" IS being presented [there is even an interesting \\"history\\" explained]. BUT beyond that -- the actual \\"Kung-Fu\\" is seen to be LIKE a Primary synthesis of many types of effective \\"Vietnam Kung-Fu\\". That could be very good for those who need or want a streamlined version of \\"Kung-Fu\\" -- fluid, clear, sharp and COMPACT. To my impression -- much modern [POST-1950] \\"Kung-Fu\\" strays from such streamlined self-defense -- but NOT the \\"Kung-Fu\\" in \\"Cao Dai Kung-Fu\\" -- which looks to be VERY direct self-defense using counter-rotation of primary \\"Kung-Fu\\" stances, footwork, kicks, blows, pokes, grips, locks, trips, sweeps and throws. The \\"Illuminati Star\\" as illustrated on page 59 seems to show a certain blatant sense-of-humor of the author -- as well as the GRAPHICALLY GRIM method-illustrations -- BUT with REALLY SILLY \\"ninja-versus-police\\" figures +++"},{"Title":"Cao Dai Kung-Fu: Lost Fighting Arts of Vietnam","review":"This book is more than simply a martial arts manual that shows the moves, the positions and the strikes. It is also a history of martial arts--sort of a thumbnail sketch of what there is around the world--and how it developed in Vietnam. The author goes into the political climate that created conditions in which Cao Dai would come to exist in the first place and how it has evolved. Plus the excellent illustrations, done by the author and they are easy to understand. There's no substitute for a live teacher, but if you already have some background or if there is no dojo around, this isn't bad. And I don't know what you mean about it being hard to come by.

It maps and describes 74 of Fiji's top dive sites and the color photography is excellent. Despite the title, however, those interested in beach-based snorkeling will find little of use here as almost all of the sites included are accessible by boat only. Even the new Waitabu Marine Park off Taveuni is mentioned only in passing. There's virtually no practical resort or restaurant information, and the first quarter of the book is devoted to brochure-style hype you can read on almost any Fiji website. Critical reviews of dive facilities are strikingly absent, so this book is of no help in selecting a specific scuba operator. Five pages of listings in the back of the book provide basic contact information, but even this is out of date as all Fiji telephone numbers have increased from six to seven digits since the book was published. Most of the email addresses are also wrong, so substitute @connect.com.fj whenever you see @is.com.fj. Nevertheless, when one considers the cost of a scuba tour to the South Pacific and the lack of any alternative Fiji dive guide, all of the above criticisms are mute and serious divers will click this title straight into their shopping carts."},{"Title":"Fiji (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Great Barrier Reef)","review":"This book is seemingly a compilation of dive locations frequented by dive resorts, with little independent research or reviews of specific dive outfitters. The book lacks basic information on water temperatures, currents, winds and seasonal influences. The independent traveller primarily interested in snorkeling will also be disappointed in the lack of practical information on the best sections of the main islands for shoreline snorkeling."},{"Title":"Fiji (Lonely Planet Diving & Snorkeling Great Barrier Reef)","review":"\\"Ni sa bula vinaka\\", as it is said in Fiji. As a master diver who has dived since 1956, and has visited many of Fiji's dive sites, I can heartily recommend this book to anyone contemplating diving Fiji. The Mahaney - Witte team- authors, photographers and dive tour guides well-known and respected in the diving community- are knowledgeable and credible. Mind you, NO book can ever catalogue ALL of Fiji's diverse and innumerable dive sites... but this book is well planned, has a very good selection of sites- rated for conditions and experience levels- and information for the would-be Fiji diver. The book has some maps, and a visual feast of photos. In summary- going to Fiji to dive? Be prepared for stiff currents, and a kaleidoscope of colorful fishes and soft corals... and BUY THIS BOOK! Dive well and safely."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:j},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],B={key:0},z={key:1};function D(n,e,s,u,r,o){const y=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",C,[(t(!0),i(w,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),b(y,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),i("span",z,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const S=c(L,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-679b0172"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/30.md","filePath":"glossary/30.md"}'),x={name:"glossary/30.md"},q=Object.assign(x,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(S)]))}});export{J as __pageData,q as default};
