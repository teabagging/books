Having worked in libraries, I had often seen the book checked out and I new that it was a Newberry winner. However, I was always turned off by the book's cover (which featured a young boy and girl next to a tree) and by the book's blurb which gave me the impression that story was a piece of chick lit geared toward young girls. My attitude towards the book first softened when I saw trailers for the BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA movie from Walden Entertainment. Those trailers didn't look anything like the blurbs and jacket covers I had read. Shortly after seeing those trailers my sister told me I should read the story and that I would probably like it. She was right.Though BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is often marketed and read en-mass by pre-teen and teenage girls, the book actually revolves around a boy named Jess Aarons. Jess lives on a poor, small farm in rural Virginia. He is the only boy of five children. There isn't anyone nearby that is close to his age and so after completing his chores, he spends a lot of time alone tramping through the fields, running, reading books, and drawing pictures. At the end of summer a new family moves into the vacant house next door. The parents are both writers and they have one child, a daughter named Leslie who is Jess' age. Jess and Leslie quickly befriend each other and become best friends. They spend all of their time together create an imaginary kingdom in the woods, Terabithia, that they rule together. Jess brings out the best in Leslie and vice versa and though neither acknowledges it they fall in love with each other. Then one glorious day, a terrible tragedy strikes. Jess is forced to examine his life and realize just how big of an impact Leslie has had upon it.I have to admit that BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA was a much better book than I thought it would be and that it touched me. The story reminded me of one of my favorite books of all time, STARGIRL, by Jerry Spinelli. Both books deal with some of the same themes (close friendships, first love, nonconformity, etc.) and have similar characters (Stargirl is like an older version of Leslie), but STARGIRL is aimed at an older audience than BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, though BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is more tragic.BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a wonderful book and is the first work of Katherine Paterson's that I have read. I highly recommend it and look forward to reading more of Paterson's writings in the future."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This story is simply yet beautifully told, and contains powerful messags about friendship, imagination, loss and recovery. Jesse Aarons, age 10, practices hard to become the fastest runner in the fifth grade. His hopes are dashed when Leslie Burke arrives in the neighborhood. Recovering from disappointment, Jesse decides that Leslie is OK, given that she never gloats. The two develop a strong friendship connected to their imaginary kingdom of Terabithia in the woods. In Terabithia Jesse and Leslie reign as king and queen, sharing stories and dreams, and finding solace from a difficult world. When Leslie tragically dies, Jesse must contend with the overwhelming loss, and in time he finds a way to do so.This superb story saddens and inspires, and is sometimes read by persons grieving the loss of loved ones. This is a popular children's story, but it connects with readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book aloud to my 10 year old. The book was chosen by his \\"book group\\" at school. Easy to read, good, smooth storyline, true life. At the end of the book, it was so sad, that I could not finish reading it aloud. Told my son he would have to read it to himself, because I was crying...."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book in 4th grade and it was probably the first book that i read that involved the death of a main character. All the other reviews have summaries so I'm going to skip that but I will say that if your child is emotionally ready to read about death this is an excellent book for mature 4th graders and up."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Have you ever read the book&quot;The Bridge to Terabithia&quot;? I have, and it is a really great book. This book is about a girl named Leslie that moves to a town where a little boy named Jesse lives. At first Jesse did not like Leslie because she kept bugging him, but later on he began to like her. They became best friends, and they created a club just for them to be. They called this club Terabithia. Leslie was very curagios. She wasn't afraid of anything. One day she was swinging on a vine across a river to get into Teribithia. Her luck of being curagios ran out. The vine broke and she fell in the river.Since she was all alone.No one could help her so she drown.Jess, her best friend, was devestated when he was told.In memory of her, Jesse built a bridge over the river to Terabithia so no one could slip again. I liked this book because the characters in this book remind me of real people that I know. I would reccomend this book for anyone who likes to read great stories because this sure was a great story. This book was very easy to follow. This book was unbelievealy good. I hope you find the time to read this book. I promise you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Katherine Paterson creates emotion which grabs the readers attention from the first page until the very last page. She takes the reader through childhood envy and laughter, from sadness and denial to acceptance. It is difficult not to feel like you, yourself are standing next to each character experiencing everything with them. I never had a book that takes me through so many emotions and to have them feel so real. The detail Ms. Paterson uses is just phenomenal! Any reader of any age would enjoy this book of childhood and friendship."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Katherine Paterson's BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA won the Newbery Award when I was in grade school. Yet I never read it during my childhood. Recently, I re-read some of my old childhood favorites with more than a few being Newbery Award or Honor winners. These books reminded me how fantastic some children's literature can be. Looking for further reading, I checked Amazon.com's list of Newbery books and I came upon BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. I was just amazed at the overwhelming number of positive reviews for this book. Needless to say, I had to read it for myself.The reviews were right. BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a terrific and truly moving reading experience. Of course, since so many reviews contained spoilers, the emotional climax wasn't the big surprise it is supposed to be. However, it still packs a powerful, emotional whallop. Through the character of &quot;Jess,&quot; the reader experiences joy, sadness, and the realization of how wonderful, however brief, the gift of friendship can truly be. BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a fantastic story on the value and joy of life."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is a book that makes the readers laugh, cry, and think. It is a wonderful novel that both boys and girls enjoy reading. The message that boys and girls can be best friends is perhaps what makes this such high interest to the two genders.Jesse, a 10 year-old boy that lives in the country, has never had true friendship until Leslie, a 5th grade girl from the city, moves in across the street. The two get to know each other and develop a unique friendship in Terabithia, a magical kingdom that they created in the woods.Leslie is known to be a carefree, imaginative girl with a lot of creativity. Jesse is just the opposite - until Leslie opens his mind to the wonderful world of imagination.This is a super book that I highly recommend people to read. Not just kids, but adults as well!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Patterson, is about a boy and a girl who become good friends. They build a secret place that only they know about. They go to this secret place if they want to be alone. Jess is a boy that lives on a small farm. Leslie moves next door to him. Jess and Leslie became good friends. Together they build a secret castle that they go to after school often. Leslie went to church with Jess for the first time. Jess helped Leslie fix up her house. They even played a joke on Janice Avery, the bully of the school. Jess and Leslie do almost everything together. One day, Jess didn't go to Terabithia with Leslie. He went with his music teacher to Washington for a day. When he comes home he hears shocking news. He knew his life wouldn't be the same anymore. I liked the book a lot because it told how two people became good friends. I liked their imaginary and adventurous world because it was exciting. It was interesting because it showed how becoming close friends and then hearing shocking news can effect life. It was a great book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Now that I have a daughter who loves to read it's refreshing that I can revisit this book and not feel like a total wuss. I first read this book sometime back in the mid 80's, and at the time my very best friend (and in some ways first love) was a girl, and the depth of the book hit me probably more than others because I understood what it meant to be that close to a girl on an innocent level. The relationship that the authour weaves throughout the tale reminded me very much of my friend and still does to this day, both of us were well read, lots of personality and vivid imaginations, and we bonded even more over this book. Now I am married, have been for years, but to this day there is still only one person who I ever allowed to read over my shoulder, and it's the girl from the 80's. (I still talk to her from time to time, not nearly as much as I would like to.)In my opinion this is one of those books that sticks with you, you know exactly who you were and where you were in life when it touched you, and it will touch you if you let it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"NO SPOILERS HEREI have read a lot of Katherine Paterson books, but BtT is my favorite by far. I was not fortunate enough to read it until I reached adulthood. I find myself envious of the kids who had to read it in school, because I know I would have enjoyed it just as much as a kid as I do now. I was at Borders when they were closing, and I happened to find a copy in an extra-large illustrated hardcover format, so now I have two copies. I cannot wait til my son is old enough to read this, because I am sure he will enjoy it as well. The characters in the story are very real and believable. One of Katherine Paterson's best qualities in her writing is the fact that her stories are very 'real', and she does not sugarcoat anything. I detest children's book authors who write endings in which everything works out perfectly as they pretend that tragedy and devastation do not exist. Kids are surprisingly resilient; we should not have to sugarcoat or protect them from every little normal part of life, such as death, for fear that they can't 'handle' it. This book deals with the feelings of a child (Jesse Aarons) as he experiences a great loss in his life, and I think it was executed very well. This book can be enjoyed by children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"As the winner of the 1978 Newbery Medal, this book gave me a full-hearted touchingness and joy. Jess Aarons, with his goal on being the fastest runner in the fifth grade, practices every morning. Despite of his works, a girl named Leslie Burke moves into his town and beats him on the run. After a few talk, a word \\"beautiful\\" came to his minds, but he shook it off, and headed home. Following the event, Leslie and Jess bond their friendship and noticing their need of a \\"place\\" just for them, they find a nice place up the forests, and construct Terabithia. After constructing the castle stronghold, Leslie and Jess continues to make more stories of Terabithia, such as the histories and the peoples living there. Of all the happy days, Miss Edmuns calls on Jess to offer him a ride to Washington to take him to National Gallery. Jess accepted it right away, thinking whether or not to ask her about if he could take Leslie with them, but the thought disappeared in the thought of the art gallery. After getting back home, tragedy occurs. Leslie died drowning in the river below the rope they used to swing across to Terabithia. Jess tries to ignore the truth, but truth is a truth. The Burks move out to Pennsylvania, after giving Jess what Leslie would have given him. Later, Jess makes a bridge to Terabithia for his little sister, May Bell.I must tell you, I wept when the part of Leslie dying came out. It was so sad, suddenly making me remember my grandfather's death. I cried until I had no more tears left to cry. The book is not that cry-able, but, yes, I wept.To sum- up, I think it is a really good book, and everyone should read."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia starts out with Jess Aarons practicing for school recess races, but ends up being mostly about friendship. Everything else is gravy. And, to throw in another food metaphor, like a hearty stew there is a whole lot of everything else. Katherine Paterson has included most everything I'd expect to find in a book for young people.There are friends. Winning that first race after the start of school is the biggest thing Jess thinks about; not the new neighbors at the Perkins place. Even when one of those neighbors turns out to be his age, he remains uninterested. After all, the neighbor is a girl. Leslie also unfortunately isn't the right size for his younger sister May Belle. Moreover, she turns out to be a competitor. She joins the recess races, something that the boys dislike but don't know how to stop. For a while, Jess even outright avoids Leslie because, thanks to her, one of the only highlights of school is no longer any fun. Then one day he sees Leslie being teased, his protective instinct kicks in, and his entire world changes. At this point in the book, the story becomes about their friendship.There are bullies. Gary Fulcher doesn't show any respect for other people's property. In his free time at school, Jess likes to grab notebook paper and draw. Gary makes it his business to try to see these sketches, the way certain boys in my sixth-grade class made it their mission to steal notes from their peers. Notice I pluralized bully. Gary is an ant compared to Janice Avery and her two friends. In typical bully fashion, they make little kids give them their food. They also snatch hopscotch rocks, run through jump ropes, and laugh when kids screamed. While no one ever stole my food in elementary school, I did avoid walking home alone in fifth-grade for fear of being beaten up. It doesn't take too many experiences to learn that there are bullies in the world. Unlike Jess, I never tried standing up to mine until I had become an adult.There are siblings. By having four, Jess has too many of them. The older two remain clich&eacute; teenagers for whom whining, shopping, dating, and razzing their younger siblings are the norm. The younger May Belle and Joyce Ann, however, inspire some of the sweeter moments in Bridge to Terabithia. On the very first morning that we meet Jess, May Bell wakes up and asks him: \\"Where are you going?\\" In response, Jess \\"patted her hair and yanked a twisted sheet up to her small chin.\\" One might wonder why Paterson bestows Jess with four sisters, when the heart of the book is his friendship with Leslie. Part of the beautiful complexity of Bridge to Terabithia is its multiple layers, including the relationship between Jess and May Bell, which eventually helps Jess nudge May Bell towards a friendship with her younger sister.There are also parents, teachers, animals, holidays, imaginary worlds, and even a discussion of faith. Those were all an important part of my world too; like Jess, I had a crush on a teacher, made up stories with my friends, and wondered about God. Every character, detail, and incident in Bridge to Terabithia is so true to life, many readers will identify.Have I given any too much of the plot? No, for there is the still the question of how Jess stands up to the bullies. You might wonder too about whether he ever does anything about his crush on his teacher. Then there is that pretend world that Leslie and Jess create, after which the book is named. Most important, there is how their friendship unfolds. I have deliberately left out those details, for you should encounter them for yourself by reading Bridge to Terabithia. If you haven't read the Paterson's book yet, there is so much to discover and love. If you have, then you know it is like looking back through a treasured vacation album.In slightly over one hundred pages, Katherine Paterson has created a patchwork quilt wherein each square reveals a little more about family, school, friends, religion, and all those important areas of life. We might sometimes experience them differently than Jess, but they were part of our childhood and have become part of our adulthood. Bridge to Terabithia has everything that I might expect to find in a book for young people, but it also has everything that adults can relate to. It's the perfect book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to TeribithiaKatherine PattersonFictionDo you like a good book with a catchy story? Well if you do then Bridge to Teribithiawould good be a perfect choice for you! Once you start the book you can't put it down!Jessie Arons is a lonely fifth grade boy who wants to be the fastest runner in the schooluntil the new girl Leslie Burke beats all of the boys in a long awaited race. Then Jess's life is changedwhen they swing across a rope into a forest landing and they create a secret place,a secret place just for them. As they build their stronghold and have fun while squirming to get out of school they becomemore absorbed into their fantasy world. Soon Jess comes back to reality and gets a call from the musicteacher he's been crushing on, Miss Edmunds and she ask him if he wants to go to the WashingtonMuseum of Art something terrible happens to his best friend...Leslie Burke.Leslie Burke, the dynamic protagonist of the story, is a happy upbeat person who is very sneaky and sinister. She is very young and blonde and small and she is a tad weird and dresses like a boy. She lives in her little fantasy. Jessie Arons is her best friend. He is a cranky fifth grader who is annoyed everyday by his younger and older sisters. Around Leslie he is very sinister and happy because she is his best friend. He loves art and likes to draw and paint and such. He is very southern from the country and has a southern accent. May Belle is a sassy 6 year old who brags about everything and come cryingto her older brother, Jessie Arons. Just like her brother she has a southern accent. She is a big tattletail and a crybaby and threatens to tell if Jess does anything.I liked this book because it was very detailed and focused on the characters and story. The author did A very good job explaining the characters and plot you could actually feel like you were in their shoes. I also liked the plot/story a lot it was almost like a growing up story such as Steven King's Stand By Me in my opinion. The characters were also very detailed in depth and has much background behind them. Anyway this story was good and exciting once you start reading it you can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"For some reason, I decided to catch up on some YA/Children's classic and this happened to appear on my list. I had seen the Disney remake and was intrigued with the idea. As I was watching the movie, I couldn't believe the girl dies. I seriously was in shock for about a week. I decided that I needed to check out this book to see what it was telling kids about death.The book is nice. I enjoyed the dialogue and pace of the story. For some strange reason, I was expecting the outcome of the book to be different from that of the movie, which, of course, makes absolutely no sense. So when Leslie dies (again) I was so frustrated that I actually threw the book against the wall. I don't know why, but it left my hand and ended up behind my bed. I just couldn't believe that a girl like that would be killed off. Don't get me wrong. I love drama and I am all for killing off characters to push the story. R+J wouldn't be the same if Mercutio lived. But are you kidding me?Anyway, I loved this book, but I'm glad I read it as adult. I'm not sure I would have been able to understand the story as a child. There really isn't that fairy tale ending, which isn't to say that kids always need that. But I think if the story is going to use the power of fun imagination as its energy source, one of the main characters can't die. Great story. A classic."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I almost cried, and I'm not the crying type. I'm the kind of man who breaks things with sledge hammers and swordfights in the backyard.

The biggest event on the school playground is the races, and Jesse only won once all last year.

And even though she obliterates the boys in the races and ruins the fun for the whole year, she and Jesse find a way to become friends. The best of friends.\\"Do you know what we need?\\" Leslie asks him. \\"We need a place, just for us. It would be so secret that we would never tell anyone in the whole world about it.\\"And Terabithia is born. A place of imagination and friendship, secrets and love. A place where an ordinary boy and girl can rule as king and queen, inventing adventures that they can enjoy together. A place to escape from family and friends who won't let you be who you want to be. A place that can only be entered by swinging across an enchanted rope.The resulting story is a moving look into the grief one experiences after a tragic accident. With careful and elegant brushstrokes, Peterson paints a canvas rich with the vibrancy of youth, the depth of friendship, and the dark hues of religion and life that sometimes color our journey through life.If you haven't read this one, treat yourself to a quality novel. 1978 Newbery Award Winner, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is worth the time.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is the story of Jess, a 10 year old boy who dreams of being the fastest runner in the fifth grade.

Then, a new family moved into the old Perkin place. The new girl Leslie ruined his dream, and turned out to be the fastest kid in the fifth grade. In the beginning, Jess was upset that a new girl, who dressed sloppy on the first day of school, didn't have a television, and was very daring, was faster than he was. Then Jess and Leslie ended up becoming great friends. Jess decided that being friends with a &quot;girl&quot; wasn't so bad after all! After being friends, they decided to build a secret retreat, called Terabithia. To get to their secret retreat, they had to cross the river, by swinging on a rope. Jess was the King, and Leslie was the Queen. Leslie and Jess loved going there, until it rained. When it did rain, the river would swell, and Jess was afraid, because he couldn't swim. One day, Jess went to Washington with his teacher Mrs. Edmunds. (Jess had a secret crush on Mrs. Edmunds!) While he was gone, Leslie decided to go Terabithia, by herself. A tragic thing happened. When Jess got back, he found out that Leslie died. Leslie's dad said that she died going to Terabithia. He said that she was swinging on the rope, when the rope snapped! In honor of Leslie, Jess made a wreath and a bridge to Terabithia. With the bridge there, he would be able to cross over the river on it, and not have to swing on a rope! *~*"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is one of the best books I've ever read. It starts out with a boy named Jesse Oliver Aarons Jr. who is going to 5th grade at his school. Jess and all the other boys, from 3rd-5th grade, race everyday for recess so he runs everyday. He then meets Leslie Burke who at first seems like a tomboy to him and Lesie wins the race. Later he smiles at her signifying a relationship between the two. The two build a secret hiding place called Terabithia, where only they could enter. A tradgedy strikes later seperating them forever. This book will make you happy and sad so I strongly reccomend it. I hope you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Paterson has outdone herself in this beautiful work of literature about the deep-rooted friendship between a young boy and girl. It is truly a joy to read again and again as their magical relationship flowers from a curious attraction to a bond that creates a forcefield of love for them both in the shape of a secret hideout in the woods, the make-believe kingdom of Terabithia. This bond is not unreceptive to outsiders though, for through Jess' (the boy) friendship with the young girl, Leslie, he is able to recognize and express his feelings for others in his life, a favorite teacher and his own little sister. This work is extraordinary, because it gives an in-depth look at the range of emotions that are often misunderstood in our childhood, i.e. love, grief, etc. The ending is tragically moving; yet, the experience for Jess, Leslie, and the readers, is truly magical."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is about a young boy named Jess and a new student named Leslie. They made an imaginary land named Terabithia. Terabithia is a place where they can go and be away from the normal world. The only way that they could get over to Terabithia, was to swing across an old rope that is suspended across a small stream. Jess and Leslie would cross the bridge every day and made a visit to their make-believe world. One day there was a huge storm. Jess and Leslie tried to cross the old rope. This one day would change their lives forever. This book was okay. It was just not detailed enough. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes carried out stories.

ParkPeriod: 6Jess Oliver Aarons and Leslie Burke were the rulers of Terabithia and were called king and queen of the Terabithians, but one day a tragedy happened. Before Terabithia existed, Jess was a normal boy who went to school, had a family, and had his own goals to reach. His goal was to be the fastest runner in the whole Lark Creek Elementary. He could have had that title, but Leslie changed everything. Leslie had moved into town and went to the same school as Jess. In fact, they were neighbors. Then in school, Leslies passed over the boy side of the school field and wanted to run with the boys. Once she started to run, she was in front of all the boys and even Jess. This mad Jess mad at Leslie, but not for long. As time passed and they got use to each other, they became best friends. Afterward, one day, Leslie had great idea of building a place where nobody could find and make that place theirs. After they finished building their secret castle in the nearest woods, they named it Terabithia. Everyday, Jess and Leslie would always go there and talk or to play with each other. Sometimes May Belle, Jess second youngest sister would come along with them to Terabithia. Days passed and their friendship became even strong than before, but on the day when Jess had to go to Washington with Miss. Edmunds, and a disaster occurred. It was raining hard and the creek that leads to Terabithia was high and the current was swift. Leslie wanted to go to Terabithia to give Jess something. Instead Jess didn't go and told Leslie not to go, but she didn't listen. When she got there, Jess was already at Washington with Miss Edmunds and this was the time when the disaster happened. On the old rope, that both Jess and Leslie used to swing on, to get to Terabithia broke! Then Leslie fell into the high tide, drowned and died. People believe that she might have died by hitting her head on something before she fell, but nobody knows the truth. This was the saddest day of Jess's life, so he had to do something about it. Later, Jess noticed that, while he was with Leslie, he was building up his strength and courage within himself. The couple day after Leslie's death, Jess decided to build a bridge to Terabithia. Then of course, the Kingdom of Terabithians needs another queen. So, instead of having no queen, Jess made May Belle the second Queen of Terabithia.The reason why I like this book is because it shows what true friendship is between two best friends. One of the quotes I liked from this book, that kept me reading, is when Leslie told Jess \\"We need a place. It would be so secret that we would never tell anyone in the world about it.\\" The reason why I like this quote is because this was the first words that Leslie said to Jess, which gave an idea of building Terabithia. If Leslie had never said that, or even bring up of the idea, there would be no such thing as Terabithia, but it could have save Leslie's life too. Leslie had died because she was trying to go to Terabithia, for a reason, but instead, she ended up dieing, but if they didn't build it. Their friendship wouldn't be as strong as it was after they build it. So the idea of building Terabithia was both a good and a terrible idea.The second quote was when Jess said to May Belle, \\"Shhh, yes. There's a rumor going around that the beautiful girl arriving today might be the queen they've been waiting for.\\" Once I read this quote it made me simile because this quote meant that, even though the first queen of Terabithia is gone forever. There can always be another one, which would be May Belle at this point. Before I read this quote, I felt heartbroken because Leslie had died and she wasn't able to become queen, but later, I was happy that Jess had found someone he can trust to become the next queen of Terabithia. Now Jess doesn't have to be lonely in his kingdom.The part when Leslie and Jess was building Terabithia was my favorite part because they were helping each other to build their secret place or hide out, where they can be together forever. Without this event happening, I don't know what could happen between those two friends. Luckily they did build it and it was all of Leslie's creative idea. If I was Jess, I would be happy for meeting Leslie and would do anything to protect her because she is the only thing that kept Jess strength and courage stronger. At the end, everything was back to normal. Terabithia had a new queen and he will always remember Leslie."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I am a school librarian, and this is the book I recommend to those kids who just don't like to read.

But it also talks about friendships and how important they are. The book starts when a girl named, Leslie Burke moves in to the house next to Jess Aarons. Leslie and Jess have a very unstable friendship at the beginning of the book, but soon they are the best of friends. Leslie teaches Jess how to look at life in a whole new way. She teaches him how to have more imagination. Together they invent a place called Terabithia, where they reign as the king and queen. They fight many battles, real and imaginary. But then suddenly, Jess's life gets turned upside down when something happens to Leslie, and Jess thinks about giving up Terabithia forever."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia was amazingly enchanting. This story introduces two wonderful friends who go on an extroridinary adventure to a world that is simply unheard of. This story was definitly without doubt the best book I have ever read. I started reading this book with lower expectations considering the fact that I myself am not much of a reader. But, by the end of the story I had suggested this book to over 10 people. This book made me laugh and cry. It was described in such incredible detail that I could actually feel myself in Jess and Leslie's shoes. If I could I would give this book ten stars but the highest I could give it was five. I personally am an extremely slow reader usually in five and a half hours I would only be able to read about eighty pages, but in this book I got so attached I found myself hanging onto the edge of my seat. This book keeps you hooked until the very last word. This story stands out from all the others because it encourages the imagination of all of its readers. It shows everyone that being different and standing out from the crowd is nothing bad and that just because some other people dont like your imagination doesnt mean that you should hide it from the rest of the world. I would advise it to readers of all ages. In the story a young boy named Jess trains everdyday all summer long to become the fastest runner in the whole fith grade. Then everything changes when a girl named Leslie Burke moves in nextdoor. It turns out that she also goes to the same school as him, but that she is an even faster runner than he is. on the first day of school she beats him in a race. At first he is very dissapointed, but then he actually gets to know her and begins to find out that he actually likes her alot. Jess and Leslie decide that they need to establish a place where the two of them can just go without any interruptions from the bullies at school or the family problems at home. Jess has four sisters two of which absolutely dispise him, one who is only just a baby, and one who admires him so much that she can never leave him alone. Jess' father is almost never home and shows no signs of affection towards his son. Leslie barely even knows her parents and she is always eager for a chance to find out more about them. Her parents are both writers and are always involved in creating a new story, leaving no time for them to be with Leslie. At school Jess, Leslie, and Jess' little sister May Bell are tortured by a school bully named Janice Avery. Leslies new writing teacher finds out what an extroidanary nack Leslie has for writting stories and comes to really like Leslie. Then the teacher gives out an assignment that involves watching a documentary on a specific man on t.v. Then Leslie raises her hand and tells the teacher that she does not posess a television. The kids at the school all make fun of Lesli for this issue. Finally after dealing with Janice for so long Leslie hears Janice crying in the bathroom. Leslie goes in to find out what is wrong. She convinces Janice to spill her beans, so to speak, and finds out that Janice is beaten at home by her father and that Janices 'friends' had embarresed her by spreading her secret around the whole school. Leslie cheers up Janice by telling her about how earlier in the year kids made fun of her for not owning a television. Also, Jess is distracted by his music teacher who he has a huge crush on. One Saturday morning the music teacher calls to inwite Jess to go to the museum with her. The idea of inviting Leslie crosses Jess' mind but he discardes it quickley eager to spend a day alone with his beautiful teacher. While Jess and the teacher are gone a terrible accident happens. When Jess arrives home he finds out that Leslie has drowned in the creek near Terabithia. Although Jess has a hard time getting over it he soon opens up his heart to his little sister May Bell and akes her the new queen of Terabithia."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"this was a gret book but sad. i almst cried. but it was still good. reccomendded for 4 and 5 graders."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I promptly cried for a half-hour straight after I'd read \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\" for the first time, but they were Good Tears. The narrative is tight, brilliant, and full of truth and beauty. Here's from my journal that day:\\"It was such a powerful story that any words I tried to use to describe it would fall so far short it wouldn't be worth the ink...if anyone reads these words and has not read \\"Terabithia,\\" You Should. And then just sit. You can cry if you want, or not, but just sit and think for a while...about Terabithia and what Jess is going to live for now. About being king or queen of Terabithia and defending the realm--defending the weak and protecting even the predators. Caring for the helpless and standing together for what is right. And most of all, never forgetting anything you learn that is worthwhile. Use it to be a blessing to others--that's why it was worth learning in the first place.\\"Those were my thoughts three years ago, and the magic has not worn off. Specifically, I loved the way Paterson showed the effect in the lives of \`real' kids of stories like C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. It was so true and so powerful.There is pain in this story, but it is good pain--the sort of pain that makes you stand up and go forward all the more boldly for the lump in your throat."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The novel, A Bridge to Terabithia, takes place in the 1940's in a small rural town where everyone knows everyone. The main character Jess Aarons becomes close friends with the new girl Leslie Burke. They become absolutely inseparable despite the fact that Leslie is different and isn't liked by many and plus she's a girl. The theme friendship and dealing with hardships runs throughout this novel.I rated this novel easily, with 5 stars. If I could I would give it more stars, that's how much I like this book. First of all it's really easy to read which makes it easier to focus on the plot instead of the difficult vocabulary found in many books. The book is approximately 150 pages long which is relatively short. The one thing about this novel that I really like is that unlike fantasy novels you can relate to the characters and themes in this book. The theme of friendship everyone can relate to. Everyone can relate to meeting your best friend for the first time and the exciting \\"adventures\\" you had with them as a child. Elementary school recess is also a theme in the book everyone can relate to. We all remember having recess where the boys played the sports and the girls talked or played their \\"girly\\" games. It was unheard of that the girls played with the boys. This book takes you back to your childhood and its nice to go back to your childhood every once in a while. Not only is this book a nostalgic easy read it also has a dramatic ending that will utterly shock you. So if you want a great book with a great story line and ending you should definitely read A Bridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Paterson."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I was a little bookworm as a kid and would sit in school daydreaming about when I could get home, run up to my bedroom, and read.

Together they create a magical kingdom where they can be themselves, applaud each others' talents, and escape the closed-minded world that fails to understand them. When Leslie suddenly leaves Jess' life, Jess realizes he has gained the confidence (with Leslie's help) to face the world on his own. He then passes Terabithia on to someone else who needs its \\"powers\\" the same way he did.

In the novel, Bridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Paterson, Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke become great friends and are close to becoming inseparatable until one rainy day, Jesse doesn't invite Leslie along on a trip and when he returns he finds himself lost in a terrible situation.He thinks of all the fun things they did together such as, building their very own, \\"Secret Kingdom.\\" He remembers all the mischievous schemes the two played on others; for example, when they write the note to Janice Avery pretending it is from a boy she has a crush on. From the very first day Jesse met Leslie, when she raced all the fifth grade boys and beat them at their little relay races during recess, until the last time he ever saw her, I'm sure she was the best friend Jesse had ever had. The last day he ever sees Leslie, when his music teacher, Miss Edmunds, whom he admires so and falls in love with, watching her long, beautiful black hair swish in the wind. On that day, Miss Edmunds calls Jesse to come on a trip to an art gallery. Jesse accepts and thinks of asking if Leslie can go, but he ends up not asking and worries that Leslie will go to Terabithia, their \\"Secret Kingdom.\\" That event is why Jesse lives the rest of his life miserably.

(Did I mention a GIRL beat him?) Her name is Leslie Burke, an only child and a real tom-boy.

The book itself is short and an easy read, but what the book really says to the reader is quite a bit bigger than its page count.

With the release ofthe recent film, I decided to revisit this children's classic. I unfortunately read it immediately after seeing the film, which stole a bit of the magic since the film was a generally faithful adaptation, leaving the book with few surprises.Let me highlight a few of the book-movie distinctions. The mother in the movie is much more sympathetic than she is in the book. (The moviemakers probably realized that one gruff parent was enough.) And yet, towards the end of the book, we finally begin to understand why the mother is how she is, and we feel sympathy and perhaps even some empathy. The father also ultimately opens up emotionally more in the movie than in the book. And Leslie, the main female protagonist, is much prettier in the movie than she is characterized in the book. (Filmmakers did the same inHoot: Let's sell a few more adolescent boy tickets!) Both media explore the magic of imagination, but the film does a particularly good job of visualizing that. Between the book and the movie, I was reminded of the power of make-believe and have - in the past few weeks - built much more make-believe into my play with my two-year-old son (to wonderfully fun effect).I listened to the unabridged audiobook narrated by Tom Stechschulte (published by Recorded Books). This took some getting used to, as I recently listened to Stechschulte narrate Cormac McCarthy's excellent but deeply darkThe Road. Bridge to Terabithia has some tragedy, but thankfully no apocalypse. The narration was very expressive and overall well done."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is a story of friendship, and how the ties that bind can make us stronger. Even in the face of tragedy, the human spirit is lifted up by the love and loyalty of a good friend. The book is, as most books are, much better than the movie. Since the movie is very good, that lets you know just how good this book must be. If you've seen the movie but have not read the book, I strongly encourage you to do so. If you are planning to watch the movie but haven't read the book, then make sure you read the book first. These two make a dynamic duo.Bridge to Terabithia"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"It is a little sad at the end but all good stories need conflict, a great book for your kids."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"When I took my kids to see this movie last year, I didn't have the slightest idea what it was about. And although I think I probably embarrassed the heck out of the kiddies by sobbing through part of it, it was a phenomenal movie. I very rarely read the book AFTER the movie, just because I hate to already know what is going to happen. But I'm glad I read this one!Jess Aarons is excited for the 5th grade to start. He's been running all summer so he can show everyone at recess that he is the fastest boy in the school. But things take an unexpected turn when the new kid is school turns out to be the fastest....and it's a girl!! Leslie Burke, a city kid that has moved to the country and just happens to be Jess' new neighbor, is different than the girls at Lark Creek Elementary. She dresses different, has short hair, and doesn't even own a TV! But once Jess gets to know her, they become inseparable. He finally finds a friend that understands his love of drawing.Leslie and Jess create a world of their own -- Terabithia, a magical world in which they are the rulers and no one else is allowed to enter. It is a Kingdom of giants (which are not-so-surprisingly similar to the bullies at school) and spirits. Terabithia is place for Leslie and Jess alone, and the only way to get there is swing across the river on a rope. But when tragedy strikes and Jess blames himself, even Terabithia can't protect him from the grief he feels.Paterson wrote this book based on personal experience. Her son David's best friend Lisa was killed in an accident when they were 8 years old. And this book was her tribute to both of them. I realize this book has been frequently \\"challenged\\" by parents. I can understand the reason, but I don't feel like children should be sheltered from this beautiful story. Yes, it is sad, but it is life. Children are more resilient than a lot of adults give them credit for, and I think this book could only be a benefit to them.When the movie was released, all the trailers showed depictions of the fantasy world that was really only in Jess and Leslie's imagination. I think it is unfair to mislead people into thinking this book is a high fantasy book. Because it's not. It's about friendship and love. It's about understanding yourself and learning to live with that understanding. And it's about loss. It is a beautiful, simple story that everyone should read, adults and children alike."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I saw the movie first... which got me interested enough to read the book. I really didn't expect to enjoy the movie, but it brought back a lot of interesting memories... always wanting to build some kind of fort, treehouse, or clubhouse. I think most kids do. The subject matter gets pretty heavy near the end, not what you usually find in children's literature, but it was well presented. The fact that the book has been in the mainstream for over 30 years now is a tribute to the quality of the writing."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The Newberry Award winning Bridge to Terabithia touches the heart as only a story influenced by real life experience can. The book is dedicated to the author's son David Paterson and his childhood friend Lisa Hill who was killed by a lightning strike. The book was written while the author was coming to terms with this tragic loss.Jesse Aarons is boy growing up in the 70's in a rural area outside of Washington D.C. that time forgot. He is the middle child of five, the other four children being girls who his mother appears to favor. He has an artistic nature which his father attempts to discourage as not fitting to a boy. Mr. Aarons is gone from dawn to dusk working in the city, leaving little time for his son who gets stuck doing all the farm work.About to enter the 5th grade, Jess is determined to be the fastest runner at Lark Creek Elementary School this year. Winning has become symbolic for everything he feels everyone expects from him. This dream is shattered when a new family moves in to the place next door.The new neighbors are city folk, the parents both writers who have decided that the city is no place to raise their child, Leslie. Leslie is just plain different. Disdained by the girls because she wears pants to school, Leslie enters the recess races traditionally designated for boys only and wins. When a classroom assignment forces Leslie to reveal the fact that her family has no television, Jess finds it in his heart to forgive her transgression and the two misfits become fast friends.With Leslie, Jess can be himself and he reveals his love of drawing to her. Leslie has a fertile imagination, no doubt inherited from her parents and tells stories that Jess just itches to draw. When Leslie decides that the woods need exploring, Jess swallows his fear of the place and together the pair creates the magical kingdom of Terabithia where they are King and Queen.Aside for his time with Leslie and recess, the only other thing Jess enjoys is their Friday music class. He has a crush on his teacher who is unique as well. The parents have labeled Ms. Edmunds a hippy because her appearance is different and the songs she teaches are often political in nature. Ms. Edmunds was the only other person besides Leslie that Jesse could show his drawings. She'd understood his need to draw and had even been complimentary.Days of rain has swollen the dry creek bed between their homes and their imaginary kingdom. Jesse who is unable to swim is consumed by fear of crossing the creek. The excuse he needs to avoid the situation comes when Ms. Edmunds offers him the chance to visit the National Gallery with her. The invitation makes Jess feel important and even though a little guilty about missing his playtime with Leslie and for not thinking to invite her along, he enjoys the day immensely.He expects to face the music when he gets home, but instead returns to unthinkable tragedy. Jess goes through all the stages of a person who has experienced a horrible loss, guilt, anger, and crushing grief and comes out on the other side a richer person for his experience. He has new insight when it comes to others and views his teacher, his family, and even the school bully with new eyes. He also realizes that in order for Terabithia to retain its magic it must be shared with others.This story reflects the joy and pain that all humans experience while growing up, finding our own identity and coping with those who would keep us from it. While the tragic aspect of the plot is painful to read, it brings home the fact that every friendship is precious and that even if short lived can profoundly affect the person we become. Jess and Leslie are every child, filled with imagination and living in a world of their own creation, one which can't be crushed by the mundane aspects of everyday life or even the tragic ones. They live in all of us.Note: the movie for the most part stays true to the book (David Paterson the author's son was one of the producers), some of the nuances are lost because the story is told as if it occurs in 2007 instead of the late 1970's, and some of the scenes have been changed but overall there was little poetic liscense take with the original text. I will admit that I cried more reading the book even though I knew what was going to happen. The movie though slow paced at times moved fairly quickly through Jesse's grief to the scene where he recreates Terabithia for his little sister. The imagery was beautiful. Nice touch making putting the school bully's face on the Terabithian giant!Reviewed by Leslie Tramposch for PNR Reviews"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book digs deep into the lives of two children just trying to make it in a world where everyone sees them as outcasts. The slow start to friendship is quite clear and gripping as we see Jesse struggle with his ability to allow a girl, someone that beats him at something he is supposed to be the best at, enter his life and transform his world.This is a great book about a friendship that goes slowly, and ends too quickly. Wonderful fantasy lies within which will surely make your children want to create their own Terabithia."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I absolutely love the movie, but I didn't read the novel until later. It works in different ways, but it's excellent! The movie develops certain story threads more than the book, and I love the changes, but it's fairly faithful to the original, which is still a moving story. It's easy to see why this book has become such a perennial favorite among readers."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is a great book for all kids to read. It is a story of friendship and imagination. We liked this book because it kept our class' attention and we didn't want to stop reading it until the end. We recommend that you read this book if you want to be entertained and amazed. It is better then the movie because you get to make up your own idea of what Terabithia looks like. In the movie you only get to see what the movie makers imagination is."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to TerabithiaWhat would you do if there was an imaginary world with imaginary creatures in it?The name of this book is Bridge to Terabithia. The author is Katherine Paterson. This type of book is a thrilling adventure book about a magical kingdom that helps Jess and Leslie through their problems.This book takes place in a little town outside of Washington D.C. also in the magical kingdom of TerabithiaJess and Leslie meet when Leslie moved right next to Jess. The two main characters are Jess and Leslie. They go into the woods and find an imaginary world. Leslie has a big imagination and Jess is a shy laid back person and a hard worker.I really like how the author was very descriptive. She described Terabithia like the castle and the warriors.I think people over nine and up should read it because there is a twist in Jess's life. I really like this book a lot it is very descriptive and doesn't give away the ending.So, if you like adventure books and you want to go to an imaginary world with creatures, then you'd like Bridge to Terabithia!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I fell in love with this book when I first read it ten years ago. It feels nice getting a new copy though as all my old ones were falling apart."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is an amazing book. It give you a chance to see that your really don't have to go along with the crowd. It's ok to be different. This book has so many moods that change often throughout the book. The story has two main characters. There is a boy named Jesse and a girl named Leslie. Jesse lives on a farm with his Mom, Dad, and four sisters. Leslie lives with her Mom and Dad. Jesse has trained all summer to be the fastest runner in fifth grade. The day of the big race Leslie asks if she can run. She ends up winning her heat and beats Jesse. Leslie is new to the school and has trouble making friends. Finally Jesse and Leslie begin to talk at home and go for a walk. They find a spot in the forest near their homes. They decide to make it a make-believe place where they can go and hang out. They call it Terabithia. For a Christmas present Jesse gives Leslie a dog. She names it Prince Terrien (P.T for short). Leslie gives Jesse a paint set because he loves to draw but doesn't have the supplies he needs. At their school there is a girl named Janice Avery who is the school bully. My favorite part was when Jesse and Leslie write a fake note to Janice telling her a boy likes her. They tell her to miss the bus so the boy can walk her home. As the bus pulls away from the school they see Janice standing there waiting. A few days later Leslie finds out that Janice's dad beats her, and she can't do anything about it. Leslie feels guilty. Towards the end of the book, Jesse gets to go on a trip to the Art Museum with his teacher. When he returns he finds out that Leslie fell while trying to go to Terabithia, hit her head and died. He runs out of the house and to Leslie's home. He can't believe that his best friend is gone. He is so upset that he throws his art set into the river. At the end of the book Jesse builds a bridge from the bank near his house to the bank were Terabithia is. The very last thing he does is takes his little sister across to Terabithia. He bends down and asks her if she can hear what the people are saying. He then tells her that everyone is saying the next Queen of Terabithia is coming."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites! Yes it is sad, but the capture of their relationship and the atmosphere of the time frame it is set in are so right-on. Kids can relate to being bullied and wanting to escape from the real world and the problems associated with it. Using it for teaching is perfect - Paterson's use of simile, metaphor, personification, imagery, onomatopoeia, ... the list goes on and on. Don't base your decision on the movie (horrible interpretation). Go straight to the source and buy this book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Well written great classic book!

The author took risks with a rich payoffs. Tragedy leads to growth and understaning as we learn that even the \\"mean\\" teacher is a person of depth, character, emotion, and substance.

The power of imagination! The pathos! A young boy growing up poor among a gaggle of sisters is introduced to other worlds (imaginary Terebithia, and the real world of culture, art and literature)when a new girl moves in next door.This is a book that has stuck with me through the years. When we moved to a new house and found a delapidated little bridge crossing the creek behind it I instantly dubbed it 'The Bridge to Terebithia'. Which was only funny b/c, being a foot off the ground, I was fairly sure it wouldn't send anyone tumbling to their death. So, it's been about a quarter century since I've last the read the book. There are parts of it that are fairly dated (crazy hippies!), but I still enjoyed the read. And I still teared up a little with the protagonist's death (which is not directly described, so you read about the reactions to it, but not the actual drowning). For children 8-10 years and up."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"cool book until his friend dies on the rope swing.I reccomend this book for ages 9-15.I really feel bad for the boy because she was the only friend he had."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I was a sensitive kid (I hated watching Road Runner and Trix commercials because of the unfairness of it all). I played with a pack of little boys, and I knew the worst thing that could happen to a person was for someone to see you cry. When friends were reading Bridge to Terabithia and reporting it as a sad, sad story, but very, very good, I ran away from it as hard as I could. We even played Terabithia in the woods together and I pretended not to mind not knowing the back story. Now I wish I hadn't waited 30 years to read this book. There's pain here, true, but also beauty and the hidden memory of what it was like to be 10 years old. I would recommend this book to anyone, even those who always wanted to give a cartoon rabbit a long-in-coming bowl of breakfast cereal."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is a book which has a message that will stick with you for a long time. The characters, the plot, the setting... everything was so real to me. I felt like I was right there with the 2 main characters in Terabithia. As a child, I too was always making up my own imaginary world to escape the bullies in life, so I really could understand how the characters felt.Yes, there is a tragedy at the end, not to spoil it. Although, I was sad this had to happen... think of all the good books and movies there are that have some type of tragedy within them. They may make us sad, yet usually their message sticks with us in a positive manner. We grow and learn from tragedy when we read and in reality... just like the main character in this book did.Yes, the book will make you cry... but if a book is that powerful to bring that much emotion to a reader, then you know the author has done his/her job. In this case, the author truly created a powerful story and an imaginary world in which we all can believe in. Open your imagination and escape to Terabithia (or your own world)... sometimes that's exacty what it takes to get through life and tragedy. Just like the main character here.This a book I could read over and over... and always come away with a new and powerful lesson."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"A Review of Bridge to TerebithiaBridge to Terebithia is a story that I first came to love based on the movie. After having watched it for the third time recently, I decided to buy the Kindle version of the book. I was moved by portrayals of Jess and Leslie and their friendship at 10 years of age that dove deep quickly and impacted them both well beyond normal friendships. Jess is presented as a boy who is an outcast and who is picked on due to his poverty and his interests. Into the sadness of his existence at both home and school rushes this girl his age named Leslie. While at first disinterested, he warms to her and she opens his life and mind well beyond his own creativity and dreams. The book marries together youthful friendship, perhaps even the love between friends, and tragedy that becomes redemptive in such a compelling way. While Leslie never becomes a popular girl, her impact upon Jess, Jess's family, the teachers and students of Lark Creek Elementary is huge. You will not be disappointed by this children's book by Katherine Paterson.[...]"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book definitely deserves five stars. It's both heart warming AND fun.

How many of us didn't have a secret place to call our own when we were children? Many of the readers may very well have grown up in a rural area, so the setting may have seemed very familiar to them.

It is a non fiction book by Katherine Paterson. If you like to imagine things and have a great imagination this book is right for you. Katherine Paterson did a good job explaining the book and gave great details. This book is about a boy named Jesse and a girl named Leslie. One day they were having a race down the street and came to the woods. They kept going farther into the woods. They came to a rope that went across the stream and wanted to swing on it so they did. Then they came to an old tree house and decided to make it better. So they brought food and came every day. Then one day Leslie said,\\" Do you see that huge alive tree! \\" they started fighting it and imagined a ton of other stuff. When they imagined stuff they can do what ever they want. So they came every day and improved their tree house and fought off all the creepy creatures they imagined. Well the ending is so sad I can't even tell you.

Once again if you have good imagination Bridge to terabithia is the perfect book for you!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Since I grew up the only boy in a family with an absentee Dad, a domineering Mother and three very feminine sister, I can definitely relate to the frustrations of the main character named Jess. I even had the little sister who followed me around and made a pest of herself. I grew up in the beautiful country side of New England circa 1950. Yes, I even had the thousand acre woods, meadows and the orchards to play make believe in. So a lot of this story resonates on a gut level with me. Especially the inner family bickering and lack of respect for the male heir.The idea of these circumstances in story form, appealed to me, but I found this story is more of a character study with a story cleverly woven around it. It deals with the need to escape from the family, the dad who is a failure and can barely provide, the mother that is overly lenient with the girls, the sisters that stifle Jess's life.A new neighbor Leslie changes everything for Jess. She's from a successful family, she is worldly and educated because of her circumstances and station in life. In fact none of the kids (or teachers) at Jess's school have ever met anyone like Leslie.The story unfolds about these two lonely kids. They're lonely for different reasons, but nonetheless desperate for real companionship.They build a tiny hut in their wooded area and call it their magical land. And it is magical to them because there in Terabithia they can be kids or the king or queen and not be embarrassed by the reality of their world.There is a lot about life to see in this well written book, with it's \\"down-home\\" style.Why the authors chose to end this story with the death of one of the principal characters is disturbing. I thought we were really getting some place with this audacious story that we would learn more about life but instead we are forced to examine the effects of the death of a loved one.Perhaps there is a fundamental fascination with death among humans. And perhaps there is something for us to examine about life, love, family and the end of time for some in this story.I'd rather read something that is uplifting to my spirit. I see too much death and have lived through too much sorrow to want to dwell on it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone.

Although it was written about children and probably for children, adults too can read this book and be touched by the story it offers.

In fact, I can't recall any book I've read having a shorter list of flaws. Writing a more polished book than this Bridge to Terabithia could prove to be an impossible task. Aside from the large number of names the book mentions, and the one or two unusual jokes about perverted acts, this book is incredibly well-written in every single way. It seems to me the inspiration behind the movie \\"My Girl.\\"Jess is a kid that likes to run and likes to draw, although his love of running isn't mentioned much toward the end of the book. He becomes friends with his new neighbor Leslie, a stereotypical tomboy kind of girl with an unexpected amount of talent. She seems to be good at everything she does and Jess just likes to be around her. Deep, DEEP friendship is the heart and soul of this novel, and it's really wonderful to read about. Jess and Leslie eventually develop their whole lives around each other, even going so far as to create a secret place only they know about.Gosh, this book reminded me so much of when I was a kid. I remember having a very best friend I hung out with every day. And I remember exploring wooded areas hoping to discover something neat. I even remember playing King of the Mountain, which is mentioned only briefly in the text.When you read the chapter headings and find the chapter \\"No!\\" after \\"The Perfect Day\\" you can quickly deduce where the novel's heading. Darn shame really, but that's where all the powerful emotion comes in. Drama at its best. I particularly like Jess's belief that the \\"No!\\" event was all a dream - one he temporarily forgets.There's some subtext addressing Biblical doubt that I don't care too much for, but it does play an important part in the book. Nothing is forced, really, it's just that alternate viewpoints are presented.The few drawings in the book are very good, particularly the one in the last chapter. That one picture seems to sum up the wonderful message of the entire book. It sure makes me appreciate my kinfolk more. (This book does have southern elements by the way, especially with the metaphors at the beginning.)We all want a friend like Leslie - someone we love more than everyone else in the world put together. Gosh, what a powerful story this is. Hopefully the Disney film adaptation of the book will be of the same great quality as their watered-down animated musicals based on literary classics."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The book &quot;Bridge To Teribithia&quot; was overall fantastic! Jess' longing to be the fastest runner in the fifth grade in the beginning is, I must say dull compared to the heroic tale that comes later in the story. But it is made up with such detail that it is still good. Jess is tired of his family: his big sisters tease him, his little sister looks up to him (a little too much), his youngest sister won't do any thing but pester, and his parents are no help. His father is always away and his mother is always either nagging or asking Jess to do some chore. So when he decides to try and beat the fastest runner in the school, it is a distraction from home. Then Leslie moves in next door and decides to run with the boys. Jess finds himself sticking up for Leslie even though she beats him. Jess and Leslie become friends despite cries of &quot;Who's your girlfriend Jess?&quot; Jess is shy at first, shaking off the good feeling of friendship. Then Leslie brings him to a clearing in the woods. She creates a magical land where you must swing across a gully on a magic rope. At first Jess just sees an empty space. Then Leslie makes him more magical by shedding some of her own magic. Then a tragedy occurs that leaves Jess heart broken. Can he go on living with this new heavy burden?Even though the story is very sad, it is full of courage. It was the creative plot that hooked me.The author's supurb details gave the story even more body.

Adults gave it the Newberry, and the touching story has caused many, many teachers to assign it to their classes. As a work of fiction written in a style for juveniles but for an adult audience, it is a complete success.But by the vast majority of children assigned to read it WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE READING LEVEL AGE RANGE (7-9), this book is viewed with either loathing or confusion. As a child, I felt that it was going for a cheap emotional payoff. Most of my classmates were either baffled or simply hated it with the passion that only the young can have. It wasn't entertaining, moving, poignant, sweet, or significant. To them, it was simply offensive.It isn't as if the children don't understand about death. But death--REAL death--has no place in children's games. If people die, it is only as characters, and then the next round, they spring to life again. Death is something that happens in the real world, but children shut it out of their idealized make-believe. In their pretend world, good triumphs over evil--however often this isn't the case in the real world.A Bridge to Terabithia breaks all of those childhood rules. And so children, as a whole, heartily reject it.This is a lovely book to read as an angst-ridden preteen or adolescent or as an adult. It is not a book that is at all enjoyed by the vast majority of children. It is one of a number of books, like The Velveteen Rabbit, that adults think children ought to like rather than what they actually do care for."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book takes place at a small town in the 70s. Bridge to Terabithia is about a boy namedJess. He is about to start fifth grade when a girl named Leslie who looks like a boy and starts to irritate Jess at first but then he starts to like her and become best friends. Later on they create a place called Terabithia.The author uses many similes in the book, for instance, after Jess runs, Brenda says \\"your smelly like a pig\\". Another instance when Leslie is late for class, Jess half expected her to \\"run like the coyote on Road Runner\\". The author writes the book as a third person point of view. This book is also very enrapturing. Katherine Paterson uses words to paint pictures in your mind. To me, that's the kind of writing that I like.I recommend that you do read this book because it has some action and has a few memorable parts to it. It also has a little drama near the end of the book. There are parts that will make you laugh and there are others that are sad, over all, it's a very good book.

Such a great novel, absolutely enchanting, imaginative, returned me to my own childhood because there were so many similarities, and then....everything gets ruined. Sometimes the tragedy is not in proportion and it overweighs the accomplishments of the entirety of what came before it. Yes, I know that happens in real life, and yes, I'm not saying it's invalid to do the same thing in literature, but I AM saying that in this case, to end as it did, the darkness here swallowed the light and destroyed a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"It is always interesting to read the story from which a movie was made.That is why I purchased this book and the book always adds something towhat the movie presented."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is only the second review I've written at amazon, also for a book I read in ~sixth grade.

He is the only boy in a family of girls. His dad is a hard worker but has little time or energy for his son. Jesse's escape from the doldrums comes in the form of Leslie, a young girl who moves into the farmhouse next door. Leslie introduces Jesse to the world of make believe and offers friendship that he has not known. Leslie's friendship has a significant impact on Jesse, and they become best friends creating the magical Terabithia together in a little \\"house\\" they build beyond the creek.The book shares some stories with Jesse and Leslie - with their families and at school. As their friendship grows, Jesse returns from an outing with his favorite teacher to learn that Leslie has drowned. Jesse's family all of a sudden has to care for him in his mourning, something that does not come easily or well. Jesse processes the death as best as he can and interprets Leslie's life and death as something of an angelic visitation.This book was understood and appropriate for my 3rd grade daughter who took it in stride and asked a few questions. Some of the writing is dated and contains what might be called \\"progressive\\" parenting by Leslie's parents v. the old-fashioned traditional parenting by Jesse's parents. These are interesting nuances that young readers will probably not pick up. The book also challenges superficial religion too I think.It is a good book but does not stand out as a great one.

I would not recommend this product."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I did a movie review which was deleted; here it is in print form of this marvelous adventure:Terebithia was a magical land which took shape after Leslie Burke moved to yet another school where she didn't fit in. Prettier than the popular cheerleaders, but too different to be accepted, she'd had to live in a fantasy world all ehr own as no one had ever had the time to listen. She was harassed by the nasty girls who would turn into people like the agitator at the last movie. She observed that her neighbor was treated badly by the bullies on the playground and on their school bus. She sat beside him so they'd leave him alone.There's nothing like first love as they transformed an old tree house out in the woods into a magical kingdom of which Leslie was the leader. Both ran like Forrest Gump as they departed the real world of violence on the school bus. The bridge was a hanging rope which they used a la Tarzan on his jungle vines. I wondered how the dog PT got across the flooded creek.As time went by, they became good friends but one day he took a field trip to a museum in the city without letting Leslie know. It was an unexpected treat, an opportunity he could not turn down. Though they were now close emotionally, he kept the trip secret like males tend to do, and he wasn't there when fate played its dirty trick.The founder of Terebithia went alone to their playground but the \\"bridge\\" broke. Jess felt guilty because he'd been too selfish to invite her along. Had fate been different, he would have taken her to the museum to show off his knowledge and experience. The oen time he wasn't there at a critical moment, she slipped and drown; when Zach took us to see the circus in Huntsville, Alabama, a friend of mine slipped away into oblivion and her mean daughter pulled the plug. Jess went into denial and missed her constantly. She'd been his sunshine and inspiration, and he just could not \\"let go.\\"When an unexpected death hits us, it helps to remembe the good about the person who now is gone. My tribute to Bob Lobertine prompted by a callous state trooper's critical remark -- a letter to the Nashville Tennessean saying we should remember the good about a prominent person and let the bad die with him. Hold on to your loved one's specialness to keep it alive.

I love this book because Katherine Paterson really went wild, funky, and extremely adventurous. This book keeps you interested if you really get into it.The title of course is Bridge to Terabithia.

They are the only ones who know about Terabithia and the only ones who can go in Terabithia. Jess and Leslie are the King and Queen of the Terabithians. Leslie only uses her imagination to build Terabithia. The bridge to Terabithia is a rope, and they have to swing over it on to the other side to get in. Jess and Leslie have fears in the real world. If you want to find out what happens in the book read it.Where do you think the setting is? It is in Terabithia and at Jess's school! The plot is Jess and Leslie make this kingdom. They both can't fight the bullies in the real world. Leslie is definitely a protagonist; she has blonde hair and brown eyes, and she always has her mind set to run wild. Jess is a protagonist too! He has brown hair and brown eyes, and he has a deep soul. Katherine Paterson has zany, sad, and adventurous writing in her books.I recommend this book to anyone who is up to it will love it. I would give this book a rating of four and a half stars.

The story affected me as deep if not deeper than it did when I was 8. This book is a must read for voracious readers as well as reluctant ones.

It was the fist day back at school and all the kids were racing Jess thought he would be the fastest but, he was beaten buy Leslie. You are probably wondering why it is called the Bridge to Terabithia.

The text was simple but yet so moving and beautiful, showing us the life as it really is, full of happiness and sorrow. I felt like I bounded with the characters, I felt like Leslie and Jesse were my friends in real. I have to admit though, that this book shouldn't be read by any younger age than 12. Because I don't think fourth/fifth graders are mature enough to understand f.ex. Jesse's relationship with his father and his friend's death. I think the author did so well because of some tragedy she based on the book from her real life. Somewhere I read that her son lost his best friend the same way Jesse did. I have never read a book that stays so long within me, I feel for sorrow every time I think of the last chapters in the book, and happiness every time I think of the wonderful relationship Jesse and Leslie had.

I know where that special tree is alive and well, and it grows in Terabithia.Terabithia is a mystical land that only those with imaginative eyes can see, and only sixth graders Jess and Leslie know about it. In this secret sanctuary, which they created for themselves in the woods, they can be and do anything. Here they are King and Queen. Outside of Terabithia, they are just a pair of social-misfit best friends.I connected instantly to this tale because I WAS Jess as a child. The relationships of Jess with his sisters and parents is all too familiar, and the author paints a vividly realistic picture of a gifted child who suffers in a troubled home. His family struggles financially to make ends meet, and as the only boy, he is expected to work harder than his siblings and remain tough, accepting whatever misdirected anger comes his way without question. When Jess meets Leslie, the new neighbor, he is surprised to find a girl who doesn't conform to any standards of girlish behavior. Leslie isn't shy, she loves to take risks, and she has the confidence to rise above other's opinions. Best of all, she has a rich imagination that inspires the creative side of Jess's mind, which was not allowed to blossom anywhere else.Through Jess and Leslie's friendship, both of them develop into children with a wisdom beyond their years. Their adventures in the woods are not just an escape from reality, but a chance to explore who they really want to be as practice for encountering real-life challenges. When a tragedy separates them at the end of the story, Jess learns that no matter how much pain you may face in life, no one can take your power to dream away from you. Although intended for pre-teens and young adults, this classic story holds valuable truths for people of all ages.-Joy Sydney Williams (author)"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Good book.

The journey that you embark on with its main protagonist changes you, and makes you grow along with him. Overall its story arc and adventure make it an endearing classic that is a must read.

I don't know why, but somewhere along the way as I grew up, I heard of this book, and I somehow gained the impression that it was a fantasy novel, where these two kids travel to a magical land. Granted, Jess and Leslie do travel to a magical land, they only do so through their imagination. So while I was thinking this was a fantasy novel, it is a realistic fiction one. So uh. That kind of ruined the book for me. Big time. One of the first comments I made after figuring this out is one that I have made for Newbery winners repeatedly: \\"Is this a popular book because kids like it, or is it a popular book because teachers like it as a tool for analysis?\\" Having finished it, I think one would be hard pressed to a find a child who really loved this book, and instead would find teachers who love it, because of exactly what I said. Considering that this book was read by me for an environmental lit class, obviously it's a favorite for teachers. It's a very dry book, with not much action until the very [depressing and hard to handle emotionally] end. There is some language in this book that is objectionable and has supposedly led to the book being banned, although many argue that the bannings are more for the \\"controversial\\" religious content. The foreshadowing in this book is painfully bad. I did really love hearing some of the sentiments expressed in this book, particularly Leslie's views, but in the end, not a fan of it. May Belle's role at the end of the book and just the ending in general are too convenient, and the big climax just ticks me off.side note: See the cover?

His parents depend on him and seem to take being able to do so for granted. All Jess wants as a new school year starts in his rural Virginia town is to prove himself the faster runner in fifth grade, something for which he has spent the summer training. So what happens on the first day of classes? A girl beats him, that's what. His new neighbor, Leslie Burke, who wants to be his friend and has no idea how to fit in among the other youngsters in her new school.At first Jess does not want to be her friend anymore than do the others, because Leslie seems just as alien to him. His father has to work in the city and farm part time, and money always runs short. Money's not a problem for Leslie's parents, though. Both are successful writers who can live and work anywhere. They've moved to the country, into the old farm next to that of the Aarons family, because it better suits their values than the city life they had before. Leslie's differences intrigue Jess, although unwillingly at first; and when he allows himself to get acquainted with her, he finds in her an unlikely soulmate. For carefully though Jess hides it from his schoolmates, and from most adults as well, Jess is a gifted artist who longs to develop his talent and who shares Leslie's soaring imagination.The two children christen a nearby woodland Terabithia, and imagine it to be a kingdom where they reign as king and queen. Terabithia can only be entered by swinging across a gully on a rope. It is their place, a secret between friends who quickly come to depend on each other - and then tragedy strikes. How can Jess survive having the gift of Leslie's friendship taken away from him? And does this mean the magic of Terabithia has gone out of his life forever?This is an amazing book. It wasn't published until I was already an adult, so I can only imagine how it would have affected me when I was in its target (9 - 12) age group; but I suspect I would have thrown myself into whole-hearted identification with its protagonist. What child with an imagination could fail to do so? The author paints a poignant yet unsentimental portrait of childhood the way it really is, not the way an adult might like to remember it with all the painful parts forgotten. The lessons Jess learns about himself and about his family are costly ones, and Jess's parents also learn a few lessons of their own. Superb!--Reviewed by Nina M.

This friendship strenghtens into a beautiful relationship and a closeness between to children you don't often read about these days. Tragedy strikes and young Jess experiences one of the most painful aspects of life and begins his journey into growing up. The subject covered in the story may be heavy for some children so it would be a nice book to read together. Be prepared for tears and have a box of tissues handy. It's a great book for families to discuss some sensitive issues in life."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"In the Bridge to Terabithia Jess is a 5th grade boy who loves to run.

This started a great friendship between Leslie and jess, which was full of excitement, sadness, and adventure."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Very striking emotions run throughout the story.... through a gamut of challenges that most children face. What great fun it is for any child to share a secret with a friend and let their imaginations run wild. Jess's final emotional challenge is awfully strong for a children's book and hits a caring reader pretty hard. There is probably a lot of debate as to whether the author might have come up with a more 'easier on the senses ' climax.... very well written, nonetheless."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The Bridge to Terabithia is a wonderful, but sad story.

So will you!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The book Bridge to Terabithia is a story of two friends with a world all their own. Jess, the first of the two, is a shy kid with some dreams and ambitions. Leslie is a tomboy with a big imagination, and fast. On the first day of school, she proves herself faster than any of the boys in third, fourth and fifth grades. Although Jess was shy of her at first, once they became friends almost nothing could seperate them. It is Leslie with her imagination who comes up with the idea to create a coutry just for them, with them as the rulers of it. Jess readily agrees with her, and they build a 'castle' across the stream in the woods. Leslie names their country Terabithia. Together, both of the friends have some excititing experiances. Then, after months of close friendship, the two are seperated for good. It is hard for Jess to learn to accept the fact that he will never see Leslie again, until he realizes that she gave him so much, and he needs to return it to the world.I thought that this book was a fairly good book, although the setting was very different from my own home. Most of the charectors are unjust, not at all like my life. I especially liked Jess and Leslie's charectors, and I would recomend this book to people who enjoy reading about every-day life with a little fantasy mixed in."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this for the first time in fifth grade.

The book explains a wonderful friendship that develops between Jess and Leslie and the adventures that they make-believe in their imaginary world- Terabithia. They fight magical dragons and hold grand feasts in their castle where the lord and lady dwell. What an incredible coming-of-age book. I searched and searched for this book after having read it about 10 years ago, I'm so glad I found it and reread it, my son will read this book and I hope he loves it just as much as I did."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"No one should miss the heart-warming story this author offers. It's a Newbury, which doesn't always guarantee a great read, but this one does. It's a bit sad, but the story is so warm-hearted and full of friendship, that I highly recommend it to the slightly older elementary crowd. It does deal with the death of a child, so some parents may want to beware of that, however, it should by no means stop them from buying the book. The death is dealt with in such a beautiful, heartfelt way, that it is a great book for a child who has just had a loss in their life. I cannot stress enough what a great book this is."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia explores the joys of discovery and pains of growing up through a timeless story about a friendship that has it's share of both. This book is an essential piece of literature for anyone to own. Katherine Paterson handles the content matter and her characters with a passion and warmth that flows through each chapter. She shows a great understanding of a young child's mind. It is through this understanding, and the honesty and simplicity of her words that she enables us to experience a vast three dimensional world that is easy to relate to and not ridiculously out of grasp. I would recommend if you have children, to some day plan on reading this to them or giving it to them to read. It delicately introduces a subject matter that we might not want to deal with but inevitably have to confront.It is a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I loved this book.

I liked this book because it shows how close you have to keep your friends near. The lesson is for every action there is an opposite but equal reaction. Meaning, in every good but bad action, it may seem good for you but hurt you in the end. To learn more about this book go to your local libary and pick up this book. You probably wont want to put it down until the end the very end."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I must say, this is one of the few realistic books I have read in awhile.I love how it shows that life is constantly going up and down, up and down, that it's not just all one big lollypop land where everything turns out good in the end.I don't know about other kids, but when I was younger, I understood this book. Now even that I am older, I understand it more.It's touching. It sets the real mood, of the real world.

I have not read it since, and I am now in my mid-twenties. I don't think that I could ever bear to pick it up again, simply because of the crushing emotional weight that this work has wrought onto my heart.As I was a very intelligent and awkward child, this book was one of many that helped to shape not only my childhood years, but the person that I came to be. I read voraciously when I was younger, because fantasy seemed to be the only escape I had from never quite fitting in. Much like the King and Queen of Teribithia, the fantasy worlds I wove in my imagination were much more real and important than the everyday shadows and dust we live. Much like them, too, I learned what love and loss were at an early age.The fact that there are over 300 reviews of this book, with others pouring out their hearts as well should attest to its importance. No child who loves to imagine and needs a friend should be without this book. Teribithia was part of the blade that shaped my adult persona, and I will never forget the experience. Please... share this book with your children... but read it yourself, as well."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"When I first saw the title of the book, I thought it'd be a really boring book about a farm or something near a bridge but one day in 5th grade(6 years ago) I decided to read it and as I did, a new world appeared before me, Terabithia.

Well in Katherine Paterson's Bridge to Terabithia Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke don't. When Jess and Leslie aren't doing chores or at school they are in Terabithia.Terabithia is........Terabithia is a magical land that Jess and Leslie created. Terabithia was created when Jess and Leslie came home from school ran into the woods and found a rope. The rope is on a tree by a creek. They decided that when you swing across the rope you've entered Terabithia. Jess and Leslie also don't have the best lives at school. They both get picked on by a girl named Janice Avery. Janice is the girl that makes everyone at school pay a $1.00 to use the bathroom. After Jess and Leslie created Terabithia they became very close. After they came into each others lives, they were both a lot happier. Does Jess's life stay great or go back to being not so good?Do you like it??I love this book it is one of my favorite. I've also seen the movie and surprisingly it follows the book. Reading isn't my favorite subject at school. I like it, but I don't love it. That book changed my mind quickly. For example when Jess thought that he would be the fastest kid in fifth grade. But that didn't happen. This book made reading very enjoyable. When I first picked the book up and started reading I wasn't sure I was going to even like it. But a few moments and chapters later I had different thoughts. I couldn't take my eyes out of it they were practically glued with an unbreakable force field. Another reason I love this book is because it teaches you something.Lesson LearnerBridge to Terabithia can teach you about friendship. For example, in the beginning of the book Jess didn't want to have anything to do with Leslie just because she was a girl. Then Leslie starts to come down to the field to race and begins to win over all of the boys. Jess came in second. He also thought Leslie was crazy. But they started to get to know each other when Leslie kept sitting by Jess on the bus. Sitting on the bus with each other made them closer by the two of them talking and finding that they both have similar interests. Also because Leslie wouldn't leave Jess alone.If you're looking for a good read......If you need a good book to read then go grab Bridge to Terabithia off the shelf because it's a five star book and I promise you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Jesse Oliver is young boy with dreams of becoming the top runner in his school, but when he meets Leslie Burke, his whole life changes from dull to exciting!

He begs Leslie not to go anymore also, after all the rope was getting weak."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This review is geared towards parents thinking of getting this book for their younger children. I bought it for my 8 year old son and decided to read it before I gave it too him. I will be holding onto it for a few years. First, unlike the commercials for the movie (I grant you I have not seen the movie only the ads), this is not an action/adventure story of travel to a magical land, i.e., Narnia or Secrets of Droon. It is a story of the friendship between two kids who do not quite fit in with the rest of the world. Terabitha is a special place for the 2 friends where they pretend they are rulers. They do not even spend much of the book there, although its an important part of the story. Mostly it is about their life at home and at school.Second, it is not a book for kids who still believe in Santa Claus, as there are a few passages that may spoil that belief.Lastly, this is a very sad book. I knew going in (based on other reviews) that this was a sad book about a tragic death, however, I thought it might be somewhat suger-coated since this is a children's book. It was not. Even from an adult perspective, it was one of the saddest books I have ever read.Overall, I thought the book was a poignant story of friendship, loss and dealing with that loss, which I did think was done well. I recommend waiting until your child is ready for such a tragic lesson."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is an awesome book of friendship by Katherine Paterson!

Sometimes at recess I read about kids racing on foot, that is something I like to do, but I mostly like challenges of anything. This is a very interesting story because theres a bully in it. The last thing I like about this story is the way she organizis the chapters and I also like the names of the characters.Somethings I don't like are that Jesse and Leslie both have a big imagination together, and that Jesse has two annoying sisters which I hate little annoying sisters plus theres something I don't understand because I don't remember reading about a bridge.I recomend for kids to read this book for education and that this book doesn't have enough violence, I give it two stars."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book was one of the best books I have ever read.

It was filled with tons of wonderful and adventurious jurnies! In the book, Jess Arrons wan's to be the fastest kid in the fourth and fifth grades! He practices every day to be it! When the big day finnaly comes, a girl named,Lelsie Burk comes and beats him. Now, Jess is very upset but they find out that they are a perfect friends! On their way home, on the bus, the bully...Janice...makes fun of Lelsie and Jess standes up for her.They decide after that, that they want to be friends! They spend everyday after school hidding out in their hide-out called...Terebithia. They have to swing on a magical rope to get to it! They built it them selves and no one else knows about it. Jess was the loyal King and Leslie was the pretty Queen! Well, back at school, Jess' favorite teacher, Miss. Edmunds, has a bond with jess and Lelsie. When Jess was at home, he got a phone call from Miss. Edmunds. She wanted him to go to Washington with him. So they went and had a great time. When Jess got back, he got the news that Lelsie had died. His best and only friend at school, his girlfriend, his companion and his soal mate! He knew he should have asked if Leslie could come with him and Miss. Edmunds to go to Washington...but he didn't! He was hurt soooooooooooo badly that he went to Terebithia and amde a wreath and a funeral that only he,Jess, attended! Just as he started to walk out...He heard his second youngest sister, May Belle's voice. She had followed him to Terebithia but wasn't supposed to. Jess said... &quot; I think you may be the next Queen of Terebithia!&quot; This book had many high points and low points. This book I think is 6th grade through 8th grade leval. This is my review of...The Bridge to Terebithia!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book for the first time in 5th grade, and just when I thought I couldn't love the story enough, I read it again in 6th grade. Since then, I have opened this book up and read it from beginning to end twice more in the past eight years. Katherine Patterson wrote what I call a &quot;very simple story&quot;, but the reason why it appeals to so many people is because it is written in a way that draws readers of all ages into it. The creative world of Terabithia is something I'm familiar with (I am quite creative myself, and write stories too) and the story about the relationship between Jess and Leslie is so unforgettable that it will stay with you the rest of your life. Leslie's death was sure enough an unexpected twist to the plot, but that really shows life down to the bloody reality. Death is often always shocking and unexpected, and most times is never foreshadowed in our lives. The pain that Jess endured in having to grips with this tragedy makes him a brave young man, and it certainly is something all people should relate to. This book makes you value the friendships you have, love the family you have, and makes you realize that death reaches out for its next victim with no consideration for the ripple effects it creates. Just like that, one you love, or like a lot, may be taken away in the blink of an eye. Young Jess dealt with that, and the book had an ending somewhat dark but full of hope, even though you knew that far after the story ended, he was still grieving about the loss of this special friend. For all readers, read this book with no prejudice, and open your mind to it. Within its pages are many lessons we should learn. Let it sprinkle your imagination with the magic that it has done to me. This is a book for the ages, to be read and studied by all."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Such a good story. I would recommend for age groups of 8-10. I absolutely love this story so much!! But it does say Danm and hell and God"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I believe this book did a great job portraying the two, very different, children. Each with an amazing imagination that creates a mystical land, Terabithia, that they rule as King and Queen. This land represents a lot of turmoil going on in the lives of these two children, and is a great escape to try and forget about the everyday hardships of a growing child.The dialogue was beautifully written. I wished for more details about Terabithia but that is left to the readers' imaginations. I didn't want to put it down and would suggest this book to most readers, young and old."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is such a cute book and a must read!! It's now one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"It's not all books written about and fir children that can keep adults captivated as well, this one sure does.

The more we got to know the characters, Jess and Leslie, and see how tight their friendship becomes, we realize just how important they are to each other and how they become to rely on each other without even knowing it. Jess seems to rely more on Leslie and when he must deal with her tragic death alone, he realizes that Leslie has not only given her friendship to Jess, but also the strength to go on. Terabithia, once an escape from reality, is now seen as a starting point to give Jess the strength he will need to live his life and to live on for Leslie. I enjoyed this book the more I read into it. The ending brought tears to my eyes. I found it to be a very heartwarming book that many would enjoy."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Paterson has written one of the best books on the market.

It is the best book I have ever read. It has changed the way I look at the world around me, and although this is an extremely personal response, I think that it is a book that everyone should read at some point in their life. For parents thinking about it for their kids, it is a tough book, so be sure that they are ready for it. But if they are mature enough, it is a truley wonderful book that all can benefit from."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"For me, this book was a testimony to love, friendship, and courage. Through Leslie, Jesse learned to challenge and question the world around him...to expand his knowledge of the world outside the restrictive barriers imposed by the simple farm folk. Most importantly, Leslie taught Jesse about creativity and imagination. A dash of idealism ultimately could help Jesse paint his world however he decided."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I had to read the book for 7th grade Reading.

I had liked how the characters acted.This means that the actors did a good job. Also what I had liked was these two characters made a magical world.What I mean was how they made Terabithia.Then I liked when the 2 characters got a bulley back.This is when they had planted a'' fake'' love note.Here are some things that I diliked about the book.When something bad happened to a character.She was doing something dangerous.I also didnt like when the boy forgot about the girl.A example is when he went to school he again wanted to be the fastest runner.Finally when his was mean to him.Now an example is when he does everything.I think this is a good book because its exciting.also its a funny and fun to read.Finally the characters are good."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"You should read this book! These are some of the thing that I liked about this book. I liked that the author put some funny things in this book , like when it said that Jess was as hot as popping grease.

This is a great book because there is great parts in it.Also there is great characters."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"In this book, Bridge to Terabithia, there were several things that I enjoyed. I liked how the author, Katherine Paterson, used a wide range of colorful vocabulary. With these words, she painted a vivid picture in my mind. I liked the characters. because they are about the same age as me, so I can relate to the story.Some things I didn't like include the ending. It was tragic and sad, and I wasn't expecting it. How judgemental the school was of Leslie because she wasn't like them was something I didn't like. Finally, I didn't like the beginning. It started slow and uninteresting.Even though it wasn't my favorite book, I highly recommend it. I think that what caught my attention was how much I could relate to it.-Anna Tatum"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I liked how a kid named Jesse meets the new girl and helps her out and they become friends. When the new girl came she didn't own a tv and the class laught at her. Also in the story Jesse and Lesslie give reveng to a girl that stoll Jesse's sisters twinkie. One last thing that I liked was how the author made Jesse and Lesslie have very creative minds.I didn't like the part when the races have rules. I also didn't like how the golden room was in there and they didn't mengen it later. When Jesse got a puppy for Leslie and not him.I think if you like books that are really imaginitive you should read it. This bookis so good I would read it over.[...]"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I think that the auther was very creative.Terabithia sounds the most beautiful place that they have ever imagined in their life.Leslie is my favorite because she was not like the other classmates.She was very loveble and outgoing.I think when Leslie dies she would say that she loved him and smiled.I think everyone could learn a lesson and exept life for what it is.Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I thought at first the book wasn't going to be as good as I thought. I liked the part when Jesse and Leslie makes a magical place that only Jesse and Leslie know about, they make it in the pine forest. When Leslie comes into class, everybody was laughing at her, execpt Jesse ,he went over to Leslie at recess and they became friends. I thought the plan to get revenge for stealing May-Belle' s twinkies was brilliant. the part I mostly hate was the tradgedy at the end. I didn't like what Leslie did to help Janice Avery . When Jesse did that to May-Belle I was shocked. you should tottally get this book because it's suspensful and frightening in some parts of the book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"If you like being very creative in your reading, such as seeing the pictures in your head rather than in the book, than this is the right book for you. The author gives great detail so that when there is no picture, you can imagine it.I absolutly love how the author made the characters so real,they are just like you and me. If you get tired of reading books that are just about one thing, like only about saddness, in this book you dont have to worry\\u0003 about it in this book because this story has saddness, action , and, joy.Some things that I disliked about the book was that the ending didnt exactly fit with the beggining . The ending was o.k , but to me, the ending is very important. From my point of veiw, i think that there shoud've been more adventure.Jess and Leslie do go to Terabithia alot , but when you read it really doesnt seem like it.I recommend this book who enjoy sad books. Again like I already said , this is a great book to anyone who likes thinking and challenging stories."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I liked this book in many ways although I did not like it at parts. Some things that were done well in this book were the authors wordchoice. She uses words that are not every day words. Jess and Leslie have an incredible imagination. They create the magical world of Terabithia. Jesse is a very creative when it comes to drawing. He draws pictures of funny animals.Some of the things that I didn't like were Janice becoming friends with Leslie. Janice is such a bully to her why would you be her friend. The terrible tragety could have had a little bit more to it.I recomend this book to readers who like adventure. The story keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Characters have realistic traits and acts."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I thought bridge to terabithia was a book that could keep me interested the whole time.

This book was required reading for her during the summer months and we decided to read it together. It is a wonderful story. It is nice to find a book that children can relate to on their own level, ie: nicknames given to teachers and the conduct of siblings. Because those things ring true throughout the book, a child can sympathize with other aspects of the story.Books are wonderful things - they allow us to reach into our hearts and transcend our own lives.

I came across this book as I was trying to find some quality books to recommend to my daughter (a strong 9 year old reader).

Don't be deterred by the few negative reviews caught up in the occasional use of a &quot;bad&quot; word; the book is as fine a childrens book as I've ever read, including many of the recent Newbery winners.I would also recommend a later book by the same author, the Great Gilly Hopkins.

Main Character Profile: Jesse is a poor son of two synnecial minded parents. He has three sisters and a cow. Jesse is a very fast runner. Leslie is a rich daughter of two cultered authors. She has a lot of imangination and has a lot of experience in doing such things as scuba-diving. For an overall rating this a great book that stole my heart."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"What other book will sixth grade boys read a dozen times because the relationships are so touchingly sincere? When C.S.Lewis warned people that denying the emotions would result in denying our humanity, he was inviting us to provide books such as this for our children to explore their own deep feelings for others. This book actually celebrates the capacity to feel grief, and reveals why the cynicism of those who laugh at pain must be identified for its destructive effects on a society no longer based on intimate family ties. Although it is often available in school classrooms, it is a book that should NOT be analyzed to death, or used to teach English. It should simply be available, with opportunities for kids to make their own meaning of it through open conversation."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Katherine Paterson really made a great book. It is a book that should be in the hands of anyone who loves to read. I think it trully deserves the Newbery Medal.It was MARVELOUS!!!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"My Brisbane Year 8 class and I enjoyed this book. Most of my students read it from cover to cover. They thought it was sad and very realistic. I enjoyed the fact that so many social issues are raised in the course of the book.

They have always stuck up for eachother. Leslie is new to the school and doesn't have many friends because she is different. She doesn't like dolls or dresses like the other girls do. She likes to run and wear jeans. Jess doesn't judge Leslie like the other kids. He lets her have a chance in friendship and takes time to get to know her. Jess is a supreme drawer. One day he draws a picture of a magical land. He and Leslie belive in it and it soon becomes real. Jess and Leslie become King and Queen of Terabithia. The question is: will this friendship last, or will it end?This book is fille dwith adventure. In every chapter there is always a suprise waiting. There are goals accomplished and new problems happening. The story gives the meaning of true frienship. I would reccomend this book to readers who lov exciting books that always have a suprise waiting. I think that elementary students would enjoy the book the most.

Newbery awards go to edgy children's literature - they dance around with child abuse and/or atheism and/or bad language and/or sexual issues and/or horrible parenting. Bleah. I can find children's literature with good storytelling without the avant-garde. My children are children, not miniature adults.Summary: This story has a boy hero, very negative, from a poor country family. Unpleasant home life. One sympathetic adult - the music teacher - who teaches hippie counter-culture songs and feminist anthems to the students. Terrific. Neighbor girl moves in from the city, new best friend, a world of imagination opens up, they create an imaginary kingdom. Tragic accident, the boy is bereft, a healing of the relationship with his dad, and then he shares his private world with his little sister, sharing that special relationship with someone else.I'd give the plot four stars. Jess (the 10-year-old boy hero) is negative and cheerless, and there is a stereotype that country people are rude and intolerant, while city people are open-minded and interesting. One thing I do like is Jess's idea that you do have to be kind to people when they are miserable, even if they have been mean to you. If you would protect a predator on the endangered species list, then you should care more about human beings. I also like the way the book approaches the uncomfortable scene where Jess suddenly has to examine his beliefs about faith and redemption.Language: Lord. Lord. Shuttup. Damn. Lord. Dumb kid. Hellhole. Lord. Lord. Lord. Gary Fulcher could go to you-know-where. Shut up. Dang. Damn. Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! You dummy. Stupid daughters. Lord, he was stupid. Save the whales and kill the people. That whole Jesus thing. Lord.The books you give your 10-year-old sons come with your unspoken endorsement. Think before you Newbery."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I have to teach this book to fifth graders. It seems this book was written solely to deal with death and the grieving process. I have no problem with it for independent or recommended reading, but not for whole class reading. The plot is very weak and the characters uninteresting. I, too, was annoyed by the excessive profanity (especially the use of the Lord's name).

Some people think that this book has a powerful message. Well, maybe it does, but it's also a depressing book. Who wants to read about a kid who has a terrible life?

I like to read books that don't make me cry. And I don't mean by that that I will read only books that make me happy. That's not true.

The setting is in Virginia in the 70s. The main characters are Jesse and Leslie. Jesse is a boy who is trying to be the fastest kid in 5th grade. Leslie is a girl who just moved next to Jesse from Arlington and wants to be Jesse's friend. Those were the main characters. The plot is about a boy who wants to be the fastest runner in 5th and he meets this girl and becomes friends with them. Together they create the magical land of Terabithia. When faces a tradegy he relizes the strength Leslie had given him. This is indeed a boring book!I would not recamend this book.

As if that weren't enough, the book dispels the children's happy myth of Santa Claus (...there wasn't enough money to buy my little sister presents from Santa at Christmas), and a confusing sexual reference when the main character's sister tells him to look away while she's dressing (...I realized that she thinks I'm enjoying it).

I stopped after about 20 pages because I just couldn't take being beaten over the head with the author's anti-American, radical feminist politics.For example, the hippie teacher is portrayed as the fount of all wisdom, and she gives singing lessons once a week. She sings 60s anthems like This Land is Your Land and Blowing in the Wind, and because the principal insists she also sings \\"God Bless America,\\" though we are made to understand that Miss Edmunds is far too \\"hip\\" to sing that song out of genuine religious or patriotic feeling.The narrator also comments that the locals disparagingly call Miss Edmunds a \\"peacenik\\" despite the fact that the \\"Vietnam War was over and it was supposed to be okay to like peace again.\\" Come on, now. I understand that many people have geniune moral objections to war but that statement is just grossly tendentious and oversimplified. I wonder what this radical anti-war author thought when Pol Pot murdered 2 million Cambodians after we withdrew anti-Communist military aid under pressure from \\"peace\\" lovers such as Paterson.I know that the author is allegedly a \\"Christian\\" but I find this hard to believe given that she seems to be a radical gender feminist. Androgyny is held up as the epitome of mental health as is indicated in the characters of Leslie and Jesse; note the androgynous names.Watch out, parents. This is the most sinister children's book I've ever read. It is very troubling that children are being force-fed this left-wing claptrap at school. I encourage you to read it closely and complain to your child's school if they are forced to read it. At the very least, you'll be in a position to have a critical discussion about it with them."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book should not be required reading. It does not portray a realistic relationship or fort building experience and the tragic ending is pointless and stupid and in the end the boy blows it off and goes on..

Finn\\" or some other Classic, why waste our kids time on this stuff.This comes from a womans point of view and maybe that is why women enjoy it.

The characters are never sketchy,even supporting ones stand out wonderfully.There is a wonderful variety of literary techniques(similes,metaphors,irony,etc.)The language choice of verbs,adverbs,adjectives,etc,is also intellegent.The bad: The story does a bad job of getting much emotion out of me.Most of the people in my Reading class agree,they don't feel touched.The setting isn't exactly believable.Even in the 70's,that setting was not typical for a fifth grade boy.There's a high level of mild profanity,which was distracting to say the least.I'll play a Duke Nukem game if I wanna hear that but I don't want to hear it in a Newbery winning novel.The pictures suck.The quality of writing is quite shaky,that being the quality is bad in the first part and good in the second.Overall,I must say the weaknesses outweigh the strengths.Everyone HATED it(but of course,for my teacher I had to pretend It was great)"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Great book about a little boy and a girl moves in and they are best friends.

Well in this adventure book you can.This book is called Bridge to Terabithia. I must also thank the great author Katherine Paterson. For making a great mischievous adventure book.Bridge to Terabithia is about a boy named Jess who is having a rough time in life. But, then his class has a new girl named Leslie and she keeps talking to Jess about his imagination. Then they find out that they are neighbors so they decide to race each other down a road when they find a rope attached to a tree and under the tree is a river.So Leslie decides to jump on the rope and go across to the other side of the river so Jess follows her across. Once they get to the other side they decide to use their imagination to create a land called Terabithia to help them conquer there fears from the school bully named Janis. So then...... I guess you will have to read the book to find out anymore.If you're wondering what happens next and why its called Bridge To Terabithia when they get to Terabithia by a rope not a bridge then you'll have to read the book to find out.My opinion is that this book would be a two thumbs up. If you like adventure and especially imagination books then this is the book for you. It's a really descriptive book I am sure you will enjoy it. This book I would give it five stars because it's a wonderful children's bookAlso after you read Bridge To Terabithia then make sure to see the movie as well. My opinion is that if you're going to see the movie then make sure your read the book before you go to the movies."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I never got to read this story as a kid, but read it recently when the movie came out. It's a good story, and the tragedy is very well related in terms of how the characters feel and respond to it. As a note to parents, in my opinion if your child is sensitive it would be a good idea to read this book together so that you can be there to answer questions that will arise about death and dying, and about grief and the grieving process. Some belief systems are addressed, and parents may want to be aware of that as well so that they can answer questions that might arise."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"My husband and I took my 10-year-old niece to see the recent film adaptation of this Newbery-winning classic, with which we were unfamiliar. We were armed only with information from the movie trailer, which had us picturing a Narnia-like romp in fantastical lands. We were stunned to find a realistic, even tragic, coming-of-age picture, which also had as a theme the power of the imagination to overcome real-life difficulties. I rushed out to get the book soon afterward. This review can't help but compare the book and the movie, which are now, for me, irretrievably interwined.Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of Jess, the only boy among a family of girls growing up on a cash-strapped farm. Jess's father is a remote, gruff, and seemingly unloving parent to Jess, a conflict developed more in the movie than in the book. Jess is an artistic boy and also a timid one, afraid to confront the various bullies he encounters at school and afraid of physical activities (except for running, which in the book he excels at). One day, a girl his age moves in to a nearby farm. Leslie's parents are rich city-dwelling writers, freethinkers who are having a turn at the rural life; quite the contrast from Jess's dirt-poor, religious and conventional family. Jess knows he has met a compatriot when he hears Leslie's essay about scuba-diving read aloud in school (a scene handled beautifully in the movie; the film also adds a scene with Leslie admitting to having imagined the scuba experience, never having dived herself). Jess and Leslie, both lonely, sensitive and imaginative children, create their own world -- Terabithia -- in a patch of forest near their homes. In this play land, explored in much more depth and more effectively in the film version than the book, Jess finds courage to confront his fears. This courage helps him weather the shocking tragedy that occurs toward the book's end.Bridge to Terabithia was written by Katherine Paterson while she was struggling with cancer, and also in response to her son's sudden loss of a childhood friend. She has said in interviews that the book was a way to deal with her questions about mortality. Interestingly, the screenplay was written by her son, who develops and expands the book's themes beautifully. Both are highly recommended, though parents of younger children should read the book or more in-depth reviews first, as the material can be upsetting for sensitive younger children. I probably wouldn't take a child younger than 10 to see the film, unless the child had read the book first."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Cornwall N.Y. sixth graderI am a sixth grader The Bridge to Terabithia is a very good book filled with action, excitement, adventure, and imagination.

It was the fist day back at school and all the kids were racing Jess thought he would be the fastest but, he was beaten buy Leslie. You are probably wondering why it is called the Bridge to Terabithia.

A wonderfully original and insightful story of friendship and human interaction, the author holds nothing back about the reality of growth and love. I loved this book as a child and more so as an adult."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Leslie was more than his friend; she was his other, more exciting, self, his way to Terabithia and all the worlds beyond. -Bridge to TerabithiaOkay, before I make this unmanly confession, let me first state in my own defense that I have two small children and I was listening to the conclusion of this book at a very early hour, before I'd even had breakfast to fortify me for the day. That said, I'll now acknowledge that I very nearly started sobbing...In 1976, Katherine Paterson's son David was 8 years old when his friend, Lisa Hill, was struck by lightning and killed. A year later Bridge to Terabithia was published, winning a Newberry Medal and becoming, if such a thing is possible, an instant classic. Ms Paterson drew upon this personal tragedy to create the story of a boy, Jess Aarons, and a girl, Leslie Burke, in rural Virginia, who become the best of friends. Jess is the middle child, and only son, of a reticent father, who struggles to earn a living. Leslie is the daughter, and only child, of two successful writers who have moved to the country, next door to the Aarons, for lifestyle reasons.The friendship between the two kids is hesitant at first, particularly after Leslie usurps Jess's title as the fastest runner in their 5th grade class at Lark Creek Elementary. But both have some trouble fitting in with theirs peers, Jess because of his interest in Art, Leslie because of her scholastic ability and her parents' very 70s social attitudes (like not having a TV), and this shared awkwardness gives them a unique bond. Leslie creates an imaginary kingdom called Terabithia for them to rule over, accessible only be a rope swing over a local creek. The imaginary adventures they share there and a series of incidents at school bring the two closer and closer together. But then an ugly reality intrudes upon their idyllic world and the various characters are forced to deal with a tragic death. To say more might ruin the story, so let's leave it at that.I understand that the use of this book in classrooms is frequently challenged by parents. If the reason for this is that they feel that the central crisis of the book may be too intense for children, I can sympathize with their feeling. But it seems like an intensity that is well worth their children's while. Ms Paterson handles the situation quite beautifully and affords a real opportunity for parents to discuss the matter of death with their kids, a topic which most families hopefully haven't much had to cope with. Reading the book is a difficult emotional experience, but better to first confront these emotions in a controlled fictional setting and begin to learn how to deal with them, than to remain totally sheltered and have to deal with them, completely unprepared, when the tragedy is real.GRADE : A"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"While I respect parents looking out for their children, I think someone should listen up for a moment and take note of one fact. While many children complain that this book is \\"boring\\", we must remember that most fifth-grade children call any book that they did not choose for themselves as boring. In this day and age, children are not satisfied with books, as they require a slightly longer attention span than the television set. Those claims have now been tossed out the window.Now... parents. Sometimes mild censoring of books is understandable. Children should not read books with explicit sex scenes, mostly because they wouldn't understand what's going on. Children should probably not read books like \\"Mein Kampf\\" and get the impression that this is right. However, are we now to declare such simple and basic concepts as friendship and death as \\"inappropriate for children\\"? Isn't it the opposite? These books prepare children for the inevitable. Sometimes accidents happen. Grandparents, parents, family, and friends can all die. Fifth graders know what \\"death\\" means. Are we to shelter them forever?Of course not. I read this book in fifth or fourth grade, and I loved it. I started crying, and crying. This book made me feel so many emotions, and that's what the purpose of a really good book is. Should we all read action-packed books with no feeling? Of course not! This portrays friendship and the loss of a friend in such a clear, solemn way. We see how Jesse (the main character) struggles to deal with this. He's only a kid, after all. We feel it all - without actually going through that pain.Regarding other claims about this book that it is not for children, let us remember one thing. These are children in the book. They think like children. They act like children. Their friendships and ties and feelings are those of children. Adults and older teens tend to find this book \\"boring\\". It is not intended for adults, but for kids to read and grow.I read this as a kid, and I loved it. I read it today, and I love it. It's bound to bring tears to your eyes and is so powerful and wonderful every time you read it. Every child reader will love and appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"CHARACTERS: Jesse Oliver Aarons, Jr., a ten-year-old boy, middle child in a family of four sisters, whose parents are desperately poor; and Leslie Burke, new girl from the city whose arrival forever changes Jesse's life and the attitudes of the students at Lark Creek Elementary School.SUMMARY: Young Jesse, who lives in poverty in the countryside in Virgnia, has big plans for the first week of school: he's run hard all summer and is sure he's now the fastest boy in fifth grade. Despite the fact that his dream is shattered by the arrival of a lean, lanky girl named Leslie Burke who moves to his school district from Arlington, Jesse and the newcomer become best friends. She never gloats over the fact that SHE is the fastest kid in the class, and the fact that the two are outcasts at school draws them into friendship.Together the two find, name, and create a magical kingdom in the woods that they reach by swinging across a creek on a rope tied to a tree limb. Jesse and Leslie keep Terabithia their secret, telling neither family nor schoolmates about the hours of make-believe fun they spend there. They name themselves king and queen of Terabithia and play elaborate games almost every day.Leslie's parents are attractive, educated professional writers who left their busy lives in the city for the simplicity and quiet of the country. The Burkes begin fixing up an old house close to Jesse's, and Jesse proves himself quite handy with carpentry and electrical repairs. When the weather is unfit for playing in the woods, Jesse and Leslie help Mr. Burke at home.Jesse has a crush on the beautiful music teacher who was new to the school district the previous year. Fearing ridicule from his family (particulary his father) and classmates, Jesse has shown his artwork only to Miss Edmunds. One rainy day she invites Jesse to accompany her to Washington DC to see the National Gallery. Jesse is awed by the fabulous works of art, and regrets only that he didn't think to ask his teacher if Leslie could come with them.When he returns from Washington, Jesse learns at a tender age how irrevocably one's life can change in the course of one short day.IMPRESSIONS: This was required reading for a children's literature course that I took; otherwise, I probably wouldn't have chosen it on my own, judging solely by the title. However, &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot; is an excellent book. It's a quick read, but one that will leave you crying for hours--which is exactly what you want from a book sometimes!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Ten-year-old Jess Aarons has never had a true friend. Someone he can confide his secrets to, and make plans with. The only thing he seems to have, in fact, is a happy relationship with his family's cow, Miss Bessie, a crush on the music teacher, Miss Edmunds - who seems to like him quite a bit, as well - and the hope to be the fastest runner in the entire fifth grade class at Lark Creek Elementary now that Wayne Pettis will be in the sixth grade. But Jess' dreams are dashed the moment Leslie Burke walks into his life. Leslie, like Jess, is ten-years-old, and, Jess sees on the first day of school, that she is also in his class, and appears to think that she and him are great friends simply because they live next door to each other, and have exchanged words - very few words, might I add. Jess is instantly reluctant to forge a friendship with this unlikely girl, who wears pants or shorts all the time, plays with the boys, calls her parents by their first names, and doesn't own a TV. However, as he gets to know her better, and realizes that, like him, she is the victim of numerous bullies attacking her for apparently no reason, Jess begins to see that Leslie could, quite possibly, become his first true friend. Together, as time passes, they establish their own secret land. A place they refer to as Terabithia, where giants and ogres run free, and work hard to destroy everything in their wake. A place where Jess is king and Leslie is queen. Where the two friends escape from the real world, and have the ability to toss their cares away. Leave their worries behind, and have a good time. Where Jess can showcase his artistic abilities, and Leslie can brag about not owning a TV, and her adventures in scuba diving, all without the repercussions of the nosy, nasty kids at school. But then, one day, a terrible tragedy occurs. One that makes Jess reevaluate everything he has experienced thus far in his lifetime, and realize just how much he learned from Leslie during the short time that he knew her.It is not often that a book touches me in such a profound way that I continually think about the outcome long after the last page has been turned. That it nags at me in such a violent way that I can't concentrate on anything else. Yet, somehow, that is exactly the frame of mind that Katherine Paterson's BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA has left me in. I don't know, exactly, how this book escaped my notice throughout my childhood. However, after seeing the movie trailers for the film, I just knew that I had to read it. Jess is an enjoyable character, whose interest in the arts and talent for drawing is inspiring, especially when you take into account that his parents don't shed any encouragement upon him. His crush on Miss Edmunds is also notable, for it really showcases the special relationship and bond that students are ability to establish with certain teachers. However, from the moment she stepped into the book, it was Leslie who captured my attention. From her introduction at the end of Chapter Two, Leslie left a mark in my mind. She is a profound character, whose thoughts and outlook on like are remarkable. Her ability to conceal her mischievous mind behind raw intelligence is hilarious; but it is her mature musings on just about everything that she encounters, and her kindness that truly make her appealing. I can honestly say that, no matter how many books I read in the course of my lifetime, Leslie Burke will remain one of my favorite fiction characters for life. Paterson has penned a novel that makes one think, and leaves room open for discussion regarding the various subjects discussed in this book. Subjects that many authors strive to avoid at all costs. A gripping, character-driven novel that leaves you trapped in thought.Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Chores, running, and hiding his talent to draw were Jess's most famous traits when he was alone, but when the neighbors moved in next door and he became friends with Leslie, this all changed. Jess was still good at these things but he became more creative, more imaginative, and more accepting of his love to draw. Leslie and Jess brought out the best in each other. These two were destined to become best friends, and they fought tough times as well as enjoyed good times together.Caught in a world without perfection, Leslie and Jess created a place where they could be without any imperfections. This secret place, once created, was longed for. Jess and Leslie needed this place just as they needed each other.Bridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Patterson, deals with a number of real life ordeals, including friendship, loss, bullying, and more. I think this is a great book for anyone who deals with life and longs for their own secret place to get away from it all."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA opens after Jess has spent his summer preparing himself for the races he and his classmates run during recess at their rural school. More than anything in the world, Jess wants to win, and he intends to do so. What he doesn't expect is to be outdistanced by a girl, especially one who has just moved in down the road. Yet Leslie doesn't care that she has beaten all the boys in fifth grade, she just wants a friend. Jess realizes that he wants this,also. The two ten year olds become inseparable and create a wonderful fantasy world across the creek called Terabithia. They get there by swinging across the creek on a vine. Here, they can forget the trying real world they leave temporarily behind. This exquisite, lyrical story was written by the author in tribute to a loved one. The story is timeless and endearing, as is demonstrated by its longevity. A book to be loved. A story to be remembered. Once you have read this book, whenever you see the title, it will tug at your heart. If you are an adult who doesn't read children's books, try this one."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Newberry Medal winner, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, by Katherine Paterson, deserves five stars out of five.I give this book five stars because this is an amazing story of friendship, imagination, love, and loss. As I read BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, I knew exactly what the main characters, Jess and Leslie, were feeling. Ms. Paterson gave so many details, I could paint a picture in my mind of Leslie, Jess, and everything around them.BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is the story of Jesse Oliver Aarons, Jr., a fifth grader at Lark Creek Elementary. Jess loves to draw, and he does it every spare moment that he has, whether it be at his desk in Monster Mouth Myer's class, or at night, in his room. Jess's father hates it when Jess draws. And Jess knows it. The only two people in the world who seem to believe in him and his art are his beautiful, 'hippie' music teacher, Miss Edmunds, and the weird new girl, Leslie Burke. Leslie is about the stangest person Jess has ever met. She dresses like a boy, and looks like one too, with her hair about as short a Jess's. Despite her appearance, Jess finds that Leslie and he have much in common, and they soon become best friends. One day, Leslie and Jess hike through the woods, and find a 'magical' kingdom that they pull from their imaginations. They call it Terabithia. They go to their kingdom to solve their problems with bullies, and families, and helps them deal with the tragedy that affects them all.Other titles that I would recommend are THE GOOSE GIRL, ENNA BURNING, and RIVER SECRETS by Shannon Hale. I would also suggest WALK TWO MOONS, and THE WANDERER, by Sharon Creech. I am a student at Harris Road."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"If you have an 11 year old or older buy them this book. I was in 4th grade when I read this book I read it about every 2-3 years. Im 24 now and I can't wait to see the movie that comes out on friday.This book shows life through the eyes of an artsy preeteen boy named Jesse, who meets an unique girl named Leslie. Togeather they create an imaginary world that only they can see and experiance and Leslie teaches Jesse that being different isn't the end of the world, but the begining. When you are different you can see things and love things that the rest of the world have no idea even exist.This book deals with alot of issues we expeariance for the first time in our adolessance and is a great way for children (and I would recomend this as a quick read for adults) to learn to cope with loss, death, competition, and being different.Any book Katherine Paterson wirtes will leace you touched and knowing you are not alone in the trials of life."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Some years ago several friends and I were trying to remember the first book we'd read which focused on loss. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; came first to mind...and then I mentioned Terabithia. One of the others looked at me, eyes wide. &quot;I'd forgotten about that completely...I cried for two days....&quot;So had I.It's interesting to read the reviews; the negatives are to be expected. Typically, it's from those with a neo-Victorian view of childhood as a time of innocence and sweetness, where only corrupting influences (like realistic novels) lead to wickedness. No, I'm afraid, children can be nasty, wicked and cruel all on their own. The best antidote is in words that sear empathy into the soul. Terabithia does that."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Jess is the middle child. Not only that, but he's the only boy and has four sisters. While his older sisters rule his house, he gets stuck with the chores. Things aren't much better at school where he really has no friends and just tries to survive the day.Jess has decided that this year, he's going to be the fastest kid in fifth grade. He practices all summer, only to see his dream evaporate when his new neighbor wins the race. Worse yet, she's a girl.But Leslie isn't like the other kids. Almost despite himself, Jess begins to open up to her and they quickly become inseparable. Together, they create a mythical kingdom on the edge of their properties where they rule and conquer all. But tragedy is on the horizon. What will happen when it strikes?First a word of warning. This book deals with heavy subjects. While they are handled in a sensitive way, parents may want to read this book with their child. It should open up lots of good discussions.Because this book should be read. While the story moves slowly in the beginning, the characters are fascinating. Ms. Paterson captures the world of fifth graders expertly both at school and at home. And when the story does get going, it packs a wallop. I, a grown man, was crying at the conclusion. Okay, so I cry at lots of stuff. While the story is sad, the ending is truly bitter sweet. Very little time is spent in Terabithia. Instead, we see how its creation affects Jess and Leslie in their daily lives.This book deals with a sensitive subject in a powerful manner kids can relate to. Deserves to be read and discussed."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I wasn't going to write a review after seeing how many there are on this forum! But I just have to. I read this book when I was a youngster, oh so many years ago. I bought the 25th edition several years ago because I am collecting books that are on the banned list. Plus, I wanted my sons to read it when they're older. And no, I have not seen the movie. I picked this book up again after 32 years and it is still as poignant as it was when I was a kid. I still cried as much as I did when I first read this book. I still felt the magic of Terabithia as I did as a kid. This book is timeless.Jesse Aarons is a middle child in a family of four daughters. Quiet and morose, he dreams of being the fastest runner in the fifth grade when school starts up again. He is also a budding secret artist. What he couldn't describe in words, he painted pictures in his head and sometimes, it actually came through his fingers. There is one scene where he described how he felt when he drawed ~~ like an addiction that starts at the top of his head that flows down to his toes and he's all warm and happy. There's Leslie, daughter of priviledged writers who moved to the countryside to get out of the city. Leslie joins the school and is the fastest runner in fifth grade much to the boys' chagrin. She befriends Jesse and together, they created a kingdom of dreams and magic in the nearby woods. Tragedy strikes and Jesse discovers there's more to his family than he thought before.It is a beautifully written novel and still incredibly touching, even read as an adult. It is a hard topic to talk about let alone read about. Paterson writes lyrically of pain and death. She writes beautifully of life and how to enjoy life to the fullest. She writes of complex relationships between friends, siblings, parents, teachers and everyone else in town. And yet, she doesn't write overbearingly ~~ just simplistic and wonderful so even the younger readers can understand. She writes of life and death and most importantly, of hope.This is a book that will be read over and over again and hopefully, my sons will discover the magic of Paterson's book in a few years. There is magic still to be found even among death.6-28-07"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"When Jess Aarons meets Leslie Burke his life will be changed forever.

The author draws you in like a magnet. Her main character is a little boy who has to live through a tragic event of a friend. The author trapped me from the first page and I never put the book down. I was so enthralled that I read it all in one sitting. Very well written. The flow of the writer was fluid and detailed and when I finished I could have sworn that this author had to of taken this story from a real life event and after I researched a bit I found out she did.A must read just don't forget the tissues."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"&amp;#65279;Imagine a society, in which everyone conforms and is restricted to the same routine, the same dress-code, and the same ideals as everyone else day after day; a society where all that is different and new must be either suppressed or shunned. This was the only world that Jess Aarons, Katherine Patterson's main character in the book Bridge to Terabithia, knew. He was a fifth grader, whose greatest ambition was to be the fastest runner in his grade. Coincidentally, this was also the greatest ambition of all the other fifth grade boys. It took a girl, Leslie Burkes, to lead him over the bridge, away from that world of black and white, into Terabithia. Leslie was a butterfly surrounded by moths in this strange world. She was able to laugh off the frowns and raised eyebrows that so often fell on her. She refused to be conformed and didn't care what people thought of her. You would think she wouldn't last long in this town of ruthless little machines, but it is a strange paradox that she is finally conquered by Terabithia and her own imagination. I found this rather out of place in a book with the obvious message of how healthy the imagination of a child is. Miss Edmunds served as Jess's bridge to the world of art, and helped further Jess's hidden desire to be an artist. At least, that was the authors intent, I found Miss Edmunds rather loose and careless and kept wishing that she would just let Jess alone. After Leslie is gone, Jess realizes that she has opened up a whole new world to him but he also realizes there is no longer a way to go back. \\"She had made him leave his old self behind and come into her world, and then before he was really at home in it but too late to go back, she had left him there - like an astronaut wandering about on the moon. Alone.\\" But fortunately Jess finds his second bridge to Terabithia, in his sister, May Belle who brings out his hidden imagination. It is then that he can realize the full extent of what Leslie did for him. \\" It was Leslie who had taken him from the cow pasture into Terabithia and turned him into a king.\\""},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Jesse is a fifth-grader, stuck in a family with two older and two younger sisters. They are poor farmers and Jesse seems to always be either lost in the shuffle or in the way of the rest of the family. It is disappointing when the only child of the family that moves in next door is a girl, Leslie. It is even worse when Leslie turns out to be Jesse's age and a better runner than he is, ruining his summer plans of being the fastest runner in his grade this year at school.Even though Leslie destroys Jesse's plan, though, she brings something entirely new into his life--a magical land called Terabithia, invented in the nearby woods. Throughout the fall and wintertime, Jesse and Leslie go there to act as king and queen, to escape from their lives and develop a deeper friendship.I liked the close friendship that developed between Jesse and Leslie, and the way they didn't let peer pressure or the opinions of Jesse's family affect their bond. The ending of the story was horrifying, but realistic.I know that this was a children's story, but I was still disappointed by the lack of character development that left me with more questions than answers. Why did Jesse's parents seem to dislike him so much and favor his horrible older sisters so much? Why did Jesse decide to be friends with Leslie, even when he was harassed for it? What made Leslie's parents decide that life in the country would be better for her, and why did they choose an area so desperately poor, when it was obvious they could have afforded better? I would have liked some more details to round out the story and help me to make more sense of Jesse's world."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"A good edition if you want to be true to the author's original intentions for the book. The interior drawings are very simple but serve to give an impression of what is going on. It's a great story and a very quick read for an adult. I purchased it because I saw the movie trailer and it brought back memories, so I wanted to re-read. As someone who is surrounded by children of all ages, I would say to parents BE CAREFUL when purchasing this book for your kids, because the subject matter is really tough.**** SPOILER ALERT **** DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT PLOT DETAILS ****I don't want to spoil anything for the potential reader but I want parents to know this before they purchase the book... One of the main characters dies and the other young character has to deal with this extremely difficult death. Make sure that your child is prepared for this subject and/ or is mature enough to handle it, because the concept of a best friend dying tragically at a young age is devastating at best for a young person (or older person! broke my heart!).

In a hot muggy town in Virginia in the 1960's lived a family named Aaron. There are 4 girls and 1 boy in the family. The boy's name is Jess. He has 2 snobby older sisters, Brenda and Ellie. He always counts on May Belle, his 6 year old sister, because she does whatever he tells her to do (almost everything). Last, but not least, there is little Joyce Anne a regular 4 year old crybaby. Jess always works in the farm. He meets a girl named Leslie who changes his life forever. Leslie moved into the old dirty Perkins's place (as the Aarons call it.)

Kids need to be treated as if they have common sense though I wonder nowadays. Death is a part of life, better get used to it, this book is sad, but remember that how we live is more important than how long we live.

A place to think about your thoughts and wonder about the thoughts of others.The book has you feeling as if you lying under a tree, chewing grass, on a sunny day, with a hat over you eyes mood one minute.

Her name is Leslie, and she is a real tomboy. Leslie and Jesse are the most important characters in the book. They become really good friends. They are in the same class. Everyday at recess, everybody in the 4th, 5th and 6th grade ran in a race on the playground. Leslie ran one day and won. The next day after school, Jesse and Leslie built a magical kingdom in the woods. They called it Terabithia.

Jess and Leslie profoundly impact each other as they develop immutable ties. Patterson's writing is beautifully crafted, enabling the reader to become enveloped in the lives of the protagonists. Jess is a weakling, barely surviving in in his carefully structured world. Leslie is a free-thinking pugilist, challenging Jess and his queasy quirks. The two realize the need they have for each other, and they quickly cement a platonic bond through their imaginary kingdom in the woods. Terabithia becomes the place where they vanguish all foes and revel in their newly-formed closeness. Reborn and invigorated, Jess conquers his slimy-palmed fears and stares wide-eyed at the shiny world around him. I am a third grade teacher and a lover of all forms and genres of literature. This book provides readers of all ages with a chance to challenge their preconceived notions of friendships, particularly between members of the opposite sex.

I enjoyed reading it as a class.I also loved reading by myself. We all had our own opinions and we all had a discussion about what we had read so far. We discused why people have their opinons. I think that the girls liked it more than the boys. My favorite part in the novel is in Chapter 2 wherein Leslie and Jess, the two main characters, meet.Katherine Patterson did a great job at writing the novel.She should make a sequal to this book, and it would be called Bridge to Terabithia II. I like the way Patterson makes such good descriptions of the setting and the characters .This book reminds me of a time when I met some new friends, but things didn't turn out as great for me. Katherine Patterson shows her true ability to entertain youg adult readers."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The reason I can't tell about the ending is that the other kidswould know about it.

But Jess doesn't do that. He just draws and colors and paints.Terabithia is an imaginary place because Leslie and Jesse are keeping it a secret. But then Jesse gets a puppy for Leslie and she takes it home. Then her parents find out and she gets in trouble.

It is wonderfully written, with actual emotions. I first read this book in the 6th grade and I completely identified with the characters. While it is a children's book, it has real emotions and situations which many adults find themselves in. It has been 10 years since I first read it, but I still manage to read it at least once a year. The characters encourage imagination, courage, passion and love. Even though the characters are only in the 5th grade, through their thoughts they can convey a huge range of ideas.Many books such as Harry Potter do not measure up, I am however biased with the change in generation...regardless.The language it is written is at a childrens level, but even reading it now, it does not detract from what the book means.

I recommend this book to any young reader!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I thought Bridge to Terabithia was a good book. I didn't think it was fantastic, but I did enjoy it. I really felt the emotions of the main character. The setting takes place in a rural area where the most common profession is farming. The area is far from any big city and the time period appears to be the 1970's. Here are some events from the book that I enjoyed. In the beginning I thought it was funny when Leslie beat Jess in the race on the first day of school. The second event that I liked was when Janice stole May Bell's Twinkies. I knew she had it coming because she was telling everyone at school. The third event that was amusing to me was when Jess and Leslie wrote that fake letter to Janice to get revenge for stealing May's Twinkies.The main conflict starts off in the beginning when the new girl Leslie wants to race with the boys. Jess unknowingly stands up for her and gets her into the race. Leslie beats him in the race and his hopes of being the fastest kid in school are crushed. Throughout the beginning Jess avoids her but the conflict is solved and they become the best of friends which leads to them creating an imaginary world called Terabithia where they spend most of their time.I would recommend this book. I liked it ok but I'm sure someone else would like it even better. I was however disappointed at how the book ended. I would rate this book about a 3 on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"A minor miracle. The honesty of the writing took my breath way. These aren't just characters on a page, but living, breathing people (at least I felt they lived in me). Jess and Leslie (and even mean old Janice) seemed like kids I knew and went to school with. Jess' mom was a bitter, bitchy mom - not Mrs. Walton, that's for sure. I loved the teachers - Mrs. Myers and, especially Miss Edmunds, who took Jess to The National Gallery and The Smithsonion (I had a special teacher/friend like that and it made all the difference in my life - to have some perceptive soul look into your secrect self and recognize an unnurtured yearning for knowledge and culture and then selflessly give it is a great gift). This lovely little novel had me in tears a couple of times. Still, I found it uplifting and life affirming. I will read this again."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Lots of people love everything Paterson has written, (\\"Jacob Have I Loved\\", \\"Gilly Hopkins\\"), and some pick and choose. I'm in that latter category, and think that not all Paterson books are equally appealing. But a young reader should be introduced to her books, and it seems that this book - straightforward, honestly felt, plainly but movingly written - is the place to start. It certainly should be available for a reader who is ready to move to \\"serious\\" ya."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Jess Aarons' is considered a nobody at school and at home where he lives with a family of only women. The only other man in the house is his father, who Jesse strives for attention and acceptance from. When a new girl moves in next door, Leslie, things change for Jesse Aarons. He experiences the most wonderful friendship one can only find during childhood, and creates a magical world known only to the two of them, Terabithia. When an unexpected tragedy occurs, Jess has to overcome his problems on his own.This book is a beautiful story about friendship, facing your fears, and overcoming challenges. This book is great for enhancing a child's imagination and teaching them a lesson on life, and all the hardships that come with it. I would highly recommend this book to children no younger than 4th or 5th grade.AC3301"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book, which is too bad, really.

Their friendship is started when imagination gave Lessie the idea of a secret place just for the two of them. They create a whole world just for them where they become the rulers. \\"In their own imagination.\\"This author creates a vision to give you an idea about the characters. She gives detail about how the characters look using descriptive words to create an image in your head. When Lessie came in to the story this author described how Lessie's jeans were all baggy and torn, her shirt all wrinkled. While everyone else wore neat ironed shirts that were plain with shorts not torn or baggy. The words used to describe the characters and setting really invites you into this story. Like when Katherine describes Lessie's house by saying that it is all falling apart, moss all over, paint peeling off the walls and the roof tiles falling off. The words that make an image also are used by Katherine to describe the personalities of a character and to show changes a character might have during the story.Katherine Patterson creatively makes Jesse start to change a lot around the middle of the story. Some of the characters change their personalities because of things they learn from other characters. When Lessie becomes his friend he starts to become a more imaginative and adventurous person. Jesse soon becomes a more friendly and active person when he and Lessie create their own secret little world just for the two of them. He really starts to change for a reason. I badly want to know what the reason was. Also a character changes in the movie. Janice the meanest girl in the whole school also changes when she starts to become a ton more friendlily then she was at the beginning of the movie.In other words, I liked reading this book with all of its good humor and dazzling descriptions. I feel like I am in the book because it truly gives you a crystal clear image of what is going on. In some parts you may want to laugh out loud like when Jesse makes a pug puppy circle him and Lessie. Other parts may want to make you just keep crying like when one of the two friends deals with a great loss in the story."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is one of my favorite children's books. But I should know better than to read it at work. Everyone in the work cafeteria probably thinks I'm an emotional wreck as it never fails to bring tears to my eyes and I unwisely chose to read on my lunch hour. But its a great book thats full of emotion.Jess is a boy in the middle of a family of girls. His parents don't have much time for him, and he's not very popular, but he's determined to be the fastest runner when he goes back to school. His plans are quickly dashed though when the new tomboyish girl Leslie beats everyone; including Jess. But it doesn't end up mattering, he becomes friends with Leslie and together they build their own fantasy world of Terabithia where they can rule fairly over their subjects. But then tragedy strikes and everything changes.Leslie and Jess are both really great characters. They have their own personalities but still make great friends. Leslie especially is a great character as she is so full of life and good ideas. Jess's sister is pretty cool too (the six year old one) and she makes a good nuisance while still being a good character. The adults are all pretty distant in this book, but they are still very realistically done.For a plot this is certainly a sad one. But I really like it. There is so much emotion written to this book but for that same token, not all children may be able to handle it. It deals with some of the harsher realities out there. Like I said before, it made me cry. Still, this is a good book for adults and children alike. Very good themes are explored.I definitely recommend this book to anyone. Its one of the better reads out there (and the movie isn't half bad either).Bridge to TerabithiaCopyright 1977128 pagesReview by M.

I saw it on the kindle books and had to own it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I loved this book by Katherine Paterson, but the ending is sad. All summer, Jess pushed himself to be the fastest boy in the fifth grade, and when the year's first school-yard race was run, he was going to win. But his victory was stolen by a newcomer, by a girl, one who didn't even know enough to stay on the girls' side of the playground. Then, unexpectedly, Jess finds himself sticking up for Leslie, for the girl who breaks rules and wins races. The friendship between the two grows as Jess guides the city girl through the pitfalls of life in their small, rural town, and Leslie draws him into the world of imagination - a world of magic and ceremony called Terabithia. Here, Leslie and Jess rule supreme among the oaks and evergreens, safe from the bullies and ridicule of the mundane world. Safe until unforeseen tragedy forces Jess to reign in Terabithia alone, and both worlds are forever changed. The book deals with several topics: hippies, calling your parents by their given names, a close relationship between a student and teacher, death, and Christianity.The plot of the book stems from the author's real-life experiences. When Katherine Paterson's son David was a child, his close friend Lisa Hill was killed by lightning. Paterson wrote the book while coming to terms with this loss. Because of the novel's content it has been the frequent target of censors and appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000 at number nine. The censorship attempts were due largely to death being a part of the plot, Jesse's frequent use of the word \\"Lord\\" outside of prayer, and concerns that the book promotes secular humanism and New Age religions, occultism, Satanism, and for accusations of sexual content. Katherine Paterson acknowledges that the name Terabithia is likely derived from Terebinthia, an island in the Narnia series. There have been two films made based on this book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book is great! It's an easy read and the storyline is great.

This is a wonderful book that can be read by children of all ages."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is a fairly good book. The beginning starts off pretty slow but once you get past a couple of chapters the book gets exciting. It is also very immaginative. The plot is very interesting and takes a weird turn at the end. The end of the book is very sad; death in a book is always sad. All in all the Bridge to Terabithia is a pretty exciting and imaginative book and a sad ending. It should not be banned."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I think the book Bridge To Terabithia is a great book. I don't see any reason for it to be banned. I read this book along with at least 200 other kids in my grade as an assigned reading book in 6th grade. I thought it was a very good piece of literature. It deals with hard to talk about events that occur in the majority of people's lives. It is also good for kids to learn that you can like someone even if they're different from you. This book teaches that you shouldn't make stereotypes. For example Leslie still liked the main character even though he didn't have as much money as her. I think this was a great book. It's a book that's really hard to put down once you start."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I hadn't thought about this book for a very long time until I recently saw it on a list of banned books. I don't remember much about the story because I read it so long ago (at least 12 years ago), but I do recall that this book was more powerful, more moving than any other book I had read up to that point in my life (which is saying something, I read a LOT). It strikes me as truly shameful that some schools and public libraries would ban such a powerful literary work."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"To me this book is an okay book, it gets boring at some parts and then exciting at others. At the end its sad to because of Leslie dieing, and it could also help kids relate to this story of their past life.

It does use the lords name in vain, but i believe that ever child will eventually hear it once in their life, and its just teaching them.

When I start a book, I never want to put it down. When I read Bridge To Terabithia, I really never wanted to put it down. The thing I didn't like about reading this book in sections was because we had to read from one place, and stop at another. I didn't want to stop reading at a certain point. I wanted to just read on.Bridge To Terabithia is about a girl who moves to a place, and becomes very good friends with a boy who lives near her. Leslie, the girl, has a very big imagination. Jesse, the boy, loves to draw, and has an imagination, but not as vivid as Leslie's. At first, Jesse thinks he's never in the world is going to be friends with this girl. But Jesse finds out, Leslie is a tomboy, and they put aside their differences, and become friends. One day, Leslie decides to make a place, just for her and Jesse, in the forest near Leslie's house. When an unexpected tragedy happens, their friendship helps Jesse cope with the tragedy, and change his life forever. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a friendship book, and can deal with the fact af a tragedy. Bridge To Terabithia is a great book, and I hope all who read it love it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia was a wonderfully written book. It explained the many perils of life and how difficult life can be. A young ten-year-old boy, by the name of Jess Aarons lives with his family on a farm. When a new girl and her family move into the old Perkins place, Jess knows that they won't stay very long. \\"No one ever stay's long in the Perkins place,\\" Jess's mother would say. Jess and the girl, Leslie Burke, become wonderful friends. They do everything together. They even make up a magical kingdom called Terabithia. Jess and Leslie make great friends. Jess has the smarts and the athleticism and Leslie has the imagination and strength. They teach each other lessons that will never be forgotten. When one day something unexpected happens. The whole of Jess's world goes off tilter and he doesn't know how to respond. Somehow, with Leslie's help, he is able to get through.I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought that Katherine Patterson wrote in the mind of a ten-year-old boy very well and she knew just what they would think in a tragedy. I enjoyed reading about Jess and his family. Many times Jess would not get along with the rest of his family and he would just need a break from them, but when he needed them the most, they were there for him. Jess and Leslie were wonderful friends from the start. You could tell that Leslie was special to Jess when he gave her Prince Terrien, the puppy, for Christmas one year. Jess and Leslie cared about each other and had big plans. I thought that their family's supported their friendship very well. I enjoyed every aspect of the book. I thought the writing was fluent and it always made since. I also thought that the writing style kept me interested in Jess's life and what happened next.There were not many things that I disliked about the book. The one major event that made me lose focus was the tragedy. I thought that it became very predictable. Once the story became closer and closer to the tragedy many events took place that practically told you what was about to happen. Such as, the thunderstorm and the fact that Jess left for the day. Katherine Patterson started to give all of these clues that almost TOLD you what was going to happen next in the book. I thought that this aspect made the book less enjoyable. When an author gives away the ending to a story it is no fun to read the rest of the book. I thought this was the one minor flaw that Katherine Patterson had as a writer.Bridge to Terabithia was a well-written book that I would recommend to a reader of all ages. It is an exciting book that made you want to keep reading and it also was an interesting book that made you think twice about many aspects of life. It made me think about how strong a friendship can be and how important your family is to you. Bridge to Terabithia was a great book and I think that you should consider reading about the life of Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke as they lead you through the magical kingdom of Terabithia."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"...an ethereal place where children rule. A fantasy...a secret...created by Jess and Leslie, two unlikely friends.Mrs. Paterson is able to combine adult concepts with a children's story in an exquisite manner. Kids will love it because she remembers what is important in a 5th grader's world. The stresses and worries of life when you're in the 5th grade come from worrying about who will be the fastest that day...or who will be your best friend.

As a small child I lost my brother and grandfather a few years apart and before eight had finished. I knew the feeling death and loss could give you. My best friend had also left around then. By the end i felt a connection. I think the ending was well done and also on a different note gave Jesse's dad a softer side. I think she taught him to follow his passions and when he lost hr it taught him a valuable thing...Nothing is forever and we aren't always promised tomorrow. As a parent trying to protecct kids for the harsh realiy of life is not always possible but maybe books about these stories help them know it happens.On another note, having read the book a few times when the movie was released I was disappointed. Favorite parts were missing and stuff that should not have been added were I thought.Overall as a child I loved many types of books and this was one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The Bridge to Terabithia is a great story involving a childhood friendship between a boy, Jess, and the new girl, Leslie. Leslie is an outcast at school because of her tomboyish behavior. Jess and Leslie become unlikely friends and spend a lot of time with one another. The story involves how the two kids deal with bullying at school and how Jess copes with the fact that his house is full of women. The two have a great contrast about them with Leslie being from a well off family whereas Jess's family is poor.Through the course of their friendship Leslie opens Jess's mind to an imaginary land where they are both important people who mean something to their peers. With a wonderful twist of an ending, this book provides a sincere sense of innocence and for me nostalgia. If you remember being a pretender, being a \\"bullied\\", or being tied to your best bud's hip, then this book is for you.P.S. This story might cause readers to throw the book in a fit of rage on one occasion. I know I did. That said...

It's a true heartbreaker, but will leave your heart warm at the same time. Keep the tissues nearby, you'll need them!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Remember when we were little kids, and we always played games with our friends that most of the time involved our imagination? How we created worlds that only our most trusted best friends could see? How in our world, we had everything we imagined? How in our world, everything was innocent and pure? How in our world, we never thought that one day, life would take over and destroy our it?Bridge to Terabithia, is that world. The world we dream of when we sleep. Don't you ever miss that world?Bridge to Terabithia starts off with a boy named Jess, who's a middle grader that acts like most teenagers today. In his eyes, his life sucks. That is, unless it's the annual school race where he decides that he will win in first place. And win he almost does. That is, until someone beats him. A girl by the name of Leslie Burke. This girl beat all the boys in the race and back then and even today, when you're a little kid, being beaten by girls is not okay. After all, they do have cooties...The story goes on and Jess and Leslie become the best of friends, and eventually, as all kids, create their perfect world. Terabithia. To get into Terabithia, you have to cross this creek by swinging on a rope. But in their minds, it's a magnificent bridge. They have battles and wars, party's and everything else there is to do. Outside of Terabithia, no one else knows about it.Jess starts to think that his life is getting better and Leslie is living life as free-spirited as she can with her family. Something Jess wish he had. In his eyes, she has everything he doesn't. So when his teacher invites him on a trip, he doesn't invite Leslie along, as he was told to. Instead, he makes an excuse that she can't go. That night, everything changed. Fatally.In Jess' mind, Terabithia still lives, as he shares the secret along with his younger sister. In his mind, Terabithia still includes Leslie."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Paterson's book becomes an exciting and dramatic book. Jess Aarons is happy to start fifth grade. He's been practicing his running all summer, determined to become the fastest runner at school. All seems to be right, until the new girl in class Leslie shows up. She leaves all the boys in the dust, including Jess. After this frustrating race, Jess and Leslie soon become friends. Together, they create an imaginary, secret world in the woods called Terabitha that can be reached only by swinging across a creek on a rope. But one morning a accident happens Leslie as she ventures alone to Terabithia, and Jess's life is changed forever. I would place this book under the category of realistic fiction, and I would recommend it for kids, and adults who love fantasy and realistic fiction!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book with my little brother. I chose it because it is read extensively throughout Australia and England, and studied in many schools. The book is not read so much in the US where oddly, the story takes place. I think it was a great book and forced you to really think and to get inside the head of another person very different from yourself. A different but similar read would be A DAY NO PIGS WOULD DIE (Robert Newton Peck). I highly recommend reading this book.

When you read the titles in the story mak e you just want to read on an dfind out what will happen.I also liked it when Leslie gave Jess his imagin starts to kick in. After the tragety Jess Really starts to think and come up with thoughts.I liked it when Jes bilds the brige becase it adds to the story and shows Jess's side of things. When is taking cotroll.What I really didn't like in the story was that afer the tragety Jess hits maybell I think it just should have been a diffrent showing of emoshon.Idont like it when Leslie calls her parentsby there names, I think they should be called mom and dad but it dose add more to the story.I would recommend this book.The reson I recomend this becase its adveturus ,great detal,and it show how people act in life.Its a touching story ,you should read it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book was very interesting. I liked The way the authour used the words to describe each setting. Almost every comparison used a literary tecniqe. The people seemed real. Leslie Burke was picked onand Jess was unable to show his true self. The other ting I liked was that there is a little bit of everything in this book.For example happy, sad, poor, rich,love, and hate wre all in this book.Some parts in this book I did not like was the ending. It just stopped dead. The foreshadowing in my opinion gave to much away. I already knew the answers half way through the book. The book sould have ended alot sooner. It went to slow at the begining but to fast at the end and kept dragging on.I would deffinetly recomend this book. It has really great detail to every scene.

Katherine Paterson out did herself in her book \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\". She included normal problems that we kids go through in our everyday lives such as, trying to be the best and being lonely.She adds suspense,humor,and drama. Scrunched in between is of course our well known similes,metaphors,prsonification,and hyperboles. It's the way she uses them is what is so magical. Each star that I gave her had a meaning. The first star stands for figurative language. I talked about that earlier. The second is awarded if the novel is understandable. Just from the first chapter you could tell that. Third,stands for the meaning or theme of the book. In this piece of work it is ,\\"younever know what you really got until it is gone. And finally, fourth is for the comparison of real life amd imagination. Once you find that border nothing can stop you. So read on!

It may have a few bad words,but it still is a good book. I really liked when Jess sprayed Leslie in the face with MissBessie's milk(MissBessie is a cow). I liked that the characters were realistic and had problems that I could relate to. I have mixed feelings about the way Mrs. Paterson ended the book. In one sense I liked the way she ended the book, but in another sense I wish it had ended differently.

It happens that one day when both are walking through the forest, they manage to put their imaginations together creating a new world of Terabithia. Jess and Leslie became really good friends until one day, Leslie had an accident and drowned. That's when the bond of Jess and Leslie was seperated. Katherine Patterson put a lovely,sad ending at the book and she also uses lot's of figurative languages.

I beleive the ending is kind of sad though. I think u should read this book"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is a book with a mission, and with an agenda to accomplish. I did not like this book one bit when I was made to read it, and I always loved books. I was the kid you couldn't get to play a video game with you because I was probably reading a book 4 grade levels above me. I sympathize with the young reviewers who say they didn't like it either.It *is* a boring book, for kids. Young reviewers are not being petulant or exercising undeveloped literary judgment when they say so. Adults may be compelled by interior drama and socio-economic details. I was merely confused and bored. The class/wealth issues with the families were completely lost on me. And when the climax of the book occurred, I remember being really *really* pissed. I was enough of a reader to know what the writer did there, and transparently why: to \\"teach\\" me about something I \\"needed\\" to know about the unfairness of life. No, really?It's heavy handed, and any honest child knows that, and resents being tricked.This is still a worthwhile book for young readers. A number of kids will always love it every year. But if some young people tell you they don't like the book, it isn't because it \\"breaks all the childhood rules\\" of living in a death-denying fantasy world. It's because it's a transparent, heavy-handed, didactic tome and kids don't like being tricked or preached to anymore than you or I do."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I recall this book very fondly. When I read it, I hoped with innocence to have my Leslie Burke. Now I do, yay! I will look forward to sharing this with my son when he is old enough to read it.A side note: I'm looking forward to the movie. I think the trailer that Disney's Feb 07 release looks beautiful, with 2 well cast children. I haven't seen this older movie, and probably won't. But the guys at Weta hopefully don't overdo the special effects trying to take over the relationship between the two kids. As a fan of Narnia and LOR, this movie version I hope is heart-centered which is why I am so thankful for my favorite book I ever read as a kid, assigned or not."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I think the book is great.However, I do not like the way the author wrote the end.I think she should have ended the book by Leslie moving because more kids will face that problem in their lives than death of others their age.The characters were fascinating, they looked and talked like the people in that setting normally does.The dialogue is serious because they speak like most people in that rural area do.In the pine grove the characters speak solemnly and the dialogue is taken very seriously.The climax happened near the end but the events building up to it was other things that teenage kids do so the events were not boring and the climax was exciting and that made me want to finish the book.I dont know what others think but i like that book beginning to the end and would recommend this book to anyone.

Read the book and decide for yourself. Minor characters are well drawn. The leisurely pace of the first half belies the page turner.

This is a far cry from books that assume everyone is middle-class and lives in a four-bedroom house in the suburbs. Jess's family is far more easy to identify with for children who come from families who are doing their best just to scrape by (or who need to realize that not everyone is like them).

This story is about a boy named Jesse Arons. He met a new girl at school named Leslie Burke. They became inseparable. It didn't matter that Leslie dressed funny, or had tons of money but no T.V. She had imagination and that was good enough for Jesse. She creates Tersbithia with Jesse and they are the rulers of this magical world. On one day Jesse went on a trip. When he arrives home, there is a deathly silence. He finds out Leslie tried to cross over to the kingdom alone. The water was very deep. She had died in the river. This book is wonderful. You will be touched by this amazing story."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book for the first time in fourth grade and several more times after that. I just finished it again for my college Children's Literature class and I think I love it more than ever, definitely the mark of a classic. Such an honest, real story about friendship and loss. It still makes me cry, probably even more now that I'm older. :-)"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I sobbed out loud in this book. I don't know when else I've ever cried that hard. This must be one of the best, most touching, most well written books ever. It makes you cry all the more because suspense builds and when the news comes out it's like the reality of something awful happening to you. If I could I'd rate this higher than a five. I highly recomend this whether you are old, young, popular, iscolated, or hate, or like to read. I'm only 11 but I read A LOT! and fast and this book must be one of the best."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I thought this was a good book. I liked the whole thing.

Then a girl named Leslie moves in next door to him and she turns out to be the fastest runner by beating all of the boys.

One day the creek is filled with water because a huge storm had just blown in. The next day Jess gets invited to go to an Art Museum with his favorite techer.

I felt like I was a part of the book .Like there was a part in it for me .Kathrine Patterson made you feel the pain and joy of the charecters and not many authours can do that.

One month later my father passed away. We were very close. I've been looking for this book ever since.It's been 11 years and it still holds a place in my heart. Read it if you get a chance. You won't be disappointed! Rhonda L. Weaver"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I was hooked from the first word. I understood the idea of wanting to be the best of wanting to be someone and of wanting someone to care. I remember all of that and I'm impressed by Paterson's ability to write it down so well that it reads like the memories I replay. I'm impressed all over with the writing. I've read a few other young-adult books this year, trying to get some new titles for my students, but none have had the respect for the language and the reader that I found here. It reminded me of reading A.A. Milne or E.B. White in that here was a writer concerned with how things were said and how they would sound.I won't say anything much about the plot, I don't think that anyone needs to hear about it before they read. That's the thing: the book gets you right into it and moves the way the life of a young boy moves. I will say that I bought into the plot though I wish the characters of his sisters had been written in a bit more. Toward the end, especially, I had some trouble believing them. Still, this is a minor complaint and no knock against the book.Go read it. Get it from your library. Check to be sure that your child's school shares it with them. Make sure that you read it with your child. It's too good to miss out."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia, tells a story of a friendship that lasted through hard times and is finally torn by a death. Its a sad realization of what could happen to someone the reader is personally very close to. Most kids feel they are invicible, this book tells the truth that anything can happen. Its a book that has you feel glory,pain, happiness,truth, and sorrow. This book is for any age because it can make any person cry and feel for the characters. If your looking for a touching story about friendship then read Bridge To Terabithia by Katherine Paterson"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I first encountered this book as a pre-adolescent, about 20 years ago, and it was the first book that ever brought me to tears. It also remains one of only a handful that was able to shock me with its unexpected plot developments. Although these two things were what made the deepest impressions on me as a youth, what has stood the test of time for me is how this book shows that tragedy does not have to overwhelm you. \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\" doesn't pull punches. But for those who want to protect children from the idea that life may hurt them badly, I have news for you -- they already know. Many of them are already hurting badly, in ways that they can't explain to adults. What they need to know (what I needed to know) is that feeling inadequate, enduring cruel treatment from your peers, and even coming up against the reality of irrevocable loss doesn't have to hurt forever. This book gives the possibility of incorporating painful experience into one's life, growth, and future happiness. It's a terribly sad book, but one full of hope as well, and the smarter the young person in your life is, the greater the chance this book could touch them deeply too."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I love this book! It is my favorite. It doesn't take long to read and it has such a great (and sad) story. I think it deserved more than just one award. It always gives your mind something to chew on.

Sad ending, but worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is a great book. It is easy to see why Katherine Paterson won the Newberry Medal for it. I think children as well as adults will enjoy this book, even though it deals with death.Jesse's main ambition is to be the fastest kid in the fifth grade. He practiced all summer, only to have a girl beat him. The girl is Leslie. At first Jesse refuses to be friends with Leslie, but after he sees how much they have in common they become best friends. Leslie is a very intelligent and imaginative girl who teaches so many things about life to Jesse, an average farm boy. They build a secret and magical kingdom called Terabithia. The only way to enter this magical kingdom is by swinging across the gorge on a rope.One day, when Jesse returned from a trip to Washington D.C. with a teacher, he learns of Leslie's death. The rope broke as Leslie was swinging over the gorge into Terabitha. At first, Jesse refuses to accept her death. Then he almost feels happy because he is now the fastest kid in the fifth grade. He finally comes to terms with Leslie's death as he goes to Terabitha to perform a funeral ceremony. He then builds a bridge across the gorge so his sister can come and enjoy the magical kingdom of Terabitha.Paterson develops the characters so well that they seem real. She gives an accurate description of their lives and of the events that occur on the playground. The reader can relate to the things that happen to Jesse and Leslie and how they handle these things. Paterson shows the reader that a boy-girl friendship can happen and that it can be a great one. She does an excellent job of making this story come alive for the reader."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This was a very sad, very difficult book. Not because of difficult language or readability, but because of the intense lessons it teaches about grieving and death. This book cannot be read lightly. It takes you throught the main character's process of making a new friend, learning to love and trust her, having that trust betrayed, and finally, learning to move on with his life. Despite its deep and painful context, this book was very worthwhile, and I completely reccomend you give it a try!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I realy like the book Bridge to Teribithia.I think some of the parts are really interesting but other parts just focus on Jesse and milking cows.

Jesse only has two friends lesslie and Ms. Edmunds.Jesse and Lesslie go to Teribithia with eachother. Jesse and Lesslie are the king queen of Teribithia.

I nearly missed my stop!Jesse and Leslie form a fast friendship, proving that opposites attract. When disaster strikes, Jesse must learn to grow up in a day, becoming an adult and facing reality the hard way.Four years later, I still flip open to the last few pages and have a good cry.

I could really identify with the characters (especially Leslie) then, and I still do. I think that I read this book so many times between third and sixth grade that I memorized most of it. And yet, I wish now that I still had it to read again, because the lessons don't stop pertaining to life once you hit adulthood. Somewhere in my life, my copy of this book and other treasured books of childhood vanished--probably passed on to some other child who would enjoy them.

It talked about the friendship of Jess and Leslie, and the care that they showed for one another. It was very well written, and a definate could not put down book.

I have read it 11 times since (my paperback copy is falling apart from wear), and never fail to admit that this is the best book I have ever read. Never to be referred to as a children-only book, it is beautifully realistic and brutally honest in content. It has brought forth laughs and tears both from me. So rent it, love it, go buy it, and then share it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book for my 5th grade assignment. The book was good but not as good as others I have read. This is a story that begins with a boy, Jess, who after his chores of milking the cows, sets out to run across the farm fields. It ends with him coping with a tragic loss of a friend by building a bridge. A bridge to a Terabithia, a magical land, he shared with his friend. Whereas, the characters seem real enough, the story does not capture one's imagination. It dwells on the sad side of life. The inability of these two kids to make friends easily with others and their need to escape their lives into a world of imagination. Imagination is wonderfully fun but how sad that they need to use it to escape."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The book was about the relationships characters. There were two main characters. Leslie was a nice girl who moved into the town. She was different that the others students. At first jess didn't even like her. However, later they become good friends. They were going almost everywhere together. They become really good friends.Leslie and Jess wanted to create a secret place. She found the place in the forest, but to go in that place you have to Cross- River, it was little bit hard. But they went there and call that place Terabithia. They were going almost every day there; they were playing or just sitting. I really liked this book, because it's about secrets, it's interesting to know someone's secret, and keep that in our heart. I feel sorry for Jess, if I be in his situation I would cry and cry ...some part I didn't like in the book, because some words were hard to translate or understand. I would give this book a 6 of 10, because I didn't like the ending."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I am in high school now i red this book in the 6th grade and loved this book.

Well I just got a high school english project on books that have been banned or are still banned at one point. I was suprised to see that this book was on that list. So i was moved and decided that i was going to pick this book to understand the reason that some parent or teacher decided that this book had a reason to banned. i havent found much information yet, but i still just cant see why they would do something. Katherine Paterson and Judy Blum they are on list that most of their books have benn banned. I think that is crazy and reading the reviews on this book it makes no since to why someone is banned this book.

Not other girls but animals, like frogs, butterflies, and birds. So she has blond hair and she is short. She is kind and generous. She would take care of other living creatures and she likes to make peace. Even though her guardians could get on her nerves she still loves them.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy books, mystery books, surprising books and funny books. This book has almost everything in it. It also has lots of action to it. This book is really clear on what's happening and it doesn't have any confusing parts.

After doing some research, I have found out that this book is on \\"banned\\" book lists. I can see why. I found the following words on the first five pages; damn,(father says in conversation) shut up (said twice), dumb (in the context of calling someone dumb), the devil, and whiskey.(Jess drew like people drink whiskey) If I had continued reading, there's no doubt my list would be longer. I have mixed feelings because I know we shouldn't shelter our kids from such material, especially in the involvement of well known and respected literature, but I just cannot let one of my students read it due to a parent complaint, raising questions that are not my place to answer, and so on. I think that since this book was written in the 70's, the language and social entity was more exceptable than it is now in our overly PC (politically correct) world.Bridge to Terabithia has been challenged by numerous school boards in the U.S. due to profanity, references to witchcraft and and containing subject matter that sets a bad example and gives students a negative view of life.

The only point it seemed to make was Leslie's death at the end of the book. Overall I thought that it was exteremly uneventful. Terabithia seemed to have a small role to play in the book. 'Much ado about nothing' fits this novel.I cannot, however, ginve this book only one star. Giving it one star would be hating this book. I did not hate it I just thought that it never did get to the point. If it was a memior I would have liked it. As a memior I would have thought it was a good book because I would have expected this. (I wouldn't have picked it up though. Memior isn't quite my style.) I liked the characters and was sad when that girl died.

As parents, we read the book and were appalled that the Lord's name was taken in vain 34 times, the word d*** was used 4 times, and the words h*** and h***hole used 2 times. We do not believe that this is appropriate for any grade and especially not for grade 5's.

The main characters Jess and Leslie, are social outsiders who find comfort in each others accepting company. They learn to have compassion for bullies, inept parents, and pestering younger siblings. On the other hand, the book reinforces the notion that fat people are deserving of contempt. In addition, some of the language in the book is inappropriate and a bad example for young people. I was surprised this book won the Newbury and saddened that higher standards weren't applied."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book and I find it to be boring. Just when it was getting good someone has to die. Personally, I don't like reading books like that, at all. I was required to read it as a school project and I think it was a waste of my time. It had all sorts of pointless text and events in it. Like when Jesse just decides to punch his little sister in the face, for no reason. And when he is milking the cow and he uses the utter like a gun and squirts his girlfriend in the ear with fresh milk. If I had time I would type more but I don't, and I'm lazy.

When I was eleven, I never went about creating &quot;magical lands&quot;. Kids hear too much of nasty words already, they shouldn't get more by read this book. It was overall unenjoyable, and the dull plot did not help the lame characters, and idiotic fantasy-land!

I am however very disappointed with the authors choice to use curse words in the book. The audience for this book ranges from 3rd graders and up.

I was shocked at the profanity in God's name and even the profanity not in God's name since this is a fifth-graders book. The characters, especially Jesse's family, were so hateable I can't say I liked a single one. And the whole magical land thing, these kids should get lives. It was not realistic at all. Leslie died at the end of the book when she drowned in a stream during a storm. She would have to be really really really stupid to try and get to Teribithia that way during a storm.

It has stayed in my memory because I disliked it so much. IT begins well, as a coming of age story between two friends, a boy and a girl, in their imaginary world. Then, just when the reader thinks what a nice and uplifting book this must be, it seems as though the author doesn't know how to let these two friends grow up together, or grow apart, or whatever they might realistically do, and kills off the girl. I don't think there is any reason for this, and certainly, kids in late elementary/early junior high feel bad enough about life in general, and themselves specifially. They don't need to read depressing nonsense as well. It's just my opinion, but if you don't like sad books, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I bough a new, but a receive a used book. I'm really dessapoinment.

But in a way, the story of Bridge to Terabithia has given me much more than knowledge.It is touching to see the way Leslie's friendship changed Jesse's life. The impact of friendship was so well illustrated and well expressed that readers can't help but be touched.Katherine Paterson also discussed many in depth topics very subtly in Bridge to Terabithia, such as friendship, death, family relations and so on and so forth, bringing the readers forth to understand the characters more and more deeply. In a way, readers can actually FEEL themselves in the character's shoes, especially in the last few chapters where Jesse experienced the different stages of griefing for Leslie's death.To conclude, I feel that Bridge to Terabithia is a rather exceptional book, and because I can really relate to it, I have only positive thoughts to say about it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Jess Aarons, a small town boy, practiced each year for a race that happened at school.

Neither of them knew whis would be the start of a magical friendship. Together they created a kingdom named Terabithia. Jess was the king, and Leslie the queen. In order to get to this wondrous place, they had to cross a fragile bridge over a stream. Both knew they were great friends, but never knew how long their friendship would last.Bridge to Terabithia is the perfect book to illustrate friendship. Katherine Patterson presents a well-crafted novel showing the unique relationship between Jess and Leslie. She emphasizes how important friends really are and how you should always appreciate them.Bridge to Terabithia is a touching novel that allows you to realize how big a part your friends play in your life.

Then one day when he was about to run a race Leslie came along and raced, and won. Jesse was interested in her because she won the race, so then they started talking. Around two days later they pulled pranks on the bullies. Then the others made fun of the bullies when they fell for the pranks. Then after a week or so they made up a place called Terrabithia and hung out there a lot! Then one day Jesse didn't want to go to Terrabithia but Leslie did. Then a tragedy struck. Jesse did not believe it...I gave this book four stars because it got me off track reading it because it got too deep into the story or people.

Last year, every boy in the fourth and fifth grade had races during recess, and Jess won once. He was praised all day long, but the next day he lost and was forgotten about. For his fifth grade year, Jess wanted to be the best runner and experience what he experienced the day that he won. That is why he would wake-up very early in the morning, before the rest of his siblings, and start to run. One day when he was running, he met his new neighbor, Leslie.The day that school started, the races began again. Leslie joined in, even though none of the boys wanted her to, and she ran faster than everyone that was racing did. This made Jess very upset because he had been the one who let Leslie join them, and she stole his dream of becoming the fastest kid in the 5th grade. He hated her for a while, but finally they became friends and were practically inseparable. The two of them created a fort that they pretended was a magical land, and became the rulers.I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a great story for young children, and shows the power of friendship. The story got me extremely emotional, and I always wanted to know what would happen next. The only problem that I had with it was the way that some of the characters would talk with a southern accent and I didn't always follow what they were saying because of this.

I love this book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Book: Bridge of TerabithiaBy: Katherine PatersonHave you ever read the book Bridge of Terabithia by Katherine Paterson? Well for those whom have not read this book let me tell you a little bit about it. This book is about two kids, a girl and a boy. They became best friends by the end but that's not how it starts. Well Leslie was the girl that moved into the old Perkins place which was just up the road a little ways from Jesse's house. Leslie and her family move in and Jesse found this out because he was running like his does every day in the summer because he wants to be the fastest kid in the 5th grade. Well by the time school started Leslie and Jesse have already met even though at the time Jesse didn't like her, he thought of a rich little girl with no t.v. But then he started to stick up for her like at school because she wouldn't hang out with girls, she wanted to hang out with the guys. But all the guys didn't want her there so they told her to go hang out with the girls. She said no and told them that she wanted to race they were like what ever she will never beat us. But they were all wrong after their race she became the fastest girl in the 5th grade but she was even the fastest out of the guys too. Jesse and Leslie went though some good but hard times. Jesse and Leslie became inseparable. Jesse would get up, do his chores, and spend the rest of the day with Leslie. If you want to know more about this book read it for yourself.Well Leslie and Jesse are the main characters of this book. But let's look at some of the other characters. Leslie's dad is a secondary character, but he also becomes friends and has fun with the kids. Jesse's mom and dad were secondary charters and when they were mentioned in the book they were always telling Jesse what to do. May Belle is Jesse's little sister. May Belle was like your normal sister, she was a pest most of the time but not all of the time. Jesse's other sisters really were mean older sisters and they liked to pick on Jesse even when he found out the bad news. They made fun of him that Leslie was his girl friend but Jesse didn't think so, he just thought that they were really good friends.I would recommend this fictional book to anybody that likes to read or likes a page turner. This book is a book that I think a girl would like more then a guy would because it's sad but I think that a guy might like it too but it wouldn't be their favorite book. I would call this book a page turner because some thing is always happening and you just want to know what's going to happen next like what would happen if someone ever found out about Terabithia? I personally could connect to the characters and what they felt because of what happened to Leslie happened to one of my very close friends. I think that the ending of the book was the best because I can connected to it and because Jesse's feelings about Leslie really show."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I have yet to meet a student who wasn't moved by Katherine Paterson's story of friendship and loss. Bridge to Terabithia introduces the reader to Jess Aarons, whose main goal in life is to be the fastest runner in the fifth grade. Jess is outdone by his new neighbor Leslie Burke, a faster runner who has move into the farmhouse next door. Despite this inauspicious beginning, Aaron and Jess soon become fast friends who build an imaginary kingdom together called Terabithia. As their friendship deepens, so does the reader's understanding of the book's complex themes: being true to oneself, coping with death, and finding the courage to build metaphorical bridges to others. As Paterson commented, \\"I discovered gradually and not without a little pain that you don't put together a bridge for a child. You become one--you lay yourself across the chasm.\\"Teachers and curriculum directors in the Boston Public Schools have been so impressed by the powerful themes in Bridge to Terabithia that they have selected it as one of six core novels for sixth graders as part of the Max Warburg Courage Curriculum. The other five novels are: Taking Sides, Number the Stars, Maniac Magee, So Far from the Bamboo Grove, and Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. As with Bridge to Terabithia, each novel addresses the theme of courage--different types of courage, what it takes to act courageously, and how even small acts of courage can have enormous consequences in everyday life.As an Educational Consultant for the Courage Curriculum, I highly recommend Bridge to Terabithia as a book that will make a lasting impression on adolescent readers."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I thought it was a really good book.But it was really sad when Leslie died.

Jess Aaron's parents are horrible parents and his sisters are the same, except for Mae Belle. The only uplifting point in this book is when he meets Leslie Burk, but that also ends tragically. I do not believe that the author did enough foreshadowing for the awful event that happens near the end of the book. It was a total shock! She could have done a better job warning the reader ahead of time, especially because this is a children's book. One of the main reasons that children read is for pleasure, and there is nothing pleasurable about this book. The tone was extremely sad throughout most of the book. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I like Katherine Paterson as an author and it is well written, but I really think she has many other better books out there. This book was too depressing for me to read. I prefer something a little bit more uplifting when I read."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I'm going to record the summary of this book as I read it in the front of the original 1977 original. \\"The life of a ten-year-old boy in rural Virginia expands when he becomes friends with a newcomer who subsequently meets an untimely death trying to reach their hideaway, Terabithia, during a storm\\". I was surprised, on reading it, at how an accurate summary of a book's plot can make it seem entirely different than the story itself. I'm also quite glad I didn't read it prior to actually reading the book. Not that I didn't know that the character Leslie (the tomboy that befriends the book's protagonist) was going to die. This book was fairly well known when I was a child of the 1980s and everybody knew, without even reading it, that in it a girl dies. In fact, for years I lay under the mistaken impression that Jesse (the story's hero) carries the body of Leslie back to Terabithia for one last time. There's even an illustration in the book that makes it look as if this scene is taking place. When I read the book for myself, I was shocked to find that this little piece of commonly known lore was, in fact, patently untrue. More importantly, I found that my early perceptions of this novel as a boring and depressing novel were far off the mark.The book is a good hard slog, but it has its enjoyable moments as well. There are sweet but not overly sentimental points in the story that give the book more meaning than it might otherwise have. I was touched by Jesse's affection for his younger sisters. His older sisters were displayed as demons, but you can't help but notice that when Jesse isn't thinking directly about them, they show some compassion for others. For example, they pool their money with Jesse to buy their younger sister a Barbie for Christmas.Quite frankly, I liked the book almost against my will. I can't imagine that all kids would enjoy it, but they should at least give it a chance. The late 70s feel of it is particularly interesting, though kids probably won't get some of the older references. This book would pair best with another tale in which a strange kid comes to town and befriends the narrator such as Kate DiCamillo's \\"The Tiger Rising\\" or, better yet, David Almond's \\"Skellig\\"."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is not a book I would read over and over agian.

This was probably the greatest book I have ever read. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 10, that is how good it was.The main characters in this book are, Jess, Leslie and their dog P.T.. the main theme in this book is Terabithia their imaginary world. Jess thought he was going to be the fastest kid in the fifth grade, which does not happen because the new girl Leslie Burke beat him to the finish. Jess and Leslie ended up being best friends and King and Queen of Terabithia. Jess gave Leslie P.T. for Christmas and P.T. became Prince Terrien.I think you should read the book before you see the movie because you can understand what is going on better. If you like Katherine Paterson's books you will love this one. I personally think this is the greatest book ever made. Once you get into it a little you are going to be hooked , you will never want to put it down.

It tells a story of a boy named Jess who lives in the country. A few chapters into the book, he's bound to find that a young girl, Leslie Burke, moves into the &quot;old perkin's place.&quot; Jess wants nothing to do with Leslie until he finds out how fast and talented she is at running. You see, all summer Jess has been working to be the fastest kid in the fifth-grade. When he finds that Leslie beats him the first day of school he is frustrated, yet fasinated at the same time. He's around Leslie quite alot because they're in the same class, and live next door to each other. Jess soon finds that Leslie isn't too bad, and quickly they become the very best of friends. They make a place called Terabithia. Leslie is queen, and Jess is king. They go to Terabithia alot, and share many great adventures until BOOM, something happens. Katherine Paterson uses very descriptive phrases to put a clear picture in your mind. She also uses catchy words so that you don't ever get bored. This book was exciting, sad, and funny at the same time. I think one of the main reasons it was so good was because the author explains and tells a good story so well. I don't think there is anything I would change in this book if I had a chance. It is all so exciting and clear. I thought this book was good for only one more reason. When you are in the middle of the book, you know what is going on, but you don't really know what the point of all the information is. When you read some of the last few pages, it all comes together inside your head, and BANG, it all comes clear. There is a reason for the name of this book, and if you want to know, I sugest you take a trip to the library."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"&quot;I'm Leslie. You could say I have the kind of name that goes backwards and forwards.&quot; Jess Aarons is timid enough worrying about being the fastest runner in the fifth grade. But when Leslie Burke (or Burke Leslie) moves next door, Jess's life changes. Leslie is something else when she beats the fifth grade boys in a race. But that's not all. To straighten out their lives, she and Jess make up an imaginary kingdom called Terabitha. Life there is wonderful - unlike their own lives. Jess has sisters who don't understand him and a father who thinks drawing &quot;is one of the horrible things that school teaches you&quot; and Leslie's parents don't own a TV, which makes her the outcast of the fifth grade. Yet when Jess gets a chance to go to the Museum of Natural History on a very rainy day, he just has to take Leslie with him. But his teacher wants just each other, and so they go. Yet, when Jess returns home &quot;your girl-friend's dead, and Momma thought you were dead too&quot; - he finds out Leslie has died. This book I first read in third grade and a friend told me it was sad. I checked it out of the school library... and put it down on my desk to remember. Unfortunately, the next day, I found out someone had returned it! I never found it in the library again, but now, finding it in a bookstore, I have read it millions of times and thought it was a good book to read if you are struggling with loss. If you finish this book read &quot;The Great Gilly Hopkins&quot; or &quot;Lyddie&quot; - these three books define the time of growing up, and are three wonderful books!P.S. &quot;The Great Gilly Hopkins&quot; and &quot;Bridge To Terebitha&quot; were Newbery Honors and Award."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book is one of the greatest books for young readers.

As you seep further in to the world of Jesse Aarons, you find that a major disaster is about to occur.

The rest of the staff all raved about it. I didn't care for it.It's reasonably well written, the storyline is easy to follow, the two central characters are reasonably well developed, and it is very good at pulling you around by your emotions.But instead of being a reasonably accurate portrayal of a 10- to 12-year-old's coming-of-age, it always strikes me as being some adult's fantasy about how a child might respond emotionally to tragedy (or pathos), if only he or she happened to have an adult's experience and perspective.It does not surprise me to learn that the books was inspired by a terrible loss in the author's personal life: the book's measured and ultimately didactic feel makes one assume that it was written to exorcise personal grief and to share Truths which were purchased at great personal cost.I personally didn't care for the book, and it didn't ring true for me (or apparently for many students), but it does seem to appeal to adults, particularly the caring, child-centered, empathetic, motherly sort of person that typifies the majority of suburban elementary school teachers.In some schools, \\"Bridge\\" is a standard book for about the fourth or fifth grade. The level of understanding that these students usually have is: \\"They didn't like each other because she could run faster, then they were friends, then she died, and it was sad.\\"Ten-year-olds, however, do not really understand what they author is saying about making friends, the value of imagination, the nature of human relationships, the effect of emotions, the presence of death, the enormity of grief -- even the futility of saying anything after a funeral, and the importance of saying it anyway.In other words, they aren't able to understand why this book is Real Literature, and not Just Another Book for practicing reading skills.If your goal is to introduce a discussion of affective issues, I'd suggest that you save this book for junior high or even lower high school students, instead of giving it to the upper-elementary school students upon whom this book is usually inflicted: Just because the average fourth grader can decode the words on the pages does NOT mean that they have enough experience (maturity) to understand what the author wants to tell them.(I'd make an exception for a grief-related student support group: if a fourth-grader has actually lost a friend or family member, then he or she would be in a better position to understand the purpose of the book.But most 9- to 12-year-olds [and those who teach them] are encouraged to steer clear of this book.)"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I bought this for my grandaughters.

We did not get to see the movie to compare how it followed the book ,events left out of the movie,etc. Recomend this book for children over 12.

Not until he meets Leslie, the new neighbour girl, does he come to realise just how much more world there is out there for an artistic soul such as himself; Leslie (whose writer parents have given up their tv and moved away from the city to give their daughter a better childhood) is an imaginative, precocious girl who shows Jess a fantasy world that changes his life forever.Most of the story is about their blossoming friendship, but it is the final few chapters, which deal with tragedy and Jess's experience with grief that are so compelling and sensitively written.This is a true classic for intermediate-aged children."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I was introduced to this book by a friend of mine when we were 11. We read it out loud to one another. Then, the next summer, a male friend of mine died suddenly. I read the book again that fall and I can honestly say it was the only help I had in grieving my friend. I was surrounded by adults who were grieving themselves and had no way to explain the death of an 11-year-old to his 12-year-old friend. Jessie's reactions, his pain, and his rage mirrored mine. At a time when I felt most abandoned, BtoT was there for me and helped me feel normal again. Fifteen years (the last one in therapy) later, I have come to realize how important this book was and is to me. I think it is the most accurate portrayal of childhood grief that I have ever encountered. I was reminded of it again when I went to a &quot;Banned Books&quot; website. It ranks in the top five for being one of the books most often banned. I was completely caught off guard by this. I cannot believe that people would let &quot;cuss&quot; words get in the way of enjoying an important work. I couldn't remember any (until I read the review that actually COUNTED the &quot;bad&quot; words).

I don't remember much of the specifics of the book, other than how it made me feel. I recall a lot of sobbing - it was the first piece of literature that really touched me and I feel I have carried with me the messages this book brought to me throughout my life so far. I'm now 30, and I just ordered it to read again. I haven't read it since I was a child, but I know I will love it because when I think of it, all those memories and feelings come back in an instant. This novel is truly a great treasure and should be treated as such.For those who think the material is too mature for children under 13, I would say that it is never too early for a child to learn compassion and empathy. And I would challenge that most children see more innapropriate things just hanging out with their friends or playing video games. This novel contributed greatly to my love of reading, and I would highly recommend it to everyone.

The boy is JESS AARON, who lives on a farm with his Mom, Dad and two older/two younger sisters. The girl is LESLIE BURKE, an &quot;only&quot; child of professional writers who just moved from the city. Although at first you would think that these two were really very different, but they end up forging a friendship which is deep and loyal. Leslie is lonely in this new community and Jess also feels different and sometimes weird. However, when these two are paired, they seem to complement each other. At school there are always &quot;bullies&quot; who enjoy picking on little kids. There are also older kids who don't want the younger ones around or include them in activities, games or sports and of course, this book contains those. Leslie however is really different in that she doesnt' dress great, has SHORT hair, doesn't even have a television at home and she actually, can you believe this, wants to run in the BOYS ONLY races! With Jess' help, because he is taunted by a &quot;Bully&quot; Leslie is allowed to rce in the fifth grade BOYS ONLY race and surprisingly WINS! She wins every race, all the time too! Jess isn't too happy about this either as he practiced all summer running early before chores to increase his speed and he was certain HE would be the fastest runner in Fifth grade THIS YEAR. He wanted this so much because he felt this accomplishment would make HIM important. He was always being made fun of because of his drawing and painting, so this would make up for all that. This running thing would assure him a position of acceptance and make the other kids forget he was weird because of his painting. After Leslie wins all the races, the boys lose interest in running and the racing ENDS. Jess and Leslie become friends and find comfort in their friendship from the taunting world of school, teachers, their peers and even their families. It is fun for them to share their ideas and thoughts on EVERYTHING! They had secret looks in class and even cooperate together on problems. It's interesting that Jess and Leslie both liked their music teacher Ms. Edmunds. They also create a &quot;separate&quot; place just for themselves to share. It is there that they can SHUT OUT the rest of the world and feel special, away from the bullies and the taunting. There they pretend anything they want and plan things in this special place they call TERABITHIA. It is like a medieval knight type castle name. They even become the King and Queen of this pretend kingdom. It is here that they plan revenge on a big girl &quot;bully&quot; Janice who had stolen twinkies from Jess' little sister MayBelle. Later on they both regret the mean trick they played on her and Leslie takes pity on Janice and tries to comfort her. A truly sad part of the book is when Leslie drowns. Jess goes to a museum in Washington D.C. with Ms. Edmunds and has a &quot;PERFECT DAY&quot; over the Easter Holiday. That day, Leslie visits Terabithia alone and the rope you use to swing over the creek into their &quot;kingdom&quot; breaks, she falls and drowns. This is unexpected and sad news that Jess hears upon returning from his trip. He gets very angry when he thinks about his great friendship and what Leslie meant to him. She changed his life and now she was gone. His previously unhelpful, uncaring family NOW becomes supportive towards him during this time after Leslie's drowning. When his anger subsides, he realizes that he has a mission to pay back the world in &quot;BEAUTY AND CARING&quot; what Leslie had loaned him through her friendship when she provided him with her vision and strength. This is a great book and children can relate to many things which happen in the story. At the very end Jess actually builds a bridge from wood he gets from Leslie's Dad to cross into the kingdom of Terabithia. He also quite happily includes his little sister MAYBELLE into this kingdom and crowns her the new QUEEN of Terabithia."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Book Review for Bridge to TerabithiaBridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Paterson, takes place in a small town outside of Washington, D.C. The main characters in the book are Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke. Jess and Leslie become best friends and they create from their imagination a kingdom in the place,' she whispered. \`Even the rulers of Terabithia come into it only at times of greatest sorrow or of greatest joy. We must strive to keep it sacred'&quot; (Bridge to Terabithia , p.47).Terabithia is a special world only for Jess and Leslie, where they can be anything and not have to good thing, for how could Jess have ever explained it to an outsider? ...The closer he came to the dry creek bed and the crab apple tree rope the more he could feel the beating of his heart. He grabbed the end of the rope and swung out toward the other bank with a kind of wild exhilaration and landed gently on his feet, taller and stronger and wiser in that mysterious land (Bridge to Terabithia, p.46).Terabithia makes them feel better about themselves, gives them strength and makes them feel brave. When a terrible tragedy occurs, Jess is able to move on because of the strength that Terabithia and his friendship with Leslie gave to him.My favorite part in the Bridge to Terabithia is when Jess and Leslie build Terabithia. This is my favorite part in the book for many reasons. The first reason is that Terabithia starts Jess and Leslie's friendship. Secondly, Terabithia helps Jess and Leslie escape from their bullies, family and other problems. In addition to Terabithia providing an escape for Jess and Leslie, it also gives them courage to take on new and scary things. Finally, Terabithia gives Jess and Leslie confidence in themselves.

Thus, the stereotype is rather...inaccurate.No, that is not why I disliked this book. I disliked this book not because I can't understand death, but because I don't understand why the entire book would just be leading up to death, and that is all. There was nothing else in the ending--nothing about the main character recovering, moving on, etc., which is slightly more interesting. It seems to me that this book was written just so (*insert name here*) could die, and the main character could suffer the loss.Therefore, I found this book unlikeable.Note: Please, I hope I didn't offend anyone with this review in any way, shape, or form.

Alone.&quot; Katherine Paterson's book Bridge to Terabithia is loosely based on her son's reaction to the death of a friend. The novel follows the friendship between a farm boy, Jesse Aarons and his neighbor Leslie, the child of two &quot;hippie parents.&quot; Leslie is instrumental in Jesse's discovery of himself. Since Jesse's spirit, creativity and deep intellect are not nurtured at home, Leslie helps Jesse to realize the importance of all of these characteristics. In short, she helps him leave his &quot;old self behind.&quot; Sadly, Leslie is killed while trying to cross a river to get to the friends' secret kingdom of Terabithia. Strong female characters are important to Jesse throughout the novel. Obviously, Leslie shows her physical strength by beating all of the boys in the race during recess. The essay she writes for Ms. Meyers shows her outstanding intellect. Beyond that, Leslie's strong emotional leadership is evident in the way she interacts with Jesse. She helps Jesse find his inner strength by allowing him to be himself. Leslie's imagination sparks Jesse's once dormant imagination. She also encourages and facilitates his creativity. Leslie appreciates his artistic ability and even gives him paints and paper to draw with. Leslie sees Jesse as much more than a simple farm boy, and in turn Jesse sees himself as more. Leslie acts as a savior for Jesse's true self, the part of him that was languishing from lack of support from his family. Both of Jesse's teachers are portrayed as strong women. Miss Edmunds, the music teacher somewhat of a rebel with her radical teaching styles and her modern interests. She is unwilling to be intimidated by the school system or teachers. She also has a role in Jesse's emotional growth. She takes an active interest in him and encourages his drawing. Ms Meyers exhibits a different kind of strength in her domination over the class. However at the end of the novel her emotional strength is evident in the story she tells Jesse about the death of her husband. Ms. Meyers' story is one of the few things that helps Jesse in his time of great sorrow, making Ms. Meyers another strong female role in Jesse's life. Beyond being a story about the death of a friend Bridge to Terabithia is about emotional growth. The strong women in the novel play pivotal roles in the emotional growth of Jesse."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"It started when Jess Oliver Aarons Jr. became best friends with his new neighbor, Leslie Burke.

Jess wanted to be the fastest runner in fifth grade, so Leslie challenged him, and she won. Soon they became friends and they had their own imaginary kingdom in the heart of a nearby forest, just over a dried-up creek. They swung over the creek bed on a rope and built their own fort with leftover wood from home improvements. They always go there to escape their not-so-perfect lives. One rainy day when Jess is out of town Leslie decides she needs to check on Terabithia. She tried to swing over the rising water in the creek bed on the rope but she feel in. She died from drowning. Jess then builds a bridge over the creek to honor her, the Bridge to Terabithia. I highly recommend this book.I really like this book because it has a lot of good background information. Both of the characters are round. For example, it tells about Jess's sisters, which is his reason to get away. Also it tells about how Leslie is weird and no one understands her.I also like this book because of the details and reasons. After they say Leslie is weird they include what she looks like and why. She hardly ever wears dresses because she isn't very girly. She is weird because she is a girl who looks and acts like a boy.I like how only Jess is dynamic and Leslie, the static character, is the one that changes him. She shows him winning isn't everything, and how to be a true friend.The best reason to read this book is because of the emotion. The ending is very sad and you feel his sorrow and you feel the sadness and solemnness during the building of the bridge. Again, I would highly recommend this book.- L.

Within few pages, Paterson gives a clear and honest interpretation of events and characters that are both easy to relate to and powerfully moving. The workmanship of Paterson is unmistakable in this poignant presentation small town life and its accompanying struggles. Paterson confirms her reputation as a skilled writer and presents readers with yet another inspiring text.Perhaps the greatest strength of A Bridge to Terabithia is found in Paterson's portrayal of the emotional effects of death. The words used and the emotions expressed are both honest and candid. Jess's character responds to Leslie's death with confusion and misunderstanding. He believes he should be feeling depressed and overcome with sorrow while he feels despondent and overwhelmed. This state of confusion and misunderstood emotions adds authenticity to Jess's character and once again strengthens Paterson's reputation for creating genuine characters with genuine emotions.Paterson delves into greater questions of life, death, and religion yet manages to do so through tender and light hearted situations and experiences. Paterson intelligently present issues of salvation and spirituality and intentionally leaves elements unresolved, complicated, and unanswered. While the themes of the book range from comedy to indescribable loss, the book itself remains fluid and seamless as it progresses and leaves the reader with an opportunity to consider overarching themes and issues themselves.In addition to the skillful writing of Patterson, illustrations by Donna Diamond proved to be a delightful addition to the text. The marksmanship within them reflect back to Jess's fascination with drawing and the simplicity of the content of each image proved to enrich the overall reading experience.Amidst the many strengths of the book, however, it would appear as if some of the characters within the text could use further development. The book itself was so concise that many of the characters seemed more like acquaintances and less like friends the readers could closely relate with. An example of the books brevity affecting the depth of a character is most aptly portrayed in Leslie's character. Just as soon as the reader begins to understand Leslie's outspoken and adventurous spirit she is removed from the plot altogether. Perhaps the limited depth of the characters could have been remedied by allowing the reader more time with the characters by lengthening the book itself. While the characters throughout the book are sincere and the plot line is stimulating, the only particular weakness of the book proved to be the loss of character development on account of its limited length.A Bridge to Terabithia is a wonderful gem of a book that proved to be a wonderful afternoon read. The possibilities for its use are numerous and extend form casual reading to exploration within the middle school classroom. Katherine Patterson once again proves herself as a wonderfully gifted and accomplished story teller and author through this book. A Bridge to Terabithia is a welcome addition to any home library and will be treasured by adolescent literature enthusiasts for years to come."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Somehow I wonder about that second question, because it has become apparent to me that many adults who judge this book as either language or age-inappropriate do not fully comprehend the capacity of the mind of a fifth-grader. I was 10 years old once, in fifth-grade, and was assigned to read this book. What I read then struck home and resonated with me. The emotions of feeling like an outsider, loneliness, despair, joy, anger, jealousy, love, and kinship all present in this book were described so vividly that, in my mind, I felt like Jess. He and I, at that point in time, were indistinguishable. I still have the book review and editorial I wrote in fifth-grade about Bridge, so deeply moved I felt by this book -- it's the only artifact I kept from my elementary school days. As I read this book again, at age 29, the themes resonated the same chords within me. I wonder how these reviewers who proclaim to be good judges of appropriateness can stand idly by and state that the book has no value for age range indicated. To the teachers who believe that all kids (grades 4-6) get out of the book is Jess doesn't like Leslie because she runs faster than him, but then they become friends, and then she dies and it is sad... you're NOT doing your job as a teacher. Your duty is to teach, and by teaching you need to challenge your students to look beyond the words at the underlying themes and emotions. If you don't think fifth-graders are capable of this type of interpretation, then you are sorely underestimating their mental capacity.

Our fifth grade class enjoyed this story very much because many of us could relate to the themes in this book. It is a well-deserved winner of the Newbery Medal.

This is a book that won't disappoint you, so make the effort to pick it up and read it!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The book that I read was Bridge to Terabithia it is by Katherine Paterson and is fiction. The theme of this book is perseverance because that's what Travis had to do all through out the book he was faced with many things but he kept his head high and persevered through it.Bridge to Terabithia is about a boy named Travis who is not the richest kid on the block and not the most accepted one either. He lives on a farm with his big family and is the only boy which means he has all the duties in the house because his dad is out in the city for his job in the day time. When Travis goes to school he usually daydreams or draws which most of the kids make fun of him for. He is a loner until he meets the new girl at school who is also his new next door neighbor. He meets her when she beats him and all the other boys at a race which sort of makes Travis look up to her even though she's only a girl. The two soon become the best of friends and share many adventures together. One of them was making Terabithia, the made up land where the two rule. But one day the world shatters underneath travis's feet and nothing will ever be the same. At first he is defeated and is very upset but soon after he will realize that he will have to learn to persevere and try to make the best out of what is in front of him.I really enjoyed this book because it made me feel like I was right beside them. That's how good of a mood the author created. When the characters were sad I was sad. When the characters were excited so was I. the other reason I enjoyed it was because of all the details put in the book. I could see exactly what was happening, or the view they were looking at, or the things they were smelling or the things they were hearing.I really loved this book and would recommended it to any and everybody. It's a timeless classic that you can read over and over again."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The book Brige to Terabithia is a very good book.I was in the play and it was awsome so buy the book!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I work at a library and one day working in the children's section, I came across this book and the memories came flooding back. I heard this book for the first time in fifth grade when my teacher read it to our class. We all liked the story and were totally shocked by the heartbreaking ending. I remember realizing what was going to happen and seeing my teacher crying as she read to us the ending. And several of us girls looked at each other and began crying too. This book is good and I'll always remember it because its a classic example of friendship and the bonds that make it beautiful."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book tells the story of Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke.The two friends make a kingdom called Terabithia.Then one day a tragedy occurs.I think you should read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"A HEART-WARMING BOOK"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Teribethia is an emotional story with a quickly learned moral many people learn the hard way.

I got to read it in grade 7 in school for English Literature (yes, quite easy for grade 7), and it's a book that I will never ever forget. The ending was unbelievable, though, but it didn't make me dislike the whole thing. It's just a fact that everyone will go through, only depending on when and how.

I hated this book!! The story is fine. Maybe kids might get something deep from this but I doubt it. From the first page, the characters are all dark and ugly to each other. There is no respect shown for any authority figure in the book from parents to teachers. There is no love or respect between any siblings. There are plenty of cuss words throughout the book. There are illusions to a child/teacher inappropriate relationship. There is a whole discussion about God d---- people to h---. The words in this book can't be typed in this review, so why would you allow your child to read them?? The death of the child holds no meaning, because I didn't feel anything for any of the characters and there's no great lesson in the death either. There are lots of references to killing people \\"by the childen\\"! Such things like \\"I'd like to kill him/her\\" said repeatedly, like it's ok to say that. The parents are portrayed as insignificant and stupid. There are illusions that the boy may turn out gay because he draws. There are lots of mean remarks about fat people. I have no idea how this book got an award and why it has 800 star reviews. I only know I am sick that my daughter got this book as a gift and read it before I checked it out. There is nothing edifying in this book whatsoever and I'm probably on damage control for the next 6 months with my child."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"PLEEEEEASE THIS BOOK IS THE MOST BORING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!

It was SO boring. I hate stories about idiot kids who make up fake places and think they're real. Or fake people or things, etc. It was a HORRIBLE book. I had no interest in it and every day when it was time to read I got SO upset because I did NOT want to read it! It was a HUGE waste of time. The only reason my class liked it is because there are some swear words in it and we thought it was funny to hear our teacher swear. Honestly, I don't know why we had to read it and why the teachers keep making us read it. Even if there is a good message. If the kids aren't interested in a book they won't retain it and won't understand the message. We kept reading it just so we'd know it would be over eventually. Among the other books I had to read in school that I hated: Maniac Magee, True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, Tuck Everlasting, and MAROO OF THE WINTER CAVES! They were all disgustingly bad."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book is about a young boy who is in the fifth grade that wants to be the fastest boy in the fourth and fifth grade.

But still, I highly recommend it to kids in third grade and over."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"My students and I completely loved this story of an unlikely friendship between Jess and Leslie. The story picks up fast and never slows down. My students hated to hear the timer go off because they knew we were out of time for the day.

I'd heard it was a wonderful book, but I never would have believed how wonderful had I not read it myself."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I love this book. I'm not sure when I first read it. Maybe in fourth grade. It made a strong impression. These were real characters that I could relate to. The kids in school who made fun of what they don't understand, the younger sister who wants to come along when she isn't welcome. This book made me feel more grown up. The events in the book are tragic and yet show how you can take the good things and honor them by sharing and passing them on.My sister is not a reader. She has finished three works of fiction that were not forced on her in school.

The writing I thought was very good. Overall the story itself was well written but in the end it just got sad. I think it did jump around a bit and too many characters were used throughout the story that didn't move the story along very well. I also kept waiting for something great to happen but nothing did. It was a story about average kids growing up in a small town and then a sad ending. There was no major problem to solve and the fantasy element was simple imagination.

I always read them first so I can discuss them with her later. I confess that I didn't see the movie, but am going on the movie trailers, which indicate some really wild imaginery creatures. The book hints at some action between the two characters and some inhabitants of Terabithia, but doesn't get very specific. I'm sure the movie was great, but it surely did stretch the text.Bottom line, if you saw the movie, don't expect the same action in the book.This is a wonderful story and a great message, though.Good book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"omg i love this book. a little profanity but i reccomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I am a fifth grade student from Waldron Mercy Academy (MG)This book is a real stinker.

This well-written story of friendship between a boy (Jess) and a girl (Leslie) and her sudden death had a strong effect on me as a fifth grader who was dealing with the recent death of her grandmother. Bridge to Terabithia is also memorable for me because Katherine Paterson came to my elementary school to promote her book, and invited us to talk to her afterwards. I approached her to tell her how much I enjoyed the book and why it was important to me personally. When she heard my story about my grandmother, she said, of course, &quot;write about it!&quot; It's taken 29 years but I'm finally doing it.Bridge to Terabithia is a classic story about friendship/love between a young boy and girl, but it's also a great book for helping kids deal with death for the first time.

For instance when a main charector goes somewhere with a teacher and comes home to A tragity and it makes you think why. I also like that the whole book is real. From bullies to tragitys.The book is also quite funny. Like whrn two main charcters try to get back at a bully.Although the book is a good book there are a few parts I didn't like. For instance when the tragity happens it brught back memories from when the same tragity happned to my best friend.I also didn't like the part where Jess hits his little sister, because if you're like me you can feel her pain. Thoes are the only things I didn't like.So in a way I both recomend and don't recomend this book.

Let me tell you, The Bridge to Terabithia is right up there in the great literature stratosphere. Even when I was a child I recognized this book as one of the greatest books I would ever read. You can really relate to the characters and the ending would make a prison inmate cry (in my opinion).If you are looking for a really good story that you will remember for the rest of your life and want to reread everyday, The Bridge to Terabithia is the book for you."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book is very touching and very emotional towards the end. The book reminds me of my little 9 year old sister because she always imagines that she is in her own little world. She pretends that she is in a spaceship like Jess and Leslie were pretending they were in a magical kingdom. I would recommend this book for other kids because of the way it shows friendship and you can learn to be careful what you wish for. It might be harder for young kids to understand."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is about a boy and a girl who build their own magical fort with their own rules.

It is a great book because it has great descriptions and details, like all the other books Katherine Paterson has wrote. In the book, a lot of stuff you did not expect happens. Also, a lot of funny things happen,but near the end,there is a big tragedy.My favorite part was when Jess and Leslie were in a race and Leslie won by a hair. It was exciting to know who won. I would recommend &quot;Bridge to Terabithia &quot; to any boy or girl."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"&quot;Bridge To Terabithia&quot; is the best book in the world!!!

Don't click, double click to buy this book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Most of the books that I read during childhood haven't held up when I go back to them as adults--but this one does. I remember empathizing with the female protagonist of this story--I was a tomboy, I had male friends, and I had a fantastic imaginative life. This book takes us into the heads and hearts of a boy and girl who dare to become friends at the age when that is sure to cause ridicule, and it takes us into the fantasy world that they create together. Because you become so involved with them and their world, it is all too tragic when reality intrudes at the end of the book.A great book by itself, but possibly also a great tool to teach children about death--particularly the untimely death of friends."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The book I read was the Bridge to Terabithia. I really enjoyed this book because it is like my seventh grade life. I have a bully in my school that is almost like Janice Avery. In the bok she is so mean, but inside she is really hurting. Another way Leslie Burkes is so fearless, but in the end her bravery puts her to her doom. In my school some kids think they're so brave by skipping class, but by the end of the day they will probably will end up with ISS. Jess reminds me of myself (except for he is a boy, and i am a girl)! Like Jess, i also love to draw, and I am a sort of normal kid. I have plenty of real close friends too. In my school we have a teacher just like Ms. Edmunds. This teacher dresses sort of weird, he loves to draw, and he loves t odo stuff with kids. I think if you give this book a chance, then you would enjoy it as much as I did. I see why it is the winner of the Newberry Medal!!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Whae we first started reading this book,I thought it was going to be a little kid's book and not a good story. The story is about a boy named Jesse who gets up every morning and runs. One morning he met a girl named Leslie, he and she became best friends .On a rainy Sunday morning his music teacher came and picked him up and they went to the museum, he forgot to tell Leslie where he was going and that he would not be able to meet her. When he comes home, his parents tell him that she is dead and that she died trying to get over the water to get to Terribethia My favorite part is the praying ceromonies they have and how they dress in flowers. I liked the ending because it ended right if she would't have died then it would not have been such a sad story. I liked this story and I think you should read it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I found this book to be boring. It did not have much action in it. The story is Jesse Arrons meets a girl named Leslie that has just recently moved close to him. They have small adventures to different places. The part I liked best was when Leslie meets one of her best friends."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I thought this book was excellent. It helps children to learn that endings are not always perfect, but you can survive tragedy. It gives children a chance to face reality. It also lets children know that it is alright to be different. I thought that it was really sad that Leslie had to die, but it is real life and I feel that children should be exposed to death. I feel through Jess and Leslie's experiences that children can learn ways to deal with death and with being different. I thought that having an imaginary place such as terabithia to teporarily escape the pains of this world was a great addition to the book. We all have places to escape and it helps us to release those pressures of the world. Bridge to Terabithia could have been written with many of our own life experiences in mind. Oh! The pain of growing up."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Excessive swearing? No plot? Slow?! How depressing...I was read this book in fifth grade and still, over ten years later, recall the profound experience the story was for me. I recommend it to others as one of my favorite books from childhood...one of the first that dealt with real issues. So, for all of you elementary age kids out there looking for a good book (besides Super Fudge), go straight to the library for this one. You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this book. I first encountered this story in fourth grade and enjoyed it greatly, however it was not until I became an adult and read it once again that I truly understood what it was about.

This book is great for kids, but even better for grown-ups."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"i read this book for the first time many years ago and am glad to just have been reminded of its exsitence as it is a book worth remembering. written for a younger audience it teaches an early, yet very important lesson about life when the climax is reached. it's something that happens in life and this is an excellent book for helping kids come to grips with this chilling, yet certain reality. a wonderful read if given to the appropriate age."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I thought this was the best book I ever read. Whenever Jesse says 'Lord' it helps the story, it's part of the dialect. His mother is southern, and the way the speech is written you can hear the way they would say it.

It all starts out with a boy named Jess Aarons who has practiced all summer to be the fastest in the fifth grade. His confidence is crushed when a new girl named Leslie Burke comes and sweeps right by him while racing. Jess is upset about this &quot;tomboy&quot; who has come to his school, and dislikes her at first.Leslie is a new girl who doesnt mind playing with boys, doesnt really fit in with girls, and has just won a race that obviously made a lot of boys mad. As time goes on, Jess and Leslie become friends. They start to spend all their time together, and soon are the best of friends. They take walks, talk, play, and even made their own kingdom called Terabithia.The author describes the setting very well, and has a way of showing the reader just how leslie and jess are together. There is a excellent description of Terabithia, and how their imagination runs wild.The two kids friendship grows so tight, and when faced with a terrible tragedy, it shows how it is handled and delt with. I think this book can realate well with young readers, and is a great book to have in your elementry classroom if your going to be a teacher.The book tells how Jess grows up from the summer of his fifth grade to the point where he is making decisions on his own, and having to deal with tragedy. The part that deals with the tragedy is very sad, but it does a great job showing the realities of life."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This wonderful story teaches children how to imagine and care, and go on after tragedy.

Anyone who has gone on make-believe adventures with their best friend will enjoy this book. The theme of friendship can be found in many great works of literature and Katherine Paterson's book is wonderful because she develops her characters.Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke, the main characters, were more than best friends. Out of all the words in a dictionary, Katherine Paterson picked the perfect one to describe their friendship: bridged. Just as a bridge links two places, their friendship connected them.Life was boring on the farm and full of problems for Jesse. His family had little money and he was ridiculed by the school children because of his drawings. The school children would ridicule him because he was too poor to afford artistic supplies, such as paints, pastels, colored pencils, etc. All he could use were stubby, school crayons that broke when you pressed down on them. Leslie stopped the ridicule by giving him some of the supplies a normal artist had. However, they would have never met if Leslie's parents had not decided to move. They chose the Perkin's place right next door to Jesse.At first, Leslie was upset when her parents moved. She had gotten use to the city and popularity. Leslie was bored and lonely. So was Jesse. When they met, however, everything changed for good. Jesse had Leslie to support him and she was one less person to ridicule him. Leslie also benefited from the friendship. Jesse was the only one who did not ridicule her for wearing shorts and a T-shirt instead of the normal gear or eating yogurt. She, in addition, had someone to share her imagination with. They were true friends. The creation of Terabithia plunged them further still into friendship. Leslie wanted a place of freedom. That is what the woods became.Leslie decided that the woods were a perfect place for their freedom. They built a stronghold next to a spacious pine groove. The woods were named Terabithia: a secret kindom where they could be rulers. At first, Jesse was not interested in making up an imaginary land. He, in the beginning, did not believe some imaginary place would help him. Then he realized he needed a friend. One less person to ridicule him was a great reward for some imagination. It was more then great. He was a king. No one could bother the place or them. Terabithia was forever strong and defended. The pine grove was even better. There he imagining spirits of all kinds watching them. The pine needles made the carpet for this separate castle all of its own. Leslie's time with Jesse made them understand each other more and made their problems disappear for while.No one argued more than Jesse's mother did. There was always some complaint. One of her major topics was Leslie and Jesse's father ignored Leslie rather rudely, but nothing could stop their friendship, however. They were stuck together. Jess needed Leslie. Without her, he was as empty as a newly made gourd. He said,\\"I grew strong and courageous. Without Leslie, I was without guts.\\" I can easily say they trusted each other. Jesse said, \\"We always walked together. I didn't push away.\\" He went deep in the woods with her where he previously thought was haunted. Leslie expected Jesse to be ready for their trudge to Terabithia every day. Rain or shine, Jesse always was. Jesse even forgot Leslie was a city kid. He grew to be comfortable with her.The theme friendship develops the story's characters. It brings them together and makes the inseparable. As the friendship progresses so does the story. It weaves in and out of the pages connecting their meaning. This makes Bridge to Terabithia a great read. I watched the quick formation of the friendship and thought, \\"Wow, nothing can stop them. That is how I want to be.\\"I enjoyed this book and I believe you will too. It is a great read for anyone who enjoys books about true friendship. I happen to be one of those people. If you decide to read it, you will want to share it. It is so original that it should be passed along a long line of your friends. Especially if you like books about friendship, you should read Bridge to Terabithia and share it with someone who enjoys the same theme."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"i really enjoyed this book. it sounded like it was a childrens book but as the book got more intense the books vocabulary got harder and harder.this story is touching and shows good friendship between 2 new friends and the problems one another go through and how they solve it.The book was a simple book to read realy no problems at all thats y i recomend it to almost all levels 4-above."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Last Spring, I sat at my desk and heard my nine-year-old daughter, Emma, making some gulping sounds from the couch across the room. Then I heard some unusual, animal-type sounds from her direction. I saw the book she was holding bob up and down. I looked past the book to her face and there were tears streaming down her cheeks.Right then she broke out in deep, heaving sobs.We went to see the movie shortly after that - and we both sobbed, even when we knew what was coming. I think I even said, \\"Oh, no,\\" aloud to the screen, as if my dismay could change the outcome.It took me several months to have the courage to read this book - and I am glad that I finally did.Bridge the Terabithia is the story of a young boy named Jess from a not-so-well-off family whose only dream - to be the fastest kid in school - who befriends the girl who snatches that dream away from him by running faster than any of the boys at Lark Creek School. Turns out Leslie - the girl, who moves into an old farmhouse near Jess' house - becomes one of Jess' great life teachers in more ways than one.Together they create the magical land of Terabithia, a place in the woods that becomes a safe haven as well as a place to come to understand some things that can't be explained using \\"regular\\" terms... to \\"regular kids\\"... Jess and Leslie are neither.This book is written, I am guessing, for fifth and sixth graders, primarily, but even younger children through adults could glean a lot from its pages. It could be seen as a simple story, but there are many layers to it.Parents ought to read it, too, so they can discuss the variety of issues that are raised in the pages - from parents being laid off, to art and music, to understanding and compassion, to dealing with difficult siblings and how to get along with others.Excellent read."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"(Warning: The summary below can be a book-spoiler)Jesse Oliver Aarons, Jr. is going on fifth grade, and he wants to be the fastest runner when summer vacation is over. Jesse practices running every day, racing around the cow field until his lungs are on fire and he is as hot as 'popping grease'. Then a girl moves into the house next door, and when school starts, this new girl becomes the running champion. Leslie Burke is from the suburbs, and in this rural town, she is seen as an oddity. Her parents are 'hippies'; they write for a living, and came to the country to 'reassess their value structure'. She doesn't have a television at home, she always wears pants to school, and she races with the boys.Jesse and Leslie become best friends; both are rather 'different' from others. Jesse loves to draw, a hobby he hides to avoid being called a sissy, and Leslie is wildy imaginative and loves reading books. Leslie and Jesse make a kingdom in the woods, in which they are king and queen, and call it Terabithia. Terabithia is separated from the farmland by a dry creek bed, which can be crossed by a long forgotten rope hanging from an old crab apple tree. With Leslie and her wild imagination, Jesse can escape his whining, snobby older sisters, his younger sister May Belle who adores him but can be a pest sometimes, his cranky mother and tired father.About half a year after Leslie moved in, it is March and the rain pours down endlessly. The dry creek bed, the magical entrance in to Terabithia, swells with dirty, swirling, rushing water. Jesse is secretly afraid when he swings over it with the old rope, but he won't admit it to Leslie. Then one day, Miss Edmunds, the music teacher Jesse adores, invites him to go to the art gallery with her. Jesse can't believe his luck, and rushes out, after cunningly asking his mother in her sleep in order to obtain permission. He has the perfect day admiring art with Miss Edmunds, although he is a little sorry about not inviting Leslie along too; she must be bored by herself. Then Jesse returns to find his entire family waiting for him, and his mother breaks into shuddering sobs at the sight of him. His whiny older sister says, \\"Your girl friend's dead, and Momma thought you was dead, too.\\"The rope broke when Leslie was crossing into Terabithia and she was swept by the torrents to her death. Jesse is numb at first; he can't accept her death. Then at Leslie's funeral, Jesse runs out and after throwing Leslie's Christmas present of paints in to the creek, heartrendingly crys at its banks. The Burkes move out, and Jesse is left with Leslie's paints and books, her last present.Jesse builds a bridge to Terabithia with planks that the Burkes left behind. He takes his little sister May Belle and introduces her to Terabithia, as a new queen.The summary became much longer than I was planning, but I wanted to sufficiently describe the moving ending. I always cry when I read this book, at the part when Jesse is taking in Leslie's death, even when I know it's coming along. His sisters throw unconsciously mean remarks that tear at the heart, such as Brenda: \\"You don't even care. Do you? If Jimmy Dicks died, I wouldn't be able to eat a bite. ... Well, it don't seem right for him to be sitting there eating like a brood sow.\\", Ellie: \\"Boys ain't supposed to cry at times like this. Are they, Momma?\\", May Belle: \\"I wanta go, too. I never seen a dead person before.\\", \\"Did you see her? Did you see her laid out?\\". They aren't mature enough to be considerate about his feelings; they don't see the deep sorrow and shock enveloping him. On the other hand, his parents, who have always seemed rather uncaring about him, show their love for him. His cranky mother tells the girls to shut up and is unusually quiet as she heaps pancakes on his plate. His father follows him and holds Jesse as he crys his heart out. The novel shows a reconciliation of sorts between Jesse and his parents.Leslie's death is hinted at here and there throughout the book, though the reader is in complete shock when he finds out about it. When Leslie goes to the church for the first time at Easter with Jesse's family, she says that she doesn't believe in the bible, but she thinks the story is beautiful. May Belle, on hearing that, says that God will damn you to Hell if you don't believe in the bible. She insists, \\"But Leslie, what if you die? What's going to happen to you if you die?\\" Jesse's fear of water, and his terror and hesitation at crossing the rushing torrents by swinging on the rope also hint of Leslie's death. Even Leslie's favorite hobby of scuba diving somehow insinuates her fate. At the art gallery, Jesse is struck by the small model of Indians in a hunt, chasing the buffaloes over a cliff, and the buffaloes falling, falling...By meeting Leslie, his deep friendship with her, and her death, Jesses matured into a more thoughtful, understanding boy. Terabithia extended the limits of his imagination and helped him gain self-confidence. He was able to keep on drawing with Leslie's help, and partly overcame his shame of it.Though the characters are rather stereotypical; after all, they are children and this is a children's book, and Mrs.Edmunds suddenly evaporates at the end without leaving a trace(a real mystery), 'Bridge to Terabithia' is a commendable, heartwarming, eloquently written book. This short story shows how profoundly one person can change another's life, and also indirectly portrays many types of love."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book is both happy and sad at the same time, because people die. Also people become fond of each other. I would recommend this book to 3rd-5th graders, boys or girls because it is a fun and interesting book. Also, it's not just about girls or just about boys, it's about both.The genre is Realistic Fiction. So, I would recommend this book to people who like things that aren't true, but could happen.

Both seem to be outcasts with no friends. Leslie is from a liberal family, who moved from the city, and Jess is from a more traditional family, who lives in the country. Leslie and Jess appear to be searching for appreciation and acceptance. Jess has a hidden talent, but the only person that understands and supports his drawings is the music teacher. Jess tries to become the fastest runner of the fifth grade boys to gain respect from classmates, his parents, and his other teacher, but Leslie wins the race. After a few approaches from Leslie, they begin a wonderful trusting relationship of creativity and understanding. They imaginatively create \\"Terabithia,\\" a kingdom in the woods where they are the king and queen of their secret place. Jess builds up his low self-esteem with Leslie's imaginative ideas and encouragement. It is not until a tragedy occurs that Jess realizes the strength and courage Leslie has given him.The main theme of Bridge to Terabithia is friendship. But, it is a story packed with many realistic concepts and issues that children and adults encounter in their everyday lives. The author does a wonderful job with descriptive language to provide vivid imagery and feeling throughout the book. Children in the intermediate grade levels can get a better understanding of how the issues presented in the book make people feel and react. There are many realistic conflicts from the beginning to the ending of the book. The reader can also observe how the characters use their friendship to dramatically change their lives even though other characters in the story remain static. In the beginning Jess is a very fearful character with no direction, but in the end he overcomes all his fears and becomes a new courageous person."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I LOVED &quot;Bridge to Terebithia&quot;.

It tells a story of a boy named Jess who lives in the country. A few chapters into the book, he's bound to find that a young girl, Leslie Burke, moves into the &quot;old perkin's place.&quot; Jess wants nothing to do with Leslie until he finds out how fast and talented she is at running. You see, all summer Jess has been working to be the fastest kid in the fifth-grade. When he finds that Leslie beats him the first day of school he is frustrated, yet fasinated at the same time. He's around Leslie quite alot because they're in the same class, and live next door to each other. Jess soon finds that Leslie isn't too bad, and quickly they become the very best of friends. They make a place called Terabithia. Leslie is queen, and Jess is king. They go to Terabithia alot, and share many great adventures until BOOM, something happens. Katherine Paterson uses very descriptive phrases to put a clear picture in your mind. She also uses catchy words so that you don't ever get bored. This book was exciting, sad, and funny at the same time. I think one of the main reasons it was so good was because the author explains and tells a good story so well. I don't think there is anything I would change in this book if I had a chance. It is all so exciting and clear. I thought this book was good for only one more reason. When you are in the middle of the book, you know what is going on, but you don't really know what the point of all the information is. When you read some of the last few pages, it all comes together inside your head, and BANG, it all comes clear. There is a reason for the name of this book, and if you want to know, I sugest you take a trip to the library."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is a splendid choice of a book. This book is very funny. It's a great story for people who enjoy twisted books. Bridge to Terabithia is by the wonderful Kathrine Paterson. It's an adventure book that makes you feel like you are almost in the book! The story takes place mostly in Terabithia, but they go to school and other places too. Terabithia is a magical place that Jess and Leslie make up.Jess and Leslie are the main characters. Jess is a very excellent student. He is kind of a scaredy-cat but he never shows it to Leslie. He is the kid who always wants to win. Jess is the king of Terabithia. He even has a crush on his music teacher Miss Edmunds!Leslie also is a marvelous student. She is a tip-top runner. Leslie is the queen in Terabithia. She is also a very good story tellerIn Bridge to Terabithia Jess and Leslie don't really fit in. Jess lives at home with his mom, dad, and 3 sisters. He has basically your average kid's life. Now Leslie on the other hand lives with her mom and dad and doesn't even have a TV!I like the author's writing because she writes with imagination. At some points it is happy but others are sad. It can switch at any minute. She also writes in an adventurous tone.I recommended this book to kids of all ages. It is definitely a family book. I would give it a 5 * rate because it is funny and mysterious.Well, if you don't want to read the book by now you might want to think again."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The story is all about the friendship that grows between two kids and the imaginary world they create. Anyone who has gone on make-believe adventures with their best friend will enjoy this book. The theme of friendship can be found in many great works of literature and Katherine Paterson's book is wonderful because she develops her characters.Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke, the main characters, were more than best friends. Out of all the words in a dictionary, Katherine Paterson picked the perfect one to describe their friendship: bridged. Just as a bridge links two places, their friendship connected them.Life was boring on the farm and full of problems for Jesse. His family had little money and he was ridiculed by the school children because of his drawings. The school children would ridicule him because he was too poor to afford artistic supplies, such as paints, pastels, colored pencils, etc. All he could use were stubby, school crayons that broke when you pressed down on them. Leslie stopped the ridicule by giving him some of the supplies a normal artist had. However, they would have never met if Leslie's parents had not decided to move. They chose the Perkin's place right next door to Jesse.At first, Leslie was upset when her parents moved. She had gotten use to the city and popularity. Leslie was bored and lonely. So was Jesse. When they met, however, everything changed for good. Jesse had Leslie to support him and she was one less person to ridicule him. Leslie also benefited from the friendship. Jesse was the only one who did not ridicule her for wearing shorts and a T-shirt instead of the normal gear or eating yogurt. She, in addition, had someone to share her imagination with. They were true friends. The creation of Terabithia plunged them further still into friendship. Leslie wanted a place of freedom. That is what the woods became.Leslie decided that the woods were a perfect place for their freedom. They built a stronghold next to a spacious pine groove. The woods were named Terabithia: a secret kindom where they could be rulers. At first, Jesse was not interested in making up an imaginary land. He, in the beginning, did not believe some imaginary place would help him. Then he realized he needed a friend. One less person to ridicule him was a great reward for some imagination. It was more then great. He was a king. No one could bother the place or them. Terabithia was forever strong and defended. The pine grove was even better. There he imagining spirits of all kinds watching them. The pine needles made the carpet for this separate castle all of its own. Leslie's time with Jesse made them understand each other more and made their problems disappear for while.No one argued more than Jesse's mother did. There was always some complaint. One of her major topics was Leslie and Jesse's father ignored Leslie rather rudely, but nothing could stop their friendship, however. They were stuck together. Jess needed Leslie. Without her, he was as empty as a newly made gourd. He said,\\"I grew strong and courageous. Without Leslie, I was without guts.\\" I can easily say they trusted each other. Jesse said, \\"We always walked together. I didn't push away.\\" He went deep in the woods with her where he previously thought was haunted. Leslie expected Jesse to be ready for their trudge to Terabithia every day. Rain or shine, Jesse always was. Jesse even forgot Leslie was a city kid. He grew to be comfortable with her.The theme friendship develops the story's characters. It brings them together and makes the inseparable. As the friendship progresses so does the story. It weaves in and out of the pages connecting their meaning. This makes Bridge to Terabithia a great read. I watched the quick formation of the friendship and thought, \\"Wow, nothing can stop them. That is how I want to be.\\"I enjoyed this book and I believe you will too. It is a great read for anyone who enjoys books about true friendship. I happen to be one of those people. If you decide to read it, you will want to share it. It is so original that it should be passed along a long line of your friends. Especially if you like books about friendship, you should read Bridge to Terabithia and share it with someone who enjoys the same theme.Reviewed by Makeda"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I am an elementary education major at West Virginia State University. I am currently taking Children's Literature with Prof. Roger Samples where we just completed a project on a banned/challenged book. For my book, I read Bridge to Terabithia. I thought Bridge to Terabithia was a great book. There were many great lessons to be learned from this book such as don't judge a person by other people's views. If Jessie had judged Leslie by what others thought of her, he would have never created the strong friendship he had with her - a friendship that lasted until the very end. I really don't see why this book was so high on the top 100 challenged books list. There were a few inappropriate words here and there, but none horrible enough to challenge the book. When I'm a teacher, I will probably use this book. I would not have it as required reading, but I would have it on a list that studnets get to pick from."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Today I read Bridge to Terabithia, one of my favorite children's books.I don't think I read it more than once and that must have been at least 20 years ago, since I'm 30 now. What a wonderful book. It's even better than I remember, seeing as not only does it still retain the same qualities that drew me to it as a kid, but it has a lot of subtleties in it that I completley missed as that age.For example, the entire issue of class, with Jess' family being so poor and Leslie's family being wealthy but doing the \\"Simple Life\\" thing in an old farmhouse, didn't hit me nearly the way it did reading it today. I guess back then I didn't really know the type of folks Leslie's family epitomized and more identified with Jess, thinking he was like me and other kids I knew from the Vale.Another subtlety in the book has to do with the pressures Jess feels to conform to standards of masculinity, whether at school or at home, and how this struggle just eats him up. I'm not a boy so nobody ever told me my drawing was stupid, silly or a \\"waste of time,\\" so I guess it makes me feel for him all the more.Of course the part of the story that still gets me are all the scenes set in \\"Terabithia,\\" which remind me so poignantly of all the days, often afternoon after afternoon, I spent in the woods out behind my house, just me and my dog, imagining, running, hatching dreams. Back when I first read this, I was still making those trips (which continued until I left home) and it was all fresh; now the book brings it back to me.The book is often said to be depressing and tearjerker but, though it did bring tears to my eyes to read that whole \\"No!\\" section, I find the book totally uplifting. It's a story that shows how much of an affect one person can have on another. Leslie is a huge turning point in Jess' life, opening doors, windows, letting in air, ideas, and pleasures the boy never knew existed. What a gift he got.I'm really glad my mom got me this book for Christmas. She thought it was odd I'd put a kid's book on my wish list, but I did."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Katherine Paterson sets her story in a small town in the post-Vietnam era.Jesse Aarons dreams of being the fastest boy in the fifth grade. On the first day of school his dream is crushed when a girl beats him in a race. However, he and the girl, Leslie, who is also his new neighbor, become great friends.Leslie Perkins seems to come from a wealthier family. Jesse realizes that her parents talk about things that the usual country folk wouldn't talk about -- like art, literature and music. Leslie doesn't really fit in with the other kids at school. She doesn't have television at home and she has been scuba diving.Jesse is fascinated with his new friend. One day, she takes him into the woods and reveals her secret kingdom -- Terabithia. She makes Jesse the king of Terabithia and she is the queen. They adopt a puppy and make him the court jester and the protector of Terabithia. Jesse loves to spend time with her, even though his sisters tease him and call her his \\"girl friend.\\" Yet, Jesse feels that sometimes Leslie can be unpredictable and she takes great risks. Jesse often feels ashamed for being scared to do the things that she does.This is not really a story about growing up, even though Jesse's character does slightly mature by the end. This is a story about friendship and learning to cope with death.Paterson's style is mature for children's literature. But her storytelling is descriptive and lucid. I would say this book is appropriate for any child at a third-grade reading level -- even though, some may need help understanding some of the topics in the book -- like the Vietnam War, folk music and even death. This would be a great book to read to children, although there are one or two curse words.I thought the only downside to this story was that it ended too abruptly. After the story reaches its climax, the denouement is too quick.I look forward to reading more of Paterson's books."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book is an absolute MUST READ! My nine year old read this book and I read everything my children read. I was taken by surprise. This is so much more than a book for children, although children can certainly appreciate the lessons that it has to teach.There is so much here. It is truly a rich and rewarding reading experience. To me, it demonstrated how we all need to unleash overselves from the dull and mundane. We need to look beyond what is apparent to the eyes and see the magic that is in something as simple as a glade or a few trees across a brook. I also like the references to Narnia.This book has won many awards and they are well deserved. I wish I could congratulate Katherine Paterson personally for such a magnificent contribution to literature. You really owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This was the first book that ever made me cry.

Now that I've reread it, I'm struck by Paterson's bravery in addressing the death of a child and how it affects another child. It's a difficult subject beautifully rendered. Thank you, Katherine. I'd recommend this as a great book for a parent to share and discuss with a child."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Keep the tissues handy, you're going to need them.

At the time I was somehow completely unprepared for the event of about 3/4 through the book, and when it came, I literally threw the book across my room. I hated that book, I said. I probably cried, I can't remember. I was cleaning out my room lately and I found it again, and I read the first 3/4 again, and this time I finished it. It still made me hate a litle, inside, that kind of unconsolable sadness. But it was good, very good. I have siblings like Aaron, and I assure you that his are very real. When I first read part of this book it made me decide that all Newberys were pointlessly sad books (See also: Sounder, Johnny Tremain...) And just how badly this book made me hurt, I don't know if I would recomend that to a kid. That's why I don't give it five stars, like I would otherwise."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The Bridge to Terabithia is a story about two children that have unseeingly wild imaginations. Two children that wouldn't typically have became friends if it wasn't for the girl, Leslie, and her storytelling ability that sucks the boy, Jessie, right into to her world of fantasy and fiction. Tucked away inside their world of imagination, fantasy, and magic lye a mysterious land where anything can happen. SPOILER ALERT: The passing of Leslie couldn't have come at a worse time for Jessie and for anyone who has lost someone close to them knows how he feels. This story is very relatable to children.

A must read for all ages."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is considered a banned book because of \\"anti-religion, language, and discussion of death.\\"*** READER BEWARE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***This book was about a lonely boy named Jesse Aarons, with no real friends or purpose in life other than being the fastest kid in the fourth and fifth grades. Jess then meets his soon-to-be best friend, Leslie Burke, when her family moves into the nearby farmhouse. She enlightens him, so to speak, and the story evolves as Jess begins to grow and change from this friendship. They create a make-believe land in the woods called Terabithia. After it rains for days on end in the early spring, the creek near Terabithia is overflowing with a swift, dangerous, icey current. Jess is dreading going to Terabithia that morning and ends up going to a museum instead with his favorite teacher and when he returns from \\"the best day of his life\\" he finds that Leslie had tried to cross the creek and drowned.This story went from being about Jess and Leslie growing in their friendship to the abrupt end of it with no explanation and no chance to say good-bye and how Jess dealt with that. It did briefly talk about religion, but nothing in my opinion was controversial about it - it merely stated the fact that some children go to church and believe in God and some are taught that you will burn in hell if you do not believe in God/Jesus and die, while other children/families do not believe this. To me, this is a fact of life, because not everyone holds the same belief system and children will run into this during their lives. I did not see anything anti-religious about it, in fact I agreed when Jess was worried about Leslie's afterlife and Jess's dad said, \\"God isn't going to let a little girl burn in hell.\\" And yes, the book discusses death, but death is also a fact of life and children will experience death in their lives at some point, but it is always up to the parent to review the book first and make sure it is appropriate for their own child because a parent should know what their child can and cannot emotionally handle. This book can be a great tool for discussing some of these issues with the child reading it and to discuss family values and morals that may or may not align with the book's."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Book was receive in expected condition as agreed upon.

I was trying to read every Newberry Award winning book our school had. I completed most of our library's inventory, and to this day, Bridge to Terabithia stood out among the books I read. I gave this book 5 stars based on my memory of reading this as a child, and on the understanding that the target audience is younger. So the rating is through younger eyes. That said, as a 32 year old male, I would still give the book a 4 star rating. This book cuts a clean storyline, but doesn't have enough character development and depth as books written for an older audience. But I think it does the job for a younger audience. It surely moved me as a child. I was around 10-12 when I read this book, and didn't know the story before I read it. I remember reading the part when the girl died and it certainly brought tears to my eyes. This time around, I didn't have a feeling of loss for the girl. I think the reason is because the book just lays it out in a matter of fact manner. There is no real lead up to her dying, it just happens. For some reason, it didn't seem to affect me much. But - the aftermath was a different story, specifically when everyone was meeting in the girl's home after she died. What moved me was the feeling of loss the parents ad grandparents felt. But mostly this was me projecting feelings because I am the father of two young children.Overall, it was worth reading again, and I would recommend it to any mature child of the appropriate age (parents will have to determine that for themselves). I certainly won't shield my children from this book when they are old enough.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"One of my favorite parts of parenting is rediscovering wonderful children's literature with my daughters. I had heard of this book but never read it, so when my daughter chose it for a book report I seized the opportunity to read an award-winning book that I had neglected.The story of Jess and his unusual friendship with Leslie is touching. There is the contrast between his family -- rural and unsophisticated -- with Leslie's very educated parents; Leslie is an only child and Jess is surrounded by sisters for whom he has mostly disdain. Yet they find comfort in one another, surrounded by provincial teachers and classmates who don't understand either one of them. Togehter the two of them create a world only they can share, and Leslie helps Jess discover who he really is.I won't ruin the climax of the book for those who have not read it. Suffice it to say, it may be the saddest book I have ever read. My daughter has not finsihed it, but when she does, I am ready for a discussion as we've never had before. This book is beautifully written and deals, very sensitively, with some very difficult issues. Yet I think it can help children navigate some complicated themes in life, areas they'll need to deal with at some point.Because of its tragic ending, this book may be hard for some. But I think the author has given careful thought into her treatment of a tough subject, and it is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Synopsis:Bridge to Terabithia is centered on a rural boy named Jess Arrons, who has a long-standing desire to acquire the attention and respect from his father, family and peers. He spends a significant amount of time running during his summer break from school so he can win races and gain recognition as the fastest kid in the fifth grade, thus earning respect from others he perceives as important. However, Jess's goal is shattered when a young girl moves to his town, transfers to his school, and beats him in a race. Nevertheless, Jess becomes close friends with Leslie Burke, who nourishes his deep interest in the visual arts. Leslie and Jess create a secret kingdom dubbed Terabithia, where they can be themselves without the pressures of conformity. Yet, their kingdom and friendship is short-lived when a tragedy strikes at the end of story.Evaluation:Paterson's book will generally appeal to fifth graders on the basis that the main characters are in the same age group. Moreover, it presents readers with realistic images painted with words, depicting an image that families are not always perfect. Such a concept is important on the basis that Paterson published her innovative book at a time when young people were likely to have their perceptions of the \\"normal\\" family displaced by Brady Bunch reruns. More specifically, Jess's father has a machismo personality, likely to discourage crying among \\"men\\" and the study of the arts. Leslie comes from a more liberal and cultured family environment that contrasts Jess's household, thus stressing the benefits of maintaining friendships with people of different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Lastly, Paterson presents her young readers with the dilemma of dealing with the death of someone significant. Therefore, I conclude that this story appropriate for fifth graders on the basis that it is truly realistic, concluding that no one is immortal regardless of age."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"It is rare to stumble upon such an utterly beautiful book. \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\" follows Jesse's relationship with Leslie, a unique and intelligent girl, as they form the magical land of Terabithia, a world where they are King and Queen, protecting their land from invaders.

I used this book in my 5th grade classroom and it was a great success."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I really liked the book. The book was so good I had bought a copy. What I did not like about it is when Leslie died in the story."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is a very well written book. I gave it four stars becauseI thought the sisters were unbearable. I also thought the crush was uncalled for. A teacher can be friends with a student without the student having a crush on the teacher. But overall Bridge to Terabithia was a good book. Just skim over the part about the crush on the teacher. Also try to avoid the parts with the sisters, you will save yourself a LOT of wincing."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is a novel that is worthy to be called a classic. The novel focuses on Jess, Leslie, and their kingdom, Terabithia. The friendship between the two is unique because of the encouragement they give each other. The creation of Terabithia gives the two an outlet to be creative in, as well as allowing Jess to be king and Leslie to be queen.Adults enjoy this book due to the nostalgia that affects them, yet children enjoy this book because they are able to relate to the characters and their lives. As a teacher, I am amazed by the new perspective that I notice each time I read this book. What also amazes me is the students' reactions as they read Bridge to Terabithia. Since they are able to relate to this novel, they beg to continue reading because they are so affected with the characters. Their glowing response to this book makes this novel a must read and have for your own personal library."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this story at least twice as a child and I still remember how much the book impacted me. Many children never get the opportunity to actually get to \\"know\\" the characters in a book and this book provides an excellent opportunity. The situations are real, the characters are real, the emotions are real and the reader leaves this story feeling as if they themselves have lost a loved one. This is an excellent read that I would DEFINITELY recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This story truely touched my heart...

Still, the book was very well written and I give it two thumbs all the way up."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I've got to say this book isn't my usual kind of read. But I'm glad now that I read it. It's a story of two youngsters forming a deep friendship. The girl, Leslie is strong and had a vivid imagination as most young girls generally do. And Jess knew he wasn't nearly as brave as Leslie, more like the odd boy out. It's rough on a young lad to know a girl can outrun him. Imagine being beaten by a girl. But he managed to overcome the fact that she was faster, that she wasn't afraid, and that she'd done so much more in her young years than he. Two small children meet and strike up an unforgettable friendship. The story is tragic, very sad in parts, but after you've finished reading it, there's a smile on your face. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia, a phenomenal work by Katherine Paterson, is a book that will be held in ages to come. This book contains friendship, love, reality, and inspiration.As soon as I got this book, I began to read it. I was so into it that I read it for 4 hours straight and finished it. I had tears on the end, but it certainly was worth the time and money.Jesse Aarons' greatest ambition is to be the fastest runner in the fifth grade. He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl(Leslie Burke) boldly crosses over to the boys' side of the playground and outruns everyone.That's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie become inseparable. Leslie has imagination. Together, she and Jess create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits. Then one morning a terrible tragedy occurs. Only when Jess is able to come to girps with this tragedy does he finally understand the strength and courage Leslie has given him.

It is a wonderful book, do not get me wrong. It just, however, another example of a Newbery book that tears your heart straight out of your chest.Jesse is the fastest kid in the fifth grade; that is, until a tomboy named Leslie usurps his title by beating him. Despite this, the two become the best of friends. They are mutually strange and different from the rest of their classmates, and find solace within each other.Jesse and Leslie create the imaginary kingdom of Terabithia, where they reign as king an queen. They fight off enemies and rule their kingdom kindly. Terabithia is their escape from the real world, in a remote part of the woods in rural Virginia. Accessible only by swinging over a rope, Jesse and Leslie are safe in their worldJust when their lives are turning around, disaster strikes. A tragic accident claims the life of Leslie, leaving Jesse behind to cope with the loss. I start crying every time I think about it. I know that reality is harsh and doesn't care if you are a kid or not, but it still bothers me to see kids experience such heartache and disaster. It only adds to that knowing that Katherine Paterson got the idea from the tragedy her son went through.This is a wonderful book. I would recommend it for elementary children of any age dealing with powerful loss (like the death of a classmate). Younger kids can have it read to them, older kids could read it themselves. It would be a huge help in teaching kids about death, whether understanding their own grief or learning about life."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Do you believe in destiny? I do after reading Bridge to Terabithia. It was a delighting experience put together by author Katherine Paterson and illustrator Donna Diamond. This team won a Newbery Medal and also got on to the ALA Booklist. Since 1977, when Bridge to Terabithia was published, Katherine has also published other outstanding books like Great Gilly Hopkins, Jacob I have loved, Jib his story, and other great books. This incredible fiction story showed me what being a friend is all about.Jess Aarons is training to become the fastest kid in school. He almost achieved his goal until the Burkes move in. Leslie Burke beat all the boys in the school on the first day of school. But Jess soon overcomes jealousy and Leslie and Jess become friends. They needed somewhere secret to hang out at, so the two look in the woods only to discover the perfect place to build there stronghold, Terabithia. But when it rains the path becomes flooded and it just became more copulated to get to. But Jess and Leslie are just determined to find a way in.One of the many things the author did well was explain the setting. You know where and when the book is taking place. A very descriptive part is when Jess and Leslie first find there kingdom of Terabithia. The setting just pops out at you. I also liked the pine forest home of the spirits. I could feel the emptiness. This book came to life before my eyes!The characters in this book seemed so realistic. I felt like I knew the characters. They were right in front of me. I could relate to some of the characters. I thought of Jess, a kind soul. Leslie is always there to cheer someone up. May Belle felt like someone you try to get away from. I felt like I was in this book.In this book I learned that a little bit of friendship goes a long way. The book takes a dip into friendship. The title of the book is one of my favorites. But there is a twist at the end. The ending will come unexpected. I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes a well written book. You will want to keep reading even after the book is finished."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"All summer long, Jess Aarons runs everyday around the feild of his farmhouse practicing to be the fastest runner in fifth grade.

Well, that's what Jess and Leslie wanted when the invented the land of Terabithia in the heartwarming book, Bridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Paterson.In this amazing book, you will fall in love with Jess Aarons, a young boy smushed in-between a family of four sisters, two younger, two older. All Jess wants is to be the fastest runner in the fifth grade, but after training all summer, on the first day of school, he is outrun by a girl named Leslie Burke.Leslie Burke, an only child who just moved in across the street from Jess, is plain weird in the eyes of all the other kids.

Among his schoolmates, only Leslie appreciates Jess's artistic temperament, and the two soul mates become inseperable, spending long hours together and creating their own imaginary kingdom--until tragedy strikes unexpectedly.Katherine Paterson's novel, simply but effectively written, provides an opportunity to consider and discuss issues such as the nature of friendship, the meaning of death, and the importance of acceptance. I thought Paterson stumbled at one point by having a teacher act in an unprofessional, implausible manner, but the resulting development was so powerful that my objection was soon forgotten."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The book Bridge to Terabithia was the most engaging book I have ever read! Besides being extremely entertaining, this book was fascinating and intriguing. One of the main characters in the book is a fifth grade boy named Jessie, who has long, dark, bushy hair and is medium height and build. Jessie lives on a farm with many animals and lots to do. He wants to become the fastest kid in the fifth grade, and runs every morning on his farm to become faster. One hot summer day, Jesse was running outside and saw a girl sitting on the fence surrounding his farm. The girl, Leslie, is the other main character in the book. Leslie has just moved to the neighboring farm and is also in the fifth grade. She is a tomboy with short hair that looks like a boy's haircut, and is very athletic. It takes some time for Jesse and Leslie to become good griends, mostly because Leslie keeps winning when they race. On the first day of school Jesse loses again in a race with Leslie, and continues to lose to her all week. Finally, Jesse gives up the idea of being faster than her and decides just to be her friend.One weekend, Jesse and Leslie were walking through the forest close to their homes, through the gigantic trees that made a ceiling of branches letting in very little light. They were searching for an open space in the forest that they could call their own. It didn't take long before they started to build a fort and called it the \\"Kingdom of Terabithia\\". Near their fort there was a creek they had to swing across by using a rope swing, even when it was raining. Jesse and Leslie both used their imagination to pretend that their kingdom was real. They also imagined that there were intruders trying to get into the kingdom, and that Leslie's pet dog, P.T.(Prince Terren) was guarding the kingdom. They had created their own world of magic called Terabithia. One morning, instead of going to Terabithia with Leslie, Jesse's teacher picked him up to go visit an art gallery. When they got back, Jesse heard the bad news. Leslie had swung on the rope swing across the creek, just like usual, but the rope broke and she had hit her head on a rock. It was the worst news possible, because Leslie had died from her injuries. Jesse couldn't believe it. Following his shock at what had happened, Jesse and his sister went to Terabithia themselves, to build a bridge. The bridge was for anyone going to Terabithia, so they wouldn't swing across the creek and fall. Definitely, I would recommend this book to others, especially to readers who enjoy a book that takes place in the outdoors. Bridge to Terabithia is a delightful book and very pleasurable to read, but also very sad at the end.By Nolan, 12 years old"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I like to read the occasional young adult book. It can be nostalgic for me, and some, like the Narnia books or the Prydain chronicles, are as good as you find at any level. This book isn't quite at that 5 star level, at least not for me, but it was a very compelling story and I think most kids will find it memorable.It's hard to talk much about the book because the end is what makes the story, and clearly one doesn't want to give the end away. Suffice it to say that it is mostly about friendship, and the rewards of not always taking the path of least resistance. It is about imagination, escape even, from the sometime prison of youth that is (blissfully and thankfully), often forgotten after childhood is past. In this story the hero, Jess, finds his prison (read: school) escape in a person- his incredibly unusual new friend, Leslie.Jess makes much of his lack of bravery, but he is actually pretty courageous, and every time he confronts his fears- especially his fear of what others will think of him, good things happen. The one time he found an out and ducked an issue...well that is the story that makes the book.The book skirts with redemption- damnation even, and the author remembers that as a kid those are big worries for you. No one wants to go to Hell, and no matter how much people might tell you there isn't one, something inside you knows that this is not quite true. The author doesn't really tell the reader what to do with this worry, but this huge, huge childhood (and adulthood) issue isn't just ignored as it is in most literature, even in stories of life and death where it really shouldn't be dismissed.A good, if somewhat gut-wrenching story. Might be a bit tough on the very little ones, though."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I didn't have the privilege of reading this book when I was younger. I regret that. However, a generous bookstore owner recommended the title to me while I was attending college. I'm so glad she did. I guess I'm just an old softie at heart, but I cry every time I read this story. Katherine Paterson is a brilliant writer. In some ways this book is even more meaningful to me as an adult, because I've now experienced the pain death brings when you lose someone you love. I couldn't have said that in my youth. It's shameful that so many institutions have attempted to ban this book in the past. I'm always left wondering why. This story offers the reader so much to contemplate. It deals with issues that are concrete. It touches on real feelings. This book is a must-have for families that encourage children to ask questions and deal with ideas that are at once painful but an essential part of growing up."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The Bridge to Terabithia is a tragic,suspenseful,well written story.

His desperately poor parents, a nagging nmother, and a father that's never home. Leslie , a new girl that just moved into the Old Perkin's place, and Jess, a ten year old farm boy, make up their own world called Terabithia. Jess and Leslie are king and queen.

This book is absolutely beautifully written and I honestly loved it with all my heart.The story is about a young boy.

And he finds out what when he enters in a race at his school.During the race, which he has been training for for the entire summer, he loses...to a girl! This is the ultimate failure, but he takes a second glance at the girl who beat him. She's not like anyone he has ever met. She looks at life in the most bizarre and optimistic way possible-a strange perspective to the boy. It turns out they are neighbors and soon after that, best friends.And the girl begins to change his life. He can see life differently now too-the way that she can. The two create a world of their own-Terabithia. It is this world that they boy discovers who he is and what life can hold. The world is at his finger tips.For those of you who do not know the ending, I won't spoil it for you.

Leslie's magical kingdom reminds me of the kingdoms I used to create with my father. The ideas are beautiful and real. It's true that the sudden ending is jolting, but Jess learns a lesson and reaches out to his sister, May Belle, which is important.

But for children, who desire excitement, will be probably bored sick of this book. It is strange why drama is recommended for children. This is an adults' book, not a children's book. If it was a children's book, they should've put lots of adventure in it. I can't believe it won the Newbery Medal. Susan Cooper's \\"The Dark is Rising\\" is far superior to thisThe story concerns Jess Aarons, \\"the fastest kid is school\\", until a new girl, Leslie, beats all of the boys, in a race. But school bores them down, so they go deep into the woods and construct \\"Terabithia\\", an imaginary world where they rule as king and queen.Sounds like a nice, little fairy tale? No! Soon after the joy, tragedy follows, as Leslie accidentally dies. This is a sad story, actually, and no fun-loving child wants as sad story, so I do not recommend this to easily bored kids. What's the moral here? Death. What's the message? Death. What does it deal with? Death, death, and loads of death. \\"The Bridge to Terabithia\\" concerns the meaning of life and death, and how serious life can be. It uses a lot of drama, that no excitement comes.Two words: VERY OVERRATED!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book is about two kids living in a rural area that slowely become the best of friends. For kids (this book is written for kids 9-12) it's nicely written and a good story but I just think the subject matter might not be something that most younger kids are ready to face.... death. Unfortunatly, sometimes (in real life) people don't have a choice in that matter and they have to deal with it and maybe a book like this will help kids/readers realize that that aspect is part of life.It was just so sad... I felt so depressed at the end and so bad for the characters that I almost wanted to cry and then I hurried and shoved the book somewhere where I won't have to look at it again."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is about a kid named Jess Aarons. He has two older sisters and two younger sisters. His dad works in Washington DC. His mom stays at the house and does work there. Jess met a new friend named Leslie.Jess and Leslie make a magic kingdom and call it Terabithea. They are the rulers of it. In Tirabithea lots of stuff happens. They cross a big field before they reach Terabithia. To get in they have to swing across an old rope. The rope is over an old stream bed. Usually the stream bead has no water in it. But sometimes it does. In Terabithia Jess and Leslie build a hut to be the kingdom. They made the hut out of wood they found in the woods. PT, Leslie's dog, is the guard to Terabithia.I like this book because the setting is not like most of the books that I have read. The setting is different because it is magical. This setting has a queen, and a king. Terabithia was a small kingdom too. It didn't have many walls I also like this book because the setting isn't very hard to imagine."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bride to TerabithiaBy: Katherine PatersonTalk about another sissy! I know you're thinking that I'm talking about a girl. Yet no, I'm talking about Terabithia's very own king Jesse. Who ever said a girl can't beat a boy at a race? If you believe this you obviously haven't met Leslie. I know that that is not exactly the theme of the book but it is very important. In the words of Jesse \\"Fetch me a shirt.\\"This book is about a boy named Jesse and his hopes of being the fastest kid of the third, fourth and fifth graders. Ok, so the whole book is not about being the fastest kid, but that's how Jesse and Leslie become friends. This book is about Jesse and Leslie finding a secret place they call Terabithia. You would think that this story would be all about Terabithia but it's mostly about Leslie and Jesse and conflicts in school like Janice Avery the school bully. I don't want to give away the ending but there is a major surprise. Let me leave you with that thought.Ok done with the thought? Now I would like to tell you about the theme of this story because if you ask me it's pretty obvious. The theme is to spend every day like it's your last and don't judge a book by its cover. If you read \\" A Summer to Die\\" you'd know what I'm talking about. The author Katherine Paterson is a good author and I would recommend this book Bridge to Terabithia to ages eight and up and if you like reality fiction genre that have slow starts and gets better as you go along you'll like this book! Don't forget to read Bridge to Terabithia."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"For my fifth grade class we were all assigned to read Newberry medal books, and we all did so, grudgingly. I had always been an avid reader, so I took the challenge to read the most Newberry books in the class.Sadly, that fall, one of my classmates and friends, died in a terrible car accident. We all kept going, though it was a strange time in all of our lives. That spring, I read Bridge to Terebethia and identified strongly with a particular character. I was devasted when the character died, but oddly enough it helped me work through some of my grief.I believe every fifth grader that year read the book at one time or another, due to the encouragement of our teacher. It is a profound, moving story and presented in just the right context. There were things that went over my head the first time I read that book, but reading it over I discovered new levels of meaning in the book. The scenes following the death are very poignant and real; but just as important are the seemingly unimportant scenes at the beginning. Patterson presents a vividly real community and families. Though the sisters to Jess could be seen as a bit overstated, they emphasize points in the book remarkably well.This book did not change me, but it did help me through very difficult changes in my life. I would recomend to anyone who has ever lost someone or to anyone who just wants a remarkably good read."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"It's really a nice book and I highly recommend it for readers of all ages. I have to read this book because it is my literature text and I did not ever regret reading it. It emphasizes alot on human relationships and getting along with others. I myself have read it four times and I still think it is a really wonderful and fantastic book. I almost cried when i read the last part, and usually I'm not a very emotional person and since this book is able to touch my heartstrings, I don't see why it shouldn't be able to touch others. Trust me, you will love this book once you read it, just as I do."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I simply love this book, To me, this book is the most touching novel I have ever read.

I really enjoyed it then. Later, when I wanted to read it again I couldn't remember the title. A friend asked me if I had ever read a book called Brige to Terabithia. I was grateful to her for reminding me what a wonderful and touching story it is. Everyone should have a &quot;Terabithia&quot; to escape to, and it is a lucky thing when a person can find someone like Leslie to share it with. I don't think that the cursing has a negative or a positive affect on the story or the reader. It is absurd for anyone to consider banning such a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. When it starts out you think it's a love story. But then it ends in tragedy. If you have never read it, I would recommend this book to you.

I'm a student in high school, and I still remember crying over this book when in grade five. It was so beautiful. Such strong friendship in this book...but then, like everything else it was lost. I believe the presence and way DEATH is portrayed is very wrong in this book. Death, as always, is portrayed with such strength and power, while hopes and dreams are shattered. I do not think a child should read this. It sends the message that nothing is real in the end, for death takes everything away. If you believe children should 'learn' about death then let your child read this book, but if you like to teach your child that hope and love truly exist in life then I do not suggest this book.

In this fantasy book written by Katherine Paterson, Leslie Burke and Jess Aarons make a world of their own and call it Terabithia. As soon as school is over Leslie and Jess go out to the forsaken tree house in the forest where they conquer their fears, which are real in the actual world. Jess gets Leslie a dog and since Leslie and Jess are King and Queen of the Kingdom Terabithia, she decides to name him Prince Tarrien (P.T. for short). But, when some massive disaster happens in Jess&iexcl; life it makes Jess&iexcl; life in Terabithia and the true world hard...Katherine Paterson explains her characters very well when you go to their homes and their school. In addition, she tests their imagination skills when they leave to Terabithia. I would recommend this book to people age 10 and older, because there are tragedies that some would shiver about. I rate it 5 billion thumbs up. But since we can only use 5 stars I will rate this 5/5 stars, for an immense book!!!!"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"I read this book about 20 years ago, when I was in grade school.

As usual I read the back of the book and I have to say it\`s kind of misleading. When I finally read this book I realized just how hard it focused on things. This book was incredible because so many books out there end with everything resolved, but this was different. It had such an immense twist that as you\`re reading your whole head kind of spins in the reality of the story. The author really makes you feel the emotions so you can really get into the book. And when you actually think of the situations in the story, you can get into the characters emotions more. This is an incredible book, definitley a cryer, but incredible."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"This is a very good book. With good characters.

That was Jess's greatest ambition. Leslie and Jess gradually learn to trust and respect each other. Together they create Terabithia, their own magical kingdom where they rule. Terabithia is so much different than the real world. Terabithia is wonderful and flawless. Then, suddenly, a great tragedy sweeps over this unbroken friendship.

And I can't even begin to comment on the folks who are actually counting occurrences of the word \\"damn\\". (I'm still reeling from THAT revelation.)This book was a birthday gift somewhere in the vicinity of my 12th birthday, and it is the one of the few books (from youth) I've kept into my adult life.Paterson weaves great intricacy into her characters. Themes like insecurity, loneliness, and peer rivalry in the pre-teen realm are articulately revealed. It speaks about loyalty and friendship, even in unlikely circumstances. The tragic aspect gives the story timeless depth.My edition features elegant blank ink watercolor illustrations-a great complement to the text.It's unfortunate that this lovely book has been elevated by educators to \\"must-read\\" status.

If I had to grade this book on a scale from one to ten, I would give it a ten because Katherine Patterson uses many similes, metaphors, personification, and hyperbole. I was shocked to see that some of the words she used were more adult words. But for the most part this a great book and I like it myself.

I recommend it highly and for those that have read it, I'm sure they know what I mean by everything I said."},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is a mix of love and hate, life and death, and everything in between. I think it is a story of love and hate because it is fiction. Yet, they make it like it's a real life adventure of two friends wanting to be together forever and a day! It all started one summer when Jesse Aarons was practicing for the big races at schools between some of the grades. When he passed the old Perkins place, he noticed someone was moving in,suddenly, a girl(or atleast he thought it was one,he couldn't tell),but after he met her he knew. He also knew he liked her VERY VERY much! That was the day the day that Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke became inseparable. The reason I think it is a story of life and death is that so many people get hurt. Take Janice Avery for example, she was the mean seventh grade of the bus. So, Jess and Leslie played a prank on her, but they regret it after they heard her crying in the bathroom. Leslie went in tto talk to her and got told that her father beat her and she had gotten a good one this morning. Lelise told Jess &quot;Now I have a friend and a half!&quot;. The next day ti started to rain, and rain, and rain. Well, Jess' favorite teacher, Miss Edmunds, asks him to go to the Smithsonian with him since it was raining, and he said yes and walked out with out even notifying his parents where he was going. Jess came home to a room of very quiet children, and a crying mother and father. They tried to tell him that something had happened to Leslie, But he wouldn't believe it.

Here they are, I have saved my treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.\\"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a wonderful quick read about a man (family) over coming adversities in life, yet continuing to hold on to and cherish what is important in life. Dr. Primrose never becomes jaded after all that is thrown at him. Just when you think he can take no more, more is piled onto him. In the end, of course, all is well. While I wouldn't call the book exciting itself, there are exciting elements...kidnappings, death, cheating, and more. I enjoyed it so much because Dr. Primrose is truly a stand up guy and one we can all learn lessons from."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"I have, in a way, two completely separate reviews for this novel, with two completely different rankings. As a serious novel it gets one star; as a comic novel it gets four. I have gone with the four-star ranking because I have very little doubt of which it is.If this book was in fact written as a serious panegyric upon the glories and virtues of the simple, holy life, and the blessings that come to those who persevere in the face of adversity, it is the most consummate tripe. The characters are caricatures, the emotions farcical, the plot lines banal. Primrose (the narrator) is a fool, and a particularly pretentious and self-righteous one. The women in the novel should make any self-respecting woman cringe. The tireless soliloquies on economics, politics and religion make you unwittingly begin to skim. I will take Wittgenstein's advice and just pass over the ending in silence. Think Danielle Steele in a more obscure vernacular, but worse. (Yes, that's right, worse.)Thankfully, it's not serious (or, at least, I am almost certain that it isn't). As a comic novel it comes off kind of like a Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker movie about a Jane Austen novel. The beauty of it is, however, is that it's so deadpan, it's so subtle in its irony, that for the first eighty pages I really thought it was sincere - albeit terrible. I won't go into the plot details as most of you probably don't want someone to spoil the plot for you, and the rest can easily find it succinctly traced out by my fellow reviewers. I will say that it's a Book-of-Job-style parable, and one of the most complete and believable satires I've ever read.(I will add, just to give my review some perspective, that I love 18th century British literature, Fielding and Sterne in particular. In other words, my opinion has not been overtly colored by an ignorance of either the genre or the writing styles of the period. At least, I hope not.)"},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"A delightful tale of the calamities that beset an 18th century English vicar.

It could almost be said to be inspiring. And definitely shows that the ends justifies the means."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations.This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Holy god, don't buy this book. It is intensely bad and over-appreciated. 1000 words cannot even begin to do justice to the extent of this book's worthlessness.Clearly, 18th Century vernacular is a hurdle in any book, but I doubt Garrison Keillor could rework this story into something bearable. The story is an exercise in description and banality. There is virtually no inertia or direction to the plot, and characterization is hopelessly shallow.Seriously, don't get this book. I'm warning you. I love great literature, and I hate this book. Ok...&quot;hate&quot; is a little rough, but I really, really don't like it. Try something more enjoyable; like stapling your hand to your eyelid.Ok, just so I have not wasted all your time, read anything by Wilde or Kafka instead. Read some freaking Mark Twain, for goodness sake. Just lay off the Goldsmith."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's 1766 novel, &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; offers the trials and tribulations of Primrose, an ecclesiastic living in the English countryside. Primrose is content in his life, with a faithful wife, and lovely, if somewhat distracted children. Hearing that his banker has gotten into trouble and fled the country, Primrose and his family begin a series of adventures which test the strength of Primrose's convictions.Among the issues which Goldsmith addresses in the novel are social ambition in a rigid class system, the drawbacks and benefits of a relatively liberal household, and the admittedly imperfect nature of the British legal system. Sprinkled throughout the novel are various discourses on the notion of liberty, the primacy of the monarchy, and a wealth of interesting references to British imperialism and colonial slavery.Regarding the class system, Primrose seems throughout the novel, to eschew the idea that social or economic mobility is possible, or even desirable. He posits, in a way that follows Aristotle and Edmund Burke, that people are fit for certain stations by their very nature; and that such social partitioning is right and should be maintained. Primrose also appears as a latter day Horace, championing the virtues of simple, rustic life. This pastoral life is directly associated in the novel with the laboring classes, who, not without faults themselves, manage to avoid the intrigues and excesses of the consistently vilified city folk.Goldsmith's writing style is fast-paced, with clear, direct language, wonderfully rendered characters, and a surprising number of plot twists for so short a work. Primrose and his eldest son George are the two finest characters in the novel. Both exhibit a picaresque tendency to wander and interact - Primrose with the intellectual/philosophical elements, and George with the material/experiential elements in the world. This is altogether a wonderful, spirited novel, and Stephen Coote's introduction to this Penguin edition is excellent in its explication of the novel's major themes and concerns."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"\\"Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to accuse.\\" So ends chapter 13 in this delightful novel by Oliver Goldsmith, his only novel by the way.Oliver creates a pious character in the form of the vicar, Dr Primrose, that suffers from that most deadly of the 7 deadly sins, Pride. The problem is he doesn't know it. As a result he is brought down peg by peg, and made a thorough fool of in the process, in a way that is comical and warm to the reader. The vicar becomes a most beloved character by way of his suffering and in the end I'm sure will have earned from even the most hard hearted reader that most cherished gift a reader can bestow upon any flawed character, redemption.Oliver also creates villiany, more like evil incarnate, in the form of Mr. Thornhill. Thornhill is central to the most severe of the hardships suffered by the vicar and his family. A very meddlesome and self-centered character indeed!!Written in the 1750's, it has it all. Greed,envy,lust,unjust imprisonment, even prostitution. Yes, It's hard to believe a novel written in the 1750's could even touch on the subject, but nevertheless it is central to the plot.Combine all this with some of the finest wit in English literature and you've got a great way to spend a weekend. The book is less than 200 pages and moves along at nice pace from page one. Well worth everyone's time."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"I agree with the reviewers who've described this as a slow read. No argument there. But it's also a very important 18th Century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period. If you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. Granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. The poor vicar is modeled on the biblical Job, to a very exaggerated extent. It's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, I know. If you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th Century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now. You don't read THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD for the plot. You read it for the study. It remains an important book."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"I found this little book a delight from start to finish.This was a favourite little &quot;classic&quot; of the Victorian classroom.

In fine, a book to be read over &amp; over without a dimunition of pleasure at each reading."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Told with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humor and wit, The Vicar of Wakefield, published in 1766, features the delightfully innocent Dr. Primrose, a cleric who believes that kindness and virtue will always be rewarded. Surrounded by his wife and six children, Dr. Primrose lives a comfortable life, but he becomes the victim of theft when his broker runs off with all his investments, leaving him penniless, just as his son George is about to be married. When George's marriage is canceled due to his lack of prospects, the family moves to the country, where Dr. Primrose becomes vicar of a rural church.One disaster follows another, involving Dr. Primrose and his family. The poor but kind Mr. Burchell, who saved daughter Sophia from drowning and befriended the family, later shocks Dr. Primrose by slandering the daughters and ruining their chances to become companions to two women in London. The sale of the family's only horses to a trickster leaves them virtually penniless. His older daughter Olivia is abducted and \\"ruined.\\" The house catches fire, and their landlord demands his rent, knowing that the family has nothing. No matter how outrageous the calamities (and those mentioned above are only a sample), Dr. Primrose insists on seeing the bright side, even when there is no bright side. Virtue and goodness, he is convinced, will always be rewarded.Owing as much to eighteenth century satiric comedy as to the developing novel, the story of Dr. Primrose and his family satirizes the sentimentality of early novels, such as Pamela, while it makes use of sentimental devices to further its plot. Poking gentle fun at Dr. Primrose for his innocence, Goldsmith never mocks or belittles him. Coincidence, mistaken identities, the humiliation of all the villains, innumerable surprises, and the restoration of Dr. Primrose's fortunes lead to the \\"deserved\\" happiness of Dr. Primrose and his family in the conclusion. Virtue is indeed rewarded, and evil is indeed punished. A gentle novel filled with charm, The Vicar of Wakefield feels like a \\"lady's novel,\\" one which lacks the bawdy excess of Fielding and the unique humor of Sterne, while never taking itself too seriously. n Mary WhippleShe Stoops to Conquer and Other Comedies (Oxford World's Classics)Oliver Goldsmith; a biography.

He was always misunderstood, as geniuses often are. This book has assured Goldsmith a place high up in the literature food chain. The theme of the book resembles somewhat the Book of Job from The Bible. Our hero is a good and innocent man who remains steadfast in faith and unbroken in courage as he faces numerous disasters. It is a story about the family Primrose and its fall from it's a place of comfort and security. The family consists of a mother and father and six children. Mr. Goldsmith's genius is in characterization, as well as his ability to evoke a pure goodness of heart and warmth and generosity of people of simple faith and warm generosity.

It is funny and at times very witty. Even though the language is a bit old fashioned, the book is still fun to read."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Regarded by some as a sentimental novel, Oliver Goldsmith's \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" (1766) describes the fortunes and misfortunes of the first-person narrator, Dr. Primrose, along with his wife and six children. The narrative is chiefly concerned with a description of Primrose's increasing adversity and the final restoration and elevation of his condition, in a story-line reminiscent of the Biblical book of Job. First the Primrose family loses their fortune, their home is engulfed by a fire, and eventually Primrose himself finds himself in prison, one daughter reportedly dead, another abducted, and a son jailed. But all is in the end restored as the narrative returns to the idyllic life of the Primrose home and its inhabitants as described at the end of the first chapter: \\"In short, a family likeness prevailed through all, and properly speaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive.\\" The circle is completed with the closing words of the final chapter: \\"As soon as dinner was over, according to my old custom, I requested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my family assembled once more by a cheerful fireside. My two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the company by their partners. I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for, all my cares were over, my pleasure was unspeakable. It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune should exceed my former submission in adversity.\\" Although Primrose is a vicar, his congregational and pastoral charge rarely comes into the picture, and it is more the events in this family circle that are the focus of his story.In the face of more than abundant adversity, Primrose remains the eternal optimist, a sweet and nave vicar who portrays himself unaffected by the worldliness and faults he sees in the lives of those around him. Nowhere is his naivete more evident than when he falls prey to the same deceptive character he has previously chastized his son for falling victim to. Yet Primrose remains blind to his own flawed character with its intellectual and spiritual pride. For example, when his half-dead son makes his entrance in the closing stages, Primrose affirms his own freedom from vanity, although the statement in which he makes this bold assertion suggests the opposite: \\"He now therefore entered, handsomely dressed in his regimentals; and without vanity (for I am above it), he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress.\\"While one must at times roll one's eyes at his excessive parade of virtue, the reader cannot help feel a strong measure of sympathy for his overly sweet character and good intentions. When his house burns down, rather than mourn the loss of his worldly possessions, he rejoices in the safety of his children: \\"'Now,' cried I, holding up my children, 'now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish. Here they are, I have saved my, treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.'\\" When misfortune results in his incarceration, he sees prison as an opportunity to convert the ungodly: \\"I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived some hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim.\\" Even his most malicious oppressors are reason for optimism: \\"... as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal.\\" And upon discovering that Jenkinson's account about the death of his daughter is false, he chooses to be overjoyed at her return rather than angered by the deception: \\"'How could you,' cried I, turning to Mr Jenkinson, 'how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death! But it matters not, my pleasure at finding her again, is more than a recompence for the pain.' \\"While Primrose's strength of spiritual character, moral fortitude and steadfastness in the face of crisis is exaggerated to the point of humor and wild improbability, it is nonetheless admirable in what it suggests about the human spirit. He sleeps untroubled while in prison and having suffered the most grave misfortune and being deprived of all that is dear to him: \\"After my usual meditations, and having praised my heavenly corrector, I laid myself down and slept with the utmost tranquility till morning.\\" And rather than grieve over his misfortune after his house has been engulfed with flames, he sees it as a positive benefit, for it humbles his wife's pride and makes her more receptive to the return of his daughter from prostitution: \\"I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one, and tho' we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart, I was willing to procure her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions.\\" And when too much laughter and merriness displeases Primrose in preparation for the solemn ceremony of marriage, he makes it the occasion for spiritual correction: \\"I told them of the grave, becoming and sublime deportment they should assume upon this Mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own composing, in order to prepare them.\\" And even some of the other characters share this virtuous approach, for rather than commiserate with Wilmot upon the loss of his fortune to deception, the senior squire remarks: \\"your present disappointment does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished.\\"Like Job, Primrose suffers at the hand of increasing disasters, but unlike his Biblical counterpart, he doesn't go to the ash-heap to mourn or struggle with his condition or grief. He remains constant in hope and optimism, sees in the greatest disasters opportunities for spiritual correction and growth, and always retains the prospect of improving his fortunes, if not in this life then in the hereafter. Despite his overly optimistic character, this nave and simple man who wants to serve God and his family presents a somewhat charming figure. We are curious what will be the outcome of his life, and our sense of expectation is heightened by the twists and turns of the plot, which for an 18th century work is reasonably fast paced and quite accessible for modern readers. While improbable, Primrose's journey from fortune to misfortune and back again might prove morally instructive not just to its protagonist, but to us all. - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Goldsmith's only novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, is, as another reviewer pointed out, a modern (1766) version of the book of Job. In the book of Job, Satan attempts to make a fool of God and at the same time attack Job. Satan accomplishes this by arguing that the godliness of Job, who is God's beloved, is motivated by self-interest alone. God allows Satan to test Job in order that God and Job be vindicated.In Goldsmith's story, Dr. Primrose is a priest with a loving wife and 6 wonderful children. They have an elegant house, the respect of their neighbors and the means to help others less fortunate. We are barely introduced to Dr. Primrose and his family when they are beset by misfortune. Their wealth is stolen and they must give up their family home and move to a distant village. From this point on, a series of ever increasing calamities occur.Through it all we know that Dr. Primrose and family will persevere even if we can't anticipate all the twists and turns in the story. With that said, Dr. Primrose is not perfect. The introduction makes clear that he is possessed of intellectual pride. This measure of sin lends the story an air of authenticity that would be missing if Dr. Primrose was perfection personified. As a side note, the Penguin edition of this book does have a useful introduction which helps to frame the issues Goldsmith was trying to communicate as well as providing context for the times. The end notes are also of tremendous help.The ending may be unlikely but the message of faith and family love endures. Don't let the age of this classic novel prevent you from enjoying its wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield is one of those books you told yourself in college to read but never quite got around to it. It is Goldsmith's only novel and includes several of his poems. The book might be termed \\"The Book of Job as written by Jane Austen,\\" in that it tells of the toils and troubles that beset an English vicar and his family, while at the same time being concerned with the love affairs of young people. The family Wakefield consists of the vicar, his wife and six children, two older boys, two girls of marriageable age and two small boys. The family is forced by circumstances to leave their good, middle class life in Wakefield and move to a lesser, but still tolerable existence in the countryside. There they encounter a variety of characters, some good and some bad and some seemingly good, but bad and some seemingly bad, but good--it all gets sorted out in the end.Much of what happens in the book is improbable, but the idea is not to present a factual account as much as a story about morality. As time goes by we see the foibles of the vicar and his family, but at the same time we see their natural goodness as well. But their problems mount and the book descends into what seems like unrelieved misery. We keep waiting for the negatives to turn into positives--after all this is not Thomas Hardy--but they are slow in coming and then are crammed into an implausible ending. One advantage of the book is that it is relatively short (less than 200 pages), thus we are not forced to wade through 500 pages of drudgery to find an alls well that ends well ending.I rate it at four stars because it is an excellent example of classical English writing with a story line that gives some insights into the life and values of English people at a time when England was growing in influence and power in the world."},{"Title":"Operation Twin Cessna","review":"It is so good to read a truly original action/adventure/thriller novel, when so much of what is out has been done so many times before. This book really takes us back and sucked me into its world and time, yet it really felt like it could be happining today. Zack is a great all American hero, a throwback to the true goodguys I grew up with, he fights the bad guys with an iron fist, but is soft with the ladies. And his side-kick Charles is a hoot! I love the planes and the cockpit &quot;chatter&quot;...very informative. I can't wait to see what this author comes up with next with this group of people, I hope he continues the series."},{"Title":"A White Bird Flying","review":"While this book will appeal to fans of prairie or pioneer literature, it has depths that will actually appeal to almost anyone. Set in the early 1900s in small-town Nebraska, it follows the childhood and early womanhood of Laura Deal. Laura is the beloved granddaughter of Abby, the heroine of Aldrich's &quot;A Lantern in Her Hand&quot;, and this book picks up right after Abby has died.Laura is gentle and whimsical, and through her discerning eyes we get to view the other members of the family, many of whom are unintentionally humorous and certainly similar to those we know in real life. There is her practical, materialistic mother, about whom Laura one day thinks, &quot;Mother has no poetry in her soul!&quot; Her father John is quiet and hardworking, who carries some of the burdens of the town on his back but inside is afire with pioneer pride. Brother Wentworth dashes from one boyish pursuit to another. Her extended family, such as her flighty cousin Kathie, fussy Aunt Grace, and powerful Uncle Mack, are all interesting to read about. Outside of her family are several fascinating neighbors, including the attractive Alan and old Oscar, one of the town's founders, who lives in the past and can only find Laura to listen to tales of his glory days.Although on the surface the story follows Laura's chronology in a fairly simple path, as she moves from school to college to a crisis of decision about how to proceed with her life, there are many other events, major and minor, occurring with everyone else in the story. There is her father's conflict with her uncle over bank monies lost, her cousin Kathie's gallivanting about rather than caring for her child, and old Christine's greediness for more land.There are also lovely descriptions of the Nebraska countryside, and in the brief but beautiful details of life we get a sense of time and place. Having had a grandmother in Nebraska myself, it all felt so real to me when I read this wonderful book! I also felt breathless when it came time for Laura to decide if she would choose love or money, and the last sentence of the book is one of the best lines I've ever read. It should be quoted like Shakespeare. Quite simply, this is a book to cherish."},{"Title":"A White Bird Flying","review":"This book is a WONDERFUL commentary on how we deal with the connections between generations. Not only was Laura caught between the ancient and modern worlds, but her feelings of progression and independance conflicted with her feelings of love and friendship. The realization that Laura finally makes is in fact the realization that ties us to the past and to the future. It creates an appreciation for those who came before us and those who will follow.I read this book first at age 14 and again at age 23. I feel more connected to Laura's emotions now, but her plight and hopes were some of the same that I had as I was growing up. There is an appreciation for all those people who stepped out of the safe world and traveled to the west, making a home for all of us who have followed."},{"Title":"A White Bird Flying","review":"I would consider White Bird flying a very good read if I hadn't read A Lantern in Her Hand first. White Bird Flying is a sequel to the Mackenzie - Deal saga begun in A Lantern in Her Hand and it is fun to learn what happened to Abbie's children, grand children and neighbors in the years follwing her death.But in reading this sequel, I got the feeling that Bess Streeter Aldrich was in a hurry to get the book out and didn't put the depth of feeling into her characters that she does in her other stories. The first chapter is promising with her dialogue between the neighbors contrasting with her narrative of Laura's feelings about her grandmother's passing.But she was lacking in other areas - she spent time on Christine Reinmueller but all we hear about Sarah Lutz is a brief mention of her funeral. Sarah was a significant character in the first book - always representing the material comforts that were just beyond Abbie's reach. It would have been interesting to know Sarah's thoughts on Abbie's death. Eloise is turned into a money grubber, which seems like a false note. Why did she marry John Deal then? This is never adequately explained in the book. Eloise's rich relatives seem to be a bit contrived - couldn't Laura have gone off into the world on her own steam, without being dependent on these relatives for her future? And cousin Kathie blows up into a caricature of herself - of course we all know she is spoiled from reading the first book but her plot lines could have maybe been drawn more subtly.But there is no denying that Aldrich is skilled story teller and her observations are magical. Her observations about life - &quot;No one can stop time&quot; make you feel like she has read your mind and has stolen your thoughts. And even if this story isn't up to par with &quot;Lantern&quot; it is still a worth while read. It is just best to have a different set of expectations for White Bird Flying than you might have for her other books."},{"Title":"A White Bird Flying","review":"This is the sequel to the novel A Lantern in her Hand by Bess Streeter Aldrich. Once you read this book, White Bird Flying, you have a deeper understanding of the first novel. These books are simply wonderful! She is a powerful, but overlooked author! This was pure pleasure!"},{"Title":"A White Bird Flying","review":"Wonderful Abbie Deal lives again in her granddaughter Laura, the writer of the family. As the Deals face the ups-and-downs of the modern world, the pioneer heritage of Will and Abbie Deal shines through.

A Lantern in her Hand was just wonderful."},{"Title":"A White Bird Flying","review":"I read A LANTERN IN HER HAND, the prequel to this book, when I was 13. I ordered it the day I ordered A White Bird Flying, and read them together ten years later. I have to say I understood the struggles and conflicts of Abbie and then Laura a lot more now. I think women are constantly seeking to strike a balance between their dreams and their families. And many think that they have to give up one or the other. I know I've struggled with these things in my own life. I was actually feeling conflicted about what I wanted out of life when these books came to me in the mail. I had just recently moved away from my childhood home, with my husband of one year. I had to take a job to help us through the financial slump. Like the Deals those of us in the west still depend a great deal on the resources of the land. Sometimes things are plentiful, other times we are just making it by. I once dreamed of a life full of bigger things. . .and as adulthood goes on I feel less and less able to do them. But I have always believed in the power of our influence on children. Because they are the future. And this world is in deep need of good parents. . .so maybe settling down, having a family, and giving those kids roots and wings are important. I recommend both these books to young women. Read A Lantern first. . .it gives you a perspective for A White Bird. Maybe being a wife and mother is still the most noble feat in life, not to say you can reach for your dreams too."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"This one may not be as well known as some of his other works, but it is worth reading.

The characters are all fully drawn, the protagonists and antagonists are all very human. The language is beautiful. Read the first page aloud to hear the poetry. An often missed classic"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"This is definitely one of my all time favorite books. The story is about the indomitable will of the people, who happen to live in occupied territory"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Some label The Moon Is Down as propaganda (usually a negative connotation even if its cause is virtuous) and there is an argument to make for that. The novella, about an unnamed European town under Nazi occupation, was written during John Stienbeck's stint as a World War II reporter and was translated into several languages and purposefully spread to areas that might face the dilemma depicted within.Yet Steinbeck is still Steinbeck and even if The Moon Is Down is a propaganda piece, that does not mean it is anything swallow. Among other things, Steinbeck excelled at portraying people in difficult situations with deep psychological and moral insight. That applies to the destitute Okies of The Grapes of Wrath, the wanderers from Of Mice and Men and it certainly applies to the humble townspeople of The Moon Is Down, who must decide between indigent but safe captivity or righteous but bloody resistance. Perhaps the most difficult and most interesting predicament is that of Mayor Orden. Is it is his duty to maintain security and order or to lead his people against the invaders?But what is remarkable about The Moon Is Down (especially considering its status as a propaganda novel) is how well Steinbeck explores the other side, that of the occupiers. Steinbeck refuses to let them be paper bad guys. Instead, he skillfully explores their paranoia that the town will rise-up and kill them and their misery due to everyone around them hating them.The atmosphere of The Moon Is Down is tense and it becomes only a matter of time before the bubble bursts. In the meantime, Stienbeck gets behind his characters' eyes for a deep and powerful portrait of occupation. The Moon is Down may have been written as a propaganda piece, but it is also a lot more."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"I have the original 1942 edition of The Moon Is Down and it is set in an unspecified Scandanavian town.

I thought the book was very understandable and it made you realize that in this kind of situation, no side really wins. It's kind of, balanced. I know that it was more of a grown up book, and I did need help from my mom with some of the words, but I still thought it was awesome. And I'm thirteen! My teacher told me that I could have fun in this kind of place so here I am. I thought the book was good yet I noticed that on the back of the book it mentioned the conquerers as Nazis. When in the book it never mentions the term, or even comes close. That's all I have to say on this book. If you haven't read it, then I strongly suggests that you do."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"John Steinbeck is best known for his depictions of American life, of the trials that ordinary men must face as they travel through life. \\"The Moon Is Down\\" is a departure in setting for Steinbeck, with the action placed in a small Norwegian town during WWII. Yet even with a change of scenery, the elements that make Steinbeck such a keen observer of human fate are present in this timeless, almost 'everyman' examination of how war affects the conquered and the conquerer.One Sunday morning, German soldiers arrive in a peaceful Norwegian town, and make short work of their occupation. Boarding with the mayor, the commanding officer hopes that the two can retain order as the Germans go about their business of extracting coal from the local mine to further their war actions. Yet the mayor will not betray his people, even to save them. As the occupation continues, the townspeople, unused to war, begin to fight their captors, with devastating consequences on both sides. And as the resistance increases, the soldiers find themselves despairing of victory.The story is short, with sparse amounts of description, which adds to the 'everyman' feel; readers are able to see themselves and their towns in the same situation. The conversations between characters are intense and focused; shifting between the brutal reality of war and the bittersweet memories men carry with them. \\"The Moon Is Down\\" is a poignant look at the effects war has on every side, and the debts that must be paid."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Before I read this book, I always thought the Nazis were unbreakable, faceless, heartless, killers with nerves of steel. Well \\"The Moon Is Down\\" proved me wrong. Steinbeck does a spectacular job of showing the story through the enemy's eyes. It gives a wonderful twist to stories we're so used to hearing.\\"The Moon Is Down\\" isn't like those. It shows the story from the enemy's eyes as well as the Good Guys'. You are able to witness the fear of both sides. It shows us that the Nazis were as afraid as we were. They went insane, they raped, they killed themselves, everything. There was just something about the way this book was written that made me read on in utter anticipation.What I really liked was how it would transition from a good guys' conversation to a bad guys'. It was almost you were in two places at once. It would even show conversations that had no relevance to the main plot, just to show you that is isn't all about the main plot. No book should direct you ONLY to the main plot. The only bad part is it ended rather abruptly. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Outstanding book by John Steinbeck one of the Great American writers. The story is about the Resistance in Norway during WW-II."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"In my opinion, this is the best of all Steinbeck's stories. The premise is that a strong army invades a small one with few ways to defend itself. While not explicitly mentioned, it is clear that the invaders are Germans in the second world war. The commander of the invading army is a scholarly type who was in Belgium in world war I and he remembers the brutality of the occupation and how little the brutality accomplished. While he is a good soldier and follows his orders, he is troubled by them and is not a hardened Nazi.What is so touching about the story is how the relationship between the invaders and the local population changes over time. Slowly, acts of heroic resistance begin and the invaders start to ratchet up the level of the reprisals, despite their understanding that it will make no difference. Caught up in a political system larger than them all, the base humanity and frustration of the people on both sides is described in great detail.The closing of the book is very poignant. The commander of the invading army and the village mayor genuinely like each other and in other circumstances would have been close friends. However, the village mayor and doctor are taken hostage and are speaking with the commander before they are to be executed. The courage of the mayor and doctor is extraordinary even though they admit their fear and that they think about pleading for their lives. This is very powerful material."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"My teacher gave us an assignment to read something by Hemingway or Steinbeck for an in class writing. I dreaded having to read yet another book for this class and I had already read Old Man and the Sea for school and I didn't enjoy at all. I put the assignment off as usual for a while until I needed a book to read while I was visiting DC for a few days. I happened across the first edition of this book in my Great Uncle's bookcase and thought of it as just an opportunity to do this assignment.Boy was I wrong. This book is truly something special for the way it makes your feelings mirror that of the characters in the story. At first it was confusing for I had no clue what the setting was or what was exactly going on. I gathered it was Nazis occupying the town from photographs in the book. Now that I look back on it, this feeling of confusion was the same many of the townspeople were feeling.Gradually confusion turns to frustration and so do yours not only for the oppressed townspeople but for the &quot;flies who conquered the fly paper&quot;, the soldiers. Steinbeck truly mastered using tone in this novel to portray the plot as it progressed.By the end I had a quick feeling of &quot;that's it?&quot; but I came to realize that Steinbeck had accomplished his goals and chose not to drag it on. Instead of making the plot plod on, he wisely finished at a good spot for the end of the story. You wonder what will happen to the characters after the end of the story, showing how in this short novel you really can empathize with all the characters in it, not just &quot;the good guys&quot;.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a well written book."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Although the ending was not 'out in the open', i guess it is common sense that carries you along. I thought the opening chapter was a bit slow , but i suppose he(j.s) wanted to ease the reader into the plot and give us a chance to get midly aquainted with the characters 'fore they were killed......i really liked the story and will continue to read his works........"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"John Steinbeck wrote this propaganda novel shortly after the Nazis had occupied most of Europe. A belief became prevalent, in Steinbeck's eyes, that much of the world was beginning to think the Nazis invincible and undefeatable, and to Steinbeck this was ridiculous. He wanted to portray them as mere men, evil and cruel and certainly overpowering at the moment, but human beings and not infallible. This novel was the result.The story centers around a town that has been occupied by an invading army (Steinbeck never identifies the soldiers as Nazis nor what country the town is in, but it's obvious that they are just that and the country is Norway). The invaders also plan on occupying the local coal mine; soon after coal miner Alexander Morden kills one of the soldiers with a pickax. Morden is sentenced to be shot, but his wife pleads with the mayor of the town, Orden, not to pass sentence. A battle of wills develops between Orden and Col. Lanser, the commander of the army. Lanser is a war-weary leader and Orden assures him he and his invaders will be \\"destroyed and driven out\\" by free men. In the meantime explosives have been acquired from England and are used to commit sabotage. Lanser wants Orden to put a stop to this, but Orden says it's beyond his control. The book ends with a large explosion in the distance.Although the book had a propaganda intent, Steinbeck does not demonize the enemy. The invaders are shown becoming homesick and disillusioned; one character, Lt. Tonder, is a lonely poet who is quite tender in his dealings with Alexander Morden's wife Molly (she kills him with a pair of scissors). (Some people at the time thought Steinbeck was TOO kind to the invaders.)Steinbeck's message is that free men working for a common cause will always be victorious. The book was, of course, banned by the Nazis, but was widely pirated and smuggled into all the occupied countries - and gave many in the resistance movements courage and hope. An important book then, and maybe worth looking at again as a reminder of the \\"durability of democracy.\\""},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"\\"The Moon is Down\\" (the title is culled from a line in Shakespeare's Macbeth)was published in 1942. John Steinbeck (1902-1968) the Nobel Prize winner and author of such classics as \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"; \\"Tortilla Flat\\"; \\"Cannery Row\\"; \\"Of Mice and Men\\"; \\"In the Winter of our Discontent\\" and many more novels and short stories is the author. Steinbeck was a native Californian and a patriot. Throughout his distinguished career Steinbeck voiced the importance of democracy against totalitarianism and the importance of common people.Donald V. Coers of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas notes in his excellent introduction to the Penguin Edition that this slim novella of only 113 pages (it was also turned into a play) lit the fire of freedom in underground movements throughout Europe captive to the evil of Nazi German rule. The book was also used in China where it inspired those citizens of that vast land who were fighting against the Japanese. It has been translated into many languages and remains a worldwide bestseller.The Plot: The book reads like a fable set in an unnamed country. The action takes place in a small village which has been captured by a foreign army (strongly resembling Nazi troops). The characters are:Mayor Orden-He begins the occupation by collaborating with the conquerors but soon turns against their harsh and cruel regime.He becomes a hero to the townspeople.Dr. Winter-The good doctor is also a hero as he joins Orden in opposing the invaders. Both men are scholarly and quote from Socrates oration prior to execution in the poignant final scenes.George Corell-The owner of a store and a Quisling who works with the enemy against the people of the town. He is later punished by revengeful townspeople.Captain Bentick-He is an invading officer who is killed by an irate miner after forcing the village's miners to produce coal to fuel the enemy war effort.Colonel Lanser-the head of the invading army. He is a cold man who will kill in an effort to squash any rebellion against authority.Lts. Pracker and Tonder are two young officers in the army of occupation who long for wine, women and the joys of domestic life back home in their native land.Captain Loff-An officious and foolish young man who has bought into the lies told by the unnamed leader of the nation he serves as a order loving by the rules man who wants to advance far in his military career.Annie and Joseph-two old servants of Mayor Orden who hate the invaders. Annie throws hot water at the enemy troops in a bold act of defiance and anger1Alex Morden and his wife Molly-Alex pays with his life before a firing squad for killing Bentick. Molly revenges herself by murdering Tonder who is courting her.The book is propaganda which is well written. The novel gave hope for freedom loving men and women who needed courage in the face of great evil. This is an important and fine book by one of America's greatest authors. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Steinbeck at his finest. The Moon is Down portrays a people that are so loyal and so patriotic that even when they are faced with thier own mortality they do not waiver. The Mayor in this novel is a beautiful example of a hero. It is a quick read and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Despite being written specifically as wartime propaganda \`The Moon is Down' is still a credible Steinbeck novel in it's own right. Set in a northern European town this looks at how the resistance grows up against the invaders and how they react to it. The town and countries are never specified, but it is normally agreed to be Norway and Germany, especially as this was written to bolster morale during WW2. This is a short novel, but typically for Steinbeck, it is perfectly crafted. His descriptions take you immediately to the scene and you feel the rebellion and disgust of the townsfolk and the despair and weariness of the invaders. This is a very subtle piece of propaganda and this is in no way brash or overtly anti German. Instead you see the human aspect of both sides in the conflict and how the enemy begin to fray around the edges in the face of the towns cold resistance. This redeeming quality of humanness is the soldiers strength and also their weakness and makes this a potent piece of propaganda. You see how the soldiers are human, just as much as the next man and if they seem machinelike and unbeatable in public it pays to be aware they are fraught and plagued with doubts in private. This must have been powerful to realise for those in occupied Europe. Ownership of this book was punishable by death in Italy during the war and it's nuanced and masterful story telling shows you exactly why this was so. This may not be as great as some other Steinbeck novels, but this is still a wonderful story, written with all of Steinbecks verve and skill and in hindsight is a great example of wartime propaganda at it's very best. This also has an informative introduction to add to your understanding and appreciation of the story.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"This was first published the year after the United States entered World War II (WWII); however, the European war began in 1939 by the Nazis invasion of Poland; Japan instigated their part of the war by invading China in 1937. Luckily these countries lost the war (although NeoNazis keep forgetting that the Nazi regime failed and Hitler committed suicide because of the ignominy). The oveall plot of this book could have been set in Asia; however, the descriptions really place it in Europe. However, the fight of conquered peoples against invading armies have happened throughout the world for millennia; unfortunately, human mindset makes it likely that it could occur for millennia more if we don't all kill each other off (and I have the hope that we can survive, in spite of our selfish and self-righteous attitudes).Big things, such as bombing enemy targets and blowing up bridges, and little things, including written propaganda and chocolate, all helped to win WWII; as it did for previous wars. In WWII, the people of those countries subjugated to the Nazis needed physical as well as mental support to fight on to liberate their countries. I heard this story was used in Europe to help bolster support of underground networks and to rally groups to directly fight against Hitler's megalomaniac dreams. Apparently Steinbeck won a freedom medal from Norway because of this story.This short story could be based on any number of wars, including World War I, in which the Germans were also defeated in ignominy. Except for the presence of airplanes, this could have even been set during earlier wars, including the Napoleonic Wars (Napoleon, another megalomaniac). The so-called conquering people can only think of the occupation on their terms and cannot understand that the conquered people do not want to be subjugated by them and will sacrifice themselves to gain their freedom. Luckily for us and what helped defeat the Nazis was their the self-righteous, superior attitude, often seen more recently by egomaniacs or megalomaniacs throughout the world (and in the past, notably many popes and monarchs).In this little story, Steinbeck has a full range of characters, from the ditsy wife of the mayor, to leaders who acknowledge their true role in the town and that they are dispensible in the war to maintain freedom for the town; and finally to German soldiers who question what is going on but keep doing their duty because if they go home they realize they would be executed. In the short length of this story, some of these characters are developed as much as in a full-length novel; the doctor, the mayor, the widow, and even a German colonel. The prose is easy to read and flows well; in places, the prose is poetic and quite moving.I have been interested in literature and nonfiction about WWII because two of my uncles and some people I used to work with fought in the war; my uncles in the Pacific, my friends in Europe. Many don't want to talk about their experiences, they did have PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), which had not been defined or acknowledged until recently, but these men and women still had it. Talking about some or all of it apparently does help and frankly it can be very interesting and of course distressing. Talking with people who fought in the war, reading histories, biographies and autobiographies (Audie Murphy's To Hell and Back is excellent) and reading literature written about the times, does help to understand what was going on 70 years ago. In addition, reading about the women here in the US during WWII who became mechanics, pilots, and other necessary personnel to aid in the war effort is very interesting and enlightening.Other people reading this review may feel this about other wars, most notably the Civil War; but WWII was personal to me because of those I loved who participated in it. The Civil War is not personal to me because I know of no ancestor of mine who fought in that war or any other earlier wars; possibly they did but my family has no knowledge of it (we only came from north of the Mason-Dixon line; so I know if my ancestors did fight in the Civil War, it would have been for the Union). I hope that more people would read fiction and nonfiction about previous wars to understand and hopefully help prevent future wars. Other really good books about various wars are: The Red Badge of Courage (the Civil War); All Quiet on the Western Front and Sagittarius Rising (WWI); Ill Met by Moonlight (WWII) and others. All books listed here I have read and consider them all 5 star. Please read these."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The important thing about this slim novel is when it was written. By 1942, the Nazis had occupied most of western Europe, but the world knew little then of the horrors that occupation would involve. Yet Steinbeck anticipates many of them and his observations of how the physical conquerors become the psychologically conquered is remarkably prescient. Or as one occupying officer put it so tellingly, \\"Conquest after conquest and deeper into the molasses .... The flies have captured the flypaper.\\" This is not propaganda as the world has since come to understand the term. Steinbeck doesn't demonize the anonymous occupying forces nor does he make heroes out of the people on the losing side. He just presents in a clear, straightforward way with a remarkable economy of language the debilitating effects of war when the fighting appears to be over.The Moon is Down was not greeted with universal acclaim by the critics of the day. But for the people of occupied Europe it was a godsend, as Donald Coers outlines in his fascinating introduction included in the Penguin Classics edition. Resistance movements grasped the hopeful message that \\"It is always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars\\" and history proved them and Steinbeck right."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"This short, less well-known story by Steinbeck offers a different perspective on war, from the point of view of the occupiers. The deftly woven tale shows that soldiers on the opposing side hate it just as much as those they're fighting. It's a gem in a two-hour read."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Though the THE MOON IS DOWN is set in Europe early in the Nazi Occupation and was written to stir resistance among captive peoples, it is not a novel about World War II and should not be pigeonholed as mere wartime propaganda. By not identifying the nationality of the occupiers or the occupied, Steinbeck allows readers to project their own feelings on the dramatic conflict between tyranny and freedom. For that reason, and because the oppressors are portrayed sympathetically rather than as caricatures, this short novel will likely be read by many future generations. As Sinclair Lewis did in IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE, Steinbeck has created a dystopian microcosm where ordinary people commit violent acts to reclaim their freedom while the agents of tyranny learn that force is insufficient to stamp out love of liberty. If American democracy were ever replaced by American tyranny, THE MOON IS DOWN would almost certainly be banned and reemerge in samizdat form as it did in 1940s France, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Sweden, Germany, Italy and Russia."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"I love this book. It is not, however, your typical Steinbeck. It has a lot of layers, is easy to read, is simple, yet complex. A story of war, of men, of people, of will, of peace, and of conquer. I highly recommend this book. Having an original printing is a plus too, it adds character and depth to the reading experience. Be careful that you get one in decent condition though, the binding on mine was already starting to go.

One Sunday morning at 10:45 AM a foreign force of gray uniformed soldiers drives into town and occupies it. Two officials, the postman and the policeman, are out on the ocean, on a fishing trip, in Mr. Corell's boat. The shopkeeper, Mr. Corell, has also organized a shooting competition for the local troops. They are out of town when the gray uniformed soldiers arrive. The occupation goes off without much of a hitch. A bad of occupying soldiers plays for the entertainment of the citizens. All seems calm, but in time the town's people become shocked, then angry, then view the new soldiers with great resentment. In order to gain the support of the people Colonel Lanser, the commanding officer of the occupiers, hopes to enlist the co-operation of Mayor Orden and Doctor Winter. Lanser reveals to these two that Mr. Corell has in fact been co-operating with them for some time. That is how the invasion went so smoothly. The Colonel asks why don't Orden and Winter co-operate as the shopkeeper did? Orden and Winter are greatly surprised. They wonder world the town's people follow them even if they did co-operate? The mayor and the doctor see no alternative but to quietly resist. Indeed the whole town will in secret resist.This book was first published in 1942. Although the invaders are never clearly identified as Nazis the text reveals that: (1) they are at war with England and Russia, (2) they follow a revered Leader, who must be obeyed at all costs, and (3) they remember defeats in Belgium and France in a previous war 20 years ago.John Steinbeck is of course a famous author and a winner of the 1962 Nobel Prize for Literature. This book was written about one third of the way into his writing career. By then he had written many of the books he is most famous for, such asOf Mice and Men (Steinbeck Centennial Edition)andThe Grapes of Wrath (Centennial Edition). All this of course leads the reader to expect that this will be a great work of art. Unfortunately reading it is a little like seeing those old black and white World War 2 movies, where the heroes, little men, struggle on valiantly against the implacable enemy. The book was in fact almost immediately on publication made into a movie. Steinbeck wrote the book \\"... to motivate and enthuse the resistance movements in occupied countries ...\\" (Wikipedia) and editions were indeed secretly published in occupied France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark the Netherlands and Italy. (Wikipedia) The propaganda ethos is strong and to modern readers a little false. It should be noted that when Steinbeck wrote the book he had no experience of war, or occupation, and had never been to Europe. This is perhaps why the novel lacks the authenticity of his well knows depression and rural American novels.To give Steinbeck his credit, though, it should be noted that, unlike those old movies, the Nazis are not faceless enemies of ultimate evil. We are presented with a very human array of soldiers, each one with his own motivations and reactions to various circumstances. Colonel Lanser is indeed the most interesting character in the book. He remembers the mistakes of the previous war and has doubts about his superior's orders. He is a man who looks for the path of least suffering, yet he is still a Nazi. Mayor Orden is also of some interest. He is a simple man, at times almost a buffoon, yet he knows what is right.The novel reads very easily and the plot moves along at an interesting pace. Chapter Six, revolving around Molly and Lieutenant Tonder, is perhaps the best written, very human but somehow not quite poignant. Steinbeck writes in a very theatrical style, with much dialog, interior, one room sets and minimal narration. At times this style works and on other occasions it seems stilted.In the past this book was a great commercial success and I do not mean to be overly critical of it. Let's face it, even today; people still like those old war movies. This novel is not bad, but not great."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The Moon isDown is aSteinbeck novel which has been downgraded by critics as a propaganda novel and especially by academic ones.I must disagree the novel presents the nazis who are named as such not in the cartoonist cariacature of propaganda but as humans with real feelings who have fear who desire love who suffer homesickness etc. There are some who are remorseless soullessideologues because such did exist but the emotions are realistic and this is why this novel is literature not propaganda, Steinbecks occupiers are a realisitc of how the Norwegians resisted the Nazis and many Norwegians commented on how amazingly accurate Steinbeck captures their resistance blowing up railroads working slow especially when mining equipment needs to be faced etc.All is told with inspiring heartfelt dialogue that some see as sentimental but I see as spirited and full of humane sensitivity and it is concise with few wasted words.The Moon is Down isnt at the level of other5 star novels like OfMice andMen or The Grapes of Wrath but I give it 5 stars anyway for the reasons stated above"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"A very, very short but very, very wonderful book that takes place during WWII. In a remote, unnamed town in an unnamed country, Nazis take control, thinking themselves in an easy position with all the arrogance of a regime of people with radical ideals. They quickly discover it's not much of a picnic to be in a town full of people silently resenting you and ready to take action the moment one of the invaders lets down their guard, whatever the consequences. This book might have only been a bit over a hundred pages but it was vastly moving and really impressed itself on my mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"In an unnamed country (similar to Norway) during World War II, a German sympathizer lures local men and the town's twelve soldiers into the forest long enough for the Germans to take the town. They occupy the home of the mayor as a sign of their power and commandeer the local coal mine. Mayor Orden has never before been a brave or very forceful man, but he is not a fool, and while he tries to keep order in the town, as the Germans demand, he refuses to use the power of his office to betray the ideals of his people. Soon the locals begin to sabotage everything the Germans can use to prolong the war.The narrative is dramatic, full of conversation and containing minimal description, which gives it the feeling of a simple morality tale. Steinbeck depicts the German soldiers, at first, as almost bumbling--organized, to be sure, but basically human, showing footsoldiers getting homesick, seeking understanding of the orders they must fulfill, complaining about the weather, and wondering if their mail will arrive on time. Gradually, as Berlin exerts more and more pressure to take out the coal, the German occupiers must impose more drastic measures. Local resistance becomes more violent in response: soldiers disappear and are found dead in snowbanks, small explosions blow up rail lines, and the miners have \\"accidents\\" which prevent the coal from being removed. Even the arrest of Mayor Orden and Doctor Winter cannot force the citizens to give in to tyranny.Though the novel was published in 1942 expressly for \\"propaganda\\" in Europe's occupied countries (where it was quickly translated and disseminated secretly), it is a good story which transcends its original purpose and, as a result, it continues to find an audience. The depiction of the Germans as ordinary but flawed humans--\\"herd men who win the battles\\"--rather than as terrifying monsters, makes their defeat seem possible. Depicting the townspeople as resourceful but ordinary--\\"free men who win the wars\\"--rather than as heroes, makes their resistance seem a natural, and victory seem possible.Though the characters are shallow, Mayor Orden does grow and change, and his references to Plato's defense of Aristotle in a crucial conversation with Doctor Winter put the relationship of the individual to authority into a wider context. Simple, direct, concise, and humane, this may be the most effective piece of mass propaganda ever written. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Steinbeck tells the story of WW II without ever telling the reader where the story takes place and who is fighting. Throughout the masterful novel, Steinbeck weaves the narrative of the Nazis and the common people who are defending their town together. Mayor Orden, the mayor of the occupied town, shows true leadership and is a true hero at the end of the novel. I think I was impressed most of all by Orden. Orden made me realize we should all have as much courage as he did to beat the enemy. Definitely a must read even if war novels don't appeal to you."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"I just finished reading the little 90 page novel, \\"The Moon is Down\\" by John Steinbeck. Written in 1942 about an unnamed Scandinavian country that is occupied by the Nazis, it is testimony to the un-conquerability of free men and women, and the terrible price paid in the souls of the occupying forces. The parralels with the present US occupation of Iraq are profound. It should be required reading for all Americans .. I'm thinking of sending a copy to Paul Bremer."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The setting is World War II and in less than an hour a small Norwegian town is captured by the Nazi forces. Peace has been in the hamlet for so long that the Mayor is befuddled as to what is the proper protocol for a city under occupation.If you believe this is a simple story of naive people then you are just as bad as the Nazi commander who thinks the same. Steinbeck's brilliance has presented us with a complex psychological drama of war. What we have portrayed is a commander who surrenders his common sense and judgement to his far off superiors in controlling the town. He is so sure of his stance even when he sees things are falling apart.Come to this little hamlet and witness a people whose stubborness won't allow them to be conquered. Feel the alienation of the German soldiers as they become stripped of their humanity and relegated to madness. See those whom you think are naive and stupid rise to the occasion in displaying great courage and leadership.Steinbeck has done an exceptional job in displaying the horrors and absurdity of the so-called conquered and conquerer.

This is the first time anyone has conquered or been conquered in many years. The towns people do not revolt as the soldiers enter their town. They keep to their own business.

As the town remains under control, individuals begin to act out and revolt. This results in the execution of the rebels. Mayor Orden states the \`the people do not like to be conquered'. The conquerors soon find out that the conquerors can eventually become the conquered. The only way for this to end, is when one side is completely wiped out. Which side will prevail? Who will end up being the conquered? You will get the answer plus more in Steinbeck's THE MOON IS DOWN."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"I began reading this book without much background, but from the first page I was drawn into the story and set aside the other book I was reading. This is an extraordinary book that contains a moral argument that can apply to any place and any time. The story is told with an economy that is marvelous to behold. Where other authors would have penned a weighty tome, Mr. Steinbeck presents the problems and personalities of his characters in just over 100 pages. This is an ageless story of the conquered vs. the conqueror. Although the setting offered is in Norway during the German occupation of the Second World War, it is a story that took place in many places with the same problems and arguments.Perhaps the most interesting part of this book is that Mr. Steinbeck does not take sides. The Germans are in Norway to do a job, to take away as much coal as they can, and the people in the village resist the invaders. One of the pivotal characters is Colonel Lanser, a veteran of the First World War who knows what to expect from a conquered people. He knows the various stages of resistance yet is also aware that he will follow orders and can do nothing to change the course events will take. There is fatalism to all of the characters that they must do what they have to and cannot deviate from their courses: the conquered will resist, the conquerors will punish resistance. The drama of this story is central to the story of Molly Morden, whose husband Alex is executed after he kills a German captain. She finds herself face to face with a lonely German lieutenant who wants to talk with her. She begins to see him as just another human being caught up in an impossible situation, but, eventually, he identity as one of the conquered overtakes these feelings. We see both sides in this conflict as the human beings they are, caught up in an impossible situation. We find the conquerors caught in a no-win situation and the conquered certain that victory will be theirs, but at a terrible price.I think this book should be taught in schools as it gives unlimited possibilities of discussion but also provides a realization that war is terrible for all, and no one has clean hands. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"It is the middle of the war, and the enemy has invaded a small country. In one small town, the occupation begins, and the antagonism with it. The enemy commander would like the town to submit quietly, the enemy troops would like to go home, and the townspeople would like the troops to go home as well. As the occupation continues, the hostility between sides mounts, until finally it manifests itself with tragic results. Steinbeck's examination of the effects of war on both the aggressor and the occupied is possibly the best example of his understanding of human nature. Steinbeck has an instinctive feel for real human emotion and interaction, and he puts it to use here. The growing unrest among the enemy troops, the festering anger and rebellion among the townspeople, and the transformation of simple people into heroes are all portrayed with stunning insight and feeling. This story means as much now as it did during World War II, when it was written, translated, and circulated to every corner of the resistance. It will endure as a triumph of the human spirit over captivity."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Although Steinbeck is one of America's most beloved authors, this particular work seems to be overshadowed by his more famous Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men. This incredibly touching story does not get the credit it deserves. The fond statements the genius author makes about democracy rouse patriotic emotions in the reader. This is a war book that is not about war. It's about power, corruption, and narrow-mindedness. It's about love, freedom, and equality. It's about the things every human being should know and read about, so I recommend that all people read this amazing piece. I promise it will make you think about things you take for granted."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"This is Steinbeck's fifth novel or more accurately a novella. The writing is exceptional and it must be ranked as average or better, but it is short and cannot be compared with his best known novel \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" Steinbeck shifts his focus away from California and gives us a very interesting book based on World War II. Think it is exceptional and one of his better short works. It is almost as good as his other famous novella \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which was his first novel. I have read most of his works including the present, which is an interesting and a must read for Steinbeck fans. It has interesting prose and good drama, and it is very well written. I would rank it on par with \\"Cannery Row\\" and ahead of \\"The Pearl\\" and better than \\"Tortilla Flat\\" in my opinion - based on the writing.It is an interesting book. It is about resistance to an invading force. We can assume that it is probably Norway during World War II, and their resistance to Germany, but Steinbeck keeps it a bit vague which broadens the appeal of the book. It could apply to any invading force.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" has over ten million copies in print.Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels and this is another good example. The present work is short and probably ranks among the middle or higher of his 17 novels and novellas. Readers will appreciate the clarity of the prose, the characters, and the message.It is not a heavy read and takes one evenings to read. I liked the book and give it a positive recommendation, and it would be high on my list of Steinbeck novels.As a suggestion, do not buy the book alone, but rather would buy it as part of a collection such as Steinbeck's book: \\"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck,\\" from Viking Press in 1953, and updated versions of that book."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The Moon Is Down is a history book.

It's a good read. . . a very good read, because it reminds us of what terrible things can happen, Man's Inhumanity to Man, to coin a phrase.But it also reminds us of strength and honor. It shows us what can be, good and bad.It is not Steinbeck's best but it is still good. It isn't Grapes of Wrath or Of Mice and Men, but not every book is.

If he did, he disappeared, and some snowdrift reeived his body. If he went alone to a woman, he disappeared. The men of the battalion could sing only together, could dance only together, and dancing gradually stopped and the singing expressed a longing for home. THeir talk was of friends and relatives who loved them and their longings were for warmth and love, because a man can be a soldier for only so many hours a day and for only so man months in a year, and then he wants to be a man again, wants girls and drinks and music and laughter and ease, and when these are cut off, they become irrestibly desirable. \\"~John Steinbeck, The Moon is DownThis book, written and released in the first year of of the Second World War, was extremely contraversial for Steinbeck. He had already established himself as a wonderful author whom was loved and respected for his clever word choice and characters, but the authoring of this book called him into question in some eyes.He tells the story of an occupied country, more importantly, an occupied city, where the invading soldiers come into a peaceable-minded people's town and try to slowly take power; eventually seeing that no one takes well to enslavement, and winter begins. Steinbeck gives each character on each side equal time to tell their reasons for being there, for killing the soldier, for falling in love with the coal miner's wife and visiting her on rounds, for being a mayor who stands up to the colonel but does not consider himself to be very brave.We find out the minds of all creatures of war, the occupied, the enslaving, the confused and angry.\\"Good.

War is an ugly business, and this book shed light on it for me as just that: a snapshot into war and how it effects the creatures within it.I recommend The Moon is Down and promise you will be moved by the simple story John Steinbeck tells about this unnamed town somewhere in the snow, fighting for their lives by turning cold, hanging solidly together, while soldiers attempt to hold the entire existence under control, even though they long for the familiarity of home.\\"Do you remember in school, the Apology ?

It is a brilliant, compelling work of fiction that is so close to reality it will give you chills. The book is written with simple prose that is still very gripping, and it's a book you could easily finish in one sitting due to it's length and the fact that you won't want to put it down.The basic story is that a group of foreign soldiers, commanded by the mysterious &quot;Leader&quot;, takes over a small town in another country (specific names of countries aren't used). The interactions between the characters act as a sort of window to some profound truths about human nature and war. As I said, the story is gripping as well and the characters are very interesting. I personally enjoyed this book a lot more upon the first read than I did The Grapes of Wrath (which is utterly brilliant, but works on a different level). The fact that the book was published during the height of Nazi power only adds to it's impact.I think Moon is Down is a book that everyone should read.

The idea is that Germany's government is so centralized and repressive that they have prevented their people from developing skills like thinking for themselves and leadership. As Mayor Orden (the mayor of the invaded town) says, even if he is shot, a free people will rise to the occasion under a new leader.

All grows impatient as the conquerer begins to doubt the superior word that they are winning the war, and the conquered, once willing overthrown people, sense insecurity and resort to terrorism. Steinbeck's work is mostly dialogue and reads like a taut play, and his eloquent passages speak clearly with no linguistic or cultural differences between the two groups of people, indeed they are all members of the human race, passing time like a bomb waiting to expire. Heavily indebted to Melville's \\"Billy Budd\\", ( one chapter seems an homage to Melville's tragedy ), I'm also reminded of a later work; William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick's \\"The Ugly American\\", in which an invading American army turns a corner of Vietnam into a bureaucratic nightmare. At 188 pages, ( hardbound ), \\"The Moon Is Down\\" reads very quickly, it possesses a timeless quality, being first published in 1942, just prior to American's entrance in World War II."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"It's fashionable these days to dismiss Steinbeck's Nobel Prize as an example of the bad judgment of the Committee. In fact, Steinbeck is the one of \\"the big three\\" (Papa, Bill, and John) most likely to hold his preeminence among American novelists in a century. I don't know of a writer who more truly represents his own century than Steinbeck, except perhaps Mark Twain.If you want to know why the Committee chose Steinbeck, The Moon Is Down is a painless way to find out. Everything is there -- the brilliant, understated, economical writing, the visionary faith in the common people, the embracing spirit that understands without applauding or condemning. You can find all that in other books, familiar ones like Of Mice and Men or Grapes of Wrath. Of Mice and Men has become such a staple of obligatory reading that it's hard to appreciate, and Grapes of Wrath is dauntingly long for Twitterers. But The Moon Is Down can be read in a couple of leisurely hours, and Steinbeck walks the slack rope between sentimentality and simplicity as deftly as Thomas Paine, creating a story simple enough for children that ends, with enormous cheek, by recreating the death of Socrates.Steinbeck's instincts are refined to a kind of purity here. He makes fun of the pretensions and priggishness of young officers, confronts one of them with the crude reality he disdains (\\"love\\" costs \\"two sausages, nice plump ones\\"), and yet allows the woman in question to keep her honor and dignity. He never says so in so many words, but the leader of the Resistance is not the honest and courageous mayor, it's his cook, an aging curmudgeon who fights the Nazis because she has a bad temper she can finally be proud of. His \\"sympathetic\\" German officer is all the more noxious because he comprehends the moral degeneracy he serves. When the Mayor observes \\"It is always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars,\\" the platitude resonates through every page of the book.This is an ideal introduction to Steinbeck -- didactic without being preachy, amusing and heartbreaking, as focused as an Ansel Adams landscape, as universal as breath. Any writer would be proud to have written one book this good; Steinbeck wrote nearly a dozen."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Today, Steinbeck's World War II novella, sixty six years after it was written, has gained a timeless significance: a brief, yet well thought-out glimpse into human relationships, between occupation and resistance in times of war. Published in 1942, the book was translated, clandestinely distributed and eagerly read by people in German-occupied countries. In the United States, it was also criticized for being too soft and generous in the depiction of the enemy. Whereas early impressions may suggest to the reader a surprisingly light parody or simplistic morality tale, we soon recognize the subtle, and with each page mounting, intensity of Steinbeck's anti-war message.Set in a small mining town in an unnamed country, invaded by an unspecified enemy force, numerous hints, however, suggest that the story's events take place in Northern Norway at the time of the 1940 Nazi occupation. The townspeople, totally unprepared for an invasion after having lived in peace for a very long time, had forgotten how to fight... Consequently the initial assault is over in less than an hour, well planned with the help of a local quisling. Taking control of the town and its mining operation turns out to be a much more complicated and difficult affair than Colonel Lanser and his battalion had been trained for and anticipated. Their headquarters established in the Mayoral residence, good Mayor Orden has little choice but to tolerate their presence. Steinbeck introduces the main players in the unfolding drama with a few yet defining characteristics. Orden, for example, comes across as an indecisive, somewhat dotty, older chap, fussed over by \\"Madame\\", his protective, efficient little wife. Doctor Winter, the local medic and historian and Orden's childhood friend does not appears to be up to the challenges, despite some traits of a Dr. Watson. But, early impressions are certainly misleading in this story.On the opposing side, the officers are a motley collection of unlikely elite military personnel, described more like army caricatures: spending more time debating than leading the battalion: one is an Anglophile, another more concerned with his model railway than the battle, and yet another honestly believes that he can find real friendship among the women of the town. Except for Lanser, none of them had seen combat before and their navet&eacute; is poignant. While justifying their action with \\"just following the Leader's orders\\", they soon realize that that excuse doesn't convince anybody. To achieve their primary objective, that is access to the town's coal, the officers insist on orderly cooperation from the townspeople, increased production and an easy life for the soldiers. Herein, as they soon find out, lies the problem... While the soldiers are muddling through in their attempts to control the locals through arbitrary executions for disobedience and non-cooperation, occupiers and local resistance are caught in a spiral of events that will lead to inevitable results as one side is destabilized and the other made stronger. Nobody can escape, sidestep or ignore the brutality of war.Steinbeck's subtle build up of the characters' strengths and weaknesses is superb. Orden (his name, incidentally, in German means \\"medal\\", often as a military decoration that Orden would have deserved...) is a case in point. His perceived malleability to the colonel's demands grows in fact into disguised and effective opposition: because he cannot represent his townspeople and therefore \\"cannot control what they do\\". The townspeople, initially confused, isolated yet quietly resisting, find new defence mechanisms and strength in coordination, and, like the flies the flypaper, may eventually overwhelm the enemy...Steinbeck's novella is written in a series of tableaux as if set for the stage. (*) Each such set is introduced by a short depiction of the background or description of events beyond the confines of the scene's space, most often the Palace's drawing room. There, the lively dialogue between the main protagonists gives immediacy to the action threads of the story. With this narrative technique, Steinbeck focuses on the personal and intimate interaction between occupiers and occupied and their evolving relationship, underscoring the human tragedy of war and those caught up in it, whatever their personal guilt or innocence. [Friederike Knabe](*) It was in fact produced as such in 1943."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"In 1942, at the height of the Nazi domination of Europe, Steinbeck wrote this novella about a small mining town under enemy occupation. Neither the country nor the aggressor is specified, and the character names are generically European, but everything fits the German conquest of Norway in 1940. Steinbeck wrote the book frankly as propaganda, as a contribution to the war effort; the introduction by Donald V. Coers to the Penguin Classics edition admirably documents the success the novel had in numerous translations smuggled into occupied Europe. Coers also discusses the controversy that the book stirred up among critics in America, some of whom accused Steinbeck almost of literary collaboration.But therein lies its fascination. At first blush, the subject suggests a story of helmeted Nazis and daring saboteurs by Alistair MacLean or Jack Higgins, and propaganda would seem a rather low literary form. But the amazing thing -- though obvious in retrospect -- is that Steinbeck keeps his own style intact, just as though he were writing of the American heartland. He is less concerned with great events than with the people caught up in them, and he describes them with the same understanding, warmth, and even humor that he would bring toCANNERY ROWorEAST OF EDEN. Furthermore -- and this is what so shocked his critics -- he finds the same humanity in the occupying soldiers as among the victim population. I titled this review \\"Occupation\\" rather than \\"Resistance\\" because Steinbeck's book really is two-sided, and shows the soldiers being destroyed as much by their own isolation and loneliness as by the overt acts of the people. The nearest thing to a stereotypical Nazi is the keen-as-mustard Captain Loft, who wants to do everything by the book. But his commanding officer, Colonel Lanser, says of him: \\"He's frightened. I know his kind. He has to be disciplined when he's afraid or he'll go to pieces. He relies on discipline the way other men rely on sympathy.\\"Lanser, the First War veteran who sees the folly of his orders even as he is forced to follow them, is one of the two richest characters in the book. The other is Mayor Orden, the aging representative of the townspeople, who is confused by events at first, but gradually comes to realize his true role. The scenes between these two men, impossible negotiations unresolved by their shared humanity, show Steinbeck at his best. Even Steinbeck's slightly awkward reach for grandeur towards the end, when Orden tries to quote Socrates, is redeemed by the fact that the old man cannot quite remember the words. Whatever the context, Steinbeck writes best about ordinary people because he can imagine himself in their minds and feelings. The fact that he is writing about a situation he had never experienced in a country he has never visited, makes that feat of imagination nothing less than amazing."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"Nice story, and a nice execution of the story. Steinbeck's voice is strong and unflinching. But the whole thing hinges on the humanity of the invading soldiers - without that there's no meaning. And we all know about how human most Nazis were in their dealings with conquered people. So we're left with the sad sense of everyone taking their place on the Wheel of Life and playing their roles until death do us part. That is, it might have been more meaningful had the Nazi characters actually broken the mold big-time and translated some of their humanity into concrete actions useful to the populace instead of reverting to form and attempting half-heartedly the few stillborn sympathetic actions they did attempt. Nevertheless, the novel is tight, with Steinbeck not yielding to the temptation of playing out some of the more obvious scenes.

Steinbeck's soldiers are real humans with real concerns, fighting a war and occupying a town for reasons which at first seem clear, but which become foggier as the novel progresses. As one soldier laments in a fit of hysteria, &quot;The flies have taken over the fly paper!&quot; The final moving scene and the interweaving of *The Trial and Death ofSocrates* leaves the reader with only one conclusion: Steinbeck truly was a genius . . ."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"How can I comment on this book.

I really enjoyed this perspective on war, read it for sure, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"By casting the German occupiers as humans, even individually sympathetic humans, Steinbeck created a work of propaganda that was much more than that. For Americans today, it's a modern parable of the perils of being a conqueror and an occupier. In one trenchant line he encapsulates the dilemma of the conquerers: \\"the flies have conquered the flypaper.\\""},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The history of this book is as interesting as the book itself. Written by author Steinbeck as a propaganda piece for the Office of Coordination of Information and the Office of Strategic Services, this book was intended to inspire the citizens of Nazi occupied countries during World War II. Its purpose was to give them hope during these dire times and to inspire them to sabotage action against the invaders. It was created for the citizens of Norway, Denmark, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Hundreds of thousands of copies in four languages circulated through Western Europe at great risk to the occupied. It is easy to see why this book was so popular. It is real. The German occupiers, the inhabitants of the overturned lands, the traitors and spies, all are captured with intensity by Steinbeck. In the unnamed country that is the setting for this book, the Germans invade to steal their coal. But soon, the invaders were as disturbed and unhappy as the invaded, who were taking steps to overthrow the foreigners. There are several layers to this book, and even now, seventy years later, it is a moving experience.

Should be required reading for all liberals."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"John Steinbeck's \\"The Moon is Down\\" was written at the height of Nazi power in World War II. It is deliberately vague in not explicitly identifying Nazi Germany as the occupying power. The occupied town is equally mysterious. Un-named and unremarkable, it could have been a small town in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Romania, Poland or anywhere else invading troops had taken over.The reason this book was banned in Nazi Germany and in Fascist Italy is that Steinbeck hits the mark in identifying the feelings that consume both occupying power and occupied community. With passing weeks and months the power of the occupying army begins to wane. The occupied town resists passively and increasingly, more actively. Attitudes on both sides harden as hatred, distrust and revenge consume both.There is no clear-cut winner or loser. Community and individuals alike are compromised and relationships broken. The reason this short work has endured is that its lessons are timeless. The feelings that Steinbeck identifies are similar to what can be seen in Afghanistan today with U.S. forces in the role of occupying power. The same could be said for the years the U.S. was in Iraq. The same holds for Israeli Defense Forces in the West Bank. These are the timeless feelings of injustice.An occuping power regardless of time, place and country experiences what the occuping power in \\"The Moon is Down\\" experienced. Likewise, the occupied town reacts. Object lesson: for all, civility is lost."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"\\"The Moon is Down\\" is not one of John Steinbeck's better known books. This novella--the copy I read was less than 100 pages of actual story--looks at a small Scandinavian town occupied by the Nazis though, while there is no mistaking the message and the general theme, the author remains vague about the governments involved. Steinbeck presents a haunting look at tyranny and the human spirit and offers a reminder that governments may conquer nations but they can never control \\"hearts and minds\\"--a lesson that still needs to be learned as recent events have shown. As always, Steinbeck is a masterful writer though much of the action takes place off stage much like a Greek drama. I was not particularly surprised to see \\"The Moon is Down\\" also was a play. While short, this novella is very satisfying and earns the highest recommendation though some readers will find this a different work than Steinbeck's usual fare."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"This book was in great condition. It was just as it was described by the seller. My boyfriend collects antique books and \\"The Moon Is Down\\" is his all time favorite read so when I saw this copy, I just couldn't pass it up. Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"According to the interesting introduction written by Donald V Coers, this short book by the author of \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was printed and read illegally by many thousands of people living in fascist occupied Europe during World War 2.The novel provides a fascinating view of the contrasting mentalities of the occupied and the occupiers. It shows how the oppressed become more defiant as the oppressors become more disillusioned.A quick, satisfying read, which must have been inspirational to those living under the Nazi's heels.I am the author of 'ALIWAL', available on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"In an unnamed country (similar to Norway) during World War II, a German sympathizer lures local men and the town's twelve soldiers into the forest long enough for the Germans to take the town. They occupy the home of the mayor as a sign of their power and commandeer the local coal mine. Mayor Orden has never before been a brave or very forceful man, but he is not a fool, and while he tries to keep order in the town, as the Germans demand, he refuses to use the power of his office to betray the ideals of his people. Soon the locals begin to sabotage everything the Germans can use to prolong the war.The narrative is dramatic, full of conversation and containing minimal description, which gives it the feeling of a simple morality tale. Steinbeck depicts the German soldiers, at first, as almost bumbling--organized, to be sure, but basically human, showing footsoldiers getting homesick, seeking understanding of the orders they must fulfill, complaining about the weather, and wondering if their mail will arrive on time. Gradually, as Berlin exerts more and more pressure to take out the coal, the German occupiers must impose more drastic measures. Local resistance becomes more violent in response: soldiers disappear and are found dead in snowbanks, small explosions blow up rail lines, and the miners have &quot;accidents&quot; which prevent the coal from being removed. Even the arrest of Mayor Orden and Doctor Winter cannot force the citizens to give in to tyranny.Though the novel was published in 1942 expressly for &quot;propaganda&quot; in Europe's occupied countries (where it was quickly translated and disseminated secretly), it is a good story which transcends its original purpose and, as a result, it continues to find an audience. The depiction of the Germans as ordinary but flawed humans--&quot;herd men who win the battles&quot;--rather than as terrifying monsters, makes their defeat seem possible. Depicting the townspeople as resourceful but ordinary--&quot;free men who win the wars&quot;--rather than as heroes, makes their resistance seem a natural, and victory seem possible. Though the characters are shallow, Mayor Orden does grow and change, and his references to Plato's defense of Aristotle in a crucial conversation with Doctor Winter put the relationship of the individual to authority into a wider context. Simple, direct, concise, and humane, this may be the most effective piece of mass propaganda ever written. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The Moon Is Down by John Steinbeck is a classic novel dealing with the emotional effects of war. Set during World War II, we are introduced to the &quot;conquerers&quot; and the town that has been sieged. A once docile, peaceful people, the villagers are quickly changed into a people full of hatred and malice. The Moon Is Down tells us how war can change people for the good, and for the worse. The townspeople become consumed with rage, and want nothing more than to free themselves by killing their conquerers. The conquerers, who were once strictly militant in every move and thought, become affected by what they have done to the once peaceful villagers, and gain more compassion througout the novel. The Moon Is Down is facepaced, and not long length-wise. Contrary to other Steinbeck works, this book is written almost in &quot;play&quot; style. It moves quickly with much of the story being dialog. It reads increadible fast and is very entertaining, as well as thought provoking. It forced the reader to sympathize with the conquerers and become emotionally attached with both the protagonists and the antagonists. This book forces the reader to delve deaper into their own minds and think more deeply about war, and it's effects on all of humanity."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The Moon is Down is not the most well-known of Steinbeck works, probably in part due to its unusual genesis, but it is a remarkably stirring work. Written as anti-German propaganda in 1942, it was by far the most successful work of Allied propaganda, with hundreds of thousands of copies in circulation in many different languages (despite Axis attempts to suppress it).As propaganda, the work was criticized as being too easy on the Germans -- portraying the occupying soldiers as very human and real instead of as cold and heartless. There is no doubt in my mind that this is precisely the reason for its success (and that Steinbeck is a genius in this respect). Steinbeck wrote about the plight of the occupied citizenry in a way that was so real that he reached them. It is also precisely in the occupying army's humanity that Steinbeck places the weapon that ultimately inspires the occupied and destroys the occupier: fear. One of the occupying soldiers articulates the fear very clearly: \\"The enemy's everywhere! Their faces look out of the doorways. The white faces behind the curtains, listening. We have beaten them, we have won everywhere, and they wait and obey, and they wait\\" (p. 64). He goes on to liken the occupying army's success to that of flies who conquer flypaper. And of course the novel itself brings the fear to life -- the flypaper ultimately proves quite inhospitable to the flies.Steinbeck's work is interesting on deeper levels, too. Freedom and leadership are clearly top-of-mind for him, and he elegantly describes both. Steinbeck's Mayor is a wonderful leader and a powerful advocate for freedom as indefatigable. He tells the colonel of the occupying forces, for instance: \\"You and your government do not understand. In all the world yours is the only government and people with a record of defeat after defeat for centuries and every time because you do not understand people\\" (p. 48). The colonel's lack of understanding is precisely that the will to be free will prevail.Finally, the Mayor is such a wonderful case study of a leader who is born of the circumstances in which he finds himself. Early in the novelette he is timid and reticient. He seems to be waiting. Then, when one of his people kills an enemy soldier, he suddenly steps up, and says of the beginning of the occupation: \\"the people were confused and I was confused. We did not know what to do or think\\" (p. 54). But the action of this one person provides the guidance and clarity that he needs to catalyze his people. And with that one man's action, he takes his queue from his people (such a remarkably subtle but so significant characteristic of a great leader), and with great wisdom and courage leads his people in the exploitation of his occupier's great fear.Definitely a good (short) read."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"John Steinbeck fully represents a great American author. His novel, &quot;The Moon is Down&quot; was written as a form of propaganda for its time, and Steinbeck uncovers profound, often unsettling truths about war-and about human nature. In every chapter you read, you can find a descriptive image about the town which has been conquered, and the feelings of its people. This book reveals the evil in human nature, and the reaction of a conquered people. A small town has just been taken over and is now Nazi occupied. The troops come in, and immediately the attitude of this once peaceful town, turns into vengeance. The mayor represents the word of the people. He stays office for a in while, however under the influence and control of the Nazi's. The people of the town show no kindness, and much disrespect to the officers, which in turn makes the Nazi's angry. This leads to the death of many innocent lives. There is much loneliness and danger in the town, which results in many citizens trying to escape to England. Some successfully do, and get to the English leaders to ask for help. The English sends planes over, and drops boxes and parachutes filled with bombs and ammunition for the people of the town to use against the Nazi's. This is where the trouble begins, and certain important lives are lost. Steinbeck includes striking images and fine dialogue throughout the entire novel. Every chapter contains a descriptive image of the town adding to the drama. This, for example, found on page 51, &quot;And over the town there hung a blackness that was deeper than the cloud, and over the town there hung a sullenness and a dry, growing hatred.&quot; Even when a line is not in context, we can understand the story by Steinbeck's creative and vivid scenes. He flavors his words in such a way, that we can fully capture the mood of a scene, and the meaning of the novel. Steinbeck helps us to understand the war and the people involved in it. A sense of togetherness is exemplified in the people, and the theme of working together is expressed in their attitudes, as they fight to save one anothers lives. What was happening to them was unfair and immoral, however they stuck through it by understanding that a group is so much better than an individual, and caring for others helps make them and you a stronger person."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"During the height of World War II John Steinbeck, renowned for his accurate and detailed depictions of the Monterey County published a short propagandistic novel designed to elicit hope and courage in the hearts of the oppressed compatriots in the Nazi-occupied territories. Demonstrating his multifaceted style, Steinbeck keeps descriptions to a minimum as the events unfold. The book, however, has been widely criticized for its portrayal of the \`insuperable enemy' as mere-mortals: men with fears and feelings of their own who detest fighting and are anxious to return back home. The Moon is Down tells the story of Mayor Orden and his fellow citizens' fight for freedom through effective dialogues and conversations. Its evident accessibility to people of varying degrees of literacy and education made it one of the most effective pieces of Allied propaganda ever written. Despite the ban in Axis-controlled regions, the book gained momentum and popularity throughout Europe with just 3,000 (estimated) illegal copies. Steinbeck powerfully and eloquently establishes that despite the harshest of circumstances, free-willed people will triumph over their oppressors.In 1941, amidst uncertainty and declining moral of World War II, Steinbeck drafted and presented The Moon is Down to the Foreign Information Service. Washington DC immediately dismissed setting the story in the United States, the patriots could not imagine an invasion in their homeland. Steinbeck proceeded to write the novel with poignantly vague depictions: as the events unfold, the setting is subject to readers' interpretation and could be located in any Eastern-European country. Shortly after being published in March 1942, The Moon is Down opened as a play in the New York Theater, followed by a movie adaptation in 1943. John Steinbeck generously donated his earnings toward the war effort. The book was targeted at the Axis-occupied Europe that was in a dire need of hope. People quickly translated and disseminated it under the shroud of secrecy and the penalty of death.A band of soldiers seized Mayor Orden's town with the help of a local coward in order to extract coal from the mines. The people were taken by surprise and initially showed little resistance, \\"The town was occupied, the defenders defeated, and the war was finished\\" (p1). From the onset the invaders consider \\"[the war] more of an engineering job than conquest\\" (p15) and do not realize the harsh realities of combat. Steinbeck depicts the soldiers as human beings following unquestionable orders from \\"The Leader;\\" as the story progress, they grow homesick and doubt the propaganda of their own superiors. Lanser, an experienced but pessimistic Colonel leads the invasion, who \\"told himself he was a soldier, given orders to carry out... [Not] to question or to think\\" (p22) and believed with certainty that history would repeat itself and they would lose the war. Despite the military's superiority, a growing resistance emerged among the people - \\"People are getting together... They don't like to be conquered\\" (p42). Lanser compels Orden to maintain control over the populace, but the Mayor aids the struggle and insists that people have a dynamic of their own. The pressure increases as sabotage ensues and soldiers begin disappearing as they venture into town. As the airplanes dropped dynamite to aid in the resistance, the enemy's once glorious attitude has vanished: the quick conquest became an ongoing struggle on foreign territory with no end in sight. Unable to suppress the opposition, as a last resort Lanser condemns Mayor Orden to execution unless the explosions cease. However, nothing can stop the free people and the last interaction between Orden and Lanser powerfully reasserts this belief.\\"Free men cannot start a war, but once it is started, they can fight on in defeat. Herd men, followers of a leader, cannot do that, and so it is always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars. You will find it so sir.\\" (p113)Steinbeck's message is clear, powerful, and effective: the free will of the people cannot be suppressed. Although written as propaganda during the World War II, the book's roots are universal and applicable to any period in history. The invaders could be perceived as the Chinese oppressors of the Tibetan region from 1951 to this day, the ultimate belief and hope for freedom shared by the Tibetan citizens and exiles scattered around the globe. Presently it can be compared even to the Iraq occupation; Steinbeck's careful style avoids judgments of right and wrong, but instead illustrates each perspective and the helplessness of the war. This book is an important contribution to literature and starkly contrasts the exaggerated propaganda during the 1940s; it ignited a fire of hope in its readers instead of depressing them with \\"Buy War Bonds\\" posters. Once again, Steinbeck displays his firm understanding of human nature and unequivocally writes about importance of human freedom."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"First of all, this is a great book, and I hope you can find some time to read it.I vehemently disagree with the characterization of Mayor Orden in the review made by the anonymous reviewer, &quot;a reader.&quot;In this review, Mayor Orden is characterized as a coward. The reader contends that Mayor Orden did nothing to help either side and his final decisions were made for himself. Then the reader goes on espousing the virtues of democracy, informing us that democratic rulers carry on the will of the people. Well, perhaps &quot;a reader&quot; needed to read this book more carefully.Mayor Orden gives his life for democracy. He says in the beginning of the book that he, as mayor, IS the people. That is, he is the WILL of the people. His self-sacrifice serves as an example to his constituency; he's telling them in the good old American-Steinbeck tradition to resist totalitarianism, even if it means death. He knows his death will provide another martyr for the resistance, thus undermining the Nazis. He knows that the will of the people is resistance. He would only betray them if he had chosen to save himself and try to impose the will of the Nazi Colonel on the town.In short, Mayor Orden = Nathan Hale. I hope people actually read these books before they review them. There are some items in the aforementioned review that make me question whether or not we read the same book."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"I imagine many people who read this book don't realize that Steinbeck wrote &quot;The Moon is Down&quot; as a vehicle for propaganda. It was translated into many languages and distributed throughout the world. The original setting was a small town in the United States, but William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan of the OSS and others felt it would be too horrific for the people of the United States so soon after World War II so Steinbeck changed the setting to an unnamed northern European country. Steinbeck did considerable research on resistance in occupied countries and found that though the countries had different histories, cultures, languages, etc., the most successful methods of resisting and fighting the enemy were the same everywhere: the method he portrays in &quot;The Moon is Down.&quot; Students who choose to read this book for a school assignment will really impress their teachers if they note that the title is a phrase from Shakespeare's &quot;MacBeth.&quot; (Be sure to find the source in the play--I'm not going to give you everything!)"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"\\"The Moon Is Down,\\" the novel by John Steinbeck, has been published in the Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics series, with an introduction by Donald V. Coers. The intro discusses Steinbeck's career during World War II, and discusses the novel's history after its 1942 publication. Particularly interesting is Coers' account of the various legal and illegal translated editions of the book. Coers' intro is followed by a comprehensive bibliography, making this edition a treasure for Steinbeck scholars.The text of the novel itself is quite short (112 pages in the Penguin edition). \\"Moon\\" tells the story of a town that is invaded and subdued by an army from another country--little hints indicate that the invader is WW2-era Germany. Steinbeck reveals the psychodrama of relations among occupying troops, the town's civil authorities, and the civilian population. The story explores the tension within the ranks of the occupiers as well as the people's reaction to occupation.This is an intriguing novel. Steinbeck's prose at times gives the book an almost fable-like flavor. His characters seem at times more like archetypes than fully fleshed people. At his most powerful Steinbeck endows the book with some really haunting imagery. After more than six decades, this book remains, in my opinion, compelling and relevant."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"John Steinbeck is a masterful writer with a keen eye to see divergent perspectives of the world. This book may strike Steinbeck fans as being odd because it is not his typical set of early 20th Century California. Despite this jaunt from his comfort zone, I would go so far as to say this is my second favorite Steinbeck book.The Moon is Down tells the tale of a Norwegian town conquered by the Nazis. Despite the advantage that the conquering Nazis have, they are never able to gain the love or admiration that they expect from the people. This troubles the Nazi soldiers, particularly when the townspeople begin to retaliate against the Nazis. What immediately strikes me reading this book in 2004 is the book parallels with the situation in Iraq. I am certainly NOT comparing American soldiers to Nazis. The idea that a country does not like foreigners occupying their country, no matter how justified the invaders might be, is true.The plot eventually digresses into a question of how the Nazis can control the townspeople. The Nazis are less confident of winning the war and only want to survive. As the reader would suspect, the Nazis resort to drastic means.Steinbeck certainly captures a unique view of war in The Moon is Down. The value of this book in terms of its political and historical commentary makes it a compelling read."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"In 1941, John Steinbeck met with officials of the Foreign Information Service in Washington D.C. to discuss writing a book to assist American propaganda efforts during WW II. He initially prepared a draft of a play centering upon German occupation of a town in the United States. This setting did not meet with approval from the Foreign Information Service, and Steinbeck revised his work. He wrote a short novel set in a small town in an unnamed Scandanavian country which had been subjected to German invasion and occupation. The resulting book \\"The Moon is Down\\" was published in 1942. It was transformed into a play and opened on Broadway later that year. A film version of the book appeared in 1943; and, in 1946, Steinbeck was awarded the King Haakon Liberty Cross from Norway for this novel.Today, \\"The Moon is Down\\" is less well-known that some of Steinbeck's other works, but it bears comparison with his best.The story moves quickly, the characterizations are effective, and the story rises to make eloquently its timeless point about the nature of human liberty.The story opens when the Germans invade by sea a small village to exploit its coal resources in the war effort. For a short novel, the story presents a variety of characters and each of them is individually developed. These include the German commander, Colonel Lanser, a man of education and culture, swift to obey all orders but who has serious inner doubts about Germany's war effort and aims. We also meet several members of Colonel Lanser's Officer Corps, some of whom are full of themselves and of military ambition, while others are lonely and feel the greatest need for the companionship of a woman.The book also includes good characterizations of the townspeople. Among others, the reader meets Corell, the local who collaborates with the Germans and facilitates the invasion, the mayor of the town, Mayor Orden, his friend, Dr Winter, and a woman of indominitable spirit, Molly, whose husband has been shot by the invaders. The book shows the conflict and enmity that develops between the invaders and the invaded as the Germans resort to ever-harsher methods to secure the coal and the townspeople stiffen their resistance in defense of freedom. For all that Steinbeck recognizes the common humanity of all the characters in his story, the book is a ringing affirmation of freedom and of the human spirit. The work is far more than a simple propaganda effort.The book makes emphatic use of products of human creativity and thought in emphasizing the value of human freedom. The climactic scene of the book includes a lengthy discussion of Plato's Apology in which Mayor Orden, Dr. Winter, and Colonel Lanser all participate. Earlier in the book, at another key moment, love poetry by the German author Heinrich Heine plays a crucial role in moving the story forward.I found \\"The Moon is Down\\" much more effective than some of Steinbeck's other short novels which are frequently forced upon young readers. While the book is short and easy to read, it is a work of some complexity and of varied characters. Steinbeck in this work met the aims of the Foreign Information Service; but, more importantly, he produced a work of literature that transcended the goals of the war effort."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"This is possibly the most unusual Steinbeck contribution to the body of American literature. The underlying unique Steinbeck perspective and observation placed in a setting foreign to his other works makes The Moon is Down a necessary read for those interested in Steinbeck, but the book would be a worthy one without the author's name beneath the title. I'd recommend this one, no matter what the reading tastes of the reader."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"An awesome book written by John Steinbeck that talks about how hard the war is and how the people survived.

Thanks again!"},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The Moon is Down is a piece of propaganda written durring the second World War when most of eastern Europe was under Hitler's power. Steinbeck wrote it for the people of these countries, and although it was illegal for them to posess it, people translated and distributed it.The story itself is about a small town in America, though I doubt this is true, that is taken in the early hours of a Sunday morning. The soldiers think that since this town hasn't seen war in a hundred years that they won't be as strong, but what they didn't realize is that free people are the most strongwilled, causing them more problems than anywhere else.Ultimately, what the soldiers under \\"The Leader\\" want is coal. The colonels have soldiers gaurding the mines forcing them to work. Colonel Loft was ordering a man named Alex Morden to work and he being a free man with a hot temper went after him with a pick. Instead of killing Loft, Morden kills another Captain. It isn't until Alex Morden is \\"tried\\" and punished that the town finally realizes that their freedom is gone.I enjoyed this book, and although it is a bit vauge (only 112 pages), it stayed true to how Steinbeck writes. There are hints of symbolism and politics. I only had the chance to read it twice, so I'm sure I'm missing alot of the big picture, but it was great from what I got out of it. I would recommend this book to people who love this country and the idea of democracy, but are sick of the morons who wave their flags around-- as it will soon remind others as swastikas in the middle of a parade or just hanging in a shop window. This novel makes you see what happens when you say that someone is infalleable- facism takes control and the free spirited are killed, literally or figuratively."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The Moon Is Down The Moon Is Down, a novel by John Steinbeck, represents the principles of democracy and how the worth of an individual will always out-weigh conquering forces, not to mention, the strength of individuals working together as a group to fight for a common cause--freedom. The setting for this book--which is a small, nameless town in a country like Norway during World War II under Nazi occupation--provides the perfect framework by which the characters demonstrate how they, individually and collectively, can overcome the forces trying to overpower their strong belief in freedom. This can be seen, for instance, by the ability of one person, a woman, to throw boiling water onto a Nazi soldier when she finds him and several fellow soldiers scoping out a house, or by several of these people banding together to destroy sections of train tracks being built by the Nazis in order to slow down German transportation. No matter what, Steinbeck's intent is to provide readers with a clear understanding of how quickly freedom can be lost and what resistance is all about as the people of one town come together and try to regain their freedom. The Moon is Down, the title of this novel, plays a significant role in the story. This title comes from the beginning of act 2 of Macbeth, a play by Shakespeare: \\"How goes the night boy?\\" Fleance replies \\"The moon is down, I have not heard the clock\\"(Introduction ix). By this, Fleance is implying that an evil is to come, and the moon is down means that there is no light. By the use or this title \\"Steinbeck's allusion suggests that the Nazis had brought similar spiritual darkness to Europe\\"(Introduction ix). In a surprising beginning, Steinbeck quickly establishes a setting by which one town loses its freedom in what seems like an instant. An invading force overtakes the town easily since no one who is able to protect the town is present, allowing for soldiers to come in and establish a dominant position. The author alludes to the fact that someone of the town has made this possible. \\"On this Sunday morning the postman and the policeman had gone fishing in the boat of Mr. Corell, the popular storekeeper. He had lent them this trim sailboat for the day... The local troops, all twelve of them, had been away, too, on this Sunday morning, for Mr. Corell, the popular storekeeper, had donated lunch, targets, cartridges, and prizes for a shooting-competition to take place six miles back in the hills...\\" Initially, the town has no response, having been shocked by the operation and placed under submission. The town's people take a withdrawn, quiet stance, almost as if resigned. However, underlying this passive response, their feelings are building to anger and rebellion. Take for instance, Annie, the mayor's cook, who throws boiling water upon a soldier who has been peering at her through the porch window, while the Nazi commander Colonel Lanser is at the Mayor's house. Upon hearing about the commotion, Col. Lanser demands of the Mayor, \\"'Have you no control over your servants, sir?' Mayor Orden smiled. \`Very little,' he said. \`She's a good cook when she's happy.'\\" As the story unfolds, more and more town's people begin to take small and larger actions against their invaders, without resorting ever to open rebellion. This town in Norway has been occupied under seemingly \\"friendly\\" conditions, but the reality is nothing but hostile. Even though the Nazis have conquered this peaceful little town, there manner, although appearing hostile and cruel, is still human. John Steinbeck does not portray the Nazis as mad, abusive people who take joy in their work, but as people who are not accustomed to war and all that goes with it. He does, through many accounts in the story, show the reader they they do have compassionate feeling of their own. For instance, \\"Captain Bentick was a family man, lover of dogs and pink children, and Christmas\\" (P. 20). So one can see that even though these Nazis have conquered there people, the feelings that they hold are still compassionate and in fact, they are just doing there job. At the end of the novel, Mayor Orden is killed. He was a conniving mayor in the aspect that he did not help the people of this town, nor did he support or help the Nazis. Although the mayor was killed by the Nazis, it was with the help of the people. He did not show loyalty to either side and appeared to be in it for himself. He did this to declare neutrality and withdraw himself from the Nazis, and in the end effect, withdrew himself from war altogether. When a stand is not taken by the leader, it can be severely detrimental to the feeling of freedom, and the spirit of rebellion. Mayor Orden tried to be dishonest to both sides; he tried to play both sides of the war, and ended up hurting himself more than anyone. He was a coward, more concerned about himself than the welfare of the people. Democracy is a system by which people can elect a leader, not a ruler, to state, and carry out the rights and opinions of the people. When this right to democracy is broken, the sense of freedom dies with it. People begin to become demanding of that freedom and democracy and will start doing anything to get it back. Rebellion is the feeling of an important thing taken away from one or many people and those people feeling like they have to have it back. This book was written to demonstrate the principles of freedom and democracy, and show how one town will fight to get that freedom back during the darkest of times."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"This book is fantastic! I can see why it was so popular at the onset of WWII. However, I was expecting to receive a paperback, but what I got was a cheap high school issued small hardcover. If I want a hard cover I buy something with historical value - with the original dust jacket, perhaps. But if I buy a paperback it's so I can stuff it in my pocket, enjoy it on the train, etc. I e-mailed the seller as soon as I received the wrong item, but they never replied. Again, I enjoyed the book but am disappointed with the customer service."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"I can't easily say that this book is bad but it's not good enough.That's all i can say about this book."},{"Title":"The Moon Is Down","review":"The Moon Is Down is a story of war. Of a conquered people and their conquerors. You cannot tell from the story when or where this book really takes place. The British and Germans are involved but that is about all you can really tell. The story is about a small town with a coalmine and the conquering forces trying to get coal out of the mine. My issue with this story is that it was written in such a pedantic way that you never seem to make any progress. And at the end, are you no further along than you were at the beginning (you still have people being occupied). I finished reading it thinking it wasn't written very well, the plot was terrible and the characters never developed because they had no depth to begin with. A real waste of my time."},{"Title":"Between the Dark and Light: The Grateful Dead Photography of Jay Blakesberg","review":"Many, many Grateful Dead books devote most of the text and photographs to the years 1965-1975, glossing over everything that came later. The photographs in Blakesberg's book fill in that gap, covering the later years of the band and the group members' various post-Jerry Garcia solo and group efforts. This is not the Dead of 710, Pigpen, and the Uncle Sam hat; it's the Dead that many younger, post-&quot;Touch of Grey&quot; fans remember. Included are photos of rehearsals, onstage shots at shows, some candids from Garcia's memorial (notice a very sad Bob Weir), the obligatory crowd and parking lot scene snaps, and some amazing photos of the New Year's Eve shows. The later photos of Garcia are heartbreaking, as they show his deteriorating health condition. He looked 30 years older than he actually was. Blakesberg ends the book with a series of posed and candid photos of the surviving members with their new bands and together as the Other Ones. This is an excellent addition to the library of any Deadhead."},{"Title":"Between the Dark and Light: The Grateful Dead Photography of Jay Blakesberg","review":"Saw this book for the first time at the Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland during a cross-country trip (side note: an interesting place to visit.

A technical book written for a non-professional wanting to upgrade or install a 12-volt electrical system in a boat or RV. It includes just the right amount of detail to avoid following a 'recipe' and to really understand what is going on. Contains some background, history, and theory, as well as lots of practical information.Cons: Contains a few too many references to products the author is selling. Even the 'revised' edition (1995) is getting old and some of the product comparisons mentioned are out of date.Has many references to the author's other book, Living on 12 Volts with Ample Power -- I think most people would probably want both books. Ideally, the authors would create a new edtion combinding both books and updating the text with the last 10 years worth of technical progress. Still, five stars."},{"Title":"Wiring 12 Volts for Ample Power","review":"This book was current in 1990 so don't expect to see more recent developments includued.

Its definitely not something which you can read at one sitting.It is loaded with historical facts and figures.A brilliant peice of work."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"From what I understand, this is mostly Bertrand Russell's lecture notes for his History of Philosophy class reworked into a more formal context. As a definitive text on the history of philosophy, this book is not very good. I just want to be clear on that. This book is highly biased.However, it clearly illustrates Russell's infinite wit and also most of his own metaphysical and epistemological theory. To me, that is the most amazing thing about the book. Russell's take on the Presocratics through Aristotle is brilliant and his treatment of the Early Moderns as well as the British Empiricists are also AMAZING. If you read some of Russell's more complex theoretical essays like the masterpiece \\"On Denoting\\" and then go over to this text, Russell's treatment of philosophers like Pythagorus and Descartes bleed with Russell's own theories as critiques of these great philosopher's works. This is exactly what I would expect IF I had the opportunity to take a class with Russell.This book has gotten a lot of negative reviews since its publication but I think this is more because people fail to understand what this book is. You have to pretend you just found Russell's class on iTunesU and you are watching or hearing him give his lectures. Then you can see that he gives a great historical perspective of intellectual development in the western world, then a selective description of the philosopher's works followed by his own critique. This is exactly what I experienced in philosophy classrooms from Junior College through UCLA."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"read while an undergrad, rereading brings the minds together. Hav't read the christian philo section yet."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Being a pillar in the philosophical community, I looked forward to his \\"History.\\" I found it to be very useful, but I was extremely disappointed in his review of Christianity. Knowing a good deal about it, like I do, his failures did not take long to notice. That said, it was good to note his perspective on Christianity - it helps one have a better understanding from an agnostic. He was not always wrong on the subject; in fact, a good deal of what he said was good and useful. In my view this is a must read for students of philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is of course an analytic philosopher's history of western philosophy, which means that Russell presupposes that there is a single rational goal which all philosophers are seeking to reach through collective progress. Unfortunately, philosophy is not mathematics, nor is it science. Russell's account is sometimes troubling, sometimes funny, as he methodically points out every logical error in the Ancient Greeks, the rationalists, the empiricists, etc. The notion of progress as it pertains to philosophy is always problematic. Granted, Russell examines each thinker in their socio-historical perspective, but he fails to give credit to the work and creativity of the thinkers as ends in themselves, not particles of a universal human project. This is not to say that a history of Western philosophy should be all adulation, but it should never be exclusive. Russell is quick to dismiss all religious thinkers as absurd (which isn't that far off the mark), but also treats Nietzsche with supreme cruelty as Nietzsche was a thinker that broke from the Enlightenment tradition and refused to play with numbers. Similarly, Heidegger is a glaringly absent in Russell's account, as he refused to admit that there was any seriousness to Heidegger's thought. This sentiment is more a reflection of philosophy's break between the analytic and the continental modes of thought than it is an honest criticism. This book does have valuable information and it does represent fairly competent historical research. But it should be read always be read as Bertrand Russell's history of Western philosophy, not THE history of Western philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I read this book almost 30 years ago as a young philosophy student, and found it one of the best intros to the subject that was available back then. The coverage of some topics is a little uneven (Russell was, after all, more a mathematical logician rather than a philosophical historian like Copleston), but overall, it's a readable, enjoyable, and even-handed introduction to the subject. I eventually went on to read graduate level works in the area (although I was by training mostly a biologist, but I felt it important to know some philosophy), and this was one of the books that was invaluable to my early education in the subject."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I was just watching the great debate between Bertrand Russell and Fr. Copleston online again at the video site, and it is so charming, the whole thing. Bertrand Russell wins truly at every point with very elegant and ultimately rather humanly modest logic. What is so charming is that Copleston keeps going even though he is getting trounced on every point, and makes his arguments with great valor. And yet, and yet, it caused me to reflect that when Russell tried to write a \\"history\\" of philosophy he produced one of the most confusing summaries ever. Do not believe all the great praise here, for all the famous reviews seem to really be reviewing Lord Russell as a persona, who of course was incomparably brilliant, witty, charming and decorous. Or his work, which is a phenomenon in itself. But as a summarizer, he was clearly poor. Whereas, Copleston was one of the best ever, and his history of philosophy is so clear and honest, even, or maybe even especially, or modes of thought he apparently wildly disagreed with. It just seems to come down to a different talent. But as a debater with Russell, he was clearly no match, but a great sport."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's education, intelligence, style and wit are in abundant evidence. Although he does cover W. philosophy, it is in great bounds. And as much as I love Russell's piercing insights and dry wit, I occasionally cringed at the obvious British, 20th century perspective from which philosophies and philosophers were reviewed. This all works out just fine, if one knows better than to take some of his criticism as solid arguments. This book is a joy to read, even with occasional flaws."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell describes, in a clear and entertaining way, the philosophical theories of the main thinkers of Western philosophy. This is not the typical textbook, full of academic terms and complicated sentences. On the contrary, he efforts himself to explain the different concepts both clearly and easily. Although it is rather long, there's no reason to be afraid about it because it is easy to understand for people like me, who are beginners in the subject.Another intersting fact about the book, is that all theories are explained within a very detailed historical context. This contributes to the full understading of the reasons that influenced each author's ideas.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to approach philosophy through a comprehensive and easy to read work."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"\\"A History of Western Philosophy\\" leaves out some of the most influential thinkers of the Twentieth Century, but it was written in and around World War II and it is often very difficult to predict who will be remembered and who will be forgotten in your own lifetime. That said, this mighty tome is a sourcebook of world-shaping ideas and precise logical arguments and contains many different ways of looking at various philosophical problems, including the perennial ones. The intricacy of Russell's understanding of each philosopher's mind is noteworthy for its clarity, and this becomes much more apparent with each reading, and even more so as the decades pass. My original copy is a paperback with a split spine, and its brown, dog-eared pages are filled with so many underlined passages now that I am loath to part with it, even though I have a new hardback in mint condition.As many reviewers have noted, Bertrand Russell disliked Nietzsche and was very critical of Rousseau. He didn't think much of Kant either, but this is what makes the book so fascinating. Russell is a lot like Nietzsche in that he is not afraid to cross swords with the greatest of philosophers, especially if their lofty notions can be sliced to ribbons by his acerbic wit and absolute mastery of logical positivistic technique. By the way, Nietzsche also had a low opinion of Kant, calling him \\"a moral fanatic a' la Rousseau.\\" And that was one of Nietzsche's kinder statements with respect to Kant, or Rousseau too for that matter. So really, Lord Russell is only giving Nietzsche a dose of his own hard medicine. His comments may seem scathing now, but we are far more forgiving of Nietzsche's type today than we would have been when Russell was writing this book. I mean, I love Nietzsche and have read almost everything he has written, but in truth he was a misanthrope who sublimated the dark side of his personality into a philosophy of power. His \\"girlfriend,\\" Lou Salome' knew this about him, and told Freud. Thus, Nietzsche the Superman was human, all too human. But then, aren't we all?Moving along, Russell offers one of the best critiques of Karl Marx I've ever read. He deals with Marx as a philosopher and an influence on the philosophy of others, and does not discuss his economics or his politics, except in a general sense. In this way Russell reveals some of the irrational biases that were largely unconscious in Marx as he developed his social and political theories. For according to Marx, it was not enough to interpret the world in various ways; the trick was to alter it. Thus, Marx was the first philosopher that Russell knew of to criticize the notion of \\"truth\\" from this activist point of view. This prompts Russell to launch into a discussion of the whole history of philosophy and the unconscious biases that have shaped them all. Fireworks popping in a night sky is the only way to describe the brilliance of Russell's prose as he tap dances through his own encyclopedic mind.Some of Russell's most favorable reviews go to Plotinus and David Hume. And he seems to regard St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas in a very positive light as well, perhaps because they both owed so much to Plotinus. Which is why his glowing account of Plotinus is so surprising, especially when we consider the fact that Russell was an agnostic, as well as a logical positivist (and eventually a logical empiricist), who, like Hume, regarded metaphysics as sophistry and illusion. And yet, the sheer beauty of the metaphysical world as described by Plotinus seems to offer Russell a rare form of personal redemption. Russell revels in the beauty of his philosophy and wears it like a cloak made of starlight. And why not? Hume's flawless logic and irrefutable truth offer very little comfort in our bruised and battered world. But the philosophy of Plotinus stirs the soul and fills us with a transcendent ecstasy.Students of religious history will discover that Bertrand Russell knew a great deal about the Church, its theology, and how philosophy did or did not interpenetrate its teachings at various stages of development. His account of St. Augustine is positively amazing, a distillation of his best ideas into pure gold. Russell's great humanity allows him to remain fully cognizant of St. Augustine's most outlandish metaphysical speculations while, at the same time, not believing them. He is always respectful toward the man and his great mind, and honors his finest insights as true philosophy. So, there is much more here than meets the eye upon first glance.A great companion to this book is Bryan Magee's \\"The Story of Philosophy.\\" If you're a starstruck lover of Sophia, read them both. But you can't go wrong with this one. It's packed with edifying wisdom and even humor. Its real value, however, lies in its technical virtuosity. Bertrand Russell was the philosopher's philosopher. He knew the field backwards and forwards and was uniquely wired to simplify its complexities and isolate its inconsistencies. They just don't make 'em like him anymore."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's Introduction is a well-written, entertaining introduction to philosopy. It is very expansive, covering dozens of philosophers and philosophical movements/trends/systems/etc., and spanning thousands of years.The only issue I have with this book is its exclusion of certain, lesser known philosophers whom I particularly like (a minour issue), and its sometimes superficial overviews of the philosophers within. That is why I suggest corroborating your knowledge with another, more in-depth introduction to philosophy, like Durant's Story of Philosophy.Though it is not necessarily a criticism, I would like to point out that Russell's bias toward philosophers appears very strongly herein, so the reader should not expect a completely objective, neutral approach-- Russell is adamently opposed to many he deals with, such as Rousseau, Marx, Nietzsche, and other, less logic-inclined philosophers! Be warned: you are not likely to agree with his analysis all the time, and might at times find it somewhat inappropriate."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Sir Bertrand Russell is one of the most important philosophers and mathematicians of the 20th century and in this book, targeted to the lay person, he endeavours to explain what is behind the rationale of each and every important Western philosopher since Greek Antiquity and what was his contribution to modern Western thinking.His own philosophical ideas are portrayed in the end of the book by means of him showing what was right and wrong in his opinio in the most modern theories which he helped to develop in paralell to Whitehead, Wittgestein , Moore and others.The book begins with a very detailed description of the philosophical background in ancient Greece (circa 700 BC), portraying the thinking of Thales, Plato, Aristotle and all Greek philosophers important at the time and later, explaining the pros and cons of the philosophy each one embraced, giving a lot of pertinent and useful historical information on the historical background of each period. He does also adequate coverage of the oral tradition of the Iliad and Odissey, the foundations of Western literature.From Ancient Greece, to whom it devotes the greatest part of the book covering the ideas of Plato, Socrates and Aristotles, he goes to the heiday of the Roman Empire and the first steps of Christian Philosophy, to the period of the Arab conquest, Religious thought at the Middle Ages, the Scholastics thinkers, the rise of the Scientific thought in the 18th century, until the year where the book was written (1945). The at the time raging World War II gives special scope to Bertrand Russel, a notorious/contradictory pacifist, to show some philosophical schools as a spring board to Soviet totalitarianism and others to Nazism. It is interesting to note that, as happened also with other subjects in which Russell deep dived, socialisma and communism were of such issues where he many times changed his mind in the course of his long and fruitful life.This book (836 pages)is a serious effort to portray the best minds of Western civilization in a very clear and precise light, trademarks of Lord Bertrand Russel. There you will know that Nietszche, besides praising as semi-gods persons like Napoleon, Frederic II and Julio Cesar, great men who deserved to use all the means available in order to perpetrate their indidual ends, ended his shrot life mentally insane. Also, some very negative facts of the life of the great French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau are there, like, for instance, the lightness with which Rousseau had himself disentangled from robbery accusations by fingerpointing a woman servant he knew was not guilty. Sure, despite being a very devastating malefic influence to everybody around him, Lord Bertrand Russel had a high opinion of himself, never seeming to undertand that evil doing was a two-way road, that is, that he did evil to others as they did him.In my opinion, this is a very good reading for anyone interested in Philosophy, rational thinking, theories of origins of God, theories of the State, etc..Strange as it seems, not only one woman appears as a great thinker, one thing it would not be the same if the book was written today, where the general masculine bias would be pretty much diminished. Regarding Russell, he manifestly had a clear disdain for every thought emanated from women, something Mr.Ray Monk says was determined by the fact that Lord Russel lost his mother very early in his childhood."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Although I have an inherent loathing of logical positivism, and Russell is the pinacle of this, this book is a must for all philosophy readers. The sections on Aristotle, Locke and Hume are of a particular succinct quality; summing up perfectly the entire range of their thought. But, I have two large objections. Firstly, the omissions; where is Soren Kierkegaard? Where is Edmund Husserl? Where is Martin Heidegger? Where is A.N. Whitehead? And where is there any mention of existentialism or Phenomenology? Secondly, the review of Nietsche is awful, Russell wants us to discount and forget Nietsche all together. How can we do this? Surely he is one of the most important figures for the future of philosophy, especially in the area of ethical and moral questions."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"If you want a well written book on the history of philosophy, and do not already have a philosophy of your own, this is your book. Russell does an incredible job of describing the philosophies of a huge number of philosophers.The problem is that he inserts his personal philosophy into that of others, in a way that makes it impossible to tell whose philosophy he is describing.To be concise, Russell removes any part of philosophy that, in his opinion, can't be proven \\"scientifically\\".In this sense, Russell in total opposition to any Socratic style philosopher."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell was one of the founding fathers of the analytic tradition of philosophy in the 20th century.

Russell is taking a huge broad spectrum of philosophical thought, going at it with his personal bias due to cultural and time in which he wrote it yet it is transcendant in its treatment of this huge swath of subject matter.His omnipresent humor deepens the work; Pythagoras and his aversion to beans was, for example, a great humorous diversion. Obviously what this book conveys most strikingly in my opinion, is that philosophy and truth is not something which is static. It is constantly shifting, as our vantage point shifts, and becoming yet at the same time, there are also constant truths which echo our humanity. Overall, a great read and very entertaining."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I bought this for my Philosophy 101 class last semester, and I wasn't disappointed at all. It was just as described, perhaps a bit better. It came in a very timely fashion, also. I got it about a week before one of my class mates who also had ordered their philosophy boos online. Score!The content is good. This book is set up in a way that I can easily find information on a good variety of philosophers that came up in class, on tests, and even every day conversation. However, Russell seems to have his own opinions on each philosopher and doesn't exactly describe them all objectively. His opinions are usually apparent, though, and can be easily separated from the concrete facts of the text. This is one of the most helpful philosophy books I have read."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is the one of the most entertaining books that I have ever read! Bertrand Russell breaths life into a subject that is often depicted as somewhat dry. Russell pokes gentle fun at various philosophers and their ideas. I was especially amused by his description of Leibnitz view where the universe was something like a fancy mechanical clock where various figures (i.e. automatons) moved about in a synchronized dance when the hour was about to be struck. Indeed, Leibnitz seemed to believe that events occurred not because of cause and effect, but because of some preordained plan that was followed to the letter. Perhaps it is analogous to the present day when people often imagine that living beings are analogous to computers complete with hardware and software. It should be noted that in Leibnitz' day this sort of elaborate mechanical clock was novel and state of the art, and so one might model the universe in a was that reflected the advanced technology of the day."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's The History of Western Philosophy is a great tome on the history of philosophy. Russell does his best to bring the philosophy down to the laymen as well as illuminate the historical context of said philosophy. If one wants to know the development and genesis of philosophical ideas then Russell has provided this. This book is approximately half philosophy and half history. I am not too fond of history so this made the book drag at times. (But what else should I have expected with a book's title beginning with \\"The History\\".) If one is looking for an introduction on pure philosophy I would recommend looking elsewhere. I would also like to comment (as many other reviewers have) that Russell's book is hardly unbiased. However, this bias does not penetrate too deeply and is really a very small bone to pick with Russell.That being said, Russell's tome is great. It is as comprehensive and enlightening a history of philosophy one could ask for. If you are interested in philosophy or the the origins and developments of the great philosophers then Russell's classic should be list."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"My personal opinion is that this book will be forever a classical deed. It is not just a unbiassed philosophical interpretation. Much more, with this book the reader can grasp the whole picture which include and the social-economical, political, religious or military circumstances under which a particular philosophy has flourished.Previously I read this book in Macedonian and Serbian language. This is my third time reading it. This book is my Bible."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It amazes me that some people have given this book a low rating. I know that among professional philosophers this is not considered a great book, but that's probably because Russell makes the ideas clear and fun instead of using jargon to make things seem more complicated that they really are. Before you read this book you should be sure of your motives. If you want an introduction that is more of a textbook, then this is not the book for you. If you want an objective survey, again, you should go somewhere else. I must say though, do you really buy a book written by Russell not expecting to read what he had to say about the issues at hand? Finally, if you want a detailed review of some specific philosopher then you will be disappointed if you read this book.With that out of the way let me say who I think this book is for: everyone who wants to read about philosophy and enjoy it. Russell's style is truly unmatched by any other philosopher, while at the same time respecting the reader's intelligence. In this book Russell connects the philosophers to the time and space which they occupied thus shedding light on why some of them thought the way they did. This book can easily pass as a brief review of history because there are whole sections dedicated to describing the political atmosphere at specific times. Russell's comments about some philosophers made me laugh. I loved the part on Rousseau although Russell was extremely harsh. I believe that Russell has a love/hate relationship with Plato, therefore the section about Plato was the best in my opinion. I also liked it when Russell said that he doesn't understand a certain part of Kant's philosophy. If he can't understand it, what can the rest of us say? I really liked the fact that he included a small section on Islamic philosophy even though I disagree with his assessment in that area. All in all, a beautiful book that you should read if you want to:-Have fun-Study philosophy-Read Russell-All of the above"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell helped found the field of Logic. But unlike some of his colleagues (eg. Wittgenstein), Russell writes with the kind of clarity and erudition that is the envy of almost any writer. This &quot;History&quot; is the best of its kind; he covers every major philosopher from the beginning in a way that no other thinker could. I refer to the book on a regular basis, and it never fails to clear away any clouds of misunderstanding that Philosophy can often create.An invaluable work for anyone, even the professional."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is a work of broad perspective, covering twenty five hundred years of history and philosophy, and will be most beneficial for anyone with less than a deep familiarity with the general principles of Philosophy. Bertrand Russell's thorough account of the history western philosophy is divided most properly into three books: the first dealing with Ancient, the second with Catholic, and the final with Modern Philosophy. Russell's work begins with the condition of Hellenic civilization at the time of Thales of Miletus and ends during the time of Russell's own distinguished contemporaries. Instead of dedicating a chapter soley to Thales, Russell deemed it more appropriate to deal singularly with Pythagoras first, simply because his influence was much more profound than Thales and others of the Milesian school. Likewise, while Russell suggests that Spinoza was a much greater philosopher than Locke, he nevertheless maintains that Locke's influence was far greater than Spinoza's, and that most appropriately more time should be dedicated to Locke instead. Although the basis of this work lies upon a particular philosopher's impact upon social and political sphere of life, Russell never fails to surface individuals with deep philosophical merit. In other words, Russell treats every principle philosopher from Pythagoras to Aquinas, all the way to his own contemporaries, despite how influential they may have been; but these individuals, though they may have been exemplary thinkers, are just dealt with much more briefly in regards to their lack of major influence. So, keeping this in mind, anyone looking to find a history of western philosophy that contains an abundance of great thinkers, with detailed summaries of their systems of thought and their influence upon the world, along with some very good general history, Russell's work should not be avoided."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Best book on philosophy that I know of. But don't get the idea that it's simple: Russell's style is clear, and he is witty, and this can lead readers to think his material is simple; but Russell now and then puts in very sharp and complicated theory-of-types analysis. Its divided mostly into names, which is handy for anyone dipping into the views of Parmenides, Plato, Bacon, Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Spinoza, John Stuart Mill, Marx, Nietzsche... there's a long list. Russell is happy to admit that academic philosophers have usually been cowardly types, and admits many names (e.g. Byron) not normally considered philosophers.Russell's style is so convincing he was often plagiarised - unconscious imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. Joad (who copied Russell on Marx), and Aldous Huxley (who based Brave New World on a Russell work) are just two examples.There are innumerable asides, which I presume (he wrote and assembled this book aged about 70) were the fruit of discussions in his youth and middle age; on psychology, groups, sex, emotions, animals, ethics, totalitarianism, adventures, trade - a vast range of topics.I recommend this to everyone willing to take some trouble. I've met many people who would have benefitted from its intellectual stiffening - for example a gifted physics man who couldn't seem to grasp that atoms are mostly holes, even though they don't look that way. And who had never understood that the square root of two is 'irrational'. Hoary problems - 'universals', 'analytical' and 'synthetic', 'induction', 'teleology', 'determinism' - appear here and there, and it can do no harm to know about them. Russell also is good at picking out the odd practical effects of beliefs: just one example: Stoics and Christians both believed (supposedly) in personal virtue: if external circumstances cannot prevent a man from being virtuous, there is no need to seek a 'just' social system.There are omissions, all I think to do with demarcation problems - the boundaries of philosophy, apart from politics, history, science, economics, and psychology. Darwin isn't here (much). Freud isn't here - but then Russell regarded the idea of unconscious motivation as the only significant part of Freud. Adam Smith isn't in. Marx is only treated as a philosopher: his economics is looked at by Russell in another book. Note that Russell seemed to regard Marx as 'socialistic'. All Russell's history in a sense is official: there must be innumerable people who were censored or killed or otherwise silenced; but Russell doesn't really bother with them. His book is a bit like commentary on a tidy, ordered library.Russell's history is typical 20th century western: prehistory, with Egypt, Babylon and the rest regarded as 'oriental despotisms'. Rather inconsistently, the Bible is admitted. There's a conspiracy of silence about Jewish beliefs. Then Greece, then Rome; then the dark ages, and 'middle ages'; Russell accepts that Islam was a transmitter, though I'm not sure he makes a good case. Finally, modern enlightenment and science. Not much was known about many chunks of history, so this schema appeared satisfactory. Some of his historical comments are typically Victorian: the dislike of Rousseau from hatred of the French revolution, and of Rousseau as the supposed origin of romanticism and silliness. Rousseau and Nietzsche and Carlyle were supposed to have led to extremism and Auschwitz; Plato and Sparta to Stalin.When eras change, Russell usually finds transitional people or ideas as exemplars: the Greeks treated in the then-usual awed way as a mix of peoples; Christianity as taking in Platonic and Judaic elements; Europe as church vs monarchs and feudal nobility and knights; Machiavelli, Erasmus and More at about the Renaissance. ...Russell himself doubted his success in describing the relation of philosophy to social events when science became important. Russell mostly knew maths, but was notoriously hopeless in practical activities; he literally couldn't make a cup of tea. Such things as the rise and fall of the idea of phlogiston, the growth of chemistry, changes in transport, and such things as anaesthesia, aren't really covered but taken for granted, in rather the way unreflective people seem to think motor cars and piped water and printing have always existed.Some accuse Russell of bias; typically these are:-[1] Catholics often can't face the rationalistic side of Russell. (They don't seem to know that Russell wrote a lot on mysticism).[2] People who like Kant and Hegel, and Nietzsche. Russell was not keen on German philosophy - when he was young, all official philosophers were Hegelians. He followed G E Moore in 'climbing down'.[3] Supporters of Wittgenstein. Russell was a friend of his, and liked his work when it was new, but decided later it was rather trivial[4] Supporters of Sartre and other existentialists. Russell dismissed it in a sentence: based emotionally on exasperation, and intellectually on errors of syntax.[5] 'Linguistic' philosophers of the Gilbert Ryle type - 'just another clever man' according to Russell.Note that, near the end of his life, Russell spent years on the problem of nuclear weapons, Kennedy's assassination, and, later, the Americans and the Vietnam War. For this reason he's partly censored, still.It's a pity there is no equivalent book on eastern philosophies... that would be something. Incidentally 'Sophie's World' is based on Russell."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It is heartening to see Russell's overview of Western thought in a new reprint. The project itself at the time and even in present time; is extremely ambitious. However, Russell manages the task with professionalism and the text is written in a style that can be read by most individuals interested in the beginnings of Western thought...but Russell takes this project further, paving the way for other recorder's of history and philosophy that was not explored at the time it was written, (1946) and that is, relating philosophy to its particular social and economic background. In other words, he attempts to put a certain philosophy, for example, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Marx into its social and economic context, revealing these influencing factors on (their) particular view of the world.Russell's magnum opus, \\"Principia Mathematica\\" , written in collaboration with Alfred North Whitehead, set the standard for logical positivism and analytical philosophy that is continued to be explored and taught in universities today. Although taking a decade to write, setting a new precedent in Western thought, Ludwig Wittgenstein took up the mantel, and changed analytical philosophy forever.From the end of WW2, Russell became what is known as a \`public philosopher', similar to the pragmatist, William James, taking Western thought to the people, writing in a style for the layman. This is one such work.He was criticised by his colleagues, including his once favourite student Wittgenstein, but he changed direction, writing about controversial issues of the time. He was a great activist joining forces with Albert Einstein and Albert Schweitzer, protesting the Hydrogen Bomb testing after WW2 that the U.S. was carelessly throwing around not knowing the full detrimental effects on human life.This book is a perfect place to begin for those interested in philosophy and considering it a subject for further study. Though a bit too general and biased in a few places, as any work is or can be, the student will receive a sweeping though accurate account of Western philosophy beginning with the pre-Socratics and ending with John Dewey and Logical Analysis.Russell has an engaging style, and many thought he would move into fiction and the novel; though he lived into his late nineties, he never failed to rise in the morning for his walk, arranging his thoughts for the days subject...one of the more prolific writer's of the twentieth century.A History of Western Philosophy is a book that should be in every library."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book ranks along side Will Durant's \\"Story of Philosophy\\" as the best book on Western Philosophy. The key difference is that whereas Durant deals only with some selected individuals, Russell gives a comprehensive history. Topics that get the short shrift in most histories (Pre-Socratics, Medieval Philosophy, etc) are given the full treatment here.'HoWP' has an authority that few can match. Russell was a great philosopher himself - no history of Western Philosophy is complete without a chapter on him!The book is strewn with gems of wisdom:1. \\"The union of idealism and love of power has led men astray throughout history, and continues to do so even today.\\" (On Sparta)2. \\"Religions that condemn the pleasures of the senses drive men towards the pleasures of power. Throughout history, power has been the vice of the ascetic.\\" (On the clergy in the Middle Ages)3. \\"Contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other people's happiness, and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race.\\" (On Continental Idealists)At times the book does get a little dense. There is only so far Russell is willing to go to make the subject accessible to the lay reader.I would especially recommend this book for history buffs. Russell dovetails the development of Western Philosophy beautifully with European history. There is no better way to develop interest in a subject than to read a book that connects it with a subject you are already passionate about!"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Written in the 1942-45, this book needs to be taken in the context of World War II. Although a courageous pacifist, Russell, nevertheless, is still an Englishman. This may account for his misunderstanding of Nietzsche, who at the time the book was written, was considered a spiritual father of Hitler, which of course he was not.Russell's handling of Aristoltle's logic is, indeed, brilliant. His introduction to most of the philosophers covered in the text is at least helpful, and at other times masterful. The Noble Prize winner for literature, Russell demonstrates his alacrity for written expression and the clearest thinking at a wondrous level. He does, however, retain his bias, which he does not express openly.So long as the reader can discount the author's British, Twenieth Century bias, he will find this book an ideal introduction for the layman to Western thought."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"First, it is extremely well written, easy to read, and often humorous. Russell's description of Nietzsche is laugh out loud funny and makes it hard to take him (Nietzsche) seriously ever afterwards. It is easy to see why the Bloomsburys were frightened of Russell's scorn and wit and avoided intellectual debate with him (and these were some seriously smart, snarky folks).Second, the book contains little less than the history of western thought. As daunting as this thick tome can appear, it is a far quicker read, and far more approachable than to read the collected works of thousands of years of the world's greatest philosophers (a term Russell uses liberally, expanding it to such figures as Byron for his influence on the tone of the time).If you like philosophy, or biography, or history or just want to know what all the fuss is about, and want a great read in the bargain: run, don't walk and buy this book."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Don't be put off by the criticisms of emphasis and slighting of particular philosophers... This is a truly brilliant overview of western philosophy. Not for the casual reader, but if you have a real interest in philosophy you must read this book completely."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is a delightlfully entertaining history of Western philosophy starting from the ancient Greeks up to Russell's time. For each of the several philosophers covered, Russell gives a bit of biographical information and describes in several pages their contribution to philosophy. This part is mostly objective and informative. The writing style is superb. After the objective description, Russell devotes a few pages to a critique of the philosopher's work and a discussion of their importance. In addition to covering the major philosophers, Russell discusses historically important trends or changes that affected philosophy, e.g. the dominance of the catholic church, Greek mathematics, the rise of science, etc.As a lay person, I greatly appreciated the brief summaries of important philosophies in a clear and modern language. For example, I personally have no time to read Immanual Kant's huge and difficult-to-read book &quot;The Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, so it is very useful to read a summary of this influential philosopher's ideas and to understand why he was influential. The only worry one might have is that Russell's account might be biased by his strong opinions. However, I believe Russell did a good job of separating his objective description of the philosopher's work from his own opinion of the merits of the work. Besides, the critical analysis adds greatly to the entertainment value and I happen to agree with most of Russell's very reasonable opinions.This book would make an excellent gift to an intellectual friend or family member -- for anyone curious about the world and about the historical influences upon our Western outlook."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I was raised in places like Okeechobee, Florida, and Orlando when it was still largely agricultural. This book was my first introduction to the breadth and complexity of this beautiful civilization. It is a wonder. Russell shows how hard it was to learn how to think. He gives everything that matters in the development of thinking in the western world, at least up to the Twentieth Century. Russell's views of philosophy and the philosophers remain connected to the realities of everyday life. This book makes a great G*I*F*T for first-rate high school kids. Feeling that a kid is ready for Russell is a high compliment."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"A great overhaul. For those interested in the stages philosophy has underwent, it is very comprehensive and readable."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I have srudied philosophy for over 40 years, and this is, without a dount, the best book I have ever read on the subject. It is very comprehensive, insightful, and easy to understand. A must read for anyone who wants to understand who we are and how we got there."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"What Bertrand Russell brings to the history of western philosophy is a clear, readable style and a delightfully opinionated stance. Unlike some writers on western philosophy, Russell is quick to give his opinion on the rigor and the agreeability of not only the philosophies presented, but of the philosophers themselves. He speaks with authority of course since he is considered one of the great minds of the twentieth century. He reaches a wide readership because of his great celebrity, and he is accessible to that readership because of his elegant, straightforward, and concrete (especially for a philosopher!) style. I understand that Russell wrote one draft, edited it and that was it. This is in contrast to some other writers (James Thurber comes to mind) who wrote twenty drafts and still were not satisfied.He had the gift of a great memory, combined with an ease of composition that allowed him to be a most prolific writer over a long lifetime that began in 1872 and ended almost a hundred years later in 1970. He has something of the English Don and the 19th century naturalist about him as well as the 20th century progressive. He was intensely engaged in various political projects throughout his long life, most notably as an anti-war and later as an anti-nuclear activist while writing academic philosophy and mathematics as well as many volumes directed toward the general public. He was infamous (in some circles) for his free-love advocacy and his public rejection of Christianity. He was thrown into prison for his pacifism during WWI. He won the Noble Prize for Literature (not peace) in 1950.Here he takes delight in surveying the entire spectrum of western philosophy beginning with the pre-Socratics and ending with his own philosophy of logical analysis. Curiously (or not so curiously) he does not mention Wittgenstein. His critique of the Greeks, especially Plato, is most edifying and fun to read. He sees modern philosophy as reaching its zenith with David Hume's empiricism. He finds Nietzsche disagreeable and is dismissive of Kant.I am reading this for the second time, having first read it as a young man. It delights me anew. As I read I am unsure as to whether I find his opinions so congenial because they are so similar to mine or because in fact I acquired many of my early opinions through reading Russell! He had quite an influence on several generations before I came of age, although perhaps he reached the epitome of his fame (at least) during the fifties before I presumed to read philosophy.Anyone interested in philosophy of any kind, especially of course western philosophy, should read this book. It is one of those books that cannot be ignored. First published in 1945, it is still in print today and will be for many decades to come. I only regret that Russell did not take the time to study eastern philosophies as well and to include them in this volume. How interesting it would be to read Russell on say, Buddhism, Taoism and Vedanta."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"A very good introduction, so long as the reader knows with whom they are dealing. Russell is fair and even-handed in his narrative and analysis, but he never pretends the book is written sans opinion. The end of the final chapter is a good example as Russell goes on the war-path against philosophers who he claims have failed to separate their metaphysics from their morals, corrupting both. As far as the breadth of the content, I found it quite adequate for both philosophies with which I was both familiar and unfamiliar. I think the focus on the Greeks and Catholic philosophers is a little inconvenient for students who are more interested in modern philosophy (as most are). The paucity of information on Kant is not that serious of a problem. Russell disagrees with him often, but does make the point that Kant is important-- the reader can read Kant on his own; Russell's summary is adequate. I wish Russell had discussed logical positivism and mathematical philosophy, those things he knows best, at greater length."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bernard Russell's history is famous mostly for expressing his bias. Nevertheless, the history does give a good introduction to classical and modern philosophy; however, it is &quot;empty&quot; in the middle. The Middle Ages are almost completely forgotten other than Aquinas and a chapter on the Franciscans in general. Too often Russell gives his opinion or worses, his personal experiences to invade the book, such as his section on Aquinas beginning with a complaint that some Catholics complained to him that it is immodest to question Aristotle or Aquinas...that's great, but it doesn't make either wrong or right.Etienne Gilson's &quot;The Unity of Philosophical Experience&quot; fills in the holes and is much better for drawing links between various trends of thought, such as Ockham and Hume or Augustine and Descartes."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This will be less of a formal review and more of a personal take, more or less. Due to the fact I've read several intro books, as well as the primary source material, i have a well-informed frame of reference in the judgment of this book's merits.Not long ago I said the following: Russell's A History of Western Philosophy? Patooey! The all time worst intro book i've ever read!Granted, HWP is witty, no doubt. This is probably the book's only redeeming value, meriting it a star. Scattered throughout are gems like: \\"I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than a friend innocent of philosophy.\\"On the other hand.... HWP is overrated, underwhelming, and embarrassingly inept for many reasons.Overrated? The inadequacy and shallowness of most interpretations of the other philosophers' works is the biggest factor. Worst of all, the flippant comments are amusing, which provide entertainment in a conversation, but are utterly out of place when introducing a serious work. However, Russell's take on Leibniz is reliable, because he did his homework, occasionally.Underwhelming? Russell, like a well trained 'whiggish', kneels deeply before the altar of John Locke, supposedly the champion of the 'modern liberal republican.' Despite admitting that Locke is an inferior philosopher to Spinoza, the godfather gets more press. Instead of philosophy in the HWP, we get self-serving propaganda.Inept? Not once does Russell ever truly take a problem seriously. IThe complete failure to understand Kant, the philosopher of the enlightenment, as well as Schopenhauer (skipping the World as Will and Representation is not a good idea, Bertie) is a huge let-down. Predictably, he reads Nietzsche as a fascist (exposes his shoddy scholarship by linking him to Nazi socialism), whiffs on Dewey's brand of pragmatism, and for reasons unknown, devotes a chapter on Byron. More bizarre is the excessive attention paid to Catholic philosophy. I don't think the biographer Ray Monk even figured this out, either. Contemporaries like G.E. Moore gets a single mention and Wittgenstein, who he greatly respected, none.Quite telling, Russell was shocked at the book's success - he produced it casually, intended it as a potboiler, compiled from the notes for the adult education classes he taught in the United States.Conclusion: The shallowness, due to its intent to amuse, the odd bulk of space devoted to Christian philosophy, all combine to account for world-wide success for The History of Western Philosophy. It might be a good starter, but it also contributes to the sense that philosophy is not worth bothering with.Alternatives: Copleston's series is lengthy, but thorough, and far superior. You can't go wrong with Durant's Story of Philosophy, although it is a bit dated. Luckily, Durant writes as well as any writer in English, making that book much more accessible to most. T. Z. Lavine's From Socrates to Sartre concentrates on much fewer big-names, but has a lively narrative that sensationalizes the content.After you've read any one of these, then try Bryan Magee's books: Great Philosophers and Talking Philosophy where both consists of interviews with scholars. As for a contemporary account, Delacampagne's A History of Philosophy in the 20th century is a delicious read."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Finally, over 20 years after college, I got around to taking a summer and reading this, by far the book I most wish I'd been required to read in college. The writing style is lively and easy to follow: it doesn't read like a philosophy book. (As Mencken observed, \\"Kant was probably the worst writer ever heard of on Earth before Karl Marx. Some of his ideas were really quite simple, but he always managed to make them seem unintelligible. I hope he is in Hell.\\")One reason for Bertrand's writing style being lively is that he doesn't hesitate to inject his opinion. Some philosophers and historians complain about this \\"editorializing,\\" but I like it. It's fun to watch him rip into Plato or Aristotle or Aquinas, because he was smarter than they were!"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is clearly one of the best concise overviews of the major philosophers and what they had to say. It is right next to Will Durant's \\"The Story of Philosophy\\" on my reference shelf. Russell is witty, rational and easy to read. He makes many difficult concepts simple. This book is clearly written for the general reader. If you want to get difficult he has other books for the more advanced. I'm not trying to learn everything about all the philosophers but rather a little about some of the more famous. This book is perfect and objective. I am aware of many of Russell's controversial personal opinions and none are detectable in this work as far as I can determine. This is about classical philosophers and their philosophies.

Beautifully captivating, complex and detailed this in-depth study is one that will fascinate you from beginning to end. It makes for a perfect introduction to the subject by explaining the fundamental basics of the topic, before then going into more detail with much explanation and examination of the topic. There is a reason why this book has become one of the best-selling philosophy books of the twentieth-century and why it remains unchallenged to this day, and that is because of the wonderful content that is blatantly meticulous and thorough on the subject matter. It gives on a sophisticated overview of the ideas that have perplexed people from the time immemorial that is intelligent and curmudgeonly skepticism. It is also one of the most significant and important philosophical works of its time, indeed of all time, that coupled with sheer brilliance of its scholarship is unequaled.The luminous, astute prose is quite beautiful coupled with the author's scrupulously honest and candid opinions, thoughts and outlooks that which make this an absorbing read. I have never been so impressed by something that gives a complete and comprehensive look at something that is such an important and key subject, which tells the reader so much about themselves (thus in a way is quite truth-drawing). Just a great philosopher's logical and coherent look at the history of his own subject, that is wonderfully readable and truly enlightening hence I cannot fault it. I sadly never had the opportunity of studying up to now philosophy but it is a subject that in recent times has become of more interest to me, especially since reading Bertrand Russell's thought-provoking book that just captures the mind. This colorful, astute walk through several millennia of philosophers and their work is inconceivably amazing and which sparks a deep interest in any reader opening your eyes to moral, ethical and analytical thoughts in Europe.This is a book that I would highly recommend to those studying philosophy, history and the changing thoughts and morals across Europe throughout the years. It is such an captivating and compelling read that covers pretty much everything on the subject you would want to know, and therefore there is nothing that is comparable or of an equivalent standard to it. I cannot praise Bertrand Russell highly enough, for he his contribution to the literary world is one that is marked, discernable to all and I thank him for it."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"One of the low-raters commented that one might as well read a novel. I have to admit I have never studied philosophy, and couldn't tell you if 3 words in this book are true, but the writing is just lovely. Especially as I age I've lost interest in novels, but this wonderful writing calls me back time after time. His opening lines on Spinoza are priceless."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell was the greatest philosopher of the 20th century. He was also a great man in other ways. His history of Western philosophy is a tour--led by the greatest philosopher of our age--through the high (and some of the low) points of Western philosophy from its inception with the pre-Socratics to the middle of the last century. What we get are Russell's necessarily brief (my copy is about 900 pages) ruminations, criticisms, and expositions of the lives and ideas of the great and some not so great philosophers of European and American culture. We also get along the way an exposition of Russell's thinking at the time (1943) on many of the problems and issues of philosophy, history, politics, war, and culture.Russell's writing is lively and non-technical, although there are a few obscure and unexplained references. He has a wonderful, subtle sense of humor, which is often dryly cutting. Let me indulge in one tiny example: \\"In the above outline, I have in the main endeavored merely to state Bergson's views, without giving the reasons adduced by him in favor of their truth. This is easier than it would be with most philosophers, since as a rule he does not give reasons for his opinions,....\\" If a reader wants a lively, opinionated, not always quite accurate, selective but illuminating tour through the history of philosophy, she could not do better than Russell's book. This book, as its subtitle suggests, also contains much political and social history in outline and its relationship to the philosophies of the eras. Many of the connections and influences that Russell emphasizes are tendentious at best.Russell is best on modern philosophy. His chapters on ancient and medieval philosophy and history seem to come mostly from secondary sources. There is a lot of material on the history and philosophy of the late Roman Empire and Dark Ages that was a chore to get through and did not seem relevant to the course of Western philosophy--lots of obscure early Christian disputes were described at boring length. Thus I would think that a reader today who is not specifically interested in early Church history could skip or skim most of \\"Book Two: Catholic Philosophy.\\" Also I found it odd that Russell includes a chapter on Byron, who is not considered to be a philosopher, certainly not one worthy of a chapter in a single volume history of Western philosophy. The chapter on Bergson should simply be skipped. Bergson is no longer considered a world-historical or even important philosopher, and the chapter devoted to him was longer than other chapters on major figures.I would not use this book to study for one's Ph.D. qualifying exam in the history of philosophy. Copleston's multi-volume history is much more useful for the serious student of philosophy.The best part of the book is the very end, the final chapter--\\"The Philosophy of Logical Analysis.\\" This is worth reading and rereading even if you don't look at anything else in the book."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I started this shortly after reading Durant's History of Philosophy book, so its hard not to compare the two. Durant's book covered far less history and only a few select philosophers and I liked reading Durant's synopsis of the ones covered more than the similar shorter ones found here. Where this book seemed to excel was the amount of material covered, whereas Durant only covered a few, Russell covered a large number of philosophers and history. Just the amount of additional material covered here makes this a nice complementary read. Although both books are obviously biased and so I'll have to read a few more neutral accounts. I also didn't like that often in this book Russell seemed to go off on tangents about what he disagreed with and set up what seemed to be straw man arguments to disprove the other philosophers."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"In 2001, I refused to call this book a pure reference. It was a safer bet, supposedly, to look for dry philosophical biographies--this way the reader rightly avoids Russell as he proselytizes for logical analysis.I've since changed my opinion of the book, though. I now believe Russell's blanket hate of putative \\"dogmatism\\" is better than a doomed try at philosophical and historical objectivity. For the summaries act as nice catalysts: you read Russell's dismissal of Nietzsche; you get annoyed at his caricature of Nietzsche as a frothing sadist; and then you joyfully go out to refute it all. Maybe you read Walter Kauffman's rehabilitative scholarship. Or maybe you pick up \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" and do earnest philosophy by yourself.Of course, if this is not seen as a plus in itself, here are some points about the actual content:1) Risking hagiography, the chapter on Leibniz is still an excellent summary.2) The chapters on ancient philosophy are much better than anything found in the Oxford, Cambridge, and Routledge encyclopedias. Here, at least, Russell rightly judges philosophical merit in its social and political context.3) For the most part, the author of \\"Why I Am Not a Christian\\" is not overly bilious when discussing Catholic Philosophy. Still, he does call Aquinas--argubly one of the greatest Aristotleans--a master of religious \\"special pleading.\\"4) Ridiculously, Russell does not offer anything about the Tractatus-period work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. There is also no mention of Kierkegaard (Russell could not have seen the Dane as too literary: this book includes a curious and very light chapter on Lord Byron).5) First published in 1945, the book thus has Frege, Whitehead, and Russell himself as its representatives of modern philosophy. Today, though, we have the great achievements of Popper, Quine, Rawls, Nozick, Donald Davidson, Daniel Dennett, and so many others. The beginning philosopher should look elsewhere in order to learn more about these contemporary thinkers."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"In a word: awesome. This book is the best introduction to Western thought (which means: to the Western mind and the way it thinks) that I have yet read. Russell does an excellent job in his choice of subject matter, his explanations of the various philosophies that Westerners have adhered to since the most ancient ones of Greece, and in his evaluations of each of those. He is fair, balanced, insightful, and witty from cover to cover in this book; even when I found myself disagreeing with him, I had to admit that he made a good point and he made it well. The only complaint that I have is that I think he shortchanged much of the philosophy of the Middle Ages, either skipping it entirely or only giving a brief mention to certain individuals and movements that I think had much more importance than he gives credit for. Aside from that, this is a simply amazing book. I recommend it to anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with Western thought and/or better understand their own thinking."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Most people might argue that this is a bunch of crap that Russell just put together and that its his own perspective of what good/useful philosophy is. Well they'd be half right. A major factor that people tend to overlook about this book is that it IS Russells own opinion on the history of philosophy, hence the words &quot;writen by Bertrand Russell&quot; on the book and not &quot;edited by Bertrand Russell&quot;. If somone is looking for a refrence of sorts for philosophy that is completly unbiased then I would suggest the Cambridge Dictionary Of Philosophy or the even better Oxford Companion To Philosophy. Other than that i have to consider this a GREAT book (altough i only read passages at a time) and really consider Russells opinions as valid ones that I (as a member of my high school debate team) find myself quoting quite often. In essence, its just a good step into a better understanding of philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Although Russell's history is biased, it provides an excellent overview of Western philosophy's history - puting it in a political and social context and thus making it more accessible to the layman."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell's classic history of Western thought continues to remain very popular, and rightly so. Though written several decades ago, it is still one of the best introductions to Western thought.Of course many aspects of the book reflect Russell's biases. Russell tends to downplay some of the more metaphysical thinkers (such as Plotinus, Proclus and the Neo-Platonists), skips over medieval Islamic and Jewish philosophy almost without a thought, and omits many of the critically important 20th century movements including positivism, analytical philosophy (Wittgenstein is omitted for example) and continental philosophy. Russell also tends to exalt the scientific and mathematical influences on philosophy and also the empiricists of England, especially David Hume and Locke.Still, this is a readable and useful overview of 20 centuries of Philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I am not exactly sure what led me to read this book.In high school and college, I avoided history and western philosophy as much as I could. They seemed like really dry topics to me. My interests and talents were scientific and mathematical. However, I am glad that I read this book, because, to me, it is one of the 20 best books ever written. Bertrand Russell won the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was an accomplished philosopher, mathematician, and a very clear rational thinker. Russell provides a tour de force of philosophical history from ancient times into the twentieth century. He interweaves, remarkably, events in world history and how philosophers helped to shape those events. This book is quite long, but my interest in it never flagged. I highly recommend this book. It is an incredible achievement."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"You risk being seduced by this wonderful and dangerous book.It is probably (despite many other merits and demerits) one of the greatest lessons in bias ever written.There is little unique about the extent to which this work is biased.But Russell's mesmerisingly convincing style makes the likelihood that anything in the book is anything but objective a thought which will occur to only the most sceptical of readers.This is not to claim that Russell was being cynical or consciously deceptive when he wrote it.Nor is it to claim that he was wildly deluded or poorly informed.What the book does exemplify however, is how Russell's enormous skill as a raconteur, combined with well developed viewpoints on many of the subjects he discusses, as well as his powerful enthusiasm for historical anecdotes.If anything were ever to have the power to kindle any latent interest in philosophy, history or science, this book probably stands alone among the philosophical works of its era in combining the necessary ingredients.None of these 'popular non-fiction attractions' should in any way undermine the fact that the book often provides a good service to the reader, in terms of providing a more than adequate overview of the philosopher or philosophy covered.But even when it provides these resources effectively, any reader who is inclined to pursue the particular subject matter further, would, in most cases be utterly shocked to discover how any further research will probably present an extraordinarily different perspective, if, in many cases, for no other reason than as a reaction to the impressions formed by this book.For every viewpoint that Russell presents authoritatively in this book, there are often a multiplicity of other viewpoints to be found elsewhere, many diametrically opposed to those expressed in the book, ranging from those which are based upon more recent historical research, to those which treat Russell's assertions as a starting point for a debate, and finally to those which essentially constitute a contemptuous dismissal of Russell's unacceptable corruption of the minds of those who take the book more seriously than many scholars would.But it is wiser to take any unqualified criticism of this book as being as much an 'understandable overreaction' as it is to recognise that Russell's endeavours to make history and philosophy entertaining came at a price that any early attempt at popularisation might be expected to pay.Read it, be enthralled, recall that this is now well over half a century later, then read it again, book in one hand, mouse in the other, reach out for the internet, check out the latest writings on the subjects he covers, get the most from both worlds.No better book on the subject (including several more comprehensive and respected histories of philosophy) exists for making you want to do this."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell was one of the preeminent thinkers of the Twentieth Century. It is difficult to imagine a man better qualified to compile and comment upon the greatest thinkers in Western Civilization. Of course, he does have a point of view, leaning more toward Aristotle's materialism than Plato's spirituality, and it is impossible to deny that it informs his interpretations of the great philosophers, but it really doesn't get in the way too much. His distillations of their thinking are as accurate as one may expect, and his commentary is always identified as opinion.What is remarkable about this volume is it's presentation of the sweep of Western thought from the Greeks through the last century, each school of thought seeming to grow out of or be a reaction against what went before. I highly recommend reading it from the beginning so the causes and effects of each period of philosophy and the people who grew from them are fully appreciated. It is dense going at times, but the reward is worth the effort it takes to plow through.That said, I found myself overwhelmed by the mathematical portions of the book, but that is not Russell's fault; if I have no head for it, he can't be blamed.It is not a work for the casual reader; a great deal will be expected. There is a wealth of information here, but one must really spend time with each philosopher in order to understand his observations and conclusions. This is a book that needs to be studied, and is not for the dilettante. It requires a certain commitment.Even so, for one who has neither the time nor the patience to slog through the actual writings of the philosophers presented here, this \\"Reader's Digest\\" version is just what is needed. One really cannot call oneself an educated person in our society without a passing knowledge of what is presented here. This introduction to Western Philosophy is about as good as you're going to get."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I've read this book twice and am always impressed by it. Russell is the most readable of philosophers, and this is one of his best books. It's easy to read and consistently interesting; there's hardly a dull page in it. You would think that the long middle section on the Catholic philosophers would be as dry as dust, but Russell makes it completely fascinating, a strength rather than a weakness. His overview of Plotinus is far more readable than Plotinus himself, and this is generally true of all the writers he discusses.The book is not without weaknesses. First, it's not long enough! Second, coverage of twentieth century philosophy is very brief (the book was published in 1945). Third, his coverage of William James (a favorite of mine, of course) is too unsympathetic and, apparently, too uninformed and superficial to be of much value. In this it shows haste, a fault which Russell admits in his Autobiography. Finally, I don't have the book in front of me, but I don't think he says much about the existentialists. These lacks are all the more galling because he does devote so much space to the Church, which is likely to be of less interest to most potential readers.But it wouldn't do to let these sins of omission cloud the view of the riches that are present. This is truly a great book, and one could do worse than use it as a guide and introduction to a reading program of philosophical history. I say &quot;history&quot; rather than &quot;philosophy&quot; because I think the writers he covers have been surpassed and have largely become irrelevant--except perhaps for scholars--toward developing a view of philosophical questions. This is more true for the general reader, because so many of the old books are so dreadfully written. To get a start on philosophical questions, one could hardly do better than Russell's Problems of Philosophy. But then, who am I to contradict Ray Monk, who called this &quot;the perfect introduction to the subject.&quot;Russell's education and his grasp of history and culture are unsurpassed (except for maybe Will Durant), and his brilliance and clarity shine on every page. This book is essential reading for one's education... but it may not say much to you personally. It won't change your life. For that kind of value, read Russell's Conquest of Happiness or Walter Kaufmann's Faith of a Heretic."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"History of Western Philosophy is Russell's attempt to reduce the breadth of intelligence, wisdom, creativity and thought of philosophy throughout the last two and a half thousand years. While in places the book is weak, and his personal bias shines through often, this is still a monumental work, and should be read by anyone interested in learning philosophy but unsure where to begin.The book begins with an introduction stating Russell's intent in very clear language. He is not interested in providing a detailed thesis on each of the major philosophers, nor is he willing or able to give enough of a background so that the casual reader will become conversant in his philosophers of choice. Rather, the intent is to give an overview, to whet the appetite, to stimulate the mind with what higher thinking is capable of. From there, we are given a brief account of the history and importance of the Greeks before plunging into a chapter by chapter exposition of major authors.It is an important part of this book that Russell allows us a look into the historical, economical and political aspects of each period. A proper understanding of a particular philosopher's thinking us not possible without at least some background in the conditions and prevalent thinking of the time. Without knowing of the huge importance of religion in the 15th and 16th century, is it so easy to appreciate Machiavelli's philosophy on power at all costs? No.As I said earlier, there are faults. Obviously, Russell has his own personal philosophy, and where there are other philosophers who disagree either in part or totally, he gives them short shrift. Kant and Nietzsche in particular are dealt with harshly, I feel, and this is mostly because Russell's views are almost completely opposite. However, importantly, he does not hide this point. He always refers to his opinions as his, and you are allowed to disagree. From the introduction it is clear that he is a person with an opinion, where you agree, perfect. Where you don't, he gives a clear enough appraisal that it doesn't really matter.In the end, this book serves only as an introduction. If you want to learn more, read the actual texts discussed as well as commentary from specialists. The goal of this book was to give a broad history, a coherent starting point and an easy access catalogue of great thinkers. In all of these goals Russell succeeds, and nowhere does he truly fail."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Many years ago Russell's &quot;History&quot; was my introduction to the subject of philosophy -and the history of Western civilization for that matter. My worn paperback copy has been read and re-read a dozen times. This book inspired me to delve deeper into the ideas and events which are covered. I always find myself going back to this book with a new perspective and Russell doesn't disappoint; every time I read &quot;History&quot; I come across an insight which I missed during a prior reading.Unlike other, more bland introductions to the subject, Russell is not afraid to tell us his opinions of a particular philosopher or movement. While his bias may skew the subject somewhat for the beginner, it does not detract from the overall value of the work. Philosophy can be a dull, difficult subject, however, Russell's style -his entertaining, often humorous prose, and willingness to interject his own commentary -serve to deeply engage the reader.The title of this book can be misleading. While the history of philosophy is certainly the central theme, it could more broadly be called &quot;A History of Western THOUGHT&quot;, because it encompasses individuals (and the movements associated with them) that might not necessarily be classified as philosophers, but rather as scientists, theologians, or politicians. Russell not only tells us what a particular philosopher believed, he puts their system into an historical perspective and does a masterful job relating the impact of their philosophy to history in general.Despite being written nearly sixty years ago, this is a timeless classic, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in introducing themselves to the subject of Western thought as well as to those who are looking for another perspective on the subject."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell's history of western philosophy makes a great reference work to philosophers and philosophy at large. Naturally Russell, being a philosopher less than a historian, he is critical of the thinkers he canvasses throughout the work. That being said, the history really is great. Russell, being the positivist, isn't too critical on the great thinkers of less enlightened times. Understanding that Russell's views don't discount the philosophies but provide an argument to them, we can use this work as a great reference to philosophy without a great investment of time.This is the real beauty of the work: it makes a great reference work. If you don't feel like reading the entire thing (which I do suggest) you can use the work in piecemeal. This book provides basic understanding of the tenets of a philosopher while also provide a quick background of the life and times of the philosopher. I have used this book on several occasions to cross reference ideas and re-acquaint myself with the philosophers.Russell, in writing this book, chose to be concise and this can be seen as a drawback. His descriptions of philosophers and philosophies are by no means complete but they are in the short space he uses filled with information and anecdotes. Naturally he weights the time he spends towards the more important philosophers: he gives a vast section to St Augustine while we spends a scant page and a half on William of Ockham. This makes sense of course and the data he provides on the obscure is certainly enough to wet the mouth so to speak and allow the reader to do some research on his own -- you will have no trouble doing this because the research is well document through a great bibliography.A major complaint I have seen in regards to this book is that it covers little of the 20th century. I can see why this can be seen as a defect but we must remember that Russell was writing a history and not a field guide. At the time this was first written and even in the times later additions could have been produced the philosophies of existentialism and postmodern relativism etc were still at the forefront of the philosophical debate (in the present) and writing a history on this probably seem absurd.While Russell himself was apologetic about the way he handled this book in making it less than complete, we should praise him for creating it. Overall it is an excellent work and handled with the command of subject and history that is most rare especially in our times. I wont say that this is the only history of philosophy you should read but it may well be the best. I implore students of philosophy and students of history to get and use this book. If you do not fit into those categories get this book anyway... you will find it not dry but delightful.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Like most of Russell's writings, this mammoth effort is extremely learned, clearly written, periodically humorous, intellectually stimulating and predominantly compelling in its logic despite housing a number of statements that do not stand up to reason. The work is composed of three books totaling seventy-six chapters and is not for the time- or attention span-constrained. The nature of the writing is not fully or accurately conveyed by the title alone. This is not a standard, dispassionate textbook explaining the views of profound and/or influential thinkers throughout history. It is, rather, an admixture between such a text, a broader history of social and political events related to the philosophers (as indicated in the subtitle), an aggressive criticism of the subject philosophies and, to a more limited degree, an explicit elucidation of Russell's own philosophical views. In short, it is a very challenging endeavor that is, by and large, pulled off remarkably well.In each segment on an individual thinker or school, Russell analyzes the philosophic formulations, the ties to earlier and later thinkers, the degree of logical consistency found in the ideas and the moral quality of the individual(s) being presented. While no thinker comes out completely unscathed, Russell does single out those individuals deserving of his high regard in certain aspects. Among them, chronologically, are Boethius (\\"During the two centuries before his time and ten centuries after it, I cannot think of any European man of learning so free from superstition and fanaticism. He would have been remarkable in any age; in the age in which he lived, he is utterly amazing.\\"), St. Francis of Assisi (\\"one of the most lovable men known to history.\\"), Spinoza (\\"the noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers. Intellectually, some others have surpassed him, but ethically he is supreme.\\"), Leibniz (\\"one of the supreme intellects of all time\\"), Hume (\\"To refute him has been, ever since he wrote, a favorite pastime among metaphysicians. For my part, I fine none of their refutations convincing.\\") and John Dewey (\\"With most of his opinions I am in almost complete agreement.).Russell is a master of the polemic and there is no shortage in this work. Those who suffer the most scathing remarks include Plato (\\"Plato and common sense do not mix easily\\"), Aristotle (\\"Any person in the present day who wishes to learn logic will be wasting his time if he reads Aristotle or any of his disciples.\\"), Aquinas (\\"There is little of the true philosophic spirit in Aquinas. He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead.\\"), Rousseau (\\"the dictatorships of Russia and Germany (especially the latter) are in part an outcome of Rousseau's teachings\\"), Hegel (\\"Such is Hegel's doctrine of the State-a doctrine which, if accepted, justifies every internal tyranny and every external aggression that can possibly be imagined.\\"), Schopenhauer (His \\"gospel of resignation is not very consistent and not very sincere.\\", and Marx (\\"Considered purely as a philosopher, Marx has grave shortcomings.\\")As has been the case in everything I've read by Russell, I find a surprising number of statements that seem to be out of harmony with his normally clear thinking. For example, his criticism of More's Utopia, a communistic system with complete lack of freedom, is shockingly insufficient: \\"It must be admitted, however, that life in More's Utopia, as in most others, would be intolerably dull. Diversity is essential to happiness, and in Utopia there is hardly any.\\" Apparently, for Russell, freedom is not essential to happiness and communism would do nicely if only it came with more diversity. Similarly, in his concluding remarks regarding Nietzsche, he makes a stunning statement: \\"I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-consistent ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to the emotions.\\" This is exactly the sort of thinking that he excoriates throughout his writings when applied to the emotionally held, comforting beliefs of others that don't fit so well with his personal prejudices.Despite my issues with some of his views, I highly recommend grappling with him as a great vehicle for stimulating intellectual growth. Readers seeking a survey style introduction to philosophy will find this to be a richer experience than most available options and one well worth the time investment."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It seems that the previous reviews cover most of the praise and objections that can be offered. I will reiterate those that deserve special emphasis. Many others have pointed out Russell's biases. As some have noted they are hardly hidden and quite clear to the reader. zencoyote above points out that this is only to be expected. Do we really believe that someone, anyone, can write a history of anything and not let their biases influence what events are given prominence and which are not? Russell's biases are clear (he often points them out to the reader himself) and add color to the text. If you want to read a history with a different set of biases then find a different author.The strengths of this book lie in the first two thirds -- dealing with the ancient Greeks and the medieval scholastics. When it reaches the modern age it begins to lose some of its brilliance. The selection of topics is curious -- Byron is included but Voltaire is not, Dewey is present but not Kierkegaard. A strangely large amount of space is devoted to Locke and I couldn't help but feel that he didn't do justice to Hegel's views (even though I think I am in general agreement with Russell about them).The most interesting aspects of this book are that Russell attempts to show philosophy in the context of society at large and provides a criticism of the various philosophies. This criticism is especially useful for a novice."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Philosophers take themselves far too seriously. Bertrand Russel is not an exception. In his own eyes, the book he would have kept for posterity would have been the Principia Mathematica, which was blown to bits by Godel's incompleteness theorem. Yet, while his own philosophy of Logical Atomism ran out of steam (and followers) by about the time he wrote this book, this book endures. In fact, he even won a Nobel Prize for it. And not without good reason.Histories of Philosophy usually lack either seriousness (like Sophie's World, which is an adaptation of this book) or wit (like the Columbia History). Granted, Russel can't be trusted on any German after Kant, everything leading up to the 19th century rests on pretty secure footing. In fact, it is an indepedant study I took in high school based off of this and photocopies of primary sources that made it possible for me to stay afloat in a graduate course on Hegel at the University of Chicago my first year.However, his treatment of philosophy after Kant has to be taken in context. Russel, however fair and objective you'd expect a philosopher to be, thought that his tradition of philosophy had more or less answered the big questions. That meant in exclusion of the Continental philosophers such as Jaspers, Husserl, and Heiddeger. Even his treatment of Analytic Philosophy ended with Whitehead, who was important in the very early part of the Century.That leaves the exclusion of Kierkegaard, and the treatment of Hegel and Neitzsche. Kierkegaard only became important in the 20s and 30s in Continental philosphy, and only in the context of a Hegel renaissance, as a religious corollary. As for Hegel, it is not Russel's fault that Hegel was used as an excuse for right wing apologists for Bismark. In WWI, Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra was distributed along with the Bible to soldiers, (Hitler among them) and so it is not Russel's fault that he blames him for Hitler.Russel admits that he based most of this book on the work of experts, and it was thrown together in quite a hurry. That it falls prey to the errors of its era is not surprising at all, what is surprising is how well this work has held up. In fact, it does. I still recommend it to my friends who are looking for a digestible introduction to the field, but of course with Caveats."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell's Hist. of Western Philosophy is an incredible introduction to the history of philosophy. If you want a straightforward description of each philosopher, I would recommend the encyclopedia, but if you want an in depth discussion of the philosopher's views, who he was influenced by, and his influence on other philosophers, Russell can't be beat. This book can be read straight through, or you can flip to the chapter on the philosopher or field of philosophy you want to learn about. The only problem with this book is that it deals with so many philosophers that it can only give about 10-20 pages to each philosopher (but longer to more influential philosophers like Plato and Locke), so if you need a great deal of info, this book won't be perfect. But this books advantages far outweigh its faults. My personal favorite part is Russell's commentary on each philosopher - he points out the strengths and weaknesses of each philosopher's philosophy. I highly recommend this volume for anyone interested in this wonderful subject."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I read this book in college (Wisconsin-Madison)and used it as the focus of a semester's final thesis. We were being challenged to actively refute a philosophical writing. I was fortunate to get this book before my classmates - because Russell wrote it in 1945, it is at times malicious to the Germanic Philosophies. Shocked that he was so shortsighted, he later begged redemption to a degree. Still a must for even the layperson to read at some point. The book reads as difficultly as the reader wishes."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book would belong to Russell's \\"popular period,\\" i.e., the period after which he had his magnum opus destroyed by Wittgenstein, a philosophical novice, at the time. It would also belong among the worst introductions to the history of philosophy every written. Even when I first read it, just prior to entering graduate school in philosophy, I thought it a crime to call this a \\"history\\" of anything whatsoever.I have two problems with this text. To begin with, it is filled with Russell's personal opinions and topics, which are highly debatable. (It is difficult to read the section on \\"Catholic Philosophy\\" without being more than aware that this is a man who also wrote a book entitled \\"Why I Am Not a Christian.\\" Moreover, the section itself is entirely too long, given its relative obscurity in the philosophical world.) He has a supremely idiosyncratic view of the so-called \\"history\\" of philosophy. (Indeed, were the 3rd Viscount of WTF ever still breathing, I would not hesitate to suggest to him that he take an intro course in history: you know, get to know something about what is--because it represents the book as of being a particular account of \\"philosophy\\"--as important a term for the description of the book as it philosophy itself.) I have mentioned the attention he gives to Catholic philosophy. Yet, there is no chapter whatsoever on Soren Kierkegaard, indisputably the most important Protestant philosopher in the history of the discipline. What's more, if he's read Nietzsche, it's far from evident. That chapter reads like a rehashing of various bad books on Nietzsche.I have already hinted at my second problem with Russell's tome. The book is copyrighted 1945, whereas the book ends, if I recall correctly, with Dewey. Hold on a minute: what of Heidegger, whose Being and Time belongs with The Interpretation of Dreams and The First and Second Theories of Relativity as being among the most important books of the early 20th Century)? How about Bergson, or even the neo-Kantians in France? In short, it's as if philosophy on the Continent fails to exist after Rousseau.In short, THIS IS A SECOND RATE BOOK BY A WASHED UP PHILOSOPHER!

There is, of course, the Bible, Shakespeare, Anna Karenina, War and Peace, The Works of O. Henry, Sherlock Holmes, Plato, Robinson Crusoe, and a few other \\"classics.\\"One of my favorites is Russell's \\"A History of Western Philosophy.\\" It is a joy to read because he is taking so vast an amount of information and making it accessible to the reader. Each segment is usually no more than 15-20 pages long (if that), and it gives you a highly intelligent overview of their most significant views. Further, it gives enough information to inform the reader as to whether it would be of interest to pursue a more detailed understanding.While Russell was not a Christian or religious, he speaks with a very solid understanding of Christian thought and the scriptures. Further, he is respectful even when he must bring criticism to bear on some church doctor or father.If I were teaching introductory philosophy, this is THE BOOK that I would use, supplemented with the actual writings of some of the key philosophers.Very simply, if you want to understand Western thought--where it came from and why we believe as we do--you won't find a better volume. Of course, you could read all the books on western history and thought...but why do that when Russell has assembled it so brilliantly in this book?"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I've read A History of Western Philosophy more than a few times, and even gave it as a gift to a few friends. Russell has accomplished a lot with this, having created a page-turner that you just can't put down, while at the same time providing one of the most lucid histories of philosophy ever written. He also editorialized a good amount, commenting and interpreting the concepts of others in a honest manner."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"\\"a history of western philosophy\\" is a great introduction to the field for the devotee or novice of ideas and is entertaining for intellectuals and book lovers, but russell clearly has not read a great deal of some of the philosophers he attacks and dismisses so sneeringly. ... schopenhauer pretended to believe in the renunciation of the will, but this part of his philosophy is precisely that which we should take with a grain of salt, as schopenhauer himself proved with his life--he loved wine, books, writing, music, etc, all things which clearly involved the excitement and use of the will. his renunciatory, life negating ethic is only a sort of postscript to \\"the world as...\\" and his pessimism is more tongue in cheek and temperamental than objective or philosophical. the value of his work lies in everything but these essentially unimportant and immature elements. nietzsche was not, as russell, portrays him, a grim obsessive over power who did nothing but advocate the the elimination of the average and weak elements of society. nor was he an anti semite as russell implies. in fact, nietzsche despised anti semites and considered the jewish people an exceptionally strong and enduring race of people. russell claims several times that nietzsche's philosophy is essentially a love of pain, which is a caricature if ever there was one. nietzsche preached a philosophy of absolute life affirmation, meaning not only the acceptance but the affirmation of creative joy AND pain and destruction. his is not a philosophy of force worshiping masochism, but quite the opposite, an exaltation of the creative and liberated individual from false values and conformity. 'will to power' rhetoric aside, nietzsche was, in the final equation, anti authoritarian, although he never would have admitted it.taking these substantial flaws into consideration, this is still an immensely important book and one that will be read by those self educators of philosophy who yearn to understand the 'why' of existence."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I have enjoyed Russell's fluid style of writing very much and this single volume History of Western Philosophy is a good quick reference and relatively easy reading for anyone interested in the subject matter. Many works of this nature tend to be laborious and thus discouraging to a newcomer. Russell's book is a joy to read. Regardless of some personal differences in his treatment of certain philosophers I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The first two thirds of the book, which covers Ancient and Catholic philosophy are excellent. Therin lies the value of the book. Russell's writing style is very easy to take, and he discusses (some) historical conditions that shaped the thinking at the time. The last portion, headed &quot;Modern Philosophy&quot; is somewhat uneven. That is perhaps due to the limited amount of space he devotes for each case. One gets the feeling that, for these more complex philosophies, he has been forced to condense the material to the point where a full understanding is lost. Russell does do a good job of following the Scientific / Enlightenment / Liberal / Utilitarian path. But his coverage of the Germanic school makes this reader wonder what all the fuss is about - they come off as practically insane, or at least highly illogical. Other commentators have noted Russell's positivist 'bias' as an explanation for this aspect of his work. That could be the case, or it may well be that the Hegelian school really is nuts. Only time will tell.Russell does spend quite a lot of time on Hume, yet little on John Stewart Mill. That is puzzling since induction is supposed to be the tonic that cures scepticism. I would have expected Russell to have said more on the subject. Also, readers should be aware that the history pretty much ends at 1900. There is no examination of Popper, the Vienna school, Godel, quantum 'reality', or other stimulating subjects from the early 20th century. As a result, the reader is left at the end of the book with the feeling that something is missing - and that more could (and should) be said.That said, Russell sprinkles his history with anecdotes and keeps the tone light. This is not a philosophy book that will put you to sleep. To repeat: his coverage of the Greek and Scholastics is quite good - and is justification alone for obtaining the book. The Modern (post 1600) philosophers get the 'once over lightly' treatment - useful as a starting point - but additional resources will be needed to fully examine those schools of thought.Don't let the carping about Russell's biases turn you off from this book. They are present, but are not outrageous, and they liven up the book. In moderation, a point of view helps keep the reader interested (e.g. Paul Johnson's Modern Times is quite stimulating precisely because he brings his conservative Catholic morals into the text - even if you don't agree with them)."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The book presents short summaries of the major philosophers, some of whom are not available through today's overly modern curriculum. Russell never panders.The book shows what was required for us to learn to think."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"There are many ways to understand the meaning of philosophy, but I believe Bertrand Russell himself had put it best: &Ograve;Is there anything we can think of which, by the mere fact that we can think of it, is shown to exist outside of our thought? Every philosopher would LIKE to say yes, because a philosophers job is to find out things about the world by thinking rather than observing. If yes is the right answer, there is a bridge from pure thought to things, if not, not.&Oacute; Russell obviously had an eye to spot the bogus and Hegelians and Phenomenologists detest him for that. The dislike is mutual, I for my part can do perfectly well without Hegel, Heidegger and Derrida. I have a very wide reading in philosophy, but I stopped reading philosophy after I had finished with Kripke in the mid eighties. Since then I lean back and enjoy the show without engaging myself in any debate. But that much is apparent: of all philosophers from the 2oth century, Russell is probably the most educational and had been read by more lay-people than any other philosopher. Was that a bad thing? I would say definitely not. His book is still a good travel guide, written by a vociferous and independent mind and in a style of such clarity, that it cant help of sounding offensive especially to acolytes of oracular nonsense. Having said this, I too here and there would prod the old man for an injustice, say about Immanuel Kant or Schopenhauer. In Kants case however, I can appreciate that we look not only at a fundamental difference of opinion, but differences in competence. Bertrand Russells own monumental contributions to mathematics and symbolic logic, entitle him to be a bit snobbish. Kants philosophy still employs a logical tool that seemed to have had barely advanced from Aristotle. It is a point only few critics ever raise, but Kant wasnt up to date even of the logical developments during his own era. So many points in his philosophy that seem to pertain to cognitive functions are actually not logical at all but belong to the set of generic conventions that seem to underpin our linguistic faculties. Its an honest disagreement, and the greater authority is on Russells side here. But he should have given more space to Charles Saunders Peirce, who, among many other things, picked up on Kants table of (basically Aristotelian) categories and put them into the context where they really belong. Russells scant treatment of Peirce who with some justice had been called &Ograve;the most original and the most versatile intellect that the Americas have so far produced&Oacute; is not so easy to forgive. As for Schopenhauer I must say Russell, or his source, is just ill informed. Schopenhauer made his own valuable contributions to epistemology (see my review on Schopenhauers &Ograve;The Fourfold Root&Oacute;) which are of interest independently from Schopenhauers more idiosyncratic views expressesed in his later works. In fact by temperament he and Russell had much in common, Schopenhauer being Russels equally caustic and somewhat pigheaded Teutonic counterpart, and, like Russell, a great stylist in his language. If you want a more limited but more in debt overview on the history of philosophy in general up to Schopenhauers time, then read Schopenhauers essays &Ograve;On the Will in Nature&Oacute; and his &Ograve;Paerga and Paralipomena&Oacute;. Schopenhauer liked to see himself as standing on the shoulders of an illustrious line of philosophers since antiquity, the last link that lays the final stone. &Ograve;Every author creates his own pedigree,&Oacute; says Borges, himself a great admirer of Schopenhauer, and Schopenhauer was very good at creating such pedigree for philosophical ideas and following their course through history. But the most telling omission is that of Russells own protege: Ludwig Witgenstein. After a brief honeymoon the two headstrong philosophers went on a long journey of irreconcilable differences, and I cant help siding with Russell on this. Witgenstein is gravely overrated these days, but apart from his unpleasant personality and the airs of a latter day saint he contributed very little worth speaking of to philosphy proper. Russell has the grace and malicious charm of Voltaire, and like him he was a great popularizer and educator. His &Ograve;History of Western Philosophy&Oacute; is worth every penny."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell was both a brilliant scholar and a perceptive man of the world, and these qualities shine equally in this astonishing book. His academic excellence is manifest throughout the work, which is written with the intellectual rigor and logical precision of the great original thinker that Russell was. On the other hand, the author's worldliness is evident in the fact that he wrote this book not for a narrow audience but for the widest possible one. He managed in paragraph after paragraph to relate seemingly abstract philosophical issues to practical aspects of the everyday world. The philosophers whose ideas he explains for us come alive as figures of flesh and blood. And Russell's magnificent prose, arguably the clearest and most elegant English ever written, speaks to our time as effectively as it spoke to the 20th. Dated? Not at all. It is as much of the 21st century as it will no doubt be of the 22nd and 23rd. Own it, read it through like a novel, dip into it again and again. It is a truly great book, a triumph of both learned and popular exposition."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Since we are required to read a bunch of Plato and Aristotle for college class, I really need a kind of book that can help me realize the whole devepoment of western thought.

Besides, I really appreciate that Amazon sent me this book very fast since I bought it."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"In so far as this work accurately presents the history of philosophy, it would deserve only two stars. Bertrand Russell was an early analytic philosopher, and so you will get only an early analytic point of view on the history of philosophy. He has a terrible understanding of the medieval period, and an even worse one of Nietzsche and Hegel. Further, his understanding of ancient philosophers is, for the most part, rather mediocre. The exception is his presentation of Plato, which is only slightly better than his understanding of St. Thomas Aquinas (he seems to care very little for the artistic elements in the Platonic dialogues and so misses the point almost entirely). The strengths of this work, in so far as it is a history of philosophy, lie chiefly with those figures that generally support the early analytic position (e.g. Locke, Kant, Hume, etc.) Still, as other readers mentioned, I would have liked to see more about his own area of specialty, namely logic.I gave it three stars since I use the book as a counterpoint for papers. Russell's understanding of medieval philosophers, Hegel, and Nietzsche is so terrible that his interpretation turns out to be useful for contrasting better interpretations. He has really presented a paradigm of how not to interpret these philosophers, which can be instructive. This book might also be useful for someone interested in learning about certain modern philosophers, as I read someone suggested it would be useful for high school students.Still, I cannot give this work more than three stars because of its many demerits as a history of philosophy, which is what it is supposed to be. Some reviewer suggested that the terrible interpretations are precisely what one should expect from Bertrand Russell, and that he would have been disappointed if Russell had created a more \\"even-handed\\" work. Such a suggestion might have merit, but it fails to understand the purpose of the book: to present a history of philosophy!In sum, if you are interested in an accurate history of philosophy from the pre-Socratics to the 20th century, you should not buy this book. Period. Instead look to Frederick Copleston's _A History of Philosophy_ in its nine volumes. Even Copleston's understanding of Nietzsche is not totally satisfactory, but it's much better. I would suggest buying this book only for three reasons. First, buy it to use as a counterpoint for philosophical essays (if you are going to do this, you should be at least a philosophy major, though I've only found use for this in graduate school). Second, buy it to understand Bertrand Russell's understanding of the history of philosophy - which might be necessary for some scholarly work. Finally, buy it to gain an understanding of some modern philosophers, pragmatists, and analytic thinkers (which might have been the appropriate goal for high school students). Though if you are considering it for the final option, you could probably just buy Copleston's work for the same volumes."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is one of those books that you can't put down until you are done.

He has gathered all the gems in one bucket and has given you the opportunity to see and select out of these. I have deep interests in philosophy and wanted a head start with western philosophy. Even though I read works by Plato prior to this, I still felt that I was missing the whole picture and a place to put Plato in that picture. I think I have now found the right door to the fascinating world of great western thinkers. I highly recommend the beginners to read this work. Even though at times you may feel that you are being dragged into unnecessary historical information, but you will realize that it does help you later on.

Over the years, I have enjoyed reading and reareading it, learning something new all the time. Russell's writing is superb. His analysis is based on the commitment to consider the facts carefully and to reason about them logically and responsibly. In writing my own reviews, I often keep this book in mind as a model.Although Russell always includes a personal commentary on a particular philosopher, this does not undermine the objectivity and value of his analysis, because it is fairly easy to see where a summary of what the philospher had to say ends and Russell's interpretation begins. Russell's erudition is truly impressive. I agree with almost all of his assessments of philosophers in this volume. Russel was a logician, not a scientist--there is a big difference. The book was written in 1943, yet Russell seems unaware of Popper's falsifability criterion for statements that purport to be scientific. But generally, the book is very close to perfection. This is philosophy in context and ideas brought to life from one of the best writers and one of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's history of philosophy is without a doubt the best single-volume history of philsophy available."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I have long been a fan of Bertrand Russell's books, and this is one of my absolute favorites. I have read it several times, and I still go back from time to time and re-read individual chapters.This is a very human history of philosophy; you get a real sense of the times and concerns the philosophers faced.In addition to an overview of Western philosophy, it also provides a fairly in-depth history of the West. The chapters on individual philosophers are punctuated by ones dealing strictly with historical developments and trends.Russell is famous for both his fairness and his outspokenness about his own views. He does not always agree with certain philosophers, but he tries to present them fairly before stating his objections. He is also fearless in presenting what he thinks is significant. How many other books on philosophy present a chapter on Byron as philosopher/exemplar of the Romantic Rebel?A side note. In his autobiography, Russell tells about the composition of this History. He wrote much of it during WWII while staying near Denver. During very hot days he would retire to a little cottage and take off all his clothes.The image of Russell composing this wonderful and insightful book mainly in the nude is quite delightful."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"As a history of Western philosophy it has its obvious (and by now pretty well-known) shortcomings, although I don't think that dishonesty is one of them. Russell does mention that he counts himself a positivist. He does dish out harsh treatment to some philosophers undeservedly, such as Kant (but even there he starts the chapter by telling the reader that Kant is generally reckoned to be one of history's finest philosophers).One of the most interesting aspects of the book is Russell's thorough attempt to explain philosophy's 'connection with political and social circumstances', as promised in the title. I know too little about history to be able to comment on Russell's exposition of political circumstances, but his attempts to expose the relationship between the histories of politics and of ideas are brave and normally sound convincing. What his approach does is make the philosphy come alive and the reader (this reader at any rate) more appreciative of the impact philosophy (and hence philosophers) can have in the real world - whatever THAT is...Above all, the prose is classic Russell and the book is highly entertaining for several reasons, all good! By no means definitive; but if I wanted that, I'd find a dictionary."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Despite its title, Bertrand Russell's A History of Western Philosophy is not really a history of philosophy at all. Russell, though he claims otherwise, probably knew as much. He comments in the preface that, \\"My purpose is to exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life: not as the isolated speculations of remarkable individuals, but as both an effect and a cause of the character of the various communities in which different systems flourished. This purpose demands more account of general history than is usually given by historians of philosophy.\\"One could agree with Russell that his book is a history of philosophy that provides an unusually extensive discussion of general history if only its account of philosophy itself were not so extremely selective: philosophers as influential as Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger are not mentioned at all. Russell, who was writing during the Second World War, frequently digresses from his ostensible subject into commentary on contemporary events. Clearly, what he really wanted to do, during a time when western civilization appeared to be on the brink of destruction, was to write a work about that civilization, its greatness, its failings, and the conditions that had made it possible. Philosophy, as Russell's particular area of interest, was simply the subject he chose to base his discussion of civilization around. Provided one reads A History of Western Philosophy that way, rather than expecting a thorough guide through the subject, it is a reasonably good book. Russell writes with a dry wit, and his perspective on civilization is always interesting whether one agrees with it or not,"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book is vintage Russell: exceptionally written yet cheerfully oblivious to his own blind spots. As far as one volume summaries of philosophy go, this is probably the best--not because he faithfully explicates opposing viewpoints from an objective position; he does no such thing. Rather, he *tells* a story and tells it well. Most reviewers will urge a reader to buy (or not buy) a book based on its merits (or not buy based on its flaws). I take the opposite position--buy the book because of the parts with which you will disagree.Russell's book is a snapshot in some ways of the waning debate between the Anglo-Analytic school of philosophy and the Continental European school. Russell's rejection of most Continental philosophers can be seen in his (admittedly charitable) rejection of Spinoza, \\"The whole of this metaphysic is impossible to accept; it is contradicted by modern logic and with scientific method. Facts have to be discovered by observation, not with reason\\" (578). The problem is that final sentence itself, which Russell takes to be axiomatic (note the irony!!!), is itself unverifiable by the scientific method.I think Russell is sort of aware of this critique when he interacts with E. A. Burk's critique of scientism. Russell tries to respond, \\"It is not what the man of science believes that distinguishes him, but the how and why he he believes. His beliefs are tentative, not dogmatic; they are based on evidence\\" (527). We should note two things by way of response: 1) Russell misunderstands the charge. We are not critiquing Copernicus's scientific methods simply because he had open mathematical errors in his formulations. That's not the issue at stake; rather, 2) the claim that Russell advances--scientists are not dogmatic but simply follow the \\"evidence\\" is itself a claim that is not verifiable by observation and evidence. It is accepted a priori.Anyway, the book ends with a stunning conclusion that the history of philosophy has climaxed, not with Hegel, but with...you guessed it...Russell! Okay, that might be a bit much. Russell is in fact arguing that modern logical analysis is superior to all other systems because of various reasons which the getting into would make this review way too long. In this chapter Russell finally seems aware that most of his ability to think and write is based off of presuppositions which are beyond the realm of sense experience (thus negative about 600 pages of this book). He then proposes that modern logical analysis seeks to dethrone mathematics from its pedestal of Platonic ideals and place it more in the realm of sense experience, except he admits this can't be done. In order to salvage his project, he says that mathematical knowledge is \\"verbal knowledge\\" (832). That's interesting because it places the argument into the \\"communal ethics\\" school ala Alasdair MacIntyre.Conclusion:It's a fine book and used copies can be found literally for a few dollars. In order to really appreciate this book, though, one needs to read a few short bios on Russell. The best one is by Paul Johnson, who admittedly has an axe to grind. For example, Russell was a pacifist yet after WWII he urged the Allied leaders to nuke Moscow, thus preventing a nuclear arms race! That makes sense...I guess. If you don't think about it. Anyway, a fun read."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Nietzsche is maltreated, slightly. To say that the book is biased, misleading, or that Russell's attitude is in any way arrogant, however, is ignorance and intolerance in itself. Of course, Russell does have a very definite opinion of each philosophy examined, but his own views do not lead him to distort any factual information and the distinction between his opinion and the other philosophers' is very clearly made. To find such rudimentary faults in such a great man is a sign of bland arrogance combined with terrible naivette."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I have read the Chinese version of this book, it is so good that I cannot let it go. The books exhibits the volumous knowledge and sharp thinking of Berti."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"As another reviewer noted, finding something new to add to the many reviews already posted is difficult. Russell's strengths and weaknesses have already mostly been noted. I will confine myself to some remarks about Russell as a historian.Where his work is weak, it is directly due to his biases, especially against religion. I do not fault Russell for being biased; I fault him for letting his biases distort his reasoning. I also do so on the basis of his own stated goals. Russell is not very successful in his own goal of achieving the \\"hypothetical sympathy\\" required \\"to know what it feels like to believe his theories\\" (Book I, Chap. 4). Instead, his history is thoroughly marked by presentism, a common fallacy in historical writing in which a historian retrojects current standards into the past. Professional historians try to avoid this error. Not surprisingly, Russell's presentism shows up most clearly when it comes to his antireligious and proscience stances.He continually faults philosophers for absorbing \\"superstitions\\" like astrology and alchemy along with whatever \\"scientific\\" information they received. The thought, of course, is that educated, rational men in any age should be above such follies. Today, a social historian would point out that in their day, in their time, given their world view, they could hardly do anything else. In such cases, Russell fails not only in his goal of achieving hypothetical sympathy, but also his goal of placing philosophers in their proper social situation.Although bashing the Scholastic and Reformation periods are also characteristic of his intellectual setting, Russell's portrayals border on wilful distortion. Russell grudgingly acknowledges the university was born in this period, but misportrays academic freedom as it then existed. In fact, modern notions about academic freedom are in continuity with, not a reaction to, the original university model. Russell blames the Scholastic assimilation of Aristotle for impeding the advance of science; on the contrary, the Church's acceptance of Aristotle paved the way for modern science. As Russell noted earlier, Aristotle tempered his metaphysical speculations with real world observations; Aristotle in effect gave philosophers permission to look at the world. It seems unlikely modern science would have emerged while the Church retained its Platonic orientation.When Russell turns to the advent of modern science, he mostly illustrates his own point that myths surrounding an event sometimes become more influential than the reality. Galileo's trial is a case in point. In reality, the Church had a longstanding tradition of adapting to new knowledge with very few problems. Indeed, Copernican theory was freely debated in the Catholic world for nearly seventy years. Copernican theory per se was not the central issue in Galileo's trial. Galileo was a victim in part of politics and in part of his own hubris. Wittingly or otherwise, he also managed to insult an otherwise favorable pope. Contrary to Russell's assertion, Galileo was ultimately convicted for what he did, not what he thought. Portraying the Galileo event as pitting dogmatic fanaticism against scientific advance is a modern myth.How blameworthy is Russell for these distortions of history? His stated goals were laudable, and reflected the direction which professional historians were heading. If Russell failed to achieve his goals, modern historians do not always live up to them, either. However, a modern historian would not be allowed to get away with such blatant distortions, especially in the face of acknowledged facts. So, though Russell acknowledges that scientists had very good reasons in Galileo's day to reject Copernicus, he still harangues Martin Luther and John Calvin for doing so. I cannot see anything other than pure spite in Russell's demonization of those who rejected the Copernican system.Read as a history, the best one can say for Russell is that he is hopelessly outdated. Perhaps it is better to read this work as a piece of history, an artifact of another time when bold writers had bold ideas and were not afraid to tackle grand themes."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Well, this book is very interesting, I knew very little on phylosophy before reading this book and it gave me some bearings in the subject. The book's title says it all &quot;A History of...&quot;, it contains the author's view and the approach he was interested in exploring. The section on Catholic church was the most interesting and I would recommend it. I think the flaw of the book are due to lack of space, no one can be without flaws trying to make 3000 years of history of thought, and, of course, it will displease those who disagree with the author. Above all, I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book has two fatal flaws. The first is that it is 70 years out of date. Russell wrote the book during World War II and many of the concepts he develops are simply wrong. We've seen the failure of logical positivism and strict standards of evidential proof such as falsification. Hume's problem of induction cannot be solved, it can only be managed. The replacement is tools like Bayesian decision theory which allow you to weigh degrees of belief. There has also been a rise in analytic Christian philosophy and all of the arguments for the existence of God that Russell advocates are now out of date. The new arguments are based on the Big Bang and the quantum mechanics, both advances that were not well-absorbed into philosophy at Russell's time. If you are into the fuzzier side of philosophy there is also the later Wittgenstein and the rise of ordinary language philosophy. The second problem is recognized even by Russell's admirers, which is that Russell allowed his biases to influence his treatment of philosophers and topics that he did not agree with.If you came to this because you wanted to learn about philosophy and this was the only book you'd heard of then here is a better approach.Looking At Philosophy: The Unbearable Heaviness of Philosophy Made LighterA plain English but surprisingly sophisticated introduction.Ancient Philosophy: A New History of Western Philosophy Volume 1Kenny set himself a low bar when he began this four book introductory series. He wanted to write an introduction that is more fun than Coppleston's epic nine volume introductory series (still the best way to learn philosophy up until the early 20th century) but less biased than Russell's book (if he wanted to set a high bar he would have tried to be more accurate than Coppleston and more fun than Russell).Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and ApologeticsA modern look at philosophy of philosophy of religion."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's History of Western Philosophy should really be titled &quot;A staunch positivist's take on the history of philosophy.&quot; Russell's bias against any form of metaphysics is so great that he essentially dismisses any attempt to establish metaphysical principles as foolishness.

If one wants a demonstration of arrogance, this is the book for you. My recommendation would be Copleston's 9 volume &quot;History of Philosophy.&quot; It is far more thorough and attempts to treat all philosophers and schools of philosophy seriously. With a greater amount of humility, Copleston honestly admits that he is writing as a Thomist and a Catholic philospher. Nevertheless, he presents the positions of others fairly and comprehensively. Fortunately for us all, few people take Bertrand Russell's opinions seriously and positivism is dead as a viable school of philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It's fairly well-written, but that's not the point if you want a history of philosophy - you might as well read a novel. The real point people should be making about this book is that it is absolutely biased. He ignores Kierkegaard and Heidegger, doesn't understand Hegel at all, gives a Humean-biased interpretation of Kant, only just understands Schopenhauer a little (and, once more, doesn't see the wealth of insight in his work), and criticises Nietzsche on the all-too-obvious points, without pointing out some of his brilliant insights about the psychological content of philosophy (which, of course, lead onto Derrida in the '60s). The only passable areas of this are the areas on Greek philosophy, but that's because they've been written about so many times and are 2500 years old it's just about impossible to get it wrong (of course, Russell doesn't add any insightful new interpretations which he could have done in light of Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger - but oh, sorry, I forgot - he doesn't understand Hegel or Kierkegaard, and he ignoroes Kierkegaard and Heidegger). Where's phenomenology? To be fair, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty had only just published their main works, but Brentano and Husserl certainly deserve mentioning - Husserl at the very least.Also, his attack on Bergson is pathetic. &quot;irrational&quot; ? That is quite arrogant (as is his treatment of others) when we try and consider what Russell's own original work was like. His major epistemological books like &quot;The Analysis of Mind&quot; and &quot;Our Knowledge of the External World&quot; are, closely considered, completely outdated (even when they were written in the early part of this century) and very shaky, far more shaky on their arguments than the idealist philosophers like the brilliant Bradley and McTaggart which Russell didn't like. If Russell hadn't been lucky and entered philosophy at the time when positivism and realism was on the rise, then no-one would remember him today. If he'd been born in Germany at the time of Hegel (or even at his own time, when Husserl and Heidegger were around), then he would have realised he's actually not very good at philosophy and can't understand it's most important aspects, and he would have stuck to mathematics and never muddied the academic waters with his useless repetitive nonsense. At least Whitehead, after writing the adequate &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; with Russell, went on to produce some important work like &quot;Process and Reality&quot; and some interpretations of the Greeks which excel Russell's pathetic efforts. Russell went on to write some non-mathematical philosophy (in other words, an area he is completely incapable in), and this heavily biased book with only almost no redeeming features, his witty style being the only one. In fact, if no-one read this any more I might have given it 2 or 3 stars and called it an 'interesting period relic' (certainly NOT a classic). As it is, considering it's current over-rated position when there are so many better histories of philosophy to read (Derrida's &quot;From Socrates to Freud and Beyond&quot; or Copleston's History, just as a few examples), it deserves to be forgotten and polemically attacked until it's at least assigned it's proper place."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book has an enormous positivist bias in the selection of the ideas and philosophers and in Russell's comments, and unfortunately many misrepresentations. This will be obvious to anyone well acquainted with the thought of idealist or theist philosophers. And this is quite understandable from Russell, given that his was during most of his life a staunch leftist and materialist activist, crusading against religion any form of morality. (although at the very end he strangely publicly admited that &quot;I am ashamed of saying this, but we need Christian love&quot;, mabe because of WWII etc.). I am not disappointed in Russell writing this history of philossophy, it perfectly reflects his views. The problem is that he does not state his view, bias and may thereby mislead many readers. I think that he really ought to have called this book: &quot;An atheist (or positivist) perspective on the history of philosophy&quot;, or have said something in the preface. That would have been clearer and more honest for those who do not know about Russell's strong activism and partisanship. I hope anyway that he did not write this book to mislead people.Anthony Kenny's history of philosophy is no better: it has also a strong bias (but idealist this time), but does not mention it either!The best history of philosophy remains, in my opinion, Frederick Copleston's nine volumes. It is big, but very serious, trying to give much attention to all philosophers instead of selecting his favorites. And although he honestly did not hide he was Christian but wrote clearly from the beginning that he was a Jesuit, he may have written the most balanced work. And this is why I prefer Copleston's history very much to Kenny's of Russell's. Or I still prefer the simple, unpretentious and short history of philo. by the postmodern Donald Palmer (Looking at philosophy). And he too is rather honest and does not hide that he is a postmodern skeptic and feminist."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The analysis of the philosophers and their philosophies is done with clinical precision. But somewhere you begin to feel the harshness of the criticism and the cynicism of the reviewer's mind jars on the readers' minds. The mind of Russell is one gigantic logical machine. The question is: can every human emotion be encapsulated by logic? Many a time we become witnesses to the demolition of the larger than life images of great thinkers - like Rousseau. It is as if Russell grudges them ( the philosophers ) their fame. But at the end of it all the book is a masterpiece and a work of monumental importance. Men like Russell are needed to keep the human race on the right track and be not led astray by the innocuous looking but dangerous writings of misled philosophers."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book, although admirable in its intention to place philosophy in its historical context, is too biased to be helpful and even factually in error. The fact that it is an introduction is particularly disturbing as his extreme biases and factual errors would not be noticeable to people who are not familiar with the philosophies and historical records he sites.I am quite familiar with Classical through Hellenistic philosophy and was hoping to educate myself more on philosophy of later times. Yet I found his treatment of the areas that I am familiar with so ill portrayed and actually in a few places factually wrong, that I am not sure if I should continue reading as I do not trust him to explain other areas that I am not familiar with."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"David C. Moses's review is great, although it should be noted that Russell and Flew have different aims. Russell's is to \\"exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life,\\" and in doing so, he gives a remarkably erudite overview of the social-historical progress of philosophy. Flew's aim, on the other hand, is to introduce to the reader the general methodology of Western philosophy. Thus, Russell begins with the the rise of Greek civilization and the Pre-Socratics and ends with John Dewey and logical analysis, while Flew arranges his chapters by subjects and shows, for example, how Hume responded to Plato with respect to the nature of value.Both books are important, though for my money Flew's is more valuable. You won't find the great social context that Russell provides, and to be honest Flew's prose is at times convoluted. Yet what Flew provides is an essential foundation, a toolkit for approaching various problems philosophically. He locates general flaws and fallacies in the arguments of major philosophers and gives those fallacies memorable names. Of course he has his own biases, but they do not detract from his purpose in the way that Russell's biases sometimes do. In the end, while I find Russell's history to be more informative, I find Flew's introduction to be more applicable."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Every person who intents to enter to the world of the philosophy needs to know the historic development of the ideas. Previously I'd read Mr. Russell's \\"History of the western Philosophy\\" in spanish, and I'd liked the way he exposses the themes of the thinkers through the becoming of the Human Race. Concrete, thruthful compared with the works of other authors and illustrative, it's a great classical work that invites us to philosophize from the page number 1 to the page 836 of its three books in one."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I decided to read this book for two reasons: 1) I was interested in philosophy and 2) Since I was new to the subject, I wanted to catch up on what modern views of it are and why they are as such.The book does not get five stars because the author often gets into a battle of semantics when commenting on the ideas promoted by his subjects. This often makes getting through the book tedious. Beyond this, I found the book satisfied my desire, which was to get a 'warm-up' in the language of philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It is impossible to pay tribute to this book to the extent it merits without repeating all the praise of others. Yes, it is comprehensive as well as beautifully written. Although I must agree with the criticism that it is not always accurate in its descriptions or always fair it is also true that I can say without reservation that it is perhaps one of the most important books writing in the 20th century. I do not believe it hyperbole to say as much.First, the most important aspect of this book is that it makes philosophy VERY approachable. Anyone with the slightest interest in philosophy can appreciate this book. I wish I could have met Russell, there are times when the wit of the man made me laugh out loud. For example, he says of Aristotle's criticism of Plato \\"I do not agree with Plato, but if anything could make be do so, it would be Aristotle's arguments against him.\\" Another time he says;ae\\"It is only among fools that the wise are judged to be destitute of reason.\\" (This reminds me of some work experiences I have had.)Second, the man knows how to use language. As I said above, the book is beautifully written. Modern writing is dumbed-down. In order to placate the ignorant or lazy reader authors are told to use simple sentences and smaller words. In the movie \\"Amadeus\\" they tell Mozart he uses too many notes. Russell was not shackled by this small mindedness. He uses the full orchestra of the English language. You have to focus when you are reading him just as you need to pay attention when listening to Mozart.Third, I am convinced that the greatest evidence of genius to most people is the degree to which the other agrees with them. I am just as guilty of this as well as any, if not more so. Russell by this standard, my subjective standard, has a supreme intellect. He describes philosophers as both effects and causes in their society. As position I have long held. In another instance, when discussing infinite sets he explains how the set of all numbers is equal to all even numbers, since all infinite sets are equal. This is an argument I once had with a calculus professor who could not distinguish the value of the object in a set from membership in the set.Fourth, the book is relevant to our time. Russell describes how teleology led science down a blind alley, how ultimately the conception of purpose is only applicable within reality and not reality itself. Something proponents of \\"Intelligent design\\" would do well to remember. Russell also deals with how hundreds of years ago dealt with the fallacies of \\"intelligent design.\\" Keep in mind that this was written in the 1943, showing that the supposed \\"science\\" of this movement has long ago been discarded. He discusses the relevance of Nietzche on the world of WWII or Rousseau's naturalism on \\"modern\\" thinking.There are many more reasons to read this book, but if I were to describe them all the review would be longer than the book itself. Suffice it to say, I love this book. READ IT."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I am not that interested in philosophy, but this book also gives an very well written HISTORY of Western thought. I skipped over the detailed accounts, why for example Plato thought, that God existed (or did not exist - I do not recall..), but I still got a definite \\"feel\\" for the development of Western thought. Mr. Russell also describes the men (it is only men...), not only their thoughts, and he shows, how they fit into their times and were influenced by their times.It is probably ideal for what it set out to be, for someone like me, who puts the emphasis on history, it is a bit lengthy. Therefore, I derated one star."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Philosophy is a series of theories and intellectual structures that predated the development of the scientific method. In years gone by Philosophy was the queen of knowledge dominating universities. Now it occupies small faculties and has drifted of into obscurity.The mass of theories developed by philosophy is enormous. Probably the best introduction is that by Frederick Copplestone which is a multi-volume series of thirteen books. Russell's book by comparison is about 800 pages. This means that Russell spends sixteen pages discussing Immanuel Kant whilst Copplestone devotes one of his volumes of 213 pages to it. To reduce a complex subject such as Kant's philosophy to such a small number of pages makes the exposition summarized in the extreme. Yet Kant's ideas are the basis of Philosophy continuing as a discipline after the development of Hume's theories.Russell is a person who was foremost in developing ideas so that we can understand the scientific method. To some extent his life's work has been to dump idealist philosophy as it now continues on in academic institutions. From that point of view the theme running through his book is development of scientific ideas and the move to the modern age. With this in mind it can be understood why he devotes a limited amount of time discussing ideas which are complex in the extreme.His advantage as an author is that he writes clearly and he is able to convey the essence of most of the people he writes about in a clear and understandable way. The book is however more a book for someone that is not interested in philosophy rather than for someone who is interested."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"From what I understand, this is mostly Bertrand Russell's lecture notes for his History of Philosophy class reworked into a more formal context. As a definitive text on the history of philosophy, this book is not very good. I just want to be clear on that. This book is highly biased. I believe this is also the reason that Russell, as a logician and philosopher of language, has titled the book 'A' History of Philosophy rather than 'The.' I think it would be a mistake to think that this was the title chosen by chance alone.However, it clearly illustrates Russell's infinite wit and also most of his own metaphysical and epistemological theory. To me, that is the most amazing thing about the book. Russell's take on the Presocratics through Aristotle is brilliant and his treatment of the Early Moderns as well as the British Empiricists are also AMAZING. If you read some of Russell's more complex theoretical essays like the masterpiece \\"On Denoting\\" and then go over to this text, Russell's treatment of philosophers like Pythagorus and Descartes bleed with Russell's own theories as critiques of these great philosopher's works. This is exactly what I would expect IF I had the opportunity to take a class with Russell.This book has gotten a lot of negative reviews since its publication but I think this is more because people fail to understand what this book is. You have to pretend you just found Russell's class on iTunesU and you are watching or hearing him give his lectures. Then you can see that he gives a great historical perspective of intellectual development in the western world, then a selective description of the philosopher's works followed by his own critique. This is exactly what I experienced in philosophy classrooms from Junior College through UCLA."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The lucidity of Russell's mind was tremendous grasping the nuances inherent in all systems of thought being able to flesh out all the themes and contradictions involved as he surveyed the times he lived through and the minds discussed. Yet it remains clear his classification as an analytic philosopher rings true because what he disdains in his analysis are philosophers he construes as poets or artists relying on intuition and emotion or in the case of those philosophies termed mystic or philosophers of Will.Somehow calculating, cold and impersonal is Russell and one reads as though Russell is always right and the pomposity reminds one of an old man alone decrying Modernism and Rock and Roll but not loss of faith.Yet the book is a must in capturing Russell and the great minds as recorded in western philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Nobel prize winner Bertrand Russell does an excellent job in compiling the most relevant stages in the history of Western Philosophy.

Anyways, this book is a good addition to any Philosophy library."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Some readers of this book rightly complain that Russell has little or nothing to say about their favorite philosophers. I notice that Edmund Burke, the father of modern political conservatism, gets exactly one sentence.

I was thoroughly impressed. Russel presents the history of western philosophy in a clear, concise way. Before this book, I'd only read a handful of philosophers that appealed to me and never understood that new philosophies were often a reaction against the prominent thinkers that came before them. This was all made clear, though Russell didn't speak to it specifically, as I listened to this book.

His bias is obvious from the start and I imagine anyone who actually reads this book will be previously aware of it. The most refreshing debunking of Plato, Aristotle and other Greeks encourages the reader that philosophy is not the fossilised subject, unable to escape from the shadow of the ancients, that it once was."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I learned in college that \\"great\\" philosophers are largely those who were most influential. Each attempted some sort of logically consistent concept of reality. The vision of each is profoundly incompatible with those of others. But taken together provide us with a rich variety of possible worlds.Russell studies each of these philosophers within the context of his own time, where we often find ulterior motives for their work. (See \\"Philosophy's Ulterior Motives\\" in Russell's \\"Unpopular Essays\\".)Philosophy for Russell is closer to science than theology because it attempts to use reason to reach truth. Theology tends toward dogma - things you must believe if you convert to a religion. St. Thomas is an example of the misfortune that results when philosophy aspires to theology. Thomas sought to prove the dogmas of Catholicism by Aristotelian logic so that faith is unnecessary. For Russell, Thomas lacked the traditional philosophic spirit of following wherever reason takes you. Instead he began with his conclusions, and bound by those limitations produced a shotgun scattering of arguments to prove them.Russell began this history by rereading the complete works of the philosophers covered. And explains his approach as follows:\\"In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held.\\"Contempt interferes with the first part of this process, and reverence with the second. Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever.\\"When an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurd we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try to understand how it ever came to SEEM true. This exercise of historical and psychological imagination at once enlarges the scope of our thinking, and helps us to realize how foolish many of our own cherished prejudices will seem in an age which has a different temper of mind.\\"This book began as a series of lectures for art students at the Barnes Institute.It is extraordinarily clear headed and highly recommended."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Yes, since it's original publication in 1945, this book has become a little dated. However, this has in no way diminished its readability one iota; this tome has not become an \\"artifact\\" just yet.Bertrand Russell pulled this book together from class notes he had compiled while teaching in the States in the 1940's; he was broke and looking for any kind of renumeration. The sales success of A HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY caught both Russell and his publisher completely off guard; this book, more than any of his others, established Russell as a great popularizer of philosophy.And yes, Russell does obsess on the logical errors and fallacies of his predecessors: the Greeks, Scholastics, Empiricists, Rationalists, and some of his contemporaries (although discussions of Wittgenstein and the \\"Existentialists\\" are purposefully absent).The writing in this thick book is a lucid and witty introduction to western thought; and since it is an introduction, there is not much that could be considered in-depth. Russell expansively sketches out the western thinkers within the historical contexts in which they lived and flourished. He writes with a wonderful clarity, although his anti-metaphysical bias really slants the focus on most of philosophy's greatest. For instance, he merely glosses over Hegel and Schopenhauer, while bringing out the big guns to rip Rousseau and Nietzsche to shreds. The criticisms, while both acerbic and humorous, are hardly cogent.There certainly is no denying Russell's tremendous abilities as an expositor and storyteller; his wit as a curmudgeon is unsurpassed. The reading throughout is lively and full of animated profiles.

It avoids much of the pedantic dryness and/or painful polemic which burdens some of his other books, while maintaining the compelling critical insight which is often (and in my view rightly) considered to be Russell's trademark. Specialists have often charged the History's treatment of various philosophers as being less than adequate, but the concluding sentence in Russell's preface concedes as much, and offers an apology in advance. His intent is to provide a deliberately broad (though essentially sound) account of major Western philosophers, the social circumstances which moulded them, and the impact their thought has had on subsequent generations. His remarkable success easily justifies the attempt. A delicious read."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Very good book, well written and very well researched.

It's Russell's take on the philosophers and their influence on subsequent philosophy and science. The fact that he was an atheist colors his views of what is good and what is bad in this history. The book may be moderately challenging for the general reader. I found his writing on form vs. substance rewarding (in his &#34;Aristotle&#34;). I long thought my understanding of it lacked something. It is important to understand the view from the standpoint of anything previous to the late 19th or early 20th centuries. A statue (substance + form) is said to have form conferred upon it by the artist. I knew that I couldn't quite visualize this in the soul to man connection. In &#34;Aristotle&#34; I found that in man and animals the soul is what creates form (sort of like DNA). This was before the notion of organic form. Aristotle invoked a god-creator, involving the human soul (not eternal) as the formative principle of the body and its life. A part of the soul, reason, was eternal--but Russell sees this as a non-personal continuation, a sort of merging with god."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"a good place to start the great journeyyou can't beat russell for clarity and elegancethis was Russell's most successful bookenjoy!"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's &quot;History of Western Philosophy&quot; is not the best introduction to western philosophy that I have read. That place goes to Antony Flew's &quot;Introduction to Western Philosophy.&quot; But for many readers, Russell's is still the better book. Flew's book is purely about philosophy. Russell, on the other hand, strives to place thought in its social context, and he is so successful that the book doubles as an outline history of the western world, and a very interesting one. Also, Russell's deep understanding of the relationship between philosophy and science adds interest. Finally, Russell's clear explanations of difficult concepts should make those concepts clear even to the novice or near-novice; Flew's book, although it assumes no knowledge of philosophy, is more technical, and so is not suitable for all novices.Despite this book's well-deserved status as a classic work, it has some major flaws that a reader should keep in mind, all stemming from Russell's intolerance of viewpoints different from his own. Russell, like other logical positivists, saw no place for metaphysics in philosophy. In his &quot;History of Western Philosophy,&quot; he makes no effort to curb that bias, resulting in what might be considered unfair treatments of all thinkers who did not stick purely to science. Also, Russell has no tolerance for systems of thought that do not conform to his preferences for democracy, atheism, pacifism, and social liberalism. So Plato is described as just another proponent of totalitarianism, Rousseau is portrayed as a crackpot and Nietzsche is depicted as a warmonger, but the much less significant thinkers John Dewey and William James get personal kudos for being nice progressive guys full of human kindness. Russell's book is a great place to start, but to get a fair treatment of thinkers such as Rousseau and Nietzsche, it should be supplemented with material such as the chapters on those thinkers in Strauss and Cropsey's &quot;History of Political Philosophy.&quot; And, of course, read Copleston's &quot;History of Philosophy&quot; if you have time."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"As a novice in the world of formal philosophy, I was entirely grateful for the existence of this book. Russell offers not only an expansive view of western philosophy within rigorous historical context, but manages to convey much of his own philosophy within his critiques. I came, over time, to look at this book as more an expression of Russell's philosophy in relation to the entire course of western thought. How could it be anything different? Russell's perspective is, however well-informed, quite one-sided. So much so that the individual philosophers he takes on have no hope of a fair trial. However much I agree with him about Nietzsche, Russell does not even attempt to be fair. Better to appreciate this book for what it is: a personal view. As such, it is quite expansive, and if you need to know more about western philosophy, you'll easily fill in the missing pieces if you start here. But don't run away hurt if your favorite philosopher gets short shrift - I also find myself disagreeing with Russell in many areas. Instead, as you read, try to keep what he accomplishes here separate from how he does it. This is truly a great work, and downplaying its importance because of skipping or riding some particular fellow would be like criticizing the Great Wall of China because they used sub-par mortar. Here is a journey through history through the eyes of one great man. Keep yours open and you may learn something."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell's \\"History of Western Philosophy,\\" quite simply, is the best all-around history I've seen. Will Durant's is accessible but more informative about its subjects lives than their thoughts. Copleston's history is much more informative but much too long (11 vol.) for any but the most serious student. Antony Flew's, for all of its strenghts, presumes much more technical knowlege than the average lay reader will have. Russell's book, then, seems the best all around intro - it is long enough but not too long, detailed enough but not overly technical, and interesting enough while remaining all the while informative. And unlike all of the others, Russell writes with the impeccable clarity we expect from him, and admirable enthusiasm.Russell's layout is thus: he sets the stage for each section (ancient, scholastic, enlightenment, romantic, modern) by giving a brief historical chapter. Once done, he sets to work on a 10-20 page walk through of each prominent philosopher therein. While he is quite objective throughout (with the occasional biting remark for humor), he generally finishes each 'walk through' with a critique from his perspective of the philosopher in question. These are useful for both the lay person (who has fodder for thought) and the more experienced reader (who gets both the philosopher's and Russell's view).Before I finish my review of this remarkably clear and interesting book, I must present a quote from the book that I feel is endemic of Russell and how he approaches all the multifarious philosophers that fill these pages. The quote intros his section on Greek philosopher Heraclitus:\\"In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first, a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to bleieve in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude... Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intellegence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever.\\" (Chapter IV, paragraph 4)Yes, Russell has biases (as has been duly noted in these reviews); yes, he makes occasional biting comments and undoubtedly betrays misunderstandings (though none, I think, deliberate). All the while though, it is obvious that in these pages, Russell presents his subject as honestly, excitedly, and (yes!) fairly as he can. Even when he does express his opinion, it seems obvious to me that he lets you know when he is doing so, and never proposes (as do many philosophers) to have the last word on the subject or to make the readers' minds up for them.Excellent book."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Perhaps we can say that this book represents the best in philosophy -- and lo -- the worst in philosophy. Widely regarded as one of the century's most eminent and controversial thinkers it is not unusual that this book should attract a great deal of attention. Russell shows that he is clearly a man of his times, and while he treats some philosophers with too much superficiality, this book remains a solid exposition of western philosophy. The writing here is superb, it is both accessible and insightful, and he always keeps the storyline moving forward in a kind of spirited hop, while trying to throw in some humor along the way. With great confidence in his own intellectual devices, he never hesitates to follow calm philosophic discussions with sharp polemical swipes. And why not? This is what gives the book its spice. While the main focus of this book is on western philosophy, the book tries to push into the border disciplines of history, science and mathematics. The reader gets to enjoy a nice introduction into the problem of 2 squared, the mathematics of Tycho Brahe, and the paradox of sets. Russell shows no intention of giving short shrift to mathematics and science. In fact, his chapter on the rise of science in the 17th century is the finest in the book.So what does our Superstar think of philosophy? What makes his opinions so popular to some, but not to others? To avoid any misunderstanding let us see exactly what Russell has to say about philosophy. He says &quot;Philosophy...is something intermediate between between theology and science. It consists of speculations on matters as to which definite knowledge has been unascertainable; but like science, it appeals to human reason. Between theology and science there is a no Man's Land; this no Man's Land is philosophy.&quot; So philosophy inhabits a murky domain between two spheres, a sort of open arena of rational speculation that avoids the the trappings of dogma and the minutiae of scientific fact. Unlike the scientific spirit, which must always remain patient and tentative, the philosophic spirit can be bold and speculative, but unlike the theological spirit, must remain free from dogma. As we shall see later, however, Russell is really a man of science and he evaluates each philosopher on whether or not they pushed philosophy in the direction of science and away from theology and metaphysics. Even things like ethics, politics, immortality and the rest of the fodder for metaphysicians do not pass his legitimacy test since they are not easily illuminated by the light of scientific investigation. Russell thinks all definite knowledge belongs to science and the &quot;philosophers&quot; who point the way out of No Man's Land receive his adulation. Those who don't, his contempt.With this in mind it easy to know who Russell likes and who doesn't. The early Greek, Thales, receives a great deal of grace for originating a distinctive hypothesis -- all is water -- and always seeking to look for natural causes and effects. Moreover, Thales is free from bias; his quip that &quot;all is water&quot; is more akin to an hypothesis and one that has much merit -- physicists used to think hydrogen was the fundamental element and it is 2/3s water. Russell encourages us to think of Thales more as a scientist than philosopher. The fondness he has for many of the Pre-Socratics, especially the Atomists, turns into a rather smug contempt when he gets to Socrates. He expresses particular admiration for the Atomists who were strict determinists and avoided most of the faults to which Greek speculation was prone. More than anyone else, the Atomists had the clearest conception of the scientific method that later Greek philosophers were to reject or betray. Socrates is given very little credit except as a man of deep integrity, but as a philosopher Russell sentences him to a scientific purgatory. Plato pushes scientific interest out of the way even further by rejecting the sensible world as illusory; real knowledge is only to be found in the sympathetic contemplation of true forms. Aristotle, while finding the empirical world fascinating and important, introduced &quot;purpose&quot; (teleology) into scientific explanations and further muddied the scientific waters that future philosophers would drink from. This evaluation of Aristotle seems unduly harsh, since he was by far the most careful, studious, and systematic of all the Greeks. His writings on politics, logic, and most importantly biology are pillars of the western canon. His work On Animals was the greatest scientific achievement of the Greeks. Did the Atomists achieve anything remotely comparable? With Russell however, your achievements matter little, it is your philosophy that counts.Russell is like a college instructor who treats previous philosophers as students. He rates each philosopher on how well they were able to twist it in a scientific direction. Russell even thinks traditional philosophy is an inharmonious blend of values (political, religious, ethical) on the one hand and nature of the world on the other. So philosophy only makes progress when it sheds another of its metaphysical layers and starts to metamorphasize into the finer crystallized elements of science. The philosophy of science becomes just the scientific method. Russell is really a scientist, a mathematician, who sees philosophy as precursor to his discipline, perhaps a logical antecedent, but one that needs to die. Much like chemistry had its roots in alchemy, and astronomy in astrology, so does science in philosophy. No wonder Socrates is sent to Purgatory!Since our Superstar really does have an ax to grind, his writing is dynamic and pugnacious, bringing each philosopher to life in an animating contest of wills; swords crossed. How much more invigorating to see each philosopher in the heat of battle, rather than presented in long, arid ruminations in a stale lecture hall. What this book lacks in substance, it more than makes up for it in style and personality."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is a fantastic reference book. I bought the &quot;Great Minds of the Western Intellectual Tradition,&quot; a series of high quality lectures produced by TeachCo.com, and I used Russell's book as a supplement. It turned out to be a great way to learn about philosophy. I really enjoyed the fact that Russell gives his opinion rather than trying to be artificially objective. My favorite part, that actually had me laughing (laughing at a philosophy book!), was the bit about what Buddha and Nietzsche would each say to the Almighty when asked to give advice about what sort of world He should create. Buddha would go first, then Nietzsche would respond to the Buddha's arguments. Russell writes, &quot;Nietzsche, whom only Omnipotence could restrain from interrupting, would burst out when his turn came: 'Good heavens, man, you must learn to be of tougher fibre. Why go about snivelling because trivial people suffer? Or, for that matter, because great men suffer? Trivial people suffer trivially, great men suffer greatly...'&quot; The book is very readable. Unfortunately, it was published in 1945, so it does not cover important modern figures such as Foucault, Heidegger, Derrida, etc., but it still absolutely worth owning."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"If you've ever wanted to understand the greatest thinkers in the history of Western Philosophy, here's some simple advice: read all of them and all of their books. No problem, right? Start with the Pre-Socratic fragments, then onto Plato, Aristotle, up through the Philosophy of the Church, then into the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, British Empiricism, Romanticism, German Idealism, Pragmatism, Logical Positivism, and the list goes on. Oh, by the way, if you really want to understand this stuff, you'll have to know a bit about the historical context in which these thinkers thought, too.The reality is that, if you're reading speed doesn't reach 2,000 words-per-minute, and if you don't have the desire to go to college for that doctorate in Philosophy, you're probably not going to be able to cover all of the greatest Western thinkers in their deserved depth.This is where Bertrand Russell comes in. Bertrand, an early twentieth century thinker, educated at Cambridge, does the incredible: he provides a comprehensive history of Western thought, that is not only easy to understand, but amazingly hard to put down. Even if you're not usually interested in philosophy, Russell's lively account will pull you in. It's filled with history, humor, ancedotes and fascinating lives, but, most of all, it's filled with great ideas that will cringe your brow and make you ponder.The History is easy to get through. It's written in quick, easy-to-digest chapters, usually about 10-15 pages in length. Want to know about Aristotle's Ethics? Read the chapter. Want to know about Christianity During the First Four Centuries? About Mohammedan Culture and Philosophy? About the Italian Renaissance? About Machiavelli, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, or Marx? Read the chapters. If you're eager for knowledge, your excitement will lead you quickly through this book, and Russell's intelligence and humor will not let you down. He's a great teacher.A few criticisms. Because Russell is not afraid to give his opinion of all the philosophers, sometimes you wonder if you're getting the real picture. For example, he paints Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the arch-villain of history; this is certainly an intriguing perspective, but I can't help but question the author's implicit conclusion that Rousseau is almost singularly responsible for the ills of the world. Also, while the content is generally well-balanced, Russell gives an undue amount of attention to Locke (40+ pages), and two modern philosophers, Bergson (20 pages), and Dewey. As John Dewey is Russell's contemporary, Russell seems to have a keen desire to ingratiate himself to the man, and such toadying doesn't play well in a History of Western Philosophy. On the whole, though, the book sings.You may think you're going to use this as a reference, but, like a good bag of potato chips, once you taste a bit of it, you'll want to finish the whole thing and your hand will be at the bottom of the bag, scraping out the crumbs and yearning for more."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"In my teens this book meant much to me . As one who wanted to know who loved to know this book promised an entrance to the world of higher wisdom. Russell tells the story of philosophy as if it is a continuous narrative, a kind of progress in which successors learn from and transcend their predecessors. It all of course comes to climax in the analytic philosophy of his own time. But he does not present this last chapter as a final conclusion, but rather as a problem still problematic and needing addressing.From the point- of - view of many years later the work still has its charm, still seems a wonderful piece of literary work, but is understood in many ways as prejudiced. Russell did not have space in his heart and mind for Kierkegaard, and the whole world of Existensialism. He did not really give much space to the philosophy of religion, or spiritual experience of any kind. The work does not really take into account sufficiently the scientific and technological developments which transform so greatly our understanding of ourselves and our world. It seems to me the ' philosophy' we need today, the wisdom we need today is much broader than that Russell envisaged. At the same time the Queen of the Sciences has if we rely on the analytic tradition alone contracted and is less central than before.With all objection and qualification however this work is a wonderful introduction to the History of Philosophy, in no small part because of Russell's great enthusiasm for the subject and capacity to convey this in sparkling prose."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I'm going to make this short but sweet. There are many books out there promising the reader an introduction to philosophy. And more times than less these books do not measure up to the reader's expectations, or simply bore the reader and cause philosophy to lose another interested adherent. If you have ever wanted to know what philosophy was all about, whether a novice or simply a victim of an &quot;Intro to Philosophy&quot; course at college, this is the only book you will ever need. But I guarantee it won't be the only book you'll purchase on the subject of philosophy.Written for the intelligent public with a verve and panache in the style that shows the author's love of the subject, this book will stimulate your interest as it makes the foggiest questions clear. No matter what the price you pay for it, it will go down as the best intellectual investment you've ever made. Sure, the are prejudices shown in the book, and Lord Russell was a strong-willed philosopher. But you will find yourself purchasing supplemental books on the subject to determine whether Russell was right or wrong in his opinion. You will already have the facts, due to Russell's diligence and clear style. I myself am on my third copy of the book, having worn out the previous two reading, writing and teaching the wisdom contained within their pages."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"To read Russell and his magnum opus 'History of Western Philosophy' is to open one's mind to the processes involved in reasonable and rational thought. I can think of no other person in the last century who epitomizes the role and purpose of the astute public intellectual. A hero in more ways than one, Russell spoke up for peace and justice and paid a price -- being jailed along with, to this day, not getting his due respect; there's simply no reason he shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Einstein, the only reason he's not lies in the fact that he chose to take more of a principled stand on controversial issues, i.e., war and nuclear power, the rapacious nature of capitalism, human sexuality and women's rights.History of Western Philosophy easily stands as the definitive one volume work on the broad subject of philosophy. Russell covers an enormous amount of material including the standard epistomological, aesthetic, logic, ethic and metaphysical questions. He spares no punches and really undresses the dogmatists for any sane reader to see. Nietzsche comes under especially harsh justified criticism. As does the ridiculous nostrums of the Catholic church and religious superstition in general.More than just a straight up philosophical work, History of Western Philosophy is an outstanding history book. Russell boils down the complicated issues of the past and rolls them out in neatly digestable essays. This one should stay on your bookshelf forever in that you'll find yourself reaching for it when historical and philosophical allusions come up in other great works of literature and film.Reading Russell is truly one of the more intellectually stimulating and enjoyable acts. His breadth of knowledge is astounding and his writing style is witty and accessible. No educated person can afford to neglect this great work."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I didn't read Bertrand Russell's \\"History of Western Philosophy\\" because I was looking for a cheerleader for Nietzsche. I might expect a bland \\"even-handed\\" treatment from an undergraduate but by the time Bertrand Russell wrote his history, he and Alfred North Whitehead had already taken Western Philosophy and Mathematics into new territory. Alan Turing himself, arguably the true inventor of the computer, found his inspiration in symbolic logic and in the\\"Principia Mathematica\\" specifically. I would feel cheated by anything less than a \\"critical\\" review of Nietzsche from Russell. To criticize Russell on this basis is akin to trying to discredit Voltaire for lampooning Leibniz as \\"Dr. Pangloss\\". Western Civilization is enriched by both.Moreover, Russell's criticisms are always accompanied by great wit --in themselves relevant contributions to the history of Philosophy. Russell's wit has been compared to that of Voltaire and the very idea of objective, even-handed accounts of Catholicism from Voltaire, for example, is absurd. The idea of \\"objectivity\\" is highly over-rated in any case. No one expects a prosecutor to make the case for the defense while stating his own; it is equally absurd to expect a philosopher whose stature is at least that of Nietzsche to serve us up a PC version of a philosophy that --taken to its logical implications --resulted in fascism and Nazism.If you want a bland history of Philosophy, read an encyclopedic entry knocked off by a professional writer; but if you prefer a perspective on Philosophy from one of the great intellects of the 20th Century and can accommodate a perspective which may differ from your own --read Russell and be enriched."},{"Title":"Between the covers of the Old Testament","review":"Very interesting readingRecommend to anyone as a learning toolArrived in excellant conditonGood for a reference libary also"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Reading CANNERY ROW on the heels of TORTILLA FLAT, the reader quickly notices many parallels between the two novels, both of which spotlight the ironies of human existence, including its happiness, despair, success and failure, and how conventional wisdom often fails dismally in describing the realities of existence. Despite the many parallels and equivalencies between them, however, the two novels differ in tone and treatment, if not in theme, and are equally worthy of the reader's attention. In fact, the reader's grasp of Steinbeck's commentary on life will remain incomplete if only one of the novels is read. By all means, learn from both.CANNERY ROW shows us many great ironies, not the least of which is the fact that \\"Mack and the boys,\\" a group of down-and-out bums, seem to be more content and fulfilled with their lot in life than is \\"Doc,\\" the professional man who operates the Western Biological Laboratory. Doc is alone in the world; he lacks that human attachment that brings comfort and connectedness to those who are otherwise adrift in an uncaring universe. He has lost his only lover some time before our story begins, and his stumbling across the corpse of a beautiful, drowned girl is a painful reminder of that loss. An even more poignant reminder of his alienation from humanity comes in the words of Frankie before he is isolated in an insane asylum. Frankie's simple answer of \\"I love you\\" sends Doc retreating to the seclusion of his laboratory.Contrasted with the loneliness of Doc, we find a fulfilling camaraderie among Mack and his cohorts. Penniless bums living in a ramshackle warehouse that they have coerced from Lee Chong, the Chinese grocer, sitting in chairs painted red with stolen paint, drinking from the liquor jug filled with the leavings of bar customers' glasses, these men possess the connectedness and the feeling of belonging to the human race that Doc has lost. Despite the facts that their few possessions have been purloined, that they are employed only when necessity drives them to it for short periods, and that they would surely be classified as ne'er-do-wells by any member of polite society, the men are not only comfortable with one another but also reach out to others, wanting to \\"do something nice\\" for Doc simply because they like him, and lavishing ignorant but fully sincere love on Darling, doting upon her even as she eats their only shoes and makes puddles in their warehouse-home.Other residents of Cannery Row also connect to the human community, sharing what they have and supporting one another when the fates bring misfortune upon their fellow men. When influenza strikes down both adults and children of the Row, Dora sends her professional girls, bearing thick, hot soup, to sit with the sick after their \\"work shifts\\" have ended for the day.Misfortune, aided by copious drink, does sweep through the company. A party for Doc, who does not return from specimen gathering in time for it, gets well out of hand, and Doc's laboratory and personal belongings suffer greatly as a consequence. At other points, the reader encounters suicide, crime, the callousness of a \\"system\\" that cannot understand or tolerate unfortunates such as Frankie. Cannery Row is not Utopia. Yet, somehow in the midst of impoverished existence, life will go on. Connections will be made. Humanity will be preserved. Logic and reason may not always apply, for the most despised dregs of society may be those who discover the paths of camaraderie, of sharing, of giving and of loving. Yet, despite such ironies, the vibrant, growing, fighting, reproducing life of the tidal pools will find its counterpart on land as well.And what of Doc, whom we have described as divorced from this community of humanity? There is perhaps some promise there, too. At another party thrown by the boys for his birthday (though it wasn't really his birthday), Doc truly enjoys himself-despite the broken glasses, windows, and door. Essentially, Doc remains alone, but now he-and we-know that bridges do exist across that gulf of loneliness and that connectedness, even though it may be temporary, is possible.Steinbeck's CANNERY ROW paints a portrait of humanity set firmly in the naturalistic genre. It depicts all of the grime, the drunkenness, the self-incriminations, and the rationalizations of men mired in poverty and ignorance, yet it also depicts them as survivors, and being a survivor is essentially what life is all about. Steinbeck's novels should probably be \\"required reading,\\" if there were such a thing, for every adult, but I am somewhat dismayed at the thought that there are high school teachers who use them in their classes. The dismay is not because of any Pollyanna-ish notion that students should be \\"protected\\" from scenes such as Steinbeck draws, but rather because having more experience with life and its diversity is really necessary for a greater appreciation of Steinbeck's observations. Here, of course, I write in generalities, for there are undoubtedly students of all ages and at all levels of life whose experiences will enable them to understand and, therefore, to appreciate Steinbeck's verbal portraits of the human condition, and to them I highly recommend him."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck resists the pessimistic strain that runs through much 20th-century literature of alienation and despair. His is essentially a positive, \\"comic\\" vision in that he affirms the human community, all the more so if it comprises outcasts and eccentrics who reject the conventions and materialist values of the dominant culture in favor of the more \\"natural\\" as well as mystic order represented by Doc. Mack and the boys, along with most of the other inhabitants of Cannery Row, embody a democratic, inclusive social order founded on genuine diversity--of character and lifestyle more than color, ethnicity, or religion. In fact, they have much in common with the lovable and vital mischief makers of Shakespeare's King Henry IV plays, though Steinbeck's Doc cannot bring himself to be as heartless as Shakespeare's Prince Hal. Falstaff and company are allowed to remain in Steinbeck's version. They're as essential to the vitality and strength of the human community as the debris that contributes to the cycle of life represented by the tide pools.One striking example of Steinbeck's worldview is the automobile. Unlike Fitzgerald's symbol of American aspiration and status, of danger and tragedy, Steinbeck's machine is distinguished by the working symmetry of its parts and by its relation to resourceful, inventive human beings capable of adapting and modifying it to their own purposes--which aren't primarily selfish but directed toward the survival and celebration of the community which it serves. Gay's mechanical expertise inspires the narrator in Chapter 11 to proclaim: \\"Two generations of Americans knew more about the Ford coil than the ..., about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars. With the Model T, part of the concept of private property disappeared.\\"Chapter 18, it strikes me, contains some of the best writing in all of Steinbeck. Doc, like Steinbeck, is a collector of specimens, but the sight of a dead girl that confronts him here discourages any action associated with acquisition or even representation. It's an expanded, mystical moment in which the author manages to suggest the inextricable relation between life and death, the suspension of the narrative matching the reader's wonder and amazement before a universe that surpasses human understanding.It's a rather utopian view, or cosmos, but Steinbeck makes it work while aligning himself with forbears like Whitman, Twain, and Sandburg--all of whom drew inspiration from the American community as a microcosm of life and nature, rooted in a deep belief in the sanctity of life and the inherent capacity of human beings for kindness and tolerance. \\"Our Father who art in Nature\\" is the narrator's invocation in the second chapter, and the story that follows reveals this Creative Spirit's unlikely incarnations in everyday experience and the natural world.Throughout the final chapters, the theme of community counterbalances an equal emphasis on the tragic and the elegiac. Even as Mack and company finally throw a successful party for Doc, the guest of honor keeps coming back to the haunting ancient poem, \\"Black Marigolds.\\" In a universe that can be ruthlessly impersonal, taking away as much as it gives, it is the spirit of poetry, Steinbeck seems to be saying, that helps us share and even repair loss, linking us to one another in our tears as well as our laughter."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is Steinbeck at his best. It is a great example of Steinbeck's humorous side as well as some sad commentary on the state of mankind. Freddy's fate, the drowned girl, and the chapter in which the boy makes fun of friend's father committing suicide make it clear that Steinbeck is trying to do more than just write a feel good novel for his readers recovering from WWII. Steinbeck seems to want to make clear to the reader that the tragedy that often is the reality of life is always lurking somewhere in the background. Despite some of the gloomy chapters, Steinbeck does an excellent job of creating memorable characters who move through their lives in a laid back manner that reflects the character of Cannery Row itself. In fact, the town of Cannery Row becomes as much a character in the novel as Doc. Mr. Lee, or Mac and the boys. By having the fickle moods of Cannery Row change as portrayed by the weather and scenery Steinbeck uses the living element of the town to move the reader through the story. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck strikes again! First in The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men and now in Cannery Row. Living among the sardine canneries of Monterey, California, are Mack, Hazel, Eddie, Hughie, and Jones. Young men with no jobs and nothing to do, just hanging out by the sea, chipping in their two cents. They aren't bad just haven't got a thing to worry about or do. As a result they are always doing things for the people of Monterey. From Doc, the owner of Western Biological, to Lee Chong, the owner of the grocery store. The only problem is that things often go wrong for Mack and his boys. Lee is wary every time one comes in the store, and Doc knows something is up every time Mack comes by asking if he's got any specimen orders to be filled. Throughout the book, the crew runs into problems but somehow for better or worse they get through it. A wonderful book about the simpleness of the poor life. A well written book with a good steady plot that lets you hear the Chinese man and his wet shoes go squishing by every morning, see the tall cannery buildings and smell the salty ocean air. John Steinbeck has yet another great book that brings you into Monterey and love the characters, even if you don't want too."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I wish I knew how to convey to you the importance of reading this book and how I think it will change your life for the better. I could tell you it's my favorite book, but that probably wouldn't work because most people who know me think that I'm am a idiot. How about there's a whole chapter about a gopher? No? Animal hater, huh? Well there's people in it too. Normal people with all the normal flaws, the normal lost dreams and the normal well-meaning plans that don't quite pan out.The story is about life on Cannery Row and the everyday people who live there. There's a whole cast of wonderful characters but the most respected is Doc and the people of Cannery Row decide they want to show Doc their appreciation and throw him a surprise party.I've read a number of Steinbeck's gloomier books and I loved them all but \\"Cannery Row\\" holds a special place in my heart (even after repeat readings) because it's so bright and sunny and it makes me happy. There's plenty of sad things happen in the book - suicide by rat poison, suicide by stabbing, a heartbroken gopher, a sad boy with no future, a dead girl - but even with all that sadness there's an overall feeling of happiness, like everything is going to be alright. It's hard to explain. How about you just read the book and find out for yourself?"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I was pretty much blown away by this book. Unfortunately, I'm coming late to discovering Steinbeck. I read &quot;Travels With Charley&quot; early on and more recently &quot;Tortilla Flat.&quot; Of his fictional works &quot;Cannery Row&quot; has far been my favorite to date.From &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; Steinbeck has come a long way. &quot;Cannery Row&quot; is more cohesive of the two; it's storyline being more linear. It still reads like a series of vignettes but each leading to the next to put together the tale, and what a tale it is. It hangs on to a thread of realism and captures a greater sense of what it is to be human, the interrelatedness of a community, despair, and hope, magnifying all of humanity within a microcosm of Cannery Row.Again, there is a characteristic band of Monterey merry men, but this time there is the offset of people with jobs and responsibilities. Doc, who is based on Steinbeck's great friend Edward Ricketts, leader of the Oceanic Biological Institute, is an endearing character. Steinbeck paints a portrait of someone you would want to meet, instantly respect, and be lifelong acquaintances. There is a strong sense of familiarity here.Chapter 2 is some of the finest writing I've come across. A beautiful two-page poem. &quot;Mack and the boys, spinning in their orbits. They are the Virtues, the Graces, the Beauties of the hurried mangled craziness of Monterey and the cosmic Monterey where men in fear and hunger destroy their stomachs in the fight to secure certain food, where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them.&quot;Truly elevated writing with a sense of melancholy that presents itself as part of life, hanging in the balance with the parties, grocery stores, tidal pools, whorehouses. Great book. Now on to Tom Joad."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Having read most Steinbeck and loving everything I've read, this story is at the top of my list. I realize that &quot;Grapes&quot; and &quot;East of Eden&quot; are considered his greatest works, but there's is just something about this book. For those who have read it, you MUST read &quot;Sweet Thrusday&quot;! It is basically a sequel to Cannery Row, set a few years down the road and using many of the same characters. I think that if you look at &quot;Cannery Row&quot; and &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; together, you will have yourself a story equal to Steinbeck's great epics."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"The only other Steinbeck book I have read was &quot;Of Mice And Men.&quot; Although I liked it, I much preferred the much less well-known &quot;Cannery Row.&quot;One thing I like about Steinbeck is that his novels are straightforward. There is none of the stream-of-consciousness experiments or literary time warps &amp; wormholes that you will find in so many other 20th century writers (such as William Faulkner and Hermann Broch). While he is perhaps not in the same league as Earnest Hemingway in writing this style, he is none-theless a very talented author.&quot;Cannery Row&quot; is about a blue-collar community of people who lead simple lives. However, as Dr. Keating says in &quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; simple does not and need not necessarily = oridinary. I found myself falling in love with many of the characters, with their aww-shucks mentality &amp; sleepy-eyed approach to life.One thing which differentiates this novels from most other 20th century works is that it is actually, for the most part, an upbeat story. It lacks the morose undertones of the majority of novels written in the past 100-150 years. It is a book about the risks of trying to fulfill one's dreams...and the heartaches and pleasures that this crazy life has to offer. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck created a novel that shows not only wit and literary aptitude, but also illuminates some of the gray areas of human nature. He does this with a humor and poignancy that endears the reader. Particularly fantastic is his use of narrative, and in that narrative, a patois with a life of its own. He includes in Cannery Row a number of allegorical stories and vignettes with varying degrees of lucidity. Chapter 2, for example, makes a few excellent, though not altogether original, points about society, but is altogether disparate with the greater body of this work. Chapter 31, in contrast, is a simple, detailed and lucid allegory that fits within the frame of the book. Aside from a few minor tangents, the book is fantastic. The characters, like those of Tortilla Flat, are wildly absurd and hilarious. Chapter 17 is one of the funniest chapters I have read in years. The stories that Steinbeck tells are rich and unpredictable in detail and plot. Tortilla Flat may have been a little better, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading Cannery Row. Bottom line: Read it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck's starkly realistic portrayal of Monterey's 1940's working class offers universal appeal as a 20th century classic.Although light on female characters this medium-length novel presents a kaliedoscope of social dynamics--a tribute to the fluctuating relationships among the denizens of this social jungle. Readers are introduced to a veritable rogue's gallery of secondary characters: a suspicious grocer named Lee Cong, who does daily battle with his shifty customers; Mack, the smooth-talking hustler and creative genius of the gang who squat at the Palace Flophouse; Dora, the community-minded madam with orange hair and a heart of gold; Frankie, the mentally defective teenager who adores Doc; the Malloys who live in a rusty boiler in the empty lot. Plus the eerie old Chinaman who flip-flaps his way to the sea at sunrise and sunset.But it is the character of Doc who proves the catalyst in this literary milieu, for most of the residents genuinely respect him. A dignified marine biologist, Doc runs the Western BiologicalLaboratory, which supplies marine specimens all over the country. This middle-aged man with his trimmed beard representsculture and class on Cannery Row--which do not prevent him frombeing generally admired, thanks to his quiet stocisim andcompassion toward those in need.When Mack and the boys decide to do something nice for Doc--like throwing him a surprise party--everything goes awry; their best of intentions culminate in physical and social disaster--for both hosts and honoree. The plot is a loosely-woven thread of the sincere but bungled efforts of Doc's true friends to thank him for being the heart of their sardine community. Despite the few short chapters (seemingly unrelated) near the beginning, readers gradually recognize the direction of Steinbeck's rambling narrrative. This literary stream of communal consciousness proves both interesting and tender, thanks to the fragile and unpredictable human element. This book is Heart with a View."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"It isn't my favorite Steinbeck to date, but as always I can still admire it. He has such a fantastic home-grown quality to his writing. Each chapter is like a short story set in the same place sometimes using the same characters sometimes introducing new ones that are only tangentaly related to the characters we have met in previous chapters. There is an over arching plot--but each chapter is self contained as well.The boys of Cannery row want to throw a party for Doc, the nicest guy they know. Throughout the book they try various ways to acheive this and each misadventure is filled with more heart and soul than the next.Unlike alot of the books from this era that high schoolers are forced to read this book is overall, pretty uplifting and certainly has a happy charm to it that \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" lacks (which is a genius work, but is never going to win feel good book of the year)In this book you can see Steinbeck's genius as it is still gestating you can sense as the reader that he still has even better things to write, but this is still an amazing work. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I don't have a lot of literary things to say about a book. This one just sounded interesting and upon picking it up I didn't put it down till I was done. Mack and his crew interested me in their simple life. They get what they need and to heck with the rest. Then there is the other side of the spectrum where people work and enjoy lounging on the side.Their idea of how to pay someone back for being kind was a lesson learned. This book didn't sugar coat the world, but made it just like life, but not gruesome. I look forward to reading Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"You usually know the books you like best - you slow down as you come towards the end, reluctant to put them by. \\"Cannery Row\\" is one of those books.In its all-American, seedy, rambling way, it has affinities with Kerouac's later \\"On the Road.\\" The episodic narrative is unified through cinematic handling of Cannery Row's topography. We share the familiarity and intimacy of its buildings and spaces \\"kitty-corner\\", opposite, in front of, and behind each other.The inhabitants thus spatially and topographically linked are no less vivid: Doc, wise and poetic, his laboratory full of his beloved marine specimens; Lee Chong, the canny Chinese grocer; Dora the local madam; and Mack with his \\"gang of good-natured losers who inhabit the Palace Flophouse\\" (per the Penguin edition).Structurally, the vignettes linked by an overarching setting recall Anderson's \\"Sherwood, Ohio\\". An extended narrative is triggered by Mack's decision to spring a surprise party for the well-loved Doc. To raise the beer money, the dossers agree to net 400 frogs for Doc up the coast. Thus starts a Pacific picaresque odyssey in Lee Chong's uncooperative Model T Ford - a recipe for trouble.Steinbeck lovingly paints this rundown society with realism and respect, occasionally introducing chapters with an epic claim: \\"Monterey is a city with a long and brilliant literary tradition.\\" \\"The Model T Ford of Lee Chong had a dignified history\\". Set against this the true-to-life element: \\"Lee Chong got the truck in payment of a grocery bill.\\"The beautiful comparison of Mack and his cohorts to the classical Graces has often been cited. Here's another detail which sums up this book's lyricism. When a disused old boiler is moved into a vacant lot, flowers germinate around it: \\"the thick fleshy tree grew up and the great white bells hung down over the boiler door and at night the flowers smelled of love and excitement, an incredibly sweet and moving odor.\\"Only Steinbeck could have wrung such humanity out of a discarded bit of hardware. Fabulous."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is a series of vignettes of life on the California coast in the 1930's. The recurring theme Steibeck seems to explore is the nature of friendship - be it the idol-worship of a mentally handicapped kid, the esprit de corps of a group of ne'er do wells, or the stoic relations the central character of &quot;Doc&quot; has with the rest of the community. It was brilliant.But Steinbeck's writing was also brilliant - the imagery is vivid, the character descriptions real, and the events that unfold in the tiny, blue-collar town of Monterey are plausable. It is easy to read, and easy to understand why it is considered such a classic of American lit."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This is not a single story, but many stories woven into a cohesive novel. What makes this novel so enjoyable is the way one can relate to the characters. I found myself cheering for Mack and the boys during their many adventures. In my life I know people who have some of the characteristics of Doc. This an inspiring novel that leaves the reader feeling good about life. So many of Steinbeck's novel have a sad tone to them, not that the sad tone is a bad thing. Sadness and misery are a major part of life, but so is happiness. In Cannery Row we see people from all walks of life enjoying at least some happiness. This is inspiring to me. This book can be read for pleasure, critical interpertation and study, or both. The choice is yours."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I loved it. I love the idea of a place where you can bruise your knuckles on someone's skull without fear of a reprisal drive by shooting; a place where you can go on week long benders without fear of liver damage or DUI's; a place when you decide when to work and when not to. I loved it so much, 'cause there ain't no place like that 'round here."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck's 'Cannery Row' is an endearing snapshot of the small community that sprung up around the Sardine Canneries of Monterey. Although far lighter than 'The Grapes of Wrath', Steinbeck's characters still have great depth and remain engaging.Doc, the head of Western Biologicals on The Row, is a complex fellow and, as such, is the lynchpin of the book. He has an essentially kindly nature, but also a mysterious, tragic air that holds your attention. His neighbours and associates provide the book's colour: Lee Chong, the shopkeeper; Mack and his hopeless, but well-meaning companions; and Dora Flood, enigmatic Mistress of the local brothel.Collectively, Steinbeck's likeable heroes and heroines make for an effortless and pleasurable read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I chose to read this book for an English class not knowing a thing about it. I enjoyed this book. It was a great change from the boring materials that we usually read in school. The characters were great and occasionally I found myself laughing out-loud from the boys' antics. This is definately a great book to read on your lunch-break."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Much as I dislike such categorization - this book is possibly the best I ever read. Over the past 20 years, I have often re-read it, entirely or in parts, and was amazed to find how it never failed to delight me afresh. Yet what exactly makes it stand apart? Is it Steinbeck's sure-footed style that allows him to choose the words that exactly describe a mood or situation? Is it the structure: Narrative chapters alternating with descriptive ones? Is it the poetic quality? Is it the dwelling on scenes which appear unremarkable, until somone points out their beauty? Is it the compassion and humor? Is it Steinbeck's wisdom and deep understanding of what is really important in life and what is not? Is it the proximity of sadness and laughter, despondency and flippancy?Probably it's the combined effect of all of these put together."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I picked up this book after a visit to Monterey, and, boy, was I glad I did. Steinbeck could flat-out write: he was no tinkerer, or pretentious aesthete, or unreadable critics' darling. Cannery Row is a true classic of American literature, and one of the gentler works to inflict upon high-schoolers."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"\\"Cannery Row\\" is an unusual book in that it has almost no plot, which would seem essential to a short novel. However, rather than focusing on constantly moving forward in time, Steinbeck uses the novel to explore his setting in three dimensions and in all senses. The interchapters, which at first are rather bewildering and seem basically irrelevant, are entertaining and serve to enlighten the reader as to what is going on outside of the adventures of Mack and his boys, a few of the many inhabitants of Cannery Row. \\"Cannery Row\\" is highly underrepresented and undervalued in the world of literary criticism. It's a very rich and rewarding book in all its layers."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck is simply an amazing author and furthermore, I believe he is the greatest American writer of all time. Steinbeck has a fluidity to paint with words, to illustrate the subjects, their emotions and their settings with such tenacious cadence that, although it sounds clich&eacute;, one feels as if he/she is there.This particular novel is about many different characters living in a city near San Francisco and follows some of the moments in their lives. What is timeless and splendid about the stories is how they come together and intertwine, and how the characters interact.Pick this book up if you want to go for an imaginary vacation to the Northern coasts of California 50 years into the past...."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Another book I used while preparing to the verbal section of the GMAT. I have this one on my list of all-time favorites. Nothing is more interesting that the life of simple people who don't busy themselves with the stockmarket, business school, or even electricity. They live in California, slip under the boats, and eat whatever God sends them. Great contrast for a bschool applicant with abmitions and desires to change to change the world and beat the strongest.Favorites:The logic; quite similar to that in the Tortilla Flat of striving for the greater &quot;good&quot; for a friend. I loved how the bums justify their crimes and glorify mistakes. Some paralells can be found in some corporate repots.Nothing beats the frog hunting scene and the &quot;new&quot; monetary system.I could not stop laughing while reading - one of the funniest and profound pieces."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I have reread this novel every couple of years since I first read it about 10 years ago. (I often listen to it as a book on tape in my car--there is an excellent unabridged version available.) Each reading is better, and with each trip through more of Steinbeck's humor comes forward. This story is first rate."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"At times hilarious, at others poignant, this is a snapshot of life in early 20th century Monterey. The language is poetic and metaphoric. The plot, which is mostly Mack's attempts to give Doc a party, is broken occasionally by short &quot;interludes&quot;, little paintings of other characters that may or may not be seen again. Like a tidal pool after the tide is out, this book is teeming with all sorts of life. A great introduction to Steinbeck, if you need encouragement to read his longer works."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Like a lot of Steinbeck's work (or at least what I remember of it), this fictionalized tribute to the small California coastal town of Monterey is sentimental to its core. Of course, in this instance, it's understandable, since the book is a very thinly veiled portrait of his friends and town, especially the central figure of \\"Doc\\", who was based on a good friend of Steinbeck's. It's a very human book, one that is less concerned about relating a story and events, but is rather about people and community.There's the wise biologist \\"Doc\\", who supplies animals to labs, the ... with hearts of gold and their madam Dora, the Chinese grocer Lee Chong, the wild French artist, and of course down and out Mack and the other well-meaning bums who may be broke and unemployed, but are never homeless as long as there's a vacant lot. No one is wealthy, and people aren't always happy, but one gets the sense that it's a good place to live. There's a lesser known sequel to this (which I haven't read), called Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Few writers can weave a plot with random, seemingly unrelated events in one setting and yet something about the book still touches a part of you, no matter who you are. Steinbeck did just that in Cannery Row. In Cannery Row, bums with the hearts of angels unintenionally cause mayhem, a good-natured Doctor reflects on life as it is for all of us, for we all have had some expierence like that the Doc's. The main characters are loveable and warm people, and Steinbeck's wonderful description puts you right on the quiet streets of Cannery Row, puts you in the shoes of a Chinese clerk, in the shoes of a lonely man, in the shoes of respectable whores. There is a little piece of everyone's life in Cannery Row."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I feel that if you want to read a good and interesting book than you should read Cannery Row. It keeps you on your seat. It is very easy to read and understand. John Stienback is a great author and I think that all his books are good ones. I can't wait to read his newest book out."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I my opinion Cannery Row is good book. I liked it better than Of Mice and Men. It held my attention while i was reading it, and i didn't notice any real dry spots. Somthing was always going on in the busy town of Cannery Row. On thing i liked about the book is that it jumped around with little side stories. I thought that kept it interesting. It wasn't like the book dragged on constently on the same old plot. It is definatly a active book with alot going on but thats why i liked it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I think Cannery row was a pretty descent book. It had some unforgetable characters and some great stories within the story. Steinbeck did a really good job describing an interesting setting and telling you a story that kept you intrigued. This has been the only book I've read in school that I've actually enjoyed."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is one of the most evocative stories I have ever read. The rhetoric used by Steinbeck is second to only F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the story provides insight into characters that only an upper tier writer could portray. The setting of Tortilla Flat , in the little town of Monterey, is perfect. The books main premise is to show the reader that one can live an ideal life even if you have no monetary stability."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck wrote this novella after he returned from World War II--he worked as a war correspondent-- and at the request of some troops who wanted the man to write an upbeat, funny story.One of the major themes that runs throughout this novella is the fact that our best laid plans often go awry. The scenes involving Frankie and his plan to steal a present for Doc, the first party thrown for Doc by Mack and the boys, and the surrealist gopher scene highlight this. Steinbeck plants this effect almost seamlessly into a strong narrative that draws a parallel between the life caught up in a tide pool and life on Cannery Row. Through vivid characterization and an uncanny ability to capture human behavior and relationships, Steinbeck successfully allows the reader to live among the whores, pimps, gamblers, and SOBs of Cannery Row. Indeed, he truly paints these people as what they are-- everybody.I'd also recommend readers grab a copy of America and Americans and read the non-fiction work based on Steinbeck's relationship with Ed Ricketts, the man who inspired the character of Doc."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I'm still on a high from reading CANNERY ROW, a good 24 hours after finishing it. This is a short book that says volumes about humanity and philosophical matters through the perfectly scribed world of bums, drunks, whores, and the workers in stinky sardine factories in the pre-tourism era of Cannery Row, Monterey, CA. There is an incredible equilibrium to this place, a leveling factor that does not allow anyone to make economic progress, and balances recklessness with goodness, loneliness with community, slapstick comedy with fine-tuned sensitivity. At the heart of the book is the character of Doc, modeled on Steinbeck's best friend, Ed Ricketts, a marine biologist with high tastes in music and literature, a loner by nature who nonetheless lives in concert with his neighbors and takes care of them. The book begins episodically, introducing sketches of the inhabitants and environment of Cannery Row, then gradually swells with the efforts of Mack and the Palace Flophouse gang to pay their dues to Doc with a party. The suspense, not to mention the comedy, builds on whether Mack and company's proclivities will cancel out their good intentions.This is a rich book under any circumstances, but if you have read Steinbeck's LOG FROM THE SEA OF CORTEZ, a non-fiction work about a marine biology expedition he and Ricketts took, then you will get an extra layer of experience from CANNERY ROW. You will spy some funny insider jokes, you will have a fuller exploration of the Steinbeck/Ricketts theme of the interconnectedness of life, and you will marvel again at Ricketts/Doc. Steinbeck had lived in New York a few years by the time he wrote this book, but you can tell the place and its people were ever present in his heart and mind."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is almost like a book of short stories. There are some central stories that follow main characters, such as a gang of jobless, penniless hooligans known as \\"Mack and the Boys\\", and a marine biologist named Doc, but interspersed between these chapters are very short tales about everything from two sailors on a date with two blondes to a gopher who decides to build his home under the ground on Cannery Row. Steinbeck explains this story-telling format in the first chapter by asking the reader, in terms that warn the reader of his similarity to the character of Doc in the novel: \\"How can the poem and the stink and the grating noise - the quality of light, the tone, the habit and the dream - be set down alive? When you collect marine animals there are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost impossible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under the touch. You must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a knife blade and then lift them gently into your bottle of sea water. And perhaps that might be way to write this book - to open the page and to let the stories crawl in by themselves.\\"The style of the Cannery Row - like most of John Steinbeck's fiction- is easy to read and free-flowing, which can be deceptive, because the characters and themes are quite deep. Take Mack and the Boys, a group of friends the town views as worthless, though friendly and fun-loving, do-nothings. A lot of the book centers on their attempts to do good things that continually turn out bad. As Mack tells Doc after a surprise party for him turns into a disaster that all but ruins his laboratory, \\"I been sorry all my life. This ain't no new thing. It's always like this... Ever'thing I done turned sour.. If I done a good thing it got poisoned up some way... I don't do nothin' but clown no more. Try to make the boys laugh.\\"In this way Mack and the Boys seem like simple, pitiful characters. However, Steinback uses them as examples of people who are truly content with themselves and their lives, and who don't try to rely on money to achieve happiness. As Doc describes them to his friend Robert Frost, \\"Look at them. There are your true philosophers. I think... that Mack and the boys know everything that has ever happened in this world and possibly everything that will happen. I think they survive in this particular world better than other people. In a time when people tear themselves to pieces with ambition and nervousness and covetousness, they are relaxed... They could ruin their lives and get money... They're all very clever if they want something. They just know the nature of things too well to be caught in that wanting.\\"Because of his ability to show the humanity of all his characters, even those viewed negatively by others, Steinbeck has a true gift of characterization. This is also seen in Doc, a good character whom everyone in Cannery Row likes and relies on. Although he has many friends and allies, Doc is portrayed as a lonely, solitary man who is more at home while dissecting animals or reading books than at the bar or a party with his friends. Doc's character comes to life near the end of the book when Mac and his friends finally throw him a successful party and for the first time in the novel he relaxes and lets himself go while in the presence of other people. There is also a mentally challenged child named Frankie who shows Doc what real love is, and this is a good way to show that although many people can need and want a person, very few actually care for him or her unconditionally.Steinbeck's literary gifts do not stop at characterization of people. He constantly uses personification throughout the novel, so that animals seems as real as the other characters. And of course, by titling the novel Cannery Row, Steinbeck promises readers a great description of the setting and surroundings of the novel, and he does not disappoint them. I have been to Cannery Row and although it has changed a lot since Steinbeck's novel was published in 1945, I am still able see it come to life again in my mind while reading the novel. Steinbeck begins it with this description of Cannery Row:\\"Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and wh--e houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitants are, as the man once said, 'wh--s, pi--s, gamblers, and sons of bi----s,' by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, \\"Saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,' and he would have meant the same thing.\\"This is a powerful description of Cannery Row and the characters who live within it, and Steinbeck tells the reader all about the place, time, and people throughout the novel. Anyone finding the first paragraph intriguing will be just as intrigued by the end of Cannery Row, because John Steinbeck expertly shows all of these things and more throughout the entire work...."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"\\"It is the hour of the pearl - the interval between day and night when time stops and examines itself.\\"Cannery Row casts a spell of enchantment from it's first pages. Steinbeck's discriptive prose have the strength and ability to place you in Cannery Row. Morning dew bathes your bare feet, cold beer quenches your thirst and the smell of whiskey and fish heads tickle your nostrils.This story is about a town. It doesn't need much more and it doesn't offer. The characters in the book have the depth of well-known neighbors; their excentricities are balanced by their warmth of familiarity. The town tells the story and the town is the main character. The town triumphs as the book crescendo's because it's people (the heart of the town) are united and content.Marvelous storytelling by a master of American Literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is about a very strange community.

Starting withTortilla Flat (New Longman Literature: Steinbeck)through Cannery Row and intoSweet Thursday (Penguin Modern Classics). Cannery Row is less about a story with a central character but more about this small section and its inhabitants. It's a book about a community with a variety of smaller stories intertwined to make it one of Steinbeck's most overlooked books. The characters are entertaining and the vividness of the setting is fully fleshed out by Steinbeck. Certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Being a Steinbeck fan, and having read a number of other Steinbeck titles, I (thankfully!)stumbled upon Cannery Row. This is a fantastic book! What struck me about this book, perhaps most profoundly, is Steinbeck's sense of humor. More than his other titles, I found this book to be quite comical and clever throughout.I've always admired Steinbeck for his placement as one of the great American authors, yet his books are wonderfully approachable and available to the average reader. Don't let the \\"classic\\" distinction scare you off, read him - and put Cannery Row at the top of your list."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck typically writes about the essence of California, or its history. He writing also encompasses the nature of humans towards each other. After visiting Monterey, Salinas, and Pacific Grove this past month, it was fun to sit down and read this short work about this area, its community and all that made this area Steinbeck's \\"stomping\\" grounds.There are many things to admire about Steinbeck's Cannery Row. To some, it may seem as if events are happening in the novel, but that they ultimately lead to nowhere; the essence of this work, however, is the close-knit feel it embodies, and the community's camaraderie with so many vastly disproportionate characters. With this in mind, each chapter is seemingly another mini-story told from the small community.One of the strengths of Steinbeck's writings is his ability to capture the essence of human feeling in characters that are atypical. We see this explored in the various citizens of Cannery Row--Lee Chong, Doc, Dora and the girls, Mack and the boys. Although they have different ideals and diversities, there is a small-town sentimentalism that seems to bring everyone together. While many of the chapters in the early portion are used for building characters, one of the main events in the story is Mack and the boys attempting to throw a party for Doc (because he's a good guy) for his birthday. But, it seems that things always don't go quite as planned; however, even when characters make mistakes, there is plenty of \\"heart and soul\\" in trying to do good.Despite Mack's simple nature, perhaps he is the one character who knows Doc sense of loneliness best: \\"In spite of his friendliness and his friends Doc was a lonely and set-apart man. Mack probably noticed it more than anybody.\\" Mack epitomizes the very nature of Cannery Row because he is the small-minded man trying to do good for others, but lacking the responsibility and know-how to do it. Despite being the antithesis of Doc, Mack's character is essential to the mood of simplicity in the novel.While there isn't a pronounced protagonist, Doc seems to fit the over all description due to his complexity. He portrays the symbol of success and intellect, and is the voice of the community to which they all are grateful: \\"Doc would listen to any kind of nonsense and change it for you to a kind of wisdom. His mind had no horizon--and his sympathy had no warp... Everyone who knew him has indebted to him. And everyone who thought of him thought next, \`I really must do something nice for Doc'.\\"Although this work does not have the complexity of some of Steinbeck's other works (East of Eden, The Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men), this is a decent sampling of his style. If you are just starting out reading Steinbeck, I suggest to start with either this one or Of Mice and Men.3 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This is the fifth time I have read it. There will be more. See the Nick Nolte movie if you get a chance.

Today, Monterey California's Cannery Row, where Steinbeck told of poor folk and sardine canning, has been developed into a world of quaint shops, high prices, and quizzical tourists.Doc's Western Biological Company, where he collected lab animals for science, has morphed into The Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of the worlds great aquariums and conservation organizations. (A very favorite place of mine.) The freewheeling life Steinbeck depicts at the Palace Flophouse is today thought of more sordidly as \\"homelessness.\\" Too bad. Poor folk have stories and grace; indeed, their stories are deep and diverse. The grace of the lives within this book is abundant, the sense of life as scaps in a quilt, not \\"lifestyle.\\" This is a book about men. Women who are not whores with hearts of gold are domesticators and nags. Its central image is the tidepool, battered, changeable, and full of life and hidden tragedy. Its scene stealer is a spoiled pointer puppy named Darling."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"At the outset of this book, Steinbeck tells the reader that the only way for the story of Cannery Row to be told is to let the characters tell it. That is exactly what Steinbeck does and he does it with his usual genious.The characters of Cannery Row are brilliantly portrayed by Steinbeck. He is in his element writing about the survivors in the lower echelon income brackets. Without the reader realizing it, in addition to the brilliant portraits of the characters, there is also a story being told. The down-and-out want to do something &quot;nice&quot; for Doc - the research scientist who is everyone's friend, mentor, doctor, banker, etc. The first attempt is an abysmal failuer. So might the second be characterized, except it is just what Doc was expecting - what he was not expecting was his enjoyment of the failure.Cannery Row is on par with Steinbeck's other fine works. His characters are, as usual, unforgettable. Although the story-line does not have a lot of depth, it is the vehicle to get to know the characters. The characters are the star of this work. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Regular people have never been so entertaining, so moving, so real.In Cannery Row, Steinbecks paints the portrait of a California town and their inhabitants on a canvas that is his pages. True to Steinbeck's form, everybody is a hero in his book and everybody has a story. From a man who loves to work on his boat yet is scared of the water to a stingy yet fair Chinese grocer, Steinbeck creates for his reader a world completely immersable. Cannery Row's short length doesn't make any of Steinbeck's chapters less astounding and moving, his prose style discriptive yet direct. The book is like a good meal, you take it in one bite at a time and savor it before moving on. By the time I had finished reading the book, Mack and the boys, Doc, Lee Chong the grocers might have well been my neighbors.\\"Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream...\\""},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I think that Cannery Row was a good book, the characters in it were funny and some of the things that happened to them i could relate to.

Too Bad. That's not the point of good literature. Plot is for critics and scholars. Steinbeck is for every man. Steinbeck is for regular readers like you and me. Cannery Row is a peek in the lives of a few people--people we'd never have had an opportunity to meet without the observing and reporting skills of John Steinbeck. Enjoy the book for what it's worth. . .and if you are a person whose interest can't be sustained without a plot, maybe you should go and read some of the hack writers that are flooding the markets today. You'll surely find the same tired plots used over and over again there.

This is a book about people and their lives it is not like a fairy tale for the people in this book don't always get their way. Some of the characters may seem strange at first, for example one man is building a boat but never finishes it for although he loves boats he has a fear of the water.

I thought it was so great because it showed people who didn't have much physically, but they had everything emotionally. These people knew that their lives wern't the greatest, and that it could have been better, but they never complained. They just accepted life the way it was. They never dwelled on what they could have done differently in their life in the past. They knew that there was no use worring about that anyway, so they just took life as it came. And nobody judged each other because they were all in the same situation. They were all friends and they depended on each other emotionally and physically. That's what was so heart-warming about this novel. Sometimes you just think, &quot;Why can't the rest of the world be like this?&quot; They judged no one on the little things that don't matter at all, instead, they looked at the bigger things that were inside at the heart. They accepted every one as equal."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Reading Cannery Row is a bit like eating cotton candy -- it's enjoyable, but it's a little too sweet and not very filling, and when you finish it you realize that there was a little more air inside than it looked like at first.The characters in Cannery Row are likable and, for the most part, believable, and some of the scenes are unforgettable. As I was reading, I did occasionally ask myself, &quot;Okay, so where's he going with this story?&quot; The answer, of course, is nowhere really, but the book is short enough and pleasant enough that it doesn't really matter.Of Mice and Men was for me a more meaningful and memorable book. While it extols some of the same values as Cannery Row -- friendship, trust, camaraderie -- it does so in a less simpleminded fashion, and its tragic ending makes it ultimately more poignant. When I finished Of Mice and Men, I said, &quot;Wow!&quot; When I finished Cannery Row, I said, &quot;That's nice.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbecks most hilarious book. The wonderful character detail more than compensates for any deficiencies in plot. Mack, Doc, Lee Chong, and all the rest come to life in a way that only Steinbeck can accomplish. Steinbeck shows that many of the aspirations and struggles of people are universal--even among those who we might think live on the fringes of society. Most importantly, the outrageous humor of this book makes it a must read for anyone who loves to laugh."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Like many of his other books Cannery Row is full of colorful characters that shape the novel and capture the reader's attention. I could not help but feel piy for Mack and the boys at their attempt to be good men, but at there continuous mistakes and lapses into the vices of booze, women, and more booze. Doc too was quite interesting being the only educated man in town who tried to help the others and displayed incredible patience in putting up with the townspeople. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and Steinbeck's dry sense of humor."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"When I first read this book, I did not hold it in very high regard. I only scratched the surface of this book. I looked only for plot and style. What I unrealizingly found was an intricate portrait of human interaction, of alienation. Every aspect of human life is represented in Cannery Row, but you have to look for it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"The book Cannery Row is excellant book for the highschool level reader. It is filled lively charecters and a very good stroy line. I recommend to any who likes to read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck is one of my favirote authors to date. Reading of mice and men took me to another time, a new place full of experiences that were exhilerating. Reading Cannery row provided me with the same amount of excitment that was shown to me in Of mice and men. The wording and descriptive prose was so intriguing that I read the book in a short time of only two days. I definetly will read another if not all of Stienbecks works."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I really like Steinbeck's books, like East of Eden, Grapes of Wrath, and many others. However, this one didn't grab me like many of his other works.I felt the main story / plot was a little weak. However, what kept me going was the intricate detail that Steinbeck uses to animate the characters of the story. Steinbeck packed a lot of information in a very small amount of space. There were many sad and happy scenes in the book. I also found the sub-stories to be interesting and more poignant than the main story.If you liked this book, be sure to check out Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"There are so memorable characters, but overall this feels like a very disjointed book.

I knocked this one out in one day after fighting my way through The Grapes of Wrath in my last read. I'm working my way through the author's California books and I'm about to start East of Eden. Only one more California book after that - Sweet Thursday.

The characters are simple, and thats the point that Steinbeck is trying to make....that life can be simple and beautiful without the aid of greed, money, prestige, and other material things.The focus is on the main characters' intentions for one another, particularly 'Mack and the Boys' intentions for Doc. The entire point of the book is that humans should not get caught up in material goods so much that they forget who they really are.Overall, this was a pleasant, easy read that brightened my day. It was loosely dynamic, and just well, pleasant. I enjoyed it, so I recommend it, but it may not blow you away in any way."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"If you've read Cannery Row, it only gets better in Sweet Thursday."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"If you love great stories filled with heart, wisdom, a love of people and a love of life, this is a great place to start.

It talked about things that didn't interest me, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't call it good either. There were however some things that could be thought of as lessons such as you shouldn't always do something to get something out of it for yourself, but to be nice or to help someone else by doing that. All in all the book was ok."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I read the book Cannery Row in my 11th grade English class. I really enjoyed the book, it seemed to go fast and it kept you on your feet because you never know what is going to happen next. Another thing that I really enjoyed about this book was the fact that you can skip a chapter or two and still completely understand what is going on. The book explains everyones view point. It isn't just told from one person's perspective."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This is a great book. This book should be read by all readers eventually. Steinback uses artful, and masterful ways of writing to express his ideas. Through Steinback's excellent writing, one can appericiate Cannery Row. This book is the type of book one cannot put down eaisly. An excellent find and a great book to read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Although some aspects of this book are typical Stienbeck, I found it particularly well done. The ideas creep onto the page in their own good time. Stienbeck's traditional bums and prostitutes are better seen when contrasted with a dignified but far from perfect doctor, an unusual and facsinating character."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"A homoruos and realistic story about how a group of bums known as &quot;Mack and the boys&quot; wanted to give Doc, the towns doctor a surprise party just because they admired him and thought of him as a great person. To make the party a reality Mack and the boys had to go through alot trouble that even involved catching frogs just to make money. This whole party idea became an adventure that took weeks. After all the first party was a total wreck and the boys felt that they had to give Doc another party to make up for all the trouble they caused at the first one. Just wonder how that went."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck had a wonderful ability to describe, but describing isn't enough unless one has something to describe that directs the story. Story? What story? Few of the &quot;chapters&quot; seemed to flow from or into the previous or following one. Example: what on earth was the point of the French physician embalming, and throwing away the liver ane entrails? Would someone fit that in for me?"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This book is easily one of Steinbecks finest works. A wonderful glimpse into an era and the lives of people that's hard to imagine in this day and age. The characters are rich and fascinating and I was left wanting to know more. If the book has any real flaw it is the length. It was too short"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Some of you will undoubtedly consider me a terrible person for despising a classic by illustrious novelist John Steinbeck. But when I review, I have a policy of honesty, and I honestly did not see the greatness of this book. The writing is good, yes. The characters are interesting, yes. The plot, however, seems to be missing. I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, but the honest-to-God plot of this book seems to be that a couple of strange characters in Cannery Row during the 1930s decide to throw a party for their friend. It's very short, but it was a fight for me to get through because nothing happened. Some of the best characters are introduced for a chapter and then never return. When I make these laments to Steinbeck lovers, they scoff at me and say \\"But, see, it's a character study.\\" I can see that, but in my opinion, it just isn't enough for the book to be good. So while I've certainly read worse books, even worse classic books, Steinbeck only gets two stars. My opinion will not change."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I brace myself for writing a negative review of a Pulitzer winning popular book. Many will not appreciate it, but here it goes...Cannery Row may serve as a great book for an English class or a book club, but it was not enjoyable. There is so much ambiguity and you can spend hours discussing the meaning behind incidents and actions of characters. How do you really know what the author meant or was trying to convey? Even if you did, what makes him the authority on that subject? Like a great political speech (great from the speaker's standpoint), you can take from it what you want. The genius of a book like this or the speech is the vagueness. Some may make a valid argument that if it promotes discussion and thought then it is a great book.The characters in Cannery Row do not seem real. They were not convincing or behave like real people. I do not think Steinbeck was even intending for them to be real. As in East of Eden they are more likely to represent a human condition. I think this is better done if the book is realistic. The alternating chapters also broke the flow of the book and added to the dullness. I recommend avoiding this classic book unless you are unfortunate enough to get it for a reading assignment."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I red this book, Cannery Row, and would have to say this is a over all good book thats good for people that enjoy old time stories and whatnot. The reason I rated this a 3 is because some parts of the book dont keep my interest, but then again that comes with all books."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is just a few blocks long. Within its limits are sardine fisheries which give the Row its name. The story that builds up around this area and the memorable characters who inbabit it is suffused with warmth,understanding,and a great grasp of human values."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I found cannery row to be one of my favorite steinbeck novels. The characters are very easy to relate to, and the way he worked in the theme of contentment is perfect."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck (1902-1968) wrote &quot;Cannery Row&quot; during a brief six week period during the summer of 1944. He wrote the book, he claimed, as &quot;a kind of nostalgic thing.... for a group of soldiers who had said to me: 'Write something funny that isn't about the war. Write something for us to read -- we're sick of war.'&quot; Steinbeck dedicated the book to Ed Ricketts. Ricketts was the model for &quot;Doc&quot;, the main character in the book. Other characters, including Dora, the madam of the &quot;Bear Flag Restaurant&quot; were modeled or real-life individuals as well.(The information in this paragraph is drawn from the Library of America edition of Steinbeck's novels -- 1942 -- 1952)Cannery Row is set in Monterey, California during the depression. The title derives from a portion of Monterey notorious for the processing of the multitudes of fish harvested by the sardine industry. The book is loosely contstructed and consists more of a series of interconnected vigenettes than a fully developed novel.The primary story-line of the book develops the character of &quot;Doc&quot; a marine biologist who collects frogs, octopuses, starfish, rattlesnakes, and other creatures for sale to museums, universities and others. Doc is highly literate, a lover of science, art and music. Doc also loves his beer and his women. He is also adored by Cannery Row denizens who live in a local flophouse (the &quot;Palace Flophouse_-- a group of men headed by a character named Mack. Much of the book centers around the efforts of these characters to plan a party for Doc. There are many other interesting characters in the book, including Dora, the madam and Lee Chong, the proprietor of the local grocery.There is much excellent descriptive writing in this book of a Monterey that is no more and of a collection of eccentric and too-lovable characters. There are portions of the book that seem to me to lag and not to advance the course of the story. The characters are vividly drawn, but in both the story and the characterizations I found elements of sentimentality and, perhaps, of over-simplification.I think the heart of the book lies in chapter 23 where Doc philosophizes about his friendship with the residents of the Palace Flophouse and similar types of people on Cannery Row. Doc finds it &quot;strange&quot; that &quot;the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concommitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, eogtism and self-interest are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.&quot;There were elements in this book that surprised me. I enjoyed the pictures of Doc and his devotion to classical music -- particularly the works of Monteverdi, Bach, Beethoven, and Debussy. Also, there are outstanding literary references. In a climactic scene late in the book, (chapter 30) Doc quotes a lengthy ancient love poem &quot;Black Marigolds&quot; originally written in Sanskrit and tranlated by E. Powys Mathers. The poem fits appropriately into Steinbeck's story and adds a great deal to the meaning of the book. With the music and the poetry, I found something in &quot;Cannery Row&quot; that I didn't expect to see there.This is an enjoyable and readable book by a great 20th Century American novelist."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"What a wonderful novel. I am a big fan of Steinbeck's writting, and Cannery Row is by far my favorite of all of his books. After reading this book you will just feel like giving \\"doc\\" a big hug. Cannary Row has everything, passion, romance, morality and humor. This book makes you wish you were back in \\"the good old days\\" and living on cannary row with doc and the boys."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS AVERAGE BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE CHAPTERS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY BCAUSE IT THREW ME OFF. MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN THE DOG BROUGHT MACK AND THE BOYS BACK TOGETHER."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Decades ago, the main drag of Monterey, CA was lined with canneries which would pack sardines brought in by fishing boats. In the mid 1940s, the yearly yield began to dramatically decline and in 1973, the last cannery went out of business. The street was renamed &quot;Cannery Row&quot; after the title of this novel. Now, Monterey is a trendy tourist spot but, after reading this novel, I can picture the Monterey of years ago. In fact, I grew up in such a village on the east coast called &quot;Greenport&quot; on the eastern end of Long Island. Greenport evolved from a fishing town to a resort area too.In my mind's eye, I can see the colorful characters Steinbeck created frequenting the streets of Monterey. Indeed, many of the characters were based upon real people. The colorful madam of the town's house of prostitution, Dora Flood, was based on an actual person named Flora Woods. The biologist &quot;Doc,&quot; who ran a biological supply shop which supplied animals to labs, was based upon Steinbeck's actual close friend. Steinbeck treats these characters with affection. For the most part, they are oddballs and misfits but, on Cannery Row, they manage to fit in perfectly. They belong there and the personalities of these colorful individuals mesh perfectly. Oh sure, there are conflicts and trouble but, all in all, everything works out.The book is lighthearted. After being a WWII war correspondant, Steinbeck gave the soldiers something funny to read. At times the book is poignant and at other times, it is almost slapstick as some of the characters find themselves in situations which would do justice to the Three Stooges. Where else but in this community can a prisoner in the local jail get furloughed for a day since the prisoner has influence to deliver votes to the sheriff in the next election? Where else can a married couple live happily in a large, abandoned boiler located in a vacant lot on Cannery Row?Interestingly, none of the action takes place in a cannery. The only references to the canneries are when one of the characters needs a job for a couple of months and takes one at a cannery. Somehow, with little money and sporadic work, everyone seems to survive in flophouses, boilers, pipes or wherever else they can mooch their way through life and they are happy with their lots in life. Yes, it's a fantasy but it's a beautifully written, descriptive one. It is a fine work of literature that I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I enjoyed Cannery Row, but my husband loved it. He rarely reads fiction, but now reads everything Steinbeck that he can find. The characters in this novel are wonderfully bright and colorful, and wonderfully they have a happy ending and live again in Steinbeck's sequal Sweet Thursday. A great book to change the mind of someone who thinks they don't like literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is an over all good book and great for LA. projects. The title may make you wonder, but Cannery Row is a place in Monterey California where pimps, whores, and basically everybody lives. Lying among it is a sardine cannery, a grocery store, vacant lot, and a few buildings. John Steinbeck is an excellent author and you'll probably be interested how he describes the lives of those who inhabit Cannery Row. The way he describes it, Cannery Row is all squeezed into the book. The way he changes the scenes for every chapter won't let you be get bored. Read this, it'll help you accept and appreciate life as it is."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I can think of no other way to describe this book, one of Steinbeck's most beautifully written, and unfortunately lesser known, novels. If someone was to ask me to retell the plot line, I couldn't do it, but I do not mean this as criticism - this is a book about people, and an examination of their lives. It is organized like a collection of short stories, but they all are centered around the same town, the same lifestyle, and the same people, and when put together weave a sweet story about the main characters. Interwoven between this main story-line are little vignettes about smaller characters that will tug at your heart - the boy whose father killed himself by eating rat poison, the optimistic woman who pulls her husband out of depression - and will leave you wanting more. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has read Steinbeck and wants more, or has yet to read one of his books (start with this or Of Mice and Men, they are less intimidating that things like Grapes of Wrath :)). And if you like it, I also recommend Sweet Thursday, the sequel to Cannery Row."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I can never bring myself to have the affection for Steinbeck's characters that he obviously has. They're liars and cheats and layabouts, I can't stand them. He's so good natured about it and reserves all his contempt and hatred for the few women characters who grace his pages."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"A Review of Cannery Row by John SteinbeckJohn Steinbeck is awesome! This is one of the funniest and most heart-warming books I have ever read. The cast of characters is composed of the unseemly individuals most of us never spend a moment's time with in our entire lives - outside of possibly spooning them some soup while volunteering at a local shelter. These are the cast offs, outcasts, prostitutes, derelicts, bums, crooks, hustlers, immigrants and the lost. All of those souls who never show up on our TV programs or at our local churches - yet they are out there, they live among us - hidden by our ignorance, dismissal and, possibly, guilt.This is not a story about the suffering of the down and out. It is not about oppression, poverty, or the plight of the poor. It is a story the takes us through the everyday life of those who live on the other side of the tracks. It is ultimately a story about community and life - about appreciating what you have, enjoying those you are with and supporting one another in whatever way you are able.This is a needed tale in the land of more.We live in a culture that is paralyzed by \\"the missing tile\\" syndrome. Dennis Prager discusses this plight in the video below. In essence - we tend to fixate all of our energy and thoughts on the things, traits or features that we do not have. We could be in great health, have a wonderful marriage, a fulfilling career, healthy children, and a home of our own - all blessings in the real world - but we will often think only of the vacation we weren't able to take, the new car we can't afford, the six-pack abs we don't have and on and on and on. We spend our days lamenting what we don't have, what our neighbor does have - meanwhile, our neighbor looks at us with the same feelings. Happiness will forever elude those who cannot be grateful for what they have, enjoy it completely and share it willingly.It is called contentment - which is the enemy of a consumer economy. Sometimes, we all need a reminder of what we have, how much worse off we could be - to just stop looking at those who are \\"above\\" you, but instead look at the billions who are \\"behind\\" you.Reading about Mac and the boys makes me remember that every one of those people who are on the \\"outside\\" are individuals - they have a history, a family, life experiences and a story to tell - of where they are from and how they arrived where they are today. Check out the song \\"Moments\\" by Emerson Drive - the lyrics are amazing and it hits you in the heart- we have all been loved, but how do so many get lost?I could read Steinbeck all day long, he is an amazing writer who brings you into the hearts and minds of his characters - they become your friends and you will carry them with you for the rest of your life. I know I will.Peace & God Bless!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I had to read this book for a class in high school, and slogging through it was like trudging through ankle-deep tar. It was impossibly tough to get into, and the activities of the characters made no sense whatever to me.However, I re-read it when I was 26 -- after I'd been out on my own for awhile, after I'd loved and lost and (this is the paramount factor) after I had learned what beer is all about.This Doc fellow became my hero. Independent, industrious, popular and, this above all, a great connoisseur of beer under all conditions, any time of day. It's not just for breakfast any more!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I did not enjoy this one as much as I did main of his other books. I guess I did not think it grabbed me at the start like many of his works. You get the always great character work of Steinbeck and the description of the town is wonderful. You can do a lot worse then this book, but it was not his best."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I don't know what to say but.... this is an extremely well written book. Steinbeck was obviously born with great character developing skills many people can only hope for (I myself happen to be one of those people). The story basically takes you through a few adventures in the lives of the grocery store owners, bums, ....and biologist of a small town near the coast in California called Cannery Row (who would of guessed?). What makes this book any different from all the stories of bums ...you ask? :) Well... I think that it is the fact that no matter how hard any of characters lives are, they cheerfully live them, and most importantly don&#8217;t feel sorry for themselves. One of my favorite of Stienbecks thought provoking passages came from a scene near the end of the book:\\"Look at them. There are your true philosophers...I think they survive in this particular world a lot better than other people. In a time when other people tear themselves to pieces with ambition and nervousness and covetousness, they are relaxed. All of our so-called successful men are sick men, with bad stomachs, and bad souls, but Mack and the boys are healthy and curiously clean. They can do what they want. They can satisfy their appetites without calling it something else.\\"I cant say I can really relate to the characters in the book, but I certain felt like I knew each and every one of them. Not to be cliche-ish, but I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a &#8220;feel good&#8221; book. Even though these characters have it pretty rough, they live and love life. I would recommend &#8220;Cannery Row&#8221; to anyone (and not just for a book report book). Hey, and you&#8217;ll kill two birds with one stone- you&#8217;ll get to learn the secret of catching thousands of frogs in a single night and enjoy some of Stienbecks great literature all in about 250 pages!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"What a perfect follow up to _Tortilla Flat_!While not borrowing all the characters from Tortilla Flat, we are obviously in the right place, Monterey. The times are the same, and they are not easy. People are poor, and everyone does what they must to get by. If that means they rent abandoned boilers and pipes as homes, so be it. Every opportunity is seized for the reward it may provide the finder. A lost rooster is someone's dinner, and someone else's truck, their ride. The shocking reality is that for most, a scam is a scam, and in the long run, all is usually forgiven by the victim. Opportunity is their credit card, and tomorrow's guilt, the interest due.The beauty of it is that for most of them, this was enough. Yes, they could see some had it better, but dwelling on this was not a pastime done. And for those women living in pipes and abandoned boilers it was a fact that now and then they longed for lace curtains, even though they had no windows. This could spark a temporary crying jag, and many walking by the boiler hut could hear them sobbing, causing an echo like wail. A particularly sensitive or desperate husband may soothe her with thrift store curtain rods, but be unable to figure out a way to attach them on the metal walls. These suggestions may not rectify the problem, but it does well to allude to it's solution. In these techniques, their strength was evident by getting through hard times and staying alert to any situation that can be manipulated, or favor that can be called in.Presenting, Cannery Row. On the main street, we have Lee Chong's grocery store open for buisness, and if you don't abuse the credit too much, he will allow you a tab. A sharp man who stations himself in front of the Booze Booth, he will maintain a military position there all day, careful to protect the expensive and coveted alcoholic beverages. Ever sharp to those trying to tempt him from his station, he is alert to those trying to distract him away from the shelves and bargain their way into his favor for a cheap bottle of booze they think he would never miss.Across the street is the popular bordello, run by Dora Flood. She runs a tight, efficient buisness. Her ladies are well fed and cared for and never thrown into the streets because they get a little long in the tooth. While targeted at least once a year by the proper ladie's groups, she never the less hangs on by being the top charity donor in town, otherwise known as political and civic blackmail.I can not conclude this review without mention of the beloved, Doc. He is a marine biologist, often confused on Cannery Row as a full fledged doctor. Therefore, being a kindly man, he is sought out by anyone for any cause that remotely relates to a living organism and illness, birth, death or advice. Not a man that indulges in luxury, he appreciates beer, food and music. He has done many favors for these people and asks nothing in return. For a group of local men, they decide to thank him and deliver unto him a party that will be the talk of the town.The skill is which these characters construct this party is pure Steinbeck poety and hilarity. I will not spoil one word of it's majic. Do yourself the favor to find out all about it!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"At some 120-odd pages it's a quick read. I'm left with a jumble of passages and images tumbling around in my head. The entire book just sort of meanders through to its close in the aftermath of Doc's party, like a cat sniffing rather aimlessly through a patch of weeds, finding something intriguing here and there at which to sniff. Characters, homilies, ideas spring off the page to you at random, all somehow reflecting the languor and the madness and the divinity with which Steinbeck invests the players in &quot;Cannery Row&quot;. If you can write a still-life piece (rather than paint it), this book is the benchmark!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"this is my review.

The tone of the author is almost relaxing and soothing. The book is reflects John Steinbeck's life during a period in which he lived in Monterey California. The Doc in the novel is much like John Steinbeck who studied science at Stanford and is a qualified marine biologist just like the,&quot;Doc,&quot; of Cannery Row. The loyalty and good hearts of Mack and the boys is gratifing. Lee Chong the chinaman who owned the store who everyone went to for food helped holdup Cannery Row.

It seemed to be divided into shorter stories that make up the book in whole. This left me missing details and there didn't seem to be a smooth transition between stories. I enjoyed hearing about Mack and the boys and their adventures, but at other points Steinbeck seemed to introduce characters that don't play any part in the story. The look at the blue collar life and discussion of what type of work makes one happy did interest me as I am going through a career crisis."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"My personal opinion of the book Cannery Row is that it was a good book. I think that it shows the hardships for people after the great depression quite well. I also felt that the characters were described in a way that seems almost as if you have known them.

That is, it's not a contender for \`the great American novel'. But it is _a_ great American novel. Perhaps the great American anti-novel, for its loosey goosey structure, its whimsical shifting of tone and style, are likely to drive batty anyone who has a very rigid vision of what a novel must be.This novel follows a long summer-fall season amongst those who lived in Cannery Row, Monterey, during the 1930s but who were not part of the business of canning sardines. That industry permeates their lives -- an endless supply of fish heads for cats, customers for the local businesses, etc. -- but the characters are not part of that industry or any other industry for that matter. They are all marginal to the rest of the world, from the Chinese store owner whose conversations with other people seem limited to discussions of the availability of credit to a male gopher who is conflicted because his paradise home is out of the flow of female gophers, which means he never gets laid. (I'm not making this up.)The two most main characters, if they can be called that, are Mack and Doc. Mack is \`one of the boys' at the Palace Flophouse. You'd call him chronically unemployed -- if the idea of being employed ever occurred to him. The boys individually and collectively don't seem to be playing with a full deck of cards but they live life so grandly and so philosophically that they are wiser than almost any other character or characters in fiction. (Many times, we're told a character is wise but the author can't back it up because they themselves haven't acquired that much wisdom.) Doc, whom I very affectionately envision as a younger version of the Doc in the HBO series Deadwood, is generous and compassionate -- yet lonely -- and the moral center of Cannery Row. [Deadwood with hindsight now looks like an ultraviolent and uncouth version of Cannery Row.] He runs a lab in which he catches animals, mainly from the tidal pools, to sell to schools and universities.The other reviews note that this novel covers a range of emotions, from tragic deaths (off-stage) to the comic. The humor, however, is more salient: P. G. Wodehouse would have given his right arm to have written this. Many events that most people would cast in a tragic light are played lightly: even when depressed the characters are somehow irrepressible.Much of the book, in fact, borders on slapstick. A major storyline involves the boys of the Palace Flophouse going on a field trip to catch frogs (to sell to Doc to fund a party for him, which seems perfectly reasonable on Cannery Row). I only have time to read these days when my newborn son is sleeping across my chest and I have to say he didn't particularly care for the frog trip because my continual laughing made his bed a little unstable. To give a flavor: the boys decide that in a trip to the country, the country would provide food, so they only bring salt and pepper. The description of gathering the other ingredients in their stew begins with reference to a rooster that wandered away from a farmhouse they're driving by (in a Model T whose acquisition and maintenance are stories in themselves). The meal begins to take shape: \\"Eddie hit him [the rooster] without running too far off the road.\\" When Hazel, whose mother was undaunted in her choice of names despite the gender of her progeny, cooks him but warns the others, \\"He ain't going to be what you call tender.\\"I would in fact mull over whether this novel sentimentalizes poverty except for two things. First, the book is so extensively based on real life that it barely deserves the label fiction. (There's another book out there called Real Life on Cannery Row. I'm reading it now: one of the most interesting points is that the various buildings really were adjacent to each other and only occupied a small portion of Cannery Row.) Second, the day before I started reading this I spoke with a friend from years past who is larger than life in a Mack kind of way: if he had a $50,000 a year job, he'd be so afraid of being corrupted by it that he'd give half away to friends and then convert paychecks into beer until he hit the poverty line. Then he could relax again. So there are people like Mack out there.On the whole, the novel is able to maintain a balance between the sadness and the joy. Indeed, it does so in such a way that it is one of the few novels in which you could learn something about life.A lot of authors from the 1920s to the 1940s come across through their characters as perpetually inebriated. Reading Fitzgerald is has a kind of boozy but truthful sadness; Hemingway is like a permanent hangover. Cannery Row and its sequel Sweet Thursday are like perfectly hitting the right point of tipsiness: there's a gloriousness to it, the feeling of being part of a happy conspiracy of everyone drinking at that moment but knowing that come morning all you'll feel are pleasant memories."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row, by John Steinbeck, is a short book about a group of wonderfully colorful characters who lent their own peculiar brand of life to a stretch of waterfront street in the city of Monterey, California, way back during the 1940's. I loved it.Now you can easily find, amongst the crowd of reviewers and critics, and highfalutin intellectuals, those who spend hours and hours thinking about and writing about John Steinbeck's philosophical reflections in his books. And they insist that every word, line, sentence and paragraph is loaded with deep-seeded philosophical meaning, and vile politics and fiery grass roots activism. And all that may very well be the case. But to me, Cannery Row is just a light-hearted story about a group of supremely colorful characters going about their daily lives, with all the fallibility, joy and disappointment common among any group of people living anywhere at anytime. That's just life, and Cannery Row is chucked full of life.Cannery Row is the central street in this short book. And in John Steinbeck's own words, \\"Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses.\\" And if you've read any of John Steinbeck's books, you know that's a typical opening description by this extraordinarily talented author.The characters of Cannery Row are just as colorful and interesting as John Steinbeck's description of the street where they lived and worked. There's Mack, and Dora Flood, Lee Chong the grocer, and Henri, and, of course, the central character, Doc, owner and purveyor of an establishment called, Western Biological. And each and every character is infinitely endowed with all the richness and depth that only a brilliant author like John Steinbeck could have created and put into mere words.The story quickly hones in on a group of bigger than life friends who set about throwing Doc a surprise birthday party. And, of course, if anything could go wrong, it did go wrong, and the result turned out to be one of the most interesting and hilariously funny human-interest stories I have ever read. I truly enjoyed Cannery Row and have no reservations whatsoever about giving it five shining stars."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is Steinbeck at his best; a lean tragic-comic novel brimming with irony and rich memorable characters. It's a novel about the loneliness that people experience, even when surrounded by a community like Cannery Row.Cannery Row is a world mired in poverty and this novel reminded me of how this time in American history was both brutally callus and yet strangely innocent. People were left to fend for themselves and sink or swim on their own. People were happy to have an old unused boiler that they could crawl into and call their home.Cannery Row has a simple plot. It's largely a series of vignettes held together loosely by the main story of Mack and the Boys, a motley crew who employ smooth talk, light fingers and an occasional honest day's work to get by, and their plan to give a party for Doc, a marine biologist with a lab on Cannery Row who acts as a surrogate parent of sorts for the community.Steinbeck has a tendency to be a little heavy handed with the themes in his novels but his touch is lighter here. The characters of Cannery Row are fully realized, flawed human beings that will linger with you long after you've finished the novel. Steinbeck does an excellent job of infusing this novel with both humor and pathos. I prefer Steinbeck's shorter works to his longer novels and consider Cannery Row to be the author's second best (Of Mice and Men being my favorite). 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I am 81 it is a long time favorite of Steinbeck's writings.Recommended it for one of my book clubs, they enjoyed it, too.This purchase I sent it for my daughter to share the joy."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck had a remarkable talent: he could take the everyday man and woman we all know that we see every day, and capture them perfectly on paper and so amazingly bring them to life. Steinbeck never made these people more than than they were, he never imbued them will \\"superhuman\\" characterizations, and yet, he made them larger than life and their struggles unforgettable. Steinbeck's talent is truly realized in \\"Cannery Row.\\"Cannery Row was the name (and was eventually formally given in the 1950s) commonly used for Ocean View in Monterrey. It runs right along the shore, and during its heydey (the time this novel was written) one fish cannery after another was located there. When the ships came in with they catch of sardines, the workers would go to work in the canneries canning the fish. The place was known as a bit rough and tumble, with employment dependent on fishing in the Pacific.John Steinbeck spent time here - as he did in so many places in California. And, as he seems to have done, studied the people who inhabited the area known as Cannery Row. He has captured those personalities here, and takes the reader along for the journey. And that journey is at once sad and sweet and poignant and amusing and confounding. And the host of characters is one not to be forgotten: Doc - a man of melancholy who still finds it in his heart to be kind to all, Lee Chong - shrewd businessman of the local grocery/dry goods store who still has a heart, somewhere inside of him, Dora - madame of the local \\"house of ill repute\\" who takes care of her girls as well as her customers, and Mack & the boys - ne'er-do-wells and bums who have managed to slack through life but one just cannot work up the energy to dislike them.As the stories of these individuals weave together and back and forth, the reader can see a community, of sorts, and realize that, no matter how desperate one's situation becomes, people need to feel connected in some way.This novel is, quite simply, beautifully written. It does appear to wander, as the novel is not told in linear fashion, but it is so very easy to get totally swept up in the stories and complexities of these individuals lives that the reader is thankful to Steinbeck for letting us wander with him. Who can argue that Steinbeck was indeed a master?"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row depicts many forms of human nature. The good, the bad, the ugly. But best of all it shows how friendship can endure through all sorts of hardships and that it has no boundaries. A Doc can be best friends with a homeless man. My trip to Monterey inspired me to read this book, and I would definitely recommend a trip to Monterey after you've read this book. Just seeing the history of Cannery Row, and how it has strived since the times of Steinbeck is amazing. I definitely give this book 5 Stars, and a trip to Monterey on anyone's Bucket List."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck's novel paints a picture of Cannery Row: lots of characters, beautiful scenery, that salty sea air, and some ladies of ill repute for good measure. This isn't a deep and life changing book, but I could read it once or twice a week and never get tired of it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Just savor it: \\"During the millennia that frogs and men have lived in the same world, it is probable that men have hunted frogs. And during that time a pattern of hunt and parry has developed. The man with net or bow or lance or gun creeps noiselessly, as he thinks, toward the frog. The pattern requires that the frog sit still, sit very still and wait. The rules of the game require the frog to wait until the final flicker of a second, when the net is descending, when the lance is in the air, when the finger squeezes the trigger, then the frog jumps, plops into the water, swims to the bottom and waits until the man goes away. That is the way it is done, the way it has always been done. Frogs have every right to expect it will always be done that way. Now and then the net is too quick, the lance pierces, the gun flicks and that frog is gone, but it is all fair and in the framework. Frogs don't resent that. But how could they have foreseen the horror that followed? The sudden flashing of lights, the shouting and squealing of men, the rush of feet. Every frog leaped, plopped into the pool, and swam frantically to the bottom. Then into the pool plunged the line of men, stamping, churning, moving in a crazy line up the pool, flinging their feet about. Hysterically the frogs displaced from their placid spots swam ahead of the crazy thrashing feet and the feet came on. Frogs are good swimmers but they haven't much endurance. Down the pool they went until finally they were bunched and crowded against the end. And the feet and wildly plunging bodies followed them. A few frogs lost their heads and floundered among the feet and got through and these were saved. But the majority decided to leave this pool forever, and to find a new home in a new country where this kind of thing didn't happen. A wave of frantic, frustrated frogs, big ones, little ones, brown ones, green ones, men frogs and women frogs, a wave of them broke over the bank, crawled, leaped, scrambled. They clambered up the grass, they clutched at each other, the little ones rode on the big ones. And then--horror on horror--the flashlights found them. Two men gathered them like berries. The line came out of the water and closed in on their rear and gathered them like potatoes. Tens and fifties of them were flung into the gunny sacks, and the sacks filled with tired, frightened, and disillusioned frogs, with dripping, whimpering frogs. Some got away, of course, and some had been saved in the pool. But never in frog history had such an execution taken place. Frogs by the pound, by the fifty pounds. They weren't counted but there must have been six or seven hundred. Then happily Mack tied up the necks of the sacks. They were soaking, dripping wet and the air was cool. They had a short one in the grass before they went back to the house so they wouldn't catch cold.\\""},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"If you read some of Steinbeck's work, you will soon discover that he has some wonderful short stories and some interesting novels, i.e.: his writing is much more extensive than a few good novels. The present work is an novel but it is under 200 pages in length.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" has over ten million copies in print. Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the stories, which are exceptional. In general, his stories are very detailed and descriptive, and it is clear that he had a natural flair or gift for writing.The story dates from 1945 and is primarily the residents of Cannery row in Monterey, California. The street is near the ocean and used to process or can fish. The story is about a resident Mack and a biologist called Doc, both who live on the same street and the interaction between those two and others, including Lee Chong who owns a general store. Doc makes his living by picking up sea creatures from the beach and selling them by mail order. This is not an intensive nor a dramatic story but rather it describes a few weeks in the life of the street. The prose and character descriptions are excellent. The story takes place mostly in the Monterey and Carmel areas, and in an era before commercial development.This is a quick short read and an excellent introduction to Steinbeck. It is among his better works and one of his top selling books. In any case, do not stop with the present work since he has many more great novels including \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" or any one of a few dozen novels and short stories."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck is one of the great literary authors who just so happens to be incredibly fun to read. What makes Steinbeck so good is not simply what he says, but the fact that he can say it simply, clearly, and beautifully. Cannery Row is proof that great writing can also be entertaining.The magic of Steinbeck is his ability to transport the reader, with carefully chosen phrases and well-placed details, to the world he is describing. His words breath life into the past, convincing us absolutely that Cannery Row is not simply a creation of an author's imagination, but a place rooted in a world that is as real as the hopes, dreams, tears, and losses we have all suffered. Steinbeck is one of the most honest writers available, presenting people as they actually are, showing us the beautiful side by side with the bad.But the true delight in this book is the writing. At times the sentences vibrate with an electricity and a poetry all their own, leaping from the mundane to the profound and back again seemingly without effort:\\"Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.\\"Yet this is not simply a book of wonderful descriptions. It contains philosophies both high and low, its truths being as practical as they are lofty:\\"Some one should write an erudite essay on the moral, physical, and esthetic effect of the Model T Ford on the American nation. Two generations of Americans knew more about the Ford coil than the clitoris, about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars.\\"All in all, this is the type of book people should think of when they think of good, solid American literature: it has the brains of a literary novel in the body of a bestselling paperback. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I feel like I've gotten pretty good at not batting an eye at seeing crazy things. I've lived in New York for a few years now and you have to just accept the crazy and move on with your day. But my cynicism is nothing compared to Steinbeck's in Cannery Row.Without so much as a hyphen, he drops in doozies like finding a beautiful dead girl while out on a fishing trip. And he slips in a family that lives in a boiler and rents out pipes so quickly that if you sneeze you'd miss it (you can hear the snores echo at night if you listen closely). Hilarious, scary, and touching moments are all a part of life at Cannery Row, and Steinbeck weaves them in so naturally you need to really pay attention to see the beauty of it all.But maybe that's not cynicism. Maybe that's optimism. To find these moments of hope and heart in your community among the work and strife is truly beautiful. And these moments were my favorite moments of the book.Not to say the rest of the town wasn't also great. Doc is a wonderful character whose pathological lies are the perfect counterbalance to his goodness. Mack's manipulations are only matched by the love for his new puppy. We know Mack's selfish schemes can't end well, but the way they fall apart is a lovely surprise each time. And the language was a beautiful surprise as well.My favorite quotes:They did not measure their joy in goods sold, their egos in bank balances, nor their loves in what they cost...where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them....for a starfish loves to hang onto something and for an hour these had found only each other.No one has studied the psychology of a dying party. It may be raging, howling, boiling, and then a fever sets in and a little silence and then quickly quickly it is gone, the guests go home or go to sleep or wander away to some other affair and they leave a dead body.Who wants to be good if he has to be hungry too?And no one was invited. Everyone was going.You may not be invited to the community you live in, but those who live at Cannery Row choose to participate. They share kindness, hope, distress, and--best of all--a good party."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Raw is a novel about valuing friendship and love above all.

Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, \\"Saints and angels and martyrs and holymen\\" and he would have meant the same thing.\\"-Cannery Row by John SteinbeckI've read Cannery Row perhaps half a dozen times, every time I've relished this uniquely insightful portrayal of a little slice of Americana, the canning district of Monterey, California where the characters are slowly putting together a better world for themselves in the post-depression era. Resourceful yet marginalized characters, good humour, and a degree of violence are my most vivid memories of a book without much of a plot. I last read the novella about 3 years ago but I'd still venture it remains my favourite book to date.I had hoped to acquire it for a friend who isn't much of a reader, as the saying goes: \\"If you don't like to read, you haven't found the right book yet.\\" And I've often though Cannery Row was a good place to start for many a non-reader. Although it was published over 65 years ago, the people and lives thrown together in the book all have echoes of familiarity; most importantly for this target audience however is the fact that the whole thing is artfully packed into just 180 pages and every word matters.(from my wordpress blog Mspeacockescapes)"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This was the first book I have ever read by Steinbeck, which may be shocking considering I am in college and part English major.BUT! It was assigned reading for one of my classes, and I really enjoyed it. The writing and description throughout the novel is beautiful. It really transports you to Steinbeck's Monterey. You get to know the characters and feel the boredom these chracters face that causes them to partake in some absurd activities. It shows you a glimpse at what poverty may be like for some people in some parts of the United States.Having said all of that, the story does not seem to have very much of a plot. It is ALMOST like character sketches and mini stories about them. Many of these small stories never get wrapped up or come to a conclusion. Things happen, comments are made, some lessons are learned and then you're finished. It is enjoyable, but it's almost like you are spending a few days hanging out with some new people and then you just pass on through town with a few stories to tell your friends at home.At least I did not take away any real Earth shattering epiphanies.

Sixty years later we smell the fresh air, relish the wood-and-iron construction of just about everything in sight, appreciate the rarity of television, wallow in the non-existence of computers and yearn for at least a short visit to his pre-nuclear world in which you looked up words in the dictionary and wound your watch to keep it running. In that sense, almost any half-decent novel of the forties benefits from the passing of a half century, but Steinbeck's world is different because it's real, bloody, sweaty, drunk, proud, beautiful, earnest, passionate and jam-packed full of integrity. Steinbeck never turns a blind eye; in fact he takes you inside the bowels of the Malloys' boiler, the perfumed interior of Dora's Bear Flag \\"Restaurant,\\" and the specimen-filled basement of Doc's Western Biological Laboratory. Along the way there are visions and epiphanies, horrors and violence, joys and triumphs. Steinbeck's world is so vivid that you forget that you're reading. You hear the frogs, the Model T, the glug of the whiskey jug and the crashing of the surf. Everyone's life in Cannery Row is tied to Nature: the sardines, the tides, the seasons, the sun and the moon. Without the ocean and the hills, the creeks and ponds, the tide-pools and cliffs, Cannery Row would cease to exist.
