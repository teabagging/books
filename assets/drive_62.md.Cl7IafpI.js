It reflects a wonderful mastery of the subject and a maturity of thought. I was expecting an excellent overview of Zen history, philosophy, and practice. This book is that and much more. Watts takes us back to the roots of Zen through Taoism and Hinduism and brings us up through a tour of Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism on the way to Zen. He also provides the best description of the concept of Maya that I've ever read. The book is mostly scholarly in tone, but there are sporadic flashes of his mystical wit and insights. To me, this is definitely one of his masterworks."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"The author traces the development of Zen through the first four chapters. The reader can thereby gain a perspective about how the practice of Zen is so much influenced by Taoism; how the underlying philosophy can be traced back to the Upanishads; how Mahayana Buddhism derived from the original Buddhism and how it was assimilated in the Far East by the Chinese and Japanese.My overall impression is that Zen differs from other forms of Buddhism mainly in regard to its practice, and also in its emphatic discouragement of metaphysical speculation. Given the human situation - as described by the mythology of the Upanishads - of being alienated in a state of ignorance and impermanence, how does one proceed? As is evident from the spirit of Zen, one cannot proceed by ignoring the journey and strictly focusing on a goal of liberation. That only results in grasping, in egocentric actions that result in further delusion. Likewise, extensive metaphysical speculation only results in being uselessly caught up in the net of duality in space and time. Rather than such self-consious and goal-setting ego pursuits, Zen has promoted ancient Chinese teachings derived from Taoism, which is a way of liberation based on observations of Nature. It has to do with going with the flow, or a letting go of the mind, with an attentive non-grasping view of the world. It has practical implications for all those activities of regular life and is not solely confined to meditation. Intuition is involved here, divination rather than calculation, which brings the subject closer to the object.An interesting approach to this idea of \\"letting go\\" is found in the chapter \\"Sitting Quietly, Doing Nothing\\" concerning the human ability of self-reflection. The author uses the analogy of a machine having a feedback system, in which the machine as an example can be regulated for temperature. To arrive at a steady state, a series of adjustments need to be made. But in the efficient use of the machine, there is always a limit to the amount of adjustments before complexity causes a \\"jittery state\\". Likewise, in human actions excessive self-reflection can result in a kind of paralysis - a going back and forth and not knowing how to proceed - as in the case of human anxiety. To escape anxiety, there has to be a point of letting go. The essential idea is not to eliminate reflection but not to get blocked, not to reflect about reflecting, which means freeing oneself of the excessive demands of the ego, the \\"identification of the mind with its own image of itself\\". But how does one do that? How does one become unblocked? A realization of a paradox appears to be the key here. \\"The simplest cure is to feel free to block, so that one does not block at blocking.\\""},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"It's hard to recommend a specific Watts intro.

My original copy became so well-worn that I recently had to relegate it to archive status and purchase a new working copy. All these years later, this title still remains for me the classic work for Western understanding of Buddhism.I am amazed at the proliferation of books on the subject to be currently found on Amazon.com. Separating the wheat from the chaff can be a daunting challenge. Many interpretations of the Dharma, especially by Western authors, often seem to be tainted by naive New Age idealism on the one hand, or dry pedantry on the other. Although Watts was academically disciplined, reading the text with appropriate reflection can be simultaneously an intellectual and experiential endeavor (although not in the \\"how-to\\" sense). Watts wisely points out, with ample historical support from past Zen masters, that while so-called techniques for enlightenment may serve as transitional supports along the path, they ultimately lead to dead ends.The Way of Zen, despite some rather petty criticisms by pedants and literalists over the years, has survived as one of the most lucid expositions of Zen specifically and Buddhism in general. Highly recommended...still."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"This can be seen as a significant book in the transmission of the dharma to the Western world, even though, or perhaps especially because, it is written by a Westerner. Consistently admired since its first publication in 1957, and reprinted many times, The Way of Zen is that rarest of books, a popular and academic success. You will not read far before seeing why. Watts's style is reasoned and reasonable, clear and authoritative, but without a hint of affectation. Watts knows what he is talking about and to whom he is speaking. Because of his perspective between two worlds, he is, more than almost any other writer on Zen, able to match the ideas of the East to the mind of the West, and in doing so make the broader outlines of Zen as clear as the polished, dustless mirror.The book is divided into two parts, \\"Background and History\\" and Principles and Practice,\\" each with four chapters. There is a bibliography also divided into two parts, the first referring to original sources and second to general works on Zen in European languages. There are 16 pages of Chinese Notes in calligraphy keyed to the text, and an Index.\\"The Way\\" in the title refers to the \\"watercourse way\\" from Taoism, a philosophy to which Zen owes much, as Watts makes clear in the first two chapters, \\"The Philosophy of the Tao\\" and \\"The Origins of Buddhism.\\" The first chapter is one of the best on Taoism that I have ever read, replete with insight and wisdom. Throughout, Watts expresses himself in an infectious style, even in the very scholarly chapters on the history of Buddhism where he traces Zen from its origin in India, through the Buddha under the Po tree, to Ch'an in China, and finally into Japan. Parallels between the unforced, natural way of Taoism and the spontaneity of Zen Buddhism are explored in a most convincing and engaging manner. Along the way we learn a little about Hinduism and Confucianism.The chapters on the principles and practices of Zen, comprising a goodly portion of the book are nothing short of marvelous, full of wit and sly observations, revealing Watts's thorough knowledge of Zen and his deep appreciation. Here are some examples of Watts at work:Referring obliquely to the rise of communism (a word he never uses in the book) he writes, \\"When the throne of the Absolute is left vacant, the relative usurps it...\\" (p. 11) Perhaps Watts is also indicating why he believes that humanism is not a complete answer.On the cosmology of the Tao: \\"...the natural universe works mainly according to the principles of growth...If the universe were made, there would of course be someone who knows &lt;how> it is made...\\" He adds, \\"...the Tao does not &lt;know> how it produces the universe...\\" (pp. 16-17)\\"Since opposed principles, or ideologies, are irreconcilable, wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation. But wars fought for simple greed will be far less destructive, because the aggressor will be careful not to destroy what he is fighting to capture.\\" (pp. 29-30)\\"Hindu philosophy has not made the mistake of imagining that one can make an informative, factual, and positive statement about the ultimate reality.\\" (p, 34)\\"Buddhism has frequently compared the course of time to the apparent motion of a wave, wherein the actual water only moves up and down, creating the illusion of a of water moving over the surface. It is a similar illusion that there is a constant &lt;self> moving through successive experiences, constituting a link between them in such a way that the youth becomes the man who becomes the graybeard who becomes the corpse.\\" (p. 123)In his exploration of koans used by the Rinzai School of Zen, it becomes clear that one of the purposes of the koan is to put doubt into the mind of the young aspirant that he knows anything at all. From that redoubtable position, real learning can begin. I was reminded of a saying attributed to baseball's Earl Weaver, the very successful manager of the Baltimore Orioles in their glory years: \\"It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.\\"Here is a story from the Ch'uan Teng Lu, told by Watts about \\"a fascinating encounter between Tao-hsin and the sage Fa-yung, who lived in a lonely temple on Mount Niu-t'ou, and was so holy that the birds used to bring him offerings of flowers. As the two men were talking, a wild animal roared close by, and Tao-hsin jumped. Fa-yung commented, --referring, of course, to the instinctive (klesa) of fright. Shortly afterwards, while he was for a moment unobserved, Tao-hsin wrote the Chinese character for on the rock where Fa-yung was accustomed to sit. When Fa-yung returned to sit down again, he saw the sacred name and hesitated to sit. said Tao-hsin, At this remark Fa-yung was fully awakened...and the birds never brought any more flowers.\\" (pp. 89-90).While this is an excellent introduction to Zen--and more--for the educated person, it is especially a delight for those of you who have already read a few books on Zen. There is no other book that I know of that goes as deeply into Zen as agreeably as does The Way of Zen.--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\""},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"Generally speaking, Watts doesn't appeal to new-age crystal fairies, channelers, and so forth, and if you prefer your Zen texts all poetical and mysterious, then this book isn't for you; but if you want a treatment of Zen as an important, credible and viable philosophical tradition, then you'll like this book. It's not an easy read, but this is good, solid, hardheaded Watts."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"Scan the &quot;Eastern Philosophy&quot; racks at your local bookstoreand you'll see the problem--books with titles like &quot;The Taoof Love and Relationships&quot; or &quot;The Zen of CareerAdvancement.&quot; Much of the literature on eastern philosophywritten by westerners is distorted as it is re-focusedthrough the prism (&quot;prison,&quot; some would argue) of westernthought and language.Alan Watts appreciates and addresses these difficulties inThe Way of Zen, an excellent introduction to the ZenBuddhism. Watts explores Zen's historical background,tracing it from Buddhism's migration from India to China,where it absorbed elements of Confucian and Taoist thought,to its final development in Japan. The second half of thebook describes Zen's underlying principles and itspractices, such as the absence of &quot;self&quot; and the futilityof purpose.Rich in scholarly detail, yet accessible to the lay reader,The Way of Zen, is remarkable in its lucidity. Watts usesanalogies and allusions culled from daily life toillustrate Zen principles and does much to clear up westernmisconceptions about Zen thought. He also warns of thedifficulties many westerners face trying to understand Zen.With the English language's clear separation between theobserver and the observed, the action and the actor and itsrigid division of time into past, present and future, Zenthought often strikes westerners as mystical or moronic.While Watts may champion Zen, he never stoops to merecheer-leading.

In this book, you'll learn where Zen came from. It has its origins in India, where Buddhism was created, and then became as fresh as a gust of wind on its way through China and Chinese Taoism. Zen reached its full fruition after it arrived in Japan.The book is separated into two sections. The first tells the history of Zen. The second describes the practice of Zen. But all the while, Watts opens your mind and you get the real FEEL of Zen. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I can tell you that Watts' way of writing works: It will change the way you look at the world. This book is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"I usually prefer to download lectures by Alan watts rather than read his books, some ofwhich seemed to just ramble along. I am not really good at critiques, but I really enjoyedthis book. Easy to read. Some concepts are so foreign to my common sense way ofthinking that it sort of turns my thinking inside-out. The idea makes sense. I cannot findfault with it. But regrettably, my mind snaps back to its usual way of thinking.For example: We tend to think of our self as an independent being inside of a separateworld. But actually there exists no separate being or outside world. The two are oppositeends of a spectrum and reality exists only between the two ends. Sort of seems to be themain point. That who you think you are is a mental construction, sort of a caricature ofitself. your true self is the entire world. One of my favorite sayings is \\"everywhere is thecenter.\\" Everywhere is everything. you are everything. I am everything and so is mycomputer. Our minds create symbols to stand for parts of the world and then we start tothink that the world is made of parts. It seems that liberation comes from dying to yoursense of self. from ceasing trying to grasp at life as though it were something \\"other\\" thatcould be grasped.I can remember some magical times in my life when instead of me acting in the world, Ilet the world take me by the hand and everything just clicked. I find these thingsfascinating, but for some reason impossible to share.There are some Zen stories which I can't seem to make any sense of, and I dunno, maybethe point is to watch your mind try to make sense of it. I really am running off at themouth now. Oh well. Have you ever been in pain and then stopped to think, am I reallyfeeling constant pain IN THIS MOMENT? And no, you weren't in this particularmoment. It was an idea that you were carrying along perhaps from one moment of pain toanother. in Zen liberation also means liberation from the idea that there exists someconstant unchanging self that some how is carried from one moment to the next to affector be affected by the world. There really is no cause and effect. One just follows the otherlike spring following winter. And the burning log does not BECOME the ashes, becauselike the previous example there is no \\"stuff\\" which was the wood and then is the ashes.First there is wood and then there are ashes.I guess zen is a method to get you to stop dreaming and wake up."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"From the get go, the book was amazing. The first two chapters that talked a lot about differences in Western vs. Eastern thought and language structures were big eye openers. There were a number of profound moments reading the book, such as when he noted contemplating what happens to us after death is like wondering what happens to your fist when you open you hand or what happens to your lap when you stand up. The writing style of the book is highly approachable, I myself a graduate engineering student found it very readible, Watts doesn't try to blow the reader away with his academic prowess but rather keeps it simple and direct, like zen itself."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"It is unfortunate in my view that the word Zen gets attached to the most frivolous things. You see books with titles such as &quot;The Zen of Motorcycle Repair&quot; or &quot;The Zen of Making Big Fat Wads of Cash&quot;. As Lao Tzu says, &quot;Those who speak do not know; those who know do not speak&quot;. With that in mind, it's clear that the modern fad of Zen-everything is not really the way of Zen. Which raises the question - what is the way of Zen? Alan Watts recognises the difficulty in explaining the concept of Zen to the West, and freely admits he's not the world's foremost expert on the subject. However humble he may have been, Watts certainly seems to know what he's talking about. &quot;The Way of Zen&quot; traces the origins of this non-religion/philosophy/ideology from ancient China and India, to its uptake in the rest of Asia (notably Japan). There's even a few chapters on Zen in the Arts, discussing the idea of haiku and how it aspires to be Zen-in-motion. Watts is lucid in his approach, and always takes the time to explain even the most perplexing concepts. Overall if you want to get one step closer to understanding the inscrutable Zen, let Watts enlighten you (pun intended)."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"So, what is a southern Christian man doing with a book about a Buddhist belief system? Well, I needed some perspective. The Christian teaching that is most familiar to me is that which says, \\"Do your best. Work hard. Don't quit trying.\\" Only, I took this to the extreme. With new ideas coming into my head at a rapid pace I struggled to write them down and struggled even more to put them into action. I know I should be developing my ideas to be published, drawing the picture I have in my head, or even becoming a more proficient cyclist, but when I don't have the time, I get frustrated. The result? A car spinning its tires. \\"Why haven't I written that yet? Why haven't I learned to paint? Why haven't I competed in a bike race?!\\" All of these things are goals that I wanted to complete last week not next year. I knew Zen was a way I could learn to be more passive in my thought processes so I read it.Zen does not look at life as something to be built like a house or attained like a graduate degree, but rather it looks at life as a flower that grows from a tiny seed. This was what I needed to hear. Instead of running and pursuing things now, I let them happen through my daily practices of writing, sketching, and cycling. Growth, inspiration, and achievement happen over time. I also wanted to read this book with my Christian glasses on.

This work presents Zen as a specific historical hybrid of two similar cultural trajectories (Buddhism and Taoism). It is scholarly (including Chinese notes of the specific technical words/ideas and important passages and quotes) which allows Watts to be both an advocate for and a critic of this system of thought - at once shows the usefulness and also the contradictions inherent in Zen as a system or practice. It is never about finding a \\"new\\" system but about learning how to see one's own system as a construct that smooths over the randomness with the semblance of coherent consistency."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"There are several excellent (informative) reviews of The Way of Zen, and I won't try to duplicate them here. In my review I will briefly summarize the book, and say something about Watts' remarkable erudition.PART I: BACKGROUND AND HISTORYChapter 1: The Way of Tao. I am well-versed in philosophical Taoism so there is little new in this chapter for me, but the chapter is a fine introduction to the topic.Chapter 2: The Origins of Buddhism. This is my least favorite chapter, not because it is inferior in any way, but because the topic does not really interest me. At least not now. The chapter is notable in that it is here that Watts first mentions cybernetics (p. 48), with an example that illuminates both the Buddhist principle (avidya) and the cybernetic principle (illusion of control). There is more cybernetics to come.Chapter 3: Mahayana Buddhism. This is better, mainly because in this chapter Watts extends my understanding of Taoism (e.g., ziran) and Zen (e.g., tathata). Interesting.Chapter 4: The Rise and Development of Zen. All four of the history chapters are excellent, but this is the one that has the most to offer me, in terms of my interests and background. It is a very personal history, based on the stories of the Zen founders (e.g., Hui-neng), which I enjoyed greatly. It is also helpful to see how the various \\"flavors\\" of Zen developed, which seems to be a common characteristic of the great spiritual traditions.PART II: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICESChapter 1: \\"Empty and Marvelous\\" Here Watts takes up a basic principle of both Taoism and Zen: the power of empty space. Ames and Hall, translators of the Daodejing, address this basic principle by means of the \\"wu-forms\\" (wuwei, wushi, etc.) In Zen, this principle manifests itself as \\"suchness\\" - forget the words, just \\"point.\\" This chapter did much to enhance my understanding of this crucially important principle.Chapter 2: \\"Sitting Quietly, Doing Nothing\\" This is the chapter that quite literally \\"blew me away\\" In this chapter Watts demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of cybernetic principles, and interprets the practice of zazen in terms of these principles. Watts describes how the practice of \\"sitting quietly, doing nothing\\" helps dissolve the dualities of the Western mind (and, apparently, the Eastern mind as well!). Based on other books I have read by Alan Watts, I expected a sophisticated treatment of Zen (and I am not disappointed), but I was totally surprised to see an equally sophisticated treatment of cybernetic principles, and how they apply to Zen practice. In this regard, The Way of Zen anticipates Douglas Flemons' excellent book, Completing Distinctions, by almost forty years. In my copy of The Way of Zen, on the last page of this chapter, is written the note \\"An astonishing chapter.\\" Wow.Chapter 3: Za-zen and the Koan. Following Chapter 2, which is electric, this chapter is a bit of a let down. However, it is well written, as with the others, and I did appreciate a better understanding of these two Zen practices, and the role they play in Zen teaching.Chapter 4: Zen in the Arts. Another great chapter. As a consequence of reading this chapter, I now understand the purpose and practice of Zen poetry. And as a consequence of this new understanding, I am writing my own Haikus ... almost one every day. Sweet!The Way of Zen is a must read, although I am sure, like any great book, every reader will meet the book in a different place, in a different way. After reading Watts' Way of Zen, I recommend reading Philip Kapleau's Three Pillars of Zen: Teaching, Practice, and Enlightenment. It corrects some minor errors in Watts' book, and is a sensible next step in one's exploration of Zen."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"This is good stuff. I like this man's style. A little history then a little doctrine. If you have no exposure to Zen then I highly recommend this. This is not something that is meant to be read through all novel like.

It is inimitable Alan Watts material. The good thing about Alan was his ability to debunk the posturing which often passes for spirituality. He made the important point that trying to justify oneself - through Zen, is un-zenlike and therefore, technically stupid.However, when it comes to practical details, this text is a trifle misleading. Somewhere in its pages, Alan categorically stated that T'ang dynasty Zen monks did not practice Za-zen, as found in Zen temples today - declaring it to be an adjunct of the Sung Confucian education system, incorporated into Japanese temple life. Though the resources at Watts' disposal were somewhat limited - when this text was first written, at least two extant translations (e.g.@Huang Po's 'Discourses' and Hui Hai's 'Treatise on Sudden Awakening') made it clear that - for Zen monks of the Tang dynasty, Za-zen was a regular part of their spiritual life. What we do find stated, in such sources, is a reminder not to take still immobility as the right state or end of the practice. Whether training in the Rinzai or the Soto tradition, few Westerners practicing Zen today will doubt that Za-zen is an essential part of the practice. If you want a readable, general introduction to Far-eastern thought - this is a good place to begin. It is best, perhaps, for its discussion of Zen in the context of Far-eastern art.

The words they use and the edicts they put forth to do this, by their very nature separate us from the \\"Ground of Being.\\" They seem to forget that neither the symbols they use, nor the practice they offer, are in fact, the actual process of the Universe itself. And thus religious teaching, as I have known it, separates us (instead of uniting us), from the \\"All\\" in the very act of trying to teach us what it is; and trying to bring us to it.Only Zen seems to recognise this. Zen focuses us on what exactly separates us from the \\"First Principle.\\" It has also been said that even many teachers of Zen, have lost their way.Watts' book is unique because it addresses the problems relating to this intersection between the awakened and the un-awakened human being, with an unusual completeness in its single small volume. Many, many books have been written about this issue, but none that I have ever read are so direct, so readable and so complete. Watts holds the magnifying glass over the problem for any student of \\"Sudden Illumination,\\" or what is also known as \\"Satori.\\" It is, I think, the great work to be read in this area; for the undoing of \\"Eastern Mystification.\\"If Watts' book is the magnifying glass, then for the very, very serious student of, \\"Awakening,\\" Hubert Benoit's book, \\"The Supreme Doctrine\\" (also available on this web site)is the final microscope. It is not for the faint of heart, being very difficult to study, but I have found that these two books together are priceless in what they bring to this area of \\"Final Awakening.\\"Paul Vereshack, B.A., M.D., D.Psych"},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"I accidentaly found an old copy of this book.

Although academically excellent, the author's insights are lost as the narrator jumps from topic to topic, speaking as quickly as he can and bombarding the listener with concept after concept. (This seems so odd and out of place for a work on Zen). It is like trying to drink from a cup while someone is tipping the other end.

Easy to read, and some real nuggets amongst what is not a very good depiction of zen. Read Dogen instead, since there are now translations widely available. Watts is lucid, but misses the mark as much as he hits it when it comes to Buddhism."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"Everyone is so enthusiastic about this book; I hate to be the wet blanket. Alan Watts is hard not to like, writes attractively and gets full marks for pioneering Taoism, Vedanta and Zen in the West. As a light popular history of Buddhism I don't find much to quarrel with: I'm not aware of too many alternatives.Watts' own philosophy was expressed in \\"The Book (on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are.)\\" Pairs of contraries such as light/dark, form/space, self/other, being/non-being, are not enemies but complementaries necessary to each other. Live joyously, with the wisdom and serenity that come from understanding that everything passes, that we are masks the Universe puts on briefly. As a philosophy of life I rate this highly, but it isn't Zen.In fact Alan Watts was badly wrong about Zen and he created a durable and harmful misconception. He never practised intensively and was acidic about long periods spent \\"sitting on your (behind)\\". He saw the regimentation and hours of meditation in Japanese monasteries as the antithesis of carefree Zen, and he misconstrued Chinese Masters or quoted them out of context to prove his point. Back then, he was sure, the Master would just gently explain the contents of \\"The Book\\" to his disciple.This is all so far astray. Chinese Zen monks lived most un-carefree lives: long hours of meditation, long hours of labour, inadequate food and sleep. Zen is not about going with the flow and doin' what comes naturally, rather about uncovering our true Unconditioned nature hidden beneath layers of habit and conditioning. Prolonged meditation happens to be the best way of doing this. Intense effort must be combined with relaxed detachment.He drops a few clangers, like interpreting the saying that the Zen Master can \\"snatch away the hungry man's food, drive away the farmer's ox,\\" to mean that the Master is Above Good and Evil. But this is a technical term: it means to rob the student of comforting conceptions and rationalisations, to create a state of helpless bafflement in which true understanding can arise...Much to enjoy here, then, but also much that's misleading."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"Zen is one of those things that defies description but which people want to describe anyway. Alan Watts is such a brilliant writer/teacher that he actually succeeds. In addition to an excellent discussion of the eastern theological traditions which gave rise to Zen Buddhism, he discusses Zen concepts in such a way that they make sense. But don't make sense, if you know what I mean.I am not a believer in reading about Zen, but this is one book that I recommend to anyone who is interested in Zen practice. Using prose that sets a new standard for elegance and simplicity, Watts will lead you down a lovely pathway, explaining just enough as you go along to help you appreciate what you are exploring. The book also makes a great reference, if you want to have just one title in your library about Zen."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"There are no words to express how important this book is.

This book, like the Zen it describes, cannot easily be categorized.I think the reason this book is so difficult to read is because Watts is so honest.

In the arena of Zen, I can only describe this as the difference between fire and ice. When you hear Alan speak, most erudite, it's fire, when you hear the narrator speak... ice... the narrator lacks any effect, and leaves you listless... not able to listen to the message.

I'm agnostic/atheistic yet very spiritual.This review is being written by someone with an M.S. in Education ,and skeptical of so-called mysticism .This book is for the most part right to the point ,avoiding polysyllabic pretentiousness and vague notions. Mr. Watts made it simple to understand a compassionate way of life that helps individuals to balance emotions and gain control over them. He takes on the false notion of reincarnation which has no place at all in Zen,Tao or original Buddhism. He shows that mortality is a reason for enjoying simple pleasures. We are not only individuals but social beings. I aim for a life that is less egocentric,balancing emotions through meditation. Alan Watts is highly responsible for making Zen concepts available to the Western world.He died yet his ideas carried on. The reader must however must eventualy close the book ,learn meditation and practice it. The notion that it is Japanese or Chinese or Indian are nonsense.

And this with the hope of coming to the ' Truth'. I remember Watts book on Zen as clear and appealing if never wholly convincing. And this not because of any defect in Watts but because the fundamental thrust of Zen is different as I understand it from what I as a Jewish religious believer fundamentally understand.Zen does not speak or think about a personal God. It does not speak or think about the Covenant or meeting between God and Man .It has no conception of this kind of personal revelation.In opposite it seems to be teaching us not to look ' for this kind of thing' And to somehow leave aside the individual private and the collective communal selves and flow into the world of Nature and Being indistinguishable. And even this last phrase is probably wrong for Zen since the speaking about it in this way is again ' categorizing' and ' humanizing' . Zen as I sense Watts presents it wants us to free ourselves from these kinds of aspirations and find our way to an enlightentment which once it is called that is not enlightenment either.\\"When you say it's the wrong way, and when you don't say you don't say , so the way the real way is to say and not say, to not say and say , to not say and not say , to say and say- everyday.\\"The Jewish way is of course to pray three times a day in the very same words other Jews elsewhere and all generations of Jews have prayed\\"I am sorry.

However, for me, I guess it was just the wrong book at the wrong time. I found it to be way too dry.... dare I say a bit boring, and I thought it sucked some of the fun and the life out of the subject matter. When you spend countless pages trying to logically explain how the universe can be looked at as a unified whole, it's just taking things a bit too far. Now, I guess that since this book is geared toward the logical Western mind, it makes sense to focus on logical arguments, I just felt that this book was overwrought intellectually, without enough consideration paid to the intuitive side of things. I would have rather had a bit more left to the imagination, especially given the subject matter.At the same time, I recognize that this is meant as an academic work, so I guess it doesn't make sense to expect the tone to be more juicy. And, to be fair, I stopped reading about halfway through, so take my review with a grain of salt.

It provides us a nice historical overview of the evolution of this type of consciousness and explains the main messages of various &quot;Eastern&quot; schools of thought in a way that most of us Western minds can comprehend. Because of this, I use this as a book as one of the texts in my class of Eastern philosophy. Another book I use for this class is a book called &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato.

But as you are taken through Zen's conception, birth, growth, and finally into the arts - you will notice that: &quot;this ain't just literature.&quot; I have adored Alan's style of writing for over 25 years now, and I must say that this is one his best books, and surely the best ever writen on the subject ( with the one possible exception of D.T. Susuki's writings.) However, I have always found Watts to be more enjoyable, because he understands the western mind and the complications we will inevitably encounter while trying to understand something so completely Chinese as Zen. As you read, you will notice an intimacy develope between author and reader, master and student, or master and master. This book is not only for the serious student of Zen, but for anyone who enjoys eastern thought and &quot;mysticism.&quot;"},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"This book does a great job of covering the history and development of Zen, and its various divisions. It tells the chronological story of the people and places that shaped Zen into what it is today.It is very specific, using the original names of various people, places, concepts, and sects of Zen. There are hundreds of words you will encounter that you've never heard of, you will hope to retain due to intrigue, but will ultimately forget because you are not Rain Man (at least I'm no Kim Peak).Interspersed into the rich history of Zen is a large amount of what Alan Watts is known for: profound, rich, yet simple, insight.I found this book to be of use for both a history lesson and spiritual growth. Perhaps more a history lesson than a genuine spiritual guide."},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"I read this book in 1983 and still consider it one of the most important books I've read.

Part I is history and Part 2 contains Zen principles and practice. This book is perfect for any\\"one\\" who is interested in Zen but is not quite sure they want to buy a Zen book that is 1000 pages long. This book is highly condensed and very easy to read and understand. The history of Buddhism is exceptionally well done since the key to understanding Zen is to understand the evolution of Buddhism. The key to understanding Chinese culture as well as their language is to understand the \\"I Ching\\" or mental power and \\"The Tao\\" or intuition/suchness/naturalness. The Tao is the opposite of \\"Confucianism\\" or logic.Buddha \\"the enlightened one\\" History covers the spread and evolution of this \\"thought system\\" from India to China to Japan.Early \\"Indian\\" Buddhism is a lengthy path to non-duality and can take many lives.Zen Buddhism is the direct path and can be \\"experienced\\" now; which is why it is so difficult for westerners to understand what Zen is. Ask a Zen Master a question and the answer will not make sense. The Zen Master points to the non dual answer which can seem like madness to us who dwell in the Hell of a dual world.A Zen Buddhist Master sees no contrast, no division, no symbols, no past and no future. The Zen Buddha only sees the NOW since everything else is an illusion. The Zen Buddha generates no karma......no bad karma AND no Good karma.......no inner world and no outer world. The Zen Buddha has balanced the mind. Once the mind is balanced, Reality is experienced. From the source of this eastern thought system, every\\"thing\\" is experienced as ONE. One Mind.Any attempt to \\"grasp\\" the Mind is an attempt to \\"cling\\" to the ego and is doomed to frustration.From the Lankavatara Sutra: For the Mind \\"is beyond all philosophical views, is apart from discrimination, it is not attainable, nor is it ever born: I say there is nothing but Mind. it is not existence and non-existence; it is indeed beyond existence and non-existence...Out of Mind spring innumerable things, conditioned by discrimination (i.e., classification) and habit energy; these things people accept as the external world.... What appears to be external does not exist in reality; it is Mind that is seen in multiplicity; the body, property and abode-all these, I say, are nothing but Mind.\\"While my goal in reading this book was to learn what is Zen. While this book contains no Zen or Buddha exercises, I did experience a glimpse of reality. While reading about the pure non-dualistic thought system of \\"The Tao\\", I was for a brief moment able to reach the state of non-dualistic reality and did not mediate to achieve it. It happened spontaneously. The best \\"I\\" can describe in words is that it was like looking out of a window for the first time.From the Zen Master Lien-teng Hui-yao, \\"Only when you have no thing in your mind and no mind in things are you vacant and spiritual, empty and marvelous.\\""},{"Title":"The way of Zen (Pelican books)","review":"I happen to read this book in the 70s. At the time I was reading Thomas Merton, and others talking a lot about 'contemplation' and the Catholic Mystical Tradition with a sprinkling of 'Eastern Mysticism'. So, I picked up this title, for various reasons, thinking it would be of helpful. I'd read most of Watts' books on Christianity (many of which included discussions of eastern philosophy). What a surprise! Turned out those Zen folks not only knew something about the tough questions relating to contemplation, they had such great experience at these matters and had come up with such unique ways of expressing it that it had become an art form for them. (The appreciation of this uniqueness has since worn off for reasons mentioned in some other reviews.) One reviewer also mentioned the legend of the 4th Patriarchs meeting with Fa-yung. When I first read that it was stunning! I've never forgot it and still refer to it to this day. It was here that I first met the Grand Masters of Chan, Bodhidharma, Huang Po and Zen had its madmen and poets, painters and potters, it was fascinating. Did I mention the historical perspective that forms the first part of the book? One last very important point. I had never encountered humor in my limited religious experience until I read about the Zen folks who, it seemed to me at the time, had the most hilarious answers to some of the most profound questions. I've never forgot that either. (Unfortunately, those answers don't strike people today as humorous, but seem more threatening to them. I wonder why that is...?) There may be some flaws in this book as some have suggested but I am willing to bet it will continue to be the best introduction to Zen for many years.

I'm glad to find it here because I'm seriously thinking of buying her a replacement. It's got cake batter and food particles from all sorts of recipes on it. The one recipe she always uses in it that caused me to go looking for it online tonight because she thought it got tossed out (after 46 YEARS PEOPLE!?!) is the Buttercream Frosting recipe. It's an easy one. But like a token of past meals eaten, she HAS to have this recipe book open to tthe Buttercream Frosting page. I don't think she actually looks at it but she HAS to have it.The cover is hard, it's wire bound in only the way books were bound back then. The pictures are classic 1960's images, drawn before women really had jobs that required them to not be in the house all day. It's a relic from my childhood. It's a comfort. I got taught how to cook using this book (with others of course). You'll enjoy it if you like to read cook books for sh!ts and giggles. Really it's that good."},{"Title":"Slaves and Slavery in Ancient Rome","review":"To begin, this is not a \\"book\\" on slaves and slavery in Ancient Rome but rather a compilation of sources regarding that matter. This appears to be a textbook or a teaching aid of some sort for those \\"students\\" interested in Roman slave revolts. In the beginning, the author examines two Sicilian Slave Revolts: one from 136-132 B.C., and the second one from 104-100 B.C. Doctor Yavetz also brings up two Roman Wars: the War against Aristonicus, and the War against Spartacus. His last section deals with the debates and issues on the study of slaves and slavery itself.The first slave revolt in Sicily was the result of abuse and torture. Led by two slaves, Antiochus and Achaois, they were able to spread terror into the Sicilian countryside for four years before being put down by the Roman army. The second revolt also lasted four years but was under completely different circumstances. The Roman government freed hundreds of Bithynian slaves to help their old friend, King Nicomedes of Bithynia. After stopping this action because of a slave owner outcry, Sicilian slaves became restless and decided to revolt. In the end, over 30,000 slaves had to be killed by the Roman army in order to stop the rebellion. The wars against Aristonicus and Spartacus, both who had recruited a large following of slaves, were successful Roman victories against attempts to gain the crown.The author's last section on slavery debates and issues focuses on scholarly attempts to undermine the importance of these slave revolts from 140 B.C. to 70 B.C. The author questions why historians believe these revolts have little significance. Doctor Yavetz asks the reader to examine if any two of the slave revolts in the Roman Empire were related? Was there a pattern for slave revolts to follow? Does the War against Aristonicus and the Sicilian Slave Revolt have anything in common? Rather than answering his own questions, Dr. Yavetz lets other scholars do the work. He inserts passages from other texts regarding slave revolts in Rome and so gives their perspective on the outcome. Overall, this book is merely a stepping-stone to larger works that answer the questions referring to Roman slavery."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"This is a well-structured and well-written text with refreshing examples from a wide range of designers. These examples reinforce the concept that successful design and typography come from critical thinking and that there is no one style or approach that is \\"correct.\\"I plan to require this book in the undergraduate typography class I teach, but because it is accessible even to a novice, I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in type. One of the strengths of the book is its succinctness, but that may be one flaw as well. When a book is so well done, you want more... (Fortunately there is a website which does have supporting materials for those who want more.) Also if you want a meaty book on the specifics of type, then you should also get Robert Bringhurst's phenomenal book \\"The Elements of Typographic Style.\\" It pairs so well with the overview and examples from Lupton's book.It is a terrific value and well-produced."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"Personally, this has probably been the most influental design book that I own. I felt like I was a better designer after having read half of it, without once touching my mac. i just knew that what I had absorbed was going to come out in my work, and it did. The book takes an overview look at design, and speaks in plain english about many things that I've heard or dealt with. But catagorizes stuff and explains things in a fluid manner so that the different bits of information come together and make sense. It is good for the novice and the struggling self taught. Full of great examples. It's too elementary for the serious designer. But for someone who did not go to Design School, but now works with design, its the perfect basic \\"education in a book\\"."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"This book and some of the other books from the Design Briefs series, have become an integral part of my working resource library. Ellen Lupton's book has been one that I have used over and over again. I often reference it when I am faced with a blank page that I am having a hard time laying out.The section on typography, the largest section of the book, was a very interesting read. I enjoyed learning about the history of printing and typography. Beginning designers will appreciate the categorizing of typefaces. This leads into the discussion of electronic typesetting and the limitations and challenges that has created for designers.Lupton's book shed a lot of light on different strategies for organizing type, graphics, and pictures on my own layouts. Unlike many other books on graphic design, Lupton's book was down-to-earth and was easy for a non-designer (like myself) to understand. It used some meaningful practical examples, instead of relying on art school projects that have limited real-life applications.The section on grids was one of the most easy to understand that I have ever come across. It also gave many examples of grids that can be incorporated for page layout. Lupton also gave a decent low-level overview on the golden section, but she did not give enough of examples of how the golden section can be used as a more flexible grid.One of my favourite parts of her book is the section on proofreading where she has one of the best proofreader's marking charts that I have ever seen. I have used this resource on complex projects like annual reports with agency graphic designers. No more second-guessing edits, Lupton's list captures it all. In fact, a lot of the designers and account reps who have used it with me consider it to be a time (and money) saver.This book is probably too basic for seasoned designers, but if you just bought a copy of InDesign, or you're working in a corporate communications department and expected to create some basic layouts, you will take away a lot of good ideas and principles from this book. It covers off on many of the principles of good design without leaving you feeling overwhelmed."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"As the author of Looking Good in Print: A Guide to Basic Design for Desktop Publishing, I approach design and type books with high expectations.I judge books on not only the amount of information they communicate, but also the accessibility of the information, the clarity of the visuals, the design of the pages, and--last, but not least--the price.Ellen Luppon's Thinking With Type scores well on all standards. It's also one of the few books that has important things to say about online type.At its remably low price, you can't buy a more useful book for learning from the past and setting computer-based type on the basis of what others have done previously."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"This book is possibly the best design education text I've seen. Everything is kept simple, and clear. Ellen Lupton's categorizing of typeface styles, for example, is logical and all inclusive, yet still a simple breakdown of the vast variety of typefaces.

This book will serve you well."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"I got this book because it's a requirement for my Typography class. I enjoy reading it greatly and I've learned many things from it. I think it's an excellent read if you're just interested in typography even if you're not interested in type setting (the book is filled with interesting facts).The only reason I gave it four stars is because the book is meant to be a typography class book and I feel it's a bit too vague for that. I think you'll learn MANY things from this book, but you'll still need to get nother one to fill in the gaps. But as an introductory book I think it's awesome (I also got Stop Stealing Sheep and Learn how Type Works, which is also an introductory book, they are pretty much at the same level of depth)."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"I was inspired by some of the samples of type usage in the book from the first few pages. Ellen Lupton, the author of \\"Design Culture Now\\", came up with a book to fill a void where it was much needed. It is hard not to encounter useful elements in it to both, help you enhance existing designs or tackle new territory.The only downside of the book, and the reason I give it 4.5 and not 5 stars, is that the layout doesn't make it particularly easy to read and follow. Therefore it ends up being a book that you resort to for visual not textual queues of where you are, and for ideas rather than specific content. At least it was that way for me. Still, the number of visual ideas it carries makes it worth your while."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"this is a great little book with some good insights and interesting view points written in an easy to understand manner. i would call this more of a brief history of design/printed type than really a stand-alone piece, its more of a gloss-over to give you a good starting point to look into other more in-depth books.i definitely recommend it, but dont expect it to answer much on its own."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"This book is a must for designers or anyone else who works with type.

I was so looking forward to learning about such details as when to prefer a sans-serif versus a serif in certain situations, how people react to various different families of faces, prescriptions for when to apply different types of layouts, and so forth.When I got was a partially complete history lesson on how different types of faces and families evolved, an introduction to grid layouts with very little prescriptive advice, and weirdly, a brief editorial primer teaching how to mark up the printed page with pen.To its credit, the book is full of examples of layouts. As I read, I expected any minute I'd penetrate the entry level \\"Here we see an example of a layout\\" to the real meat, but it never ever happened.To the author's credit, the book was meticulously assembled and was clearly the product of a great deal of effort. And, this is not the first design-related book I've discovered that lacked meaningful depth.But to any practicing designer looking for some guidance for taking their use of type to the next level, or understanding beyond his own innate instincts when to apply certain techniques, this is not the book for you.

It uses different fonts and colors and layout to tell you about different fonts and colors and layout. Even the example text is about itself, and not Lorem Ipsum or some such (for example, \\"This is Helvetica 9 point\\" written in Helvetica 9 point).This is about as meta as you can get, a work of reflexive modern art if you will. ThinkGodel, Lupton, Bach? But it advertises itself as A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers and Editors, which it surely, emphatically, is not. I learned more from the first few pages ofParker's Looking Good in Print-- a fine book every one of whose commandments Lupton manages to violate -- than from this opus of navel-gazing.A few concrete things wrong with it: well, the obvious one is that since every design element in this book exists to show itself, the book as a whole is extremely difficult to read. This is exacerbated by bad Index and Table of Contents... the only reason they exist is because they should (sum ergo sum). The fancy rendering of chapters (of which there are three, yes three; moreover they have monosyllabic titles) and sections add to this weird where-am-I-in-the-text effect.At a graphic design contest level, this might be interesting, but at a \\"critical guide\\" level, it is criminal -- worse than type crime. This book suffers from the unpardonable crime of overdesign at any macroscopic level you'd care to think about. Moreover, it simply lacks substance. If a tenth of the time spent typesetting this book had been allocated to actual content, it could have turned out all right. As such, it is full of gloss and color, signifying nothing."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"This book does not accomplish what it sets out to be, according to the subtitle, \\"A critical guide for designers, writers, editors & students\\". It has some interesting examples of unusual designs and has some value for designers of, for example, brochures or advertisements. But the book has limited value for the remaining targeted audience, as far too much of the book is devoted to oddities and strange designs that a writer, editor or student should NEVER even think of using.The majority of the examples of text settings in the book are unreadable for more than a few lines. No writer who actually wants his or her work to be read should ever want to have the text set in one of these designs.There are some useful guides on matters such as leading and tracking, but these are lost in the overall jumble. The book merits two stars only because of designers might find it useful. All others should avoid the book."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"To quote Ellen Lupton: \\"There is no playbook that assigns fixed meaning or function every typeface; each designer must confront the library of possibilities in light of a project's unique circumstance.\\" Unfortunately, this seem to be true, and this book is no such playbook.

In steering projects toward visual solutions that deliver clear messages, we have to look at the very building blocks of design. Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students aims to get at the heart of this issue. If the cover seems familiar it might be because I mentioned this book before in my article Gifts for Graphic Designers: A Wish List, but it's time for a more thorough review. The book's aim is to be as practical as possible while providing a logical and historical foundation. It's a field guide for professionals to deal with type. This book comes from Ellen Lupton, a professor at my home state's Maryland Institute College of Art.Choosing type isn't just about whim or feeling. This book deconstructs type into basic elements helping you make informed design decisions. The book is divided into three sections: Letter, Text and Grid plus an appendix of definitions, hints and warnings. History is weaved between practical information in a way that is more narrative and entertaining than the typically dry text book lesson. In one moment you're reading about the purpose of body text; the author switches abruptly into the history of written manuscripts. In a short few paragraphs we're in the digital age of dynamic text. In talking about spacing, the history of written type translated onto evenly made printing blocks is transformed into the modern purpose of controlling visual space in body copy. The sections might be considered essays more than a longer narrative, which makes for an easy read.The examples are as integral to the book's narrative as the history itself. The design of the pages often split the text liberally with examples. The layout of the book has great play with type itself. When is justified text good or bad? The answers are stated with justified text. Makes sense. Many of the other examples are just fun type tricks and explainations on when and why they work or don't.Effectively conveyed is type styles' effectiveness in different mediums. Helvetica is a font designed for print, Verdana works well for web. The writer doesn't just force you to memorize this kind of information, but instead she explains why. So you can look at type with fresh eyes and see that Verdana's large x-height and simple curves work well for the pixel display of the computer system. The layout grid is discussed like most things, with it's origin with printing press. The focus is clearly intended to steer the reader into the uses of the modern grid in magazine, book and web design.There are some negatives. Purposefully functional,the history isn't fully explored. It's the backdrop for basing modern uses of type. The essay format drives the points forward and then simply moves on. This is possibly ideal for the busy modern pros that the book must be aimed to, but for those looking for a long form and in-depth view you'll have to go elsewhere. The modern model of dynamic typography that changes with context is in full effect and some readers might not like some of the more magazine styled layouts.I suspect that the average reader will learn a lot from this text. It can serve as a good guide during the design process. The short page count of the book can be seen as a much appreciated conciseness. The format is almost web-like in it's sections and pieces which appeals to a young and tech-savvy designer such as myself. Will the average writer or editor appreciate this information as much? Perhaps not. It may not be what everyone is looking for, but it will appeal to many design professionals who need a quick reference and crash course."},{"Title":"Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs).","review":"Bought this for a typography class, seems to be in great condition and full of interesting design perspectives.

After revisiting this book, I've upped it to 4 stars, realizing that while it doesn't serve as a typographical reference, it is thought-provoking.This book, while it does contain some practical dos and don'ts, is more useful for: seeing good examples of interesting typography; learning a bit of history about typefaces, layout, and grid; and for learning about how typographical grids and other techniques apply to web design.I agree with some other reviewers that the design and layout of the book at times is overwrought, and distracts from the content. This is most evident in the first chapter, Letters, which I found very difficult to get through.

She did not have any idea what the girls were plagued with, but through much research and study about a subject that she didn't even know existed, she learned.The devasation of one child effected with Fetal Alcohol is difficult enough for parents, but Sandra was dealing with two granddaughters who were born 15 months apart and had been raising them both since they were born.When the girls were teenagers, Sandra learned about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects/Exposure.The rages were frequent and harsh and Sandra and Ken were always in the middle and always the ones to have to call 911. Many times they were the ones who were abused. But, mostly it was one girl or the other. The girls were quite different in some respects and yet they were similar, because they were both very angry young ladies. They could not breathe the same air. They could not walk through a room without jumping on each other for the silliest of reasons. But, those actions caused them to spend many days and nights in, not only juvenile lock-up, but in the adult county jail. And, that was not where either one of them should have been. With the loss of knowledge for cause and effect, neither one of them understood why they were locked up!Sandra wants to help other families who are going through these difficulties and advises people to read her book with an open mind and glean from it what might make their lives easier.

Christianity has suffered greatly because of this lack of discernment in the Church. This book clearly calls Christians to discernment, and explains how to practice discernment with numerous practical examples.Although I cannot comment too particularly on all the books discussed in this book, based on what I have heard about these books their critiques seem accurate, and the general ideas contained in these are certainly accurate. The rest of the book, which I can certainly comment on, is very good and accurate and really makes you think. For example, the section on contemporary Christian music has really forced me to think and to re-analyze some of my positions. As one of the other reviewers said, in this section, Dr. MacArthur doesn't really argue about the style of worship but the CONTENT of worship, and, although I like a lot of contemporary music and tend not to prefer hymns, I have to agree that he has a point. A lot of modern Christian music IS completely mindless and very weak in content. Many songs consist of a few phrases repeated over and over again, particularly in the charismatic movement.I definitly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"Unlike many articles written to counter political or religious differences, the ones I have read in this book are balanced, Christlike and were written in an attitude of caution and warning. I appreciate the candor that does not cross over into angry dogma, even willing to see the good side of some of the trends they caution against. Any discerning Christian should appreciate the desire of the authors to carefully analyze the thoughts and practices around us in light of Scripture. Too often we find ourselves going through the motions of typical church procedures, or following the trends of popular Christian books and leaders without stopping to think about whether our doing so is Scriptural. These authors remind us that \\"Sola Scriptura\\" or Only Scripture should be our guide, while tradition, trends and other guidelines should be carefully thought through.

His beginning chapters on discernment were very thought provoking. The chapter addressing the \\"Purpose Driven Series\\" was well done, with the author of that chapter talking time to point out the strong suits and issues of the book by Rick Warren.However, the chapter on \\"Wild at Heart\\", done by Daniel Gillespie, was nothing more that rant and rave tactics. His poor attempts at discrediting the bookwere hilighted by his use of excerpts out of context. The book in it's design was not meant for, nor does Wild at Heart make the claim to replace the Bible or Bible Study. It is simply a different view from, and well pointed out by the books author, the author's own experience. People who would seek to use this book as a replacement for the Bible do so on their own accord, not at the author's suggestion.It was sad to see Fool's Gold go from informative work of research and debate to a poorly guided witch-hunt with Mr. Gillespie. Minus his section, it was a well done and must read book.Durning Mr. Gillespie's section of the book, he quoted an amazon book review.

This book was mainly about the author's opinions about plexiglass preaching, music types and styles, Rick Warren, Wild at Heart, Revolve Bible Magazine, altar calls, consumerism or politics. The title was so short of delivering its intended purpose. It was nothing more than a call to study your Bible, pray every day and tell others about Jesus which I would hope was the reality of someone who is looking to \\"discern truth.\\" This book was a complete waste of time.\\""},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"John MacArthur and his staff have put together a much-needed treatise on the spiritual discernment necessary in today's age.I thoroughly enjoyed the chapters evaluating the Revolve New Testament (a Bible packaged as a fashion magazine for teenage girls), the modern practice of altar calls, and John MacArthurs own particularly insightful and balanced contribution on sacred music.I have not read \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" (or anything \\"Purpose Driven\\" for that matter), however the critique given in this book rings true with the results I have seen in popular culture.I am going to have to withhold judgment on Daniel Gillespie's review of \\"Wild at Heart\\" until I read the book myself. Two men who I admire greatly have read the book and heartily recommend it, which does not mesh with the panning given it by Mr. Gillespie.I would have to say my favorite parts of the book were the contributions by Phil Johnson of Pyromaniac fame. I have been a fan ever since hearing his \\"Dead Right\\" treatise on modern Fundamentalism at the 2005 Shepherd's Conference. In this book, he ably puts the \\"new perspective on Paul\\" into perspective, and sheds light on the \\"let your light so shine\\" injunction of Matthew 5:16.Although this book does not attain the theological level of \\"The Gospel According to Jesus\\", it is a good read and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"Pastor MacArthur uses a 150-year analogy about the California Gold Rush to compare to today's evangelical churches who rush to embrace any doctrine that is culturally relevant or politically correct. How true. Like yeast in a ball of bread dough, false teaching and apostasy are running rampant through today's church. Truth takes a backseat in the rush to build new buildings and bring in the sinner (seeker) to have their felt needs and desires drive the content and format of the service for believers.MacArthur does not author the entire book but serves as general editor. He does pen several key chapters that define the problem in today's world, including the one that concentrates on Rick Warren and Saddleback Church. The Seeker-Sensitive Movement is the prime culprit of false teaching today. Satan loves to deceive people and this time, he came up with a movement that is about 90 percent truth but 10 percent heresy. That's why most evangelical Christians don't see the problem with Rick Warren. He is so close to truth but fails to preach a solid gospel of repentance, the Cross, the blood atonement, and the resurrection. People read all the bible verses Warren quotes but those promises were given to Christians, not the seekers prior to accepting Christ. Until they accept the offensive gospel of a crucified Jew (1 Cor Ch. 1), they are lost in the sins.Rick Warren has now come out with his PEACE plan to globalize Christianity. Where in the bible does it say we are to conquer the world for Christ so that He is ready to come back to reign? No, our job is to preach the gospel. We probably won't get wealthy doing it and Jesus promised great persecution for doing so. (John 15:18). If one takes a literal view of the Second Coming Promises, all one can find about peace is that there will be a 3 1/2 year period of peace immediately before AntiChrist takes over world authority. Rick Warren, no matter how well intentioned and sincere, is inevitably helping to set up the one-world church to be used by AntiChrist. God will judge his heart but he should be using his platform and authority to preach the gospel of Jesus, not man's felt needs.Fool's Gold also addresses other key problems in today's churches such as the shallowness of contemporary christian music, easy-believism, and Christian involvement into today's political issues. MacArthur ends the book by offering practical suggestions to sharpen one's biblical discernment and apply it into their local church.Excellent response to 90 percent of the junk that litters most Christian bookstores."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"While Dr. MacArthur and I would not agree on many areas theologically, we dosee eye to eye on basically every issue requiring discernment.This book is no exception. I found the handeling of all the topics to be exceptionally fair, yet bold about the truth. His discussion regarding John Elderidge's writings is excellent. A must read for anyone who reads his books. This guy must be read with caution. Also, many writers either attack Rick Warren or sing his never ending praise. This book however does, a little bit of both. While pointing out thevery strong areas of the \\"purpose Driven Life\\" the writier also goes to sufficent lengths to expose the shallow and potentially harmful areas of Rick Warrens mega-seller book.Another excellent area this book covers is that of \\"worship music\\"....It handles this topic with great care. Pointuing out the strengths of traditional music, while not erring on the side of TRADITIONALISM.....It must be noted that Dr. MacArthur does not write every chapter of this book, but is rather the primary editor. However, this book is nonetheless a worthy read."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"MacArthur (and his team of pastors) does a great job at reemphasizing the primacy of God's Word, over all cultural fads. This book addresses many items of our church that have fallen off the side of truth and wandered into the fields of entertainment, pride and false doctrine.Written from a strong and supported Scriptural basis, this book examines even the format and focus of church worship, music and preaching - placing it at obvious odds with Warren-style mega-churches. But MacArthur is uncompromising in his allegiance to Scripture for his guiding principles, and does not simply follow the passing appetites of sinful man.If you're tired of watered-down church ideas, read this and be guided back into God's Word. Read this and be strengthened and emboldened to stand firm against the tides of emotionalism, emergent doctrines and the host of \\"feel good\\" ideas driving much of our churches today."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"Considering the sad state of modern evangelicalism books like these should be published more and more to combat the consumer mentality among modern-day evangelicals. The book deals with various issues with the problems of contemporary evangelicalism.One of the key essays in the book is Nathan Busenitz's thoughtful critique of Rick Warren's Purpose Driven program. Though he does not bash Warren, he gives a careful critique of why Warren's program is unbiblical in many ways (especially Warren's use of Scripture and weak theological foundations). Those enamored with this movement should read this chapter. You'll realize just how off Warren is on many issues.Another good essay is Phil Johnson's critique of the New Perspective on Paul. He ably provides evidence why the NPP is anti-orthodox and anti-Protestant. That it undermines sola fide and should not be accepted by orthodox evangelical Christians. I really liked how he treated Wright's understanding of justification, the law, righteousness, and imputation. Those Reformed people who embrace the NPP are nothing more than a bunch of theonomic cattle farmers who obviously need to loosen their collars a bit.I also liked Johnson's other essay on Christians and politics. This essay is based on Matthew 5:16. Johnson rightly argues that this verse should not be used by Christians to implement some socio-political program on earth (as those theonomic corn farmers like to advocate, I can't stand those guys), but about individual Christians making a positive impact in their society by being salt and light to the world by bearing good fruit.Other good essays include Daniel Gillespie's critique of John Eldridge's \\"Wild at Heart\\" (yes, you must stop reading his stuff because it is harmful to your masculinity and spirituality) and Rick Holland's essay on the teenage girl directed \\"The Revolve New Testament\\" (ech...how low will Christian publishing companies go just to be \\"cool\\" and \\"mainstream\\").Other well written essays include Carey Hardy's essay on the legitimacy of modern-day alter calls, Kurt Gebhards' criticism of Western consumerism (oh yeah, did you know that excessive materialism is condemned in Scripture? Oh, who would have known!), and Dan Dumas' touching yet instructive essay on doctrinal discernment (I agree with Dumas that Christians cannot believe what THEY WANT TO BELIEVE...sheesh).MacArthur's essay on worship songs is okay. As long as worship songs are not heretical and/or hyped up by modern instruments, I believe that it is okay (yes, it is okay to use Matt Redman's songs during Sunday service).Overall, I highly recommend this book to all Christians - clergy or lay - who want a better understanding of the problems of modern evangelicalism. Many of you will be surprised to know that what your church promotes may be non or anti-biblical. It will be up to you, after reading this book, to stay in your stubborn disobedience to God or to truly seek God and obey his truth."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"MacArthur puts together a wonderful thought-provoking book concerning the lack of discernment by the church today. I'm so heart sick to see how many Christians buy into every new book and trend that attracts the masses. Much of the church has not hidden the Word in their hearts and have been led astray by an \\"American pop-culture gospel\\" which is no Gospel at all.Get this book and you will find that it points you to the Scripture... as every book should do. God's Word ought to be the centerpiece to all that we do as a church. MacArthur really shows his love and respect for the Word of God.However, I would like to point out something in the book that I thought was off base. In chapter 4 Phil Johnson discusses 'New Perspective Theology.' He really pushes N.T. Wright into a category that he doesn't belong. I believe New Perspective Theology is misrepresented by Mr. Johnson. His case sounds good, but he doesn't present New Perspective Theology in full. N.T. Wright is only trying to broaden our understanding of \\"justification by faith.\\" A closer study of first century Judaism will prove that. Mr. Johnson defends the understanding of \\"justification\\" taught by Luther and the reformers years after Paul. It is peculiar that he doesn't mention Luther's view on the book of James, Revelation, etc. It certainly would not have helped his case.If the truth be known, Luther's understanding of \\"justification\\" comes amidst the Catholic teachings (legalism & paganism) concerning indulgences, works salvation, and so on. Luther had a particular axe to grind with the gospel presented by the \\"church\\" of his day. We certainly respect much of Luther's work, but we better recognize that the buck doesn't stop with Luther. Luther's agenda is no secret.We want to understand \\"justification\\" and \\"righteousness\\" the way Paul's hearers would have heard it in the first century, not through the eyes of a reformed catholic like Luther. Even if you are committed to reformed theology... you must ask yourself, \\"Am I concerned with what Paul meant when he wrote Romans... or Luther's 16th century interpretation of what Paul wrote?\\" The answer should be obvious.I recommend you readPaul: In Fresh Perspectiveby N.T. Wright before you take Mr. Johnson's word for it. And this is the very point of the book.

MacArthur once again writes a great book, and backs up all his points by scripture.Really like the chapter on Purpose Driven Life"},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"It is rare these days to find a book on Christian discernment when everyone appears to be jumping on every band-wagon of the Evangelical church that comes along. MacArthur has assemblied an excellent set of essays by the staff of Grace Community Church, including several young men who are recent graduates of the Master's Seminary.I found the most insightful chapters to be the ones in the middle of the book dealing with some of the hottest sellers in the Christian Bookstores (not to mention everywhere else). Nathan Busenitz' critique of \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" is one of the best I have read. Although there are perhaps some redeeming features of the book, they are very few. It is a snapshot of just how shallow American Evangelicalism has become and the degree to which professing Christians are unable to tolerate serious engagement with a truly Biblical Worldview.Daniel Gillespie's review of \\"Wild at Heart\\" was aslo excellent. John Eldredge has zeroed in a narrow and spurious definition of masculinity, the notion that men need to tap into our wild and carefree ambitions; a throw-back to our so-called primal instincts that can be renewed if we just get back to the untamed wilderness of nature and find ourselves again. Gillespie points out that Eldredge skews the Biblical evidence in favor of his own thesis and fails to deal with explicit texts of the Bible that deal directly with masculinity (namely, because they contratict his thesis).Perhaps the most shocking expose of the book is Rick Holland's review of the new Bibzines, \\"Revole\\" and \\"Refuel\\"; New Testaments for teenagers designed to look like magazines (inside and out) for those who are afraid to carry traditional looking Bibles because they are too \\"freaky.\\" The chapter focused on \\"Revolve\\" for girls. Inside the Bible is a colorful array of sidebars and boxes with opinions from guys who are 'hunks'; advice on self-esteem; beauty tips for making yourself as beautiful as the next girl; shop-til-you-drop tips so that you can be totally accessorized; and advertisements for other cool books by the publisher. Instead of focusing on what Jesus and the Apostles mean by what they say (as in other study Bibles), these cleverly packaged 'non-Bibles\\" are focused on the self. It is undiluted narcissism geared to the vulnerable youth of our churches. These Bibles are selling like hot cakes which, like \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\", is a sad commentary on the state of the American Church.Other highlights of the book include the critique of 'altar calls' by Carey Hardy. Very little has been written on this venerable tradition in many Evangelical churches. This essay shows the theological and very practical dangers of the invitation system that reeks of evangelistic manipulation.MacArthur's chapter, \\"Plexiglass Preaching\\" is an excellent 15 point summary of what is wrong with so much banal preaching today. This ought to spur many pastors to re-evalute their preaching ministry that is so central and crucial to the church's well-being.Also MacArthur's chapter on Contemporary Worship Music is very insightful. He shows his preference for the classic hymns, namely because they exemplify a high view of God and truth. He points out that the shallowness of contemporary Praise Chorus' goes back a hundred years to the advent of gospel music. MacArthur is careful not to condemn musical style, but content. He believes there is much to be commended in both gospel songs and contemporary Praise songs and advocates a balance. Unfortunately a greater degree of discernment must be exercised when choosing modern worship songs that reflect a high view of God and the scriptures; songs that don't degenrate into trivial ditties that reduces worship to the near blasphemous, \\"God is my boyfriend/ girlfriend\\" type lryical sludge. The appendix to that chapter by Nathan Busenitz, a checklist to evaluate worship music and its content in the church, is a must for every pastor and worship leader (I wish he would have been more specific with criteria for the music itself though). The only critique I had for this chapter was MacArtur's lament that the classic hymns have been cast aside in the contemporary worship music craze. I think he is wrong. There has been a remarkable resurgence of the hymns recomposed with a contemporary flair that has been re-introduced by artists as wide-ranging as Fernando Ortega, Jars of Clay and Michael W. Smith. Many Contemporary Christian musicians have rediscovered the hymns and I think this is a positive sign away from so much of the banal stuff presently popular.Kurt Gebhards' chapter \\"Choking on Choices\\" was a good companion to Holland's chapter on the \\"Revolve\\" Bible. It points out how pervasive our self-aborbed and consumeristic culture has shaped the philosophy of ministry so prevalent in Evangelicalism today. The church is choking on the cult of self and has forgotten the true nature of fellowship and ministry which is radically other-centered. The reason we have lost that perspective is because we have lost our Christ-centered focus.I was dissappointed with Phil Johnson's 2 chapters, though mildly so. Johnson is a very thorough and articulate thinker and I was expecting more from him. His chapter on the 'New Perspective on Paul' is a neccessary engagement with the abondonment of the Biblical doctrine of Justification by many Evangelicals. Unfornately, I felt he spent too much time telling us what he was going to try to focus on in the chapter instead of getting right to the topic. His treatment was too cursory even bearing in mind the limited space. I was not impressed with his chapter on political involvement either. I thought there could have been a more careful examination what civic duties for the Christian ought to look like in light of the priority to evangelize our culture and not merely moralize it.I was also dissapointed with Dan Dumas' chapter on \\"Hills to Die on.\\" It outlined 3 broad categories of issues for which we can stand no compromise: a high view of Scricture, a high view of God and a high view of the gospel. I have no dispute with what he said, in fact it is crucial to the discussion. I was dissapointed in what he did not say. He began the chapter with Jonathan Edward's expulsion from his Northhampton church in 1750 over the infamous Lord's Supper issue. I thought a more thorough analysis of those issues would provide a fulcrum to develop a practical strategy for discerning what kinds of hills to die on which one's not to and how to go about doing so. The broad focus left me wondering about the many things that can divide a church or place the pastor in a position of uneccessary risk when delving into difficult issues. When a pastor enters a particular church enviornment, there may be a whole host of issues that must be addressed. If he is patient, those issues can be a cause to see a church grow tremendously in the grace and knowledge of the Lord. If he is impatient, he may become a bull in a china closest and do irrepairable damage. No principles were set forth as to how to patiently and loving deal with error in the church while maintaining unity. Such a topic would be useful in a fuller treatment, especially in light of the seemingly universal confusion resting over the professing church today. I am not aware of any such written resource, perhaps MacArthur could pursue a work of this kind.These mild criticisms in no way undermine the strengh of those chapters nor of the book as a whole. I heartilty recommend this collaborative effort to both pastors and to all Christians as an excellent contribution to discerning certain trends of the times. We need to be constantly warned of those matters that impact the Church in a way that is at best less than biblical and in some cases outrightly unbiblical and even at times heretical."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"\\"Bravo!\\"I don't think I said the word aloud when I finished reading Fool's Gold, but it may have slipped out. John MacArthur is the general editor of this new book from Crossway, and contributing authors are several of his ministry associates.The theme of the book is spiritual discernment; not set forth in a didactic way, but in a series of topical snapshots. Section one lays the foundation for the chapters to follow: a call for biblical discernment, and the consequences of a weak proclamation of Christianity. MacArthur makes the point that discernment is not just the responsibility of pastors and Christian leaders, but of every Christian. He covers the favorite verse of many in today's church: \\"Judge not, lest ye be judged.\\" (Matthew 7:1) and compares that with 1 Thessalonians 5:21: \\"Test everything.\\" In the second chapter he lists fifteen negative effects of superficial preaching, whittled down from an original list if sixty-one! My only reservation is with the twelfth point, and his comment about the difficulty of exercising church discipline where there is no commitment to the authority of God's Word. I'm not sure that very many churches even practice biblical church discipline, according to the teaching of Matthew 18:15-19. Perhaps a brief exposition of this passage, and an example of how this is practiced in his church is in order. The final two chapters of the book, \\"A Doctrinal Framework for Developing Discernment\\" and \\"A Practical Plan for Developing Personal Discernment\\" are excellent. I particularly appreciated the exhortation on page 201: \\"Discernment is not enough apart from obedience.\\"The rest of the book is a series of chapters looking at current doctrinal trends in the church and in Christian books. The contributors cover such things as altar calls, contemporary worship music, Wild at Heart and The Purpose Driven Life, as well as politics and consumerism. This is a must-read, written in a clear, straightforward style. I have already loaned out my copy to two people, and one of my pastors is referring to it in the college Bible study he teaches. I heartily commend it to you. - Pam Glass, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"This book is vintage MacArthur. It is concise, uncompromising and totally committed to a through exegisis of Scripture. I find it disturbing that books such as this are even needed today. But sadly, they are. Most profressing Christians are so biblically illierate that they don't know how to recognize truth, much less error and deception. Here again, I find myself wishing I could disagree with MacArthurs findings and teachings, but yet again, I can't. I have to say, the other contributers to this book are on the same caliber as MacArthur himself. Which isn't surprising, considering they all serve at MacArthur's church. I found this book very practical and very disturbing. It is also very convicting.I have struggled with some of the very things addressed in this book. This book has shown me that my concerns are not unfounded. I truly believe that MacArthur is not overstating his case. Discernment is crucial today. The reader is encouraged to critique every sermon, book, song, teaching, movement and everything else that is labeled Christian through the grid of Scripture. This is a book that should be read and re-read. MacArthur has done a great service to the church by writing this book. Everyone who professes to know Christ would do well to take his message and his advice to heart."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"I had heard about Fool's Gold shortly after its publiation and purchaced a copy as soon as I could.This book is edited and partially written by Pastor John MacArthur of Grace Community Church in California. The topic at hand is Biblical Discernment. Is this discernment applied to other world religions? No. Cults? No. Worldly philosophies? No. This is a book about discernment within the Evangelical Christian community itself! There are movements and activities going on \\"under the radar\\" which, while not all outright heresy, should still be tested in light of God's word.The book covers many areas such as popular Christian books, music, and church practices. Everything is subjected to the word of God. The book starts out with a general description of discernment and the case in favor of it and continues through various topics relevant to Evangelicism today. Among the topics discussed are:1) The Purpose Driven Life2) Wild At Heart3) Worship Music4) Political Activism5) Altar CallsThe book then wraps up with guidelines for practicing discerment in your daily life.All in all this book is excellent. The authors are not afraid to call to account many things that are very popular in Evangelical circles today. Many of these things sound very good on the surface but are called into serious question when subjected to the standards of Scripture.I have had personal experiences with many of these issues and was left with a general feeling that something was not right. The authors of Fool's Gold articulated what I had been thinking and feeling. This book is not merely part of some \\"fued\\" within the Evangelical community. These are Godly men who are simply doing what the Bible commands. Holding all teaching up to the standard of truth: Scripture.In my opinion this is must read for anyone in the Evangelical community today."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"All that glitters is not gold. This is a lesson many thousands of men learned in the 19th century when they stormed California seeking their fortunes. While there was treasure to be found, as evidenced by the wealth many gained from their mining ventures, there was also what came to be known as fool's gold. While this looked like gold, it was in reality valueless iron pyrite. For a miner to be successful he had to learn to discern the true gold from mere fool's gold. A man's livelihood depended on this. Because it was difficult to tell one from the other only by looking at it, miners develped some simple tests. One was the hardness test, where a miner could bite a rock in question. Fool's gold was hard while real gold was much softer. A broken tooth would prove the rock to be fool's gold. For a second test a miner would scrape the rock against a white stone. True gold would leave a yellowish streak while fool's gold would leave one that was greenish-black. This is the historical backdrop against which John MacArthur and the staff of Grace Community Church compare today's church. We are in a time where the church is filled with fool's gold and only godly discernment will show what is true treasure and what is trash.Fool's Gold is divided into four sections. In the first John MacArthur provides a call for biblical discernment and examines the devastating consequences of a watered-down message to the church. The second section, entitled \\"Practicing Discernment in your Local Bookstore\\" examines four of the latest Christian bestsellers in the light of the Scripture. Nathan Busenitz reviews The Purpose Driven Life, Phil Johnson introduces the New Perspective on Paul through What Saint Paul Really Said, Daniel Gillespie evaluates Wild at Heart and Rick Holland looks at The Revolve New Testament Bible-zine. The third section provides pointers for \\"Practicing Discernment in your Local Church.\\" Receiving attention are contemporary worship music, altar calls, the American-Christian approach to politics and the consumer mindset. The book wraps up with an examination of \\"hills to die on\\" - a doctrinal framework for developing discernment, and a practical plan for personal discernment.As we have come to expect from MacArthur's books and ministry, this book is incisive, penetrating and inherently biblical. It cuts to the heart of the matters at hand. In fact, the authors' tasks were quite simple ones - they had to merely hold the church's fads and obsessions up to the light of Scripture and to examine them against God's unchanging standard. In many cases these fads were found wanting. The authors are careful to assign credit where credit is due and are consistently respectful to those whose teachings they oppose. At the same time, they are unapologetic in their defense of the truth and their desire to see God's standards held high.My only disappointments with the book were that the authors did not discuss two of the most pressing issues in evangelicalism today - the Emergent Church (which received only one passing mention) and mysticism, which is gaining a firm hold in the church, in part through the very books the authors evaluate.This book is an excellent introduction to the importance of biblical discernment and a penetrating analysis of how a lack of discernment has allowed error to infiltrate the church and prosper within. Only with a rediscovery of biblical discernment will the church be able to root out this fool's gold. This book will help any Christian develop a foundation for biblical discernment that will allow him to make the crucial distinctions between truth and error. I highly recommend this title, especially as a companion volume to Ashamed of the Gospel and Hard to Believe."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"FOOL'S GOLD is an excellent series of articles that come from the Shepherd's Conference held yearly at Grace Community Church of which John MacArthur is the pastor. The articles are essentially the notes and the talks given by the various teachers of the seminars.The book itself is an eye-opener and calls the believer to discernment in an age of careless theology (and no theology at all in most churches). The book deals with nearly every hot issue of the evangelical church from Rick Warren's popular but misleading Purpose-Driven ministry to the modern feminist movement. The book deals with music issues, church discipline, and a host of other local ministry issues. Nothing is left untouched.Dr. John MacArthur and his staff at Grace Community Church, The Master's College and Seminary, and Grace To You are to be commended for giving the Church this book. Truly, the modern Church is looking for God but finding fool's gold. Only by a return to the authority of Scripture will we truly find God's blessing."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"Fool's Gold is a must read for all who are interested in truth. We are living in an age of error just like the Bible says that we would before the Lord returns. In an age of deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, discernment is to be top priority for those who have received the love of the truth so as to be saved. This book is an excellent resource for helping pastors and churches with equipping their people with a biblical mindset for discerning the truth."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"Introduction:How are we to distinguish gold from \\"fool's gold\\"? This is a question that perplexed many in the 1800's with the \\"gold rush\\" that swept the many hopefuls that left all behind in search for fortune. In Fool's Gold?, John MacArthur, along with other staff members from Grace Community Church, tackle a wide variety of trends in the evangelical world that seem to offer hope and answers, when in fact they might be a bit misleading. All that glitters is not gold.Book Structure:There are four parts to the book. In the first part, MacArthur unabashedly calls for discernment rooted in Scripture, offering three points from 1 Thessalonians 5:21-22. Having established a foundation for biblical discernment, he then presents the negative results of \\"watered-down\\" preaching which seems to pervade the contemporary Christian community today. In the second part, four different popular books are addressed and critiqued from a biblical standpoint-in a way modeling for the reader what it looks like to employ biblical discernment: 1. Rick Warren's The Purpose-Driven Life; 2. N.T. Wright's What Saint Paul Really Said; 3. John Eldredge's Wild at Heart; and 4. The Resolve New Testament Bible-zine for girls. The third part deals with very provocative issues such as contemporary Christian music, \\"altar calls\\" and invitations to \\"receive Christ into your heart,\\" the Christian's approach to politics, and the consumeristic mind-set that many adopt within the church. And the finally, the book concludes with a doctrinal and practical framework to implement as one seeks to discern which hills are worth dying on and to live a life much like the Bereans, who Luke tells us in Acts 17 were of \\"noble character\\" because they \\"received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true\\" (v.11, emphasis added).Notable Quotes:* \\"If the current current hunger for ecumenical compromise, pragmatic sanctification, and numerical success continues to gain a foothold within evangelicalism, it will result in an unmitigated spiritual disaster....The church will never manifest its power in society until we regain a passionate love for truth and corollary hatred for error\\" (pp.14,15).* \\"...worship is a transcendent experience. Worship should take us above the mundane and simplistic. So the only way true worship can occur is if we first come to grips with the depth of spiritual truth. Our people can only rise high in worship in the same proportion to which we have taken them deep into the profound truths of the Word. There is no way they can have lofty thoughts of God unless we have plunged them into the depths of God's self-revelation\\" (p.38).* \\"So let the man who searches for true masculinity look no further than the pages of Scripture, for there he will find the truth about himself from the mouth of his Creator. Let his ears not be tickled by the whims of men, but let his mind be trained by the Word of God. And before any man looks for his battle to fight, his beauty to rescue, and his adventure to live, let him first look to his God to glorify\\" (p.95).* \\"Our only sure defense against false doctrine is to be discerning, to distrust our own emotions, to hold our own senses suspect, to examine all things, to test every truth-claim with the yardstick of Scripture, and to handle the Word of God with great care\\" (p.199).Conclusion:I heartily endorse this book to any Christian who seeks honor God and show discernment in what he reads and what he meditates on. I wish the authors would have tackled a few more popular books like Joel Osteen's Your Best Life Now and some of the emerging church books that seem to popping up everywhere. Overall, I think the authors did a great job in laying a foundation in the Word for discernment and then demonstrating what that looks like in some books (many of which I have read have benefited from). There a few minor criticisms I have of the book, but they in no way undermine the overall flow that makes this a great read as we can expect from John MacArthur.If we lose the ability to discern, then we lose the ability to distinguish truth from error; when this occurs, our gospel becomes vulnerable to the onslaught of false speculations and lofty ideas that present themselves against the Truth. We then become confused and apathetic to the essentials of our faith, thinking it only a matter of preference.May we all be known for our discernment as we test everything and hold on to the good (1 Thess. 4:21) and in so doing, God will receive the glory!"},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"It is regretable that such a book is necessary for the church today. It seems though that every era in the church has its theological \\"sinkholes\\" that distact and divert the believer from truth and devotion to our Lord. In our era of the internet and the \\"marketed\\" church, error both new and old is packaged and bought into by believers not grounded in the Word. This work is very helpful in understanding the error of many movements that are, alarmingly, gaining popularity in many assemblies today.I do wish that editors had seen fit to include a chapter devoted to an old error that is surfacing in the church today, that of \\"Christian\\" mysticism principally as espoused by the parachurch organization Renovare' and it's founder Richard Foster."},{"Title":"Fool's Gold?: Discerning Truth in an Age of Error","review":"John MacArthur is a well known preacher-teacher of Truth. He has authored great books from doctrine to Christian living. This book is all of that combine, in the sense, it's addresses the issues of everyday life. From the weak preaching from the pulpits today that is very common to the church today. To some of the postmodernism that has infected the church like a bad cancer. A look at some \\"best\\" sellers on the Christian market like \\"The purpose driven life\\" and \\"Wild at heart\\". To politics to a vital issue that the church lacks, that is biblical discernment.

Divinlyamazinglysatisfyinglyprofound, if a word could describe my own experience of this book, Love."},{"Title":"Pulsation of Love","review":"I gave this book 4 stars based on the fact that the poetry is not truly poetry, more of a stanza-structured prose, so it was slightly disappointing from that perspective. I am sure that devotees of Gurumayi will not find this a problem as it is filled with tremendous heart and deep spiritual expression. It's a bit like a Christian saying the Bible is poetry, when it is not truly poetry, though it often reads as such. Still it is narrative prose. I am pickier than most as a poet that also writes prose.One other note that I think everyone should be aware of, this is basically the same book in softcover as \\"Ashes At My Guru's Feet\\". The poems have been slightly re-ordered and the hardcover has some very nice illustrations that \\"Pulsation Of Love\\" does not have. Also, the hardcover \\"Ashes\\" is beautifully constructed, has a hard case slipcover and a clear dust cover that adds a very high-class look to the book. Over all, I am pleased, just disappointed that they gave the soft-cover a different title and cover artwork (though very nice in it's own right), leading one to believe they are two separate entities.As one who is not a devotee of Gurumayi, but who is on a quest for faith, I found this book to contain great wisdom and to be worth reading in spite of being poetically disappointed.

Santiago describes her struggles and triumphs in adjusting to a new lifestyle in the United States, embracing her culture, and maturing into the woman she wishes to be.I really enjoyed this book. Santiago writes in honest detail about the adventures she has in attempt to become independent from her restricting, \\"old-fashioned\\" mother and performing in theaters of Manhattan. Most entertaining are her accounts of unique relationships with various men. I didn't know whether to laugh or to remain in shock as Santiago recalled such things as, \\"he was thirty-seven, the same age as Mami, seventeen years older than me,\\" or, \\"it hit me that I was about to marry a man who stole planes for a living.\\" The events are amazingly unpredictable and quite engaging. Only the clarity and specification of her words reminded me that I was not reading an imaginative, fictional story, but rather the true and eventful life of quite a remarkable woman!I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand the challenges of moving from one very different environment and country to another, while embarking on the journey into adulthood.

You sometimes feel like you can't relate to it but it just takes your breath away. The book \\"Almost a Woman\\", really took my breath away. Since I am Hispanic I can relate how a Hispanic mother or father can be with their daughters, especially if they are the oldest. In the story, she discovers herself trying to find what she really wants. Trying to please her mother, she sometimes goes against her mother's wishes. Esmeralda's mother knows what's best for her and doesn't want her to end up like a pregnant girl at age fifteen or dropping out of high school. Her mother wants her to succeed in life and support herself and her family.I really liked the dialogue because I understood the words in Spanish. What really stood out for me when they would talk were the responses they would have. I sometimes knew what they would say because of the similar responses between a child and a parent. Sometimes you know what a parent might say to a child because most Hispanic parents are the same.I loved all the character and all the men she met. There were a lot of guys that came in and out of her life. She wasn't being picky; she was just meeting them as they come. I especially loved the grandmother. She reminds me of that lady on \\"The George Lopez Show.\\" All the children were great, even though they are not mentioned a lot. They are only mention when something big happens to Esmeralda.This memoir made me realize that family is the only people in your life that you need. They are the key to your life. You don't need a man to tell you what to do, what to wear, who you can or can't see, etc. You should never have to choose between a parent and your lover. I've been through that experience and it was hard but I still say today that I'm glad I chose what was best for me and my family. Sometimes I feel like her wanting to have the freedom to be on my own and live on my own two feet but parents always come in the way of things. When reading it, it made me realize a lot of things when I had my first boyfriend. None less to say, I was dumb and naive back then.

Because this book is set in New York, it lacks the scenic imagery that is used in the first book to describe her home country. However, we are instead introduced to the introspective musings of a girl attempting to define and journey into womanhood while acclimating to New York - both of which are unfamiliar territory. The book explores some very real and/or mature concerns - e.g., love, an absent father, familial obligations, unwed motherhood, sex, responsibility, culture, etc. - although they are interwoven into a fun and lighthearted tale of Negi's teen years. I would recommend this book (although I would suggest picking up \\"When I Was Puerto Rican\\" first)."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"Being Puerto Rican,and growing up in New York, I can truly relate to Esmeralda's Story.

I felt the book proved that no matter where you come from as long as you preservere, the path of the future is also so sweeter."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"Esmeralda Santiago was born in Puerto Rico, and spent her early years there. Her mother moved with her children to New York City (Brooklyn) to start a new life, hoping for newer and greater opportunities after various setbacks in the Caribbean island. Esmeralda tells the story of her beginnings in New York, her struggle to learn English, to cope with the school system, to cope with a new culture and to deal with gangs and crime. The book portrays a strong and proud mother who struggles to maintain her family in the midst of poverty, and who despite an already large family keeps adding to it. The author, in a sort of painful honesty, describes her own passage through adolescence which includes her efforts to earn money,have friends, pursue drama, date and form relationships with men. The one relationship in particular is rather unusual and interesting and I won't spoil the pleasure of reading it for the first time by providing more details. Nor will I spoil her most heroic moment of triumph in the book, a moment which truly leaves one gasping in awe. All in all this is quite a moving and interesting book, written simply and directly but with passion and power."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"Her life is not easy, but she has made the best of it growing to be an excellent human being, a great writter and an inspiration on success if your really try and have specific goals.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that her latest book &quot;Almost A Woman&quot; just came out and I cannot wait to read it but I'm trying to find out if it is also available in Spanish, since it is when she writes in that language that I enjoy it the most. Although I do much of my reading in English, I believe that part of what makes Esmeralda's work so special and unique is the fact that when she writes in Spanish, she uses a lot of those local sayings that we no longer hear about, with such graciousness, that magically transport us to those time when we were also growing up and in much of the same situations, thus bringing back lots of memories. Her style is with a such humor and so straighforward that I can't wait to put my hands on my copy. I just need to know if she has writen this one in Spanish also or if not, if it will be coming out soon. Please, someone give me an answer!!!

To say I was disappointed by Almost a Woman is an understatement. I was, in fact, shocked that Santiago whom had written the first book of her memoir so beautifully was capable of such medocrity with the second.

This memoir picks up where \\"When I Was Puerto Rican\\" stops (well, the first chapter or 2 basically repeats the end of the first book for those that did not read it) and covers her teenage years. She had a mother that bore eleven children and never married, but was apparently so concerned that her daughter not follow her example, she did not let Esmeralda date and kept her on a very short leash. Esmeralda finds ways around it tho like any spunky rebellious teenager. I found parts of it engrossing. I felt embarassed with her during the retelling of her Mami showing up at a party simply because she forgot to call. However, I did not find this one as humorous as \\"When I Was Puerto Rican\\". I also do not care to read an entire novel about the Turkish guy she meets at the end, which the next novel covers. Basically what I am trying to say, is that unlike \\"When I Was Puerto Rican,\\" this memoir, although good, does not make me want to keep reading. However, I am going to read the next one just to find out if Esmeralda ever asked her mother \\"Mami, why do you not use birth control?\\" I am dying for the answer at this point."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"Almost a Woman portrays the life of author Esmeralda Santiago as a 13-year-old girl who has just moved to the United States from Puerto Rico.

It is one that keeps the reader's interest throughout the entire novel. The trials and tribulations that Negi faces in her life are described in detail. It is a tale of how truly difficult it is to move to a new county and try to become accustomed to its ways.

When she first comes to the U.S. with her highly protective mother and two younger siblings, Esmeralda finds herself caught in a struggle between her desire to become Americanized and the need to retain her cultural identity as a Puerto Rican. Before finally leaving the local middle school, she is given a spot at the Performing Arts High School in Manhattan. Soon, Esmeralda is on her way to a life full of excitement, drama, adventure, self-discovery, and personal growth.Santiago uses delightfully descriptive prose and excellent character development to endear her readers. There is never a dull moment in her storytelling; you feel her ups, downs, and in-betweens. Santiago's whirlwind romances, exploits as an actress and dancer, and adventures with new friends will surely feel as if they've become your own. The end is brilliant and will leave you ravenous for Santiago's next engrossing installment. There is something for everyone to enjoy in Almost A Woman, which should make it highly popular among many different kinds of readers.

That is where the comparison/connection ends, because this book is horrible compared to Santiago's first biography. To sum up one part of the book that really sums up the whole: There is one \\"big\\" event that happens in this book (won't give it away) and it's 272 pages leading up to it, and when it finally happens, ONE PAGE (and barely that, it's more like half a page) is devoted to describing it. Does that make any sense? Other events are given twenty pages to describe it, and the \\"big\\" moment for Santiago gets one page? The talented way Santiago describes her whereabouts and experiences are happily evident on her first biography; in ALMOST A WOMAN, they are almost non-existent.

The story focuses on a proud Spanish family who has immigrated to the alien United States. They find the large Puerto Rican family consisting of eleven children is irregular compared to the small white families of the United States. This book gave great insight into the Puerto Rican culture and also does an excellent job of attaching the reader to the main character.

She yearns for what she pictures to be an &quot;American&quot; life whil struggling with her mother's constant mantra of &quot;just because you go to a school for blanquetos..&quot; I felt that the author has yet to find a way to be an American Puerto Rican. Her frequent use of Spanglish only serves to confuse those of us who do not speak Spanish. I was annoyed and felt it only proved on thing: How Puerto Rican she is. The fundamental story of a young girl's struggle for independence is blurred by constant ethnic references which kept me from being able to relate to experiences that were, in essence, something we all go through as teens. This book is easy reading and fairly entertaining. People who share Esmeralda's background would especially enjoy it. But if you're looking for more than a time-filler, this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"I loved Santiago's first book (When I Was Puerto Rican) and I love this one too. Almost a Woman is a memoir about coming of age in New York City. It is also about the struggle to find her own identity among a large family and a domineering but loving mother. Even though I am not an immigrant or Puerto Rican I found this book very compelling and hard to put down.

In some ways this book read like a soap opera, once you read one chapter you couldn't wait to move on to the rest of the juicy details. In some parts shocking but painfully real. I can't wait to get another one of her books. It's like having a kindred spirit in her. I'm very grateful that I discovered this author. She has sent me on a wonderful journey in reading."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"I highly recommend the book to anyone who read and loved &quot;When I was Puerto Rican&quot;.

Warning: you will find yourself wanting to yell at the book, to give words of worldly wisdom to young Esmeralda at various crossroads in her life.The actual writing (style) is tops!!!! I can't say any more than that. Well, except that it ended too soon. I want to know how she gets to Harvard. I just know this is a set up for volume three."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"Santiago is portraying the struggle that all immigrants and especially Puerto Rican immigrants have to face when they are thrown into the Anglo world.

It's best read in Spanish."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"I suggest that you read the prequel to this book, \\"When I Was Puerto Rican,\\" simply for transition into the life of Esmeralda Santiago. Santiago, a woman who came from a desolate background in Puerto Rico, arrived in the United States with her mother (\\"Mami\\") and her numerous younger brothers and sisters. As the book evolves, the household grows, as the family must move from house to house, and utilize the welfare system to make ends meet. Esmeralda (\\"Negi\\") is the oldest of ten brothers and sisters, must help care for them, balance work, school and her aspirations as a young actress, all the while, translating for her mother at the welfare office. How this young woman managed to balance all of these factors, and triumph, is a true inspiration to readers, young and old. We also get a real sense of her bicultural struggle, to assimilate into U.S. culture, while maintaining ties to her Puerto Rican heritage, and an ethnic \\"other\\" (neither black, nor white, but brown).What is especially compelling about the style of this sequel, is that we get a sense of Esmeralda Santiago's conflict as a young woman, as a daughter and as an aspiring artist, looking for an outlet for her gift as an actress. Though, she was not allowed to date until the age of seventeen, and continued to live at home until the age of twenty-one, this did not stop her from embarking in love affairs that taught her about life and herself. This is truly a part of coming of age that we all can relate to, and will touch readers from all backgrounds. I really reccomend this novel...You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Almost a Woman","review":"i absolutely loved &quot;when i was puertorican&quot;, and wondered if this could be as good. it's AS good, if not better, and I highly recommend this book if you like esmeralda santiago. you will not be disappointed.

Not surprisingly, this candor sat poorly with Arab governments and hate-the-West intellectuals. As a result, this report, the third annual volume in the series, includes an executive summary and a chapter that bow in the direction of Arab political correctness, departing from the rest of the volume in its focus on the pernicious West as the source of restrictions on Arab freedoms. A particularly bizarre box criticizes Israel for its restrictions on churches--this in a volume that says not a single word about religious freedom for non-Muslims in the Arab world, not even about the ban on organized non-Muslim worship in Saudi Arabia.The 2004 report focuses on freedom with chapters on the intellectual basis of freedom, an overview of problematic issues, human rights (\\"denial of fundamental individual freedoms\\"), legal architecture (\\"legislative restrictions on freedom\\"), political architecture (\\"the vicious circle of repression and corruption\\"), and societal structures (\\"the chain that stifles individual freedom\\"), before closing with a chapter offering \\"strategic visions of freedom and governance.\\" In the areas it covers, the analysis is quite solid if usually abstract: the authors obviously felt constrained from offering specific examples about freedom deficits in particular countries.Even accepting those limitations, the report's approach suffers from some obvious omissions, such as ignoring the rampant discrimination against non-Muslim and non-Arab populations, which are significant minorities in most of the Arab world. (In the four large Arab states of Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, and Sudan, which between them have a majority of the population of Arab states, minorities constitute a larger share of the population than do blacks in the United States.) The report also suffers from the mythology that an \\"Arab world\\" actually exists when problems and accomplishments differ remarkably from one Arabic-speaking country to another. Still, Nader Fergany and the rest of his large team are to be congratulated for being blunt about the Arab world's freedom deficit, a topic that only a few years ago would have been unthinkable as a subject for a report from an international organization."},{"Title":"Arab Human Development Report 2004: Towards Freedom in the Arab World","review":"The first The Arab Human Development Report (2002) reasonably diagnosed the three key constraints to development in the Arab world to be the low status of women, lack of knowledge and lack of freedom. The 2003 Report dealt with the knowledge deficit. The 2004 report is concerned with the lack of freedom in Arab countries which is probably the most fundamental of the three deficit areas.It is unclear whether the authors would have fearlessly, objectively and honestly dealt with this most important issue if given a free hand. However, being sponsored by a UN organization, in which the Arab governments have a major say, they probably never got the chance. They ended up damning with faint praise. Reading between the lines the authors consider that a very bad situation has become even worse.The authors continue to tiptoe around the relationship between Islamic values and practices and the fact that functional democracies are almost unknown in the Islamic world. They really do not come to grips with why virtually every Arab state is repressive and corrupt even though some were colonized by the British, some by the French, some by the Spanish and a few never colonized at all. They fall back on that old Arab way of avoiding reality - blaming Israel (and oil) though most Arab states neither border on Israel nor have oil.If these reports do not recover their rigor and intellectual integrity they will just represent so many trees unnecessarily slaughtered in a bad cause.(...)"},{"Title":"Arab Human Development Report 2004: Towards Freedom in the Arab World","review":"The Arab world has failed to meet the challenge of modernity. It has failed to confront antiquated regimes with leaders who seem far from capable of confronting the real problems of their people. The lack of freedom, discrimination against women of this world mark out its backwardness.The young Arab intellectuals working to change this are to be commended for their effort."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor attack: An abbreviated history (Ships data series)","review":"This book is a 32 page, stapled softcover, with a cover of slightly heavier stock, in landscape format. It is a bare bones account of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Color is restricted to the outside and inside covers. The interior supplements the text with photographs, sketches, maps, and tables. Outstanding here is the two page spread of a map of Pearl Harbor. Overall one gets an excellent view of the extent of the attack even at facilities elsewhere on Oahu.There are certainly better and more comprehensive accounts of the attack but this one offers considerable value. It has a number of interesting features not found elsewhere including a table of ships of the Pacific fleet that were *not* at Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack, Navy decorations (Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, etc) awarded for conduct during the attack, ships named after men killed during the attack, and reproductions of Time magazine covers.The book is very much a \\"Navy\\" book. Army activities are hardly mentioned. Even though a few Army aircraft managed to get airborne and oppose the attack, this fact is not mentioned.Interestingly, the types of Japanese planes used in the attack are never identified except as fighters (Mitsubishi A6M), dive bombers (Aichi D3A), torpedo bombers, and high level bombers (both Nakijima B5N). The one aircraft that is identified, a cruiser launched reconnaissance float plane, is done so in a confusing manner as a \\"Zero float plane\\" leading one to think it is a float version of the famous Mitsubishi A6M. It was actually another Type 0, an Aichi E13A.One could have wished for some mention of the antitorpedo nets deployed in the harbor and why they failed to stop the torpedoes. They are clearly marked on the map. It seems they should have provided some protection to the ships moored on the west side of Ford Island, like the Utah.But these are nits. The book is well worth picking up at the current secondhand asking prices."},{"Title":"A First Book of Christmas Songs: 20 Favorite Songs in Easy Piano Arrangements (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"Anyone can truly teach themselves how to play the piano with this children's collection of familiar Christmas songs.

This book is too simple for anyone who has spent any time--even if it was years ago--playing the piano. Many of the songs have just a single note melody line and there are very few chords included. Have been able to improve with chords I remember. The book would be great for first-year piano students and has great illustrations that kids would like to color. I, however, am almost 60. Bought two other books--one for Complete Levels 2 & 3 that I am able to play fairly well (Alfred's Basic Piano Library Christmas Book) and one with more challenging arrangements that I wouldn't necessarily call east (Hal Leonard Ultimate Christmas) that I am finding most satisfactory.A First Book of Christmas Songs: 20 Favorite Songs in Easy Piano Arrangements (Dover Music for Piano)Alfred's Basic Piano Library: Christmas Book Complete Levels 2 & 3 (Top Hits!

Because the piano arrangements are not at all at the beginning level...they are more like what you would see in a book for a 2nd or even a 3rd year student. The hand positions are all over the place, with many shifts in hand position, there are many 3 and 4-note chords, there are pieces with both hands reading/playing treble clef, and there are many ledger line notes both above and below the staff.

The arrangements tend to be minimalistic. Caveat: there are at least two obviously wrong notes in The First Nowell and Jingle Bells, so you'd be well advised to correct them once you find them; hopefully they'll fix them by the time a second edition rolls out.

Great for Level II Primary however!It's also a fun book to improvise from.

On any given day you will see the children streaming from music school or music camp, clutching this durable Dover book to their chests while the music in their heads strums through their fingers, and conjures up a jolly Christmas to come. The sadder aspects of Christmas are not forgotten either, and the minor keys in which some holiday gems are written (e.g., O Little Town of Bethlehem which, even if not in a minor key borrows some mournful tones from Russian and Jewish music) will provide an adult counterpoint to the brainless holiday rock music that's a staple to US top 40 radio around this time of year.Give your kids (or nephews and nieces) this book of Christmas songs. Bergerac is one of the best arrangers around, and knows the mind of a child every bit as extensively as the late Dr. Seuss.

Several of them are in the key of F or G, even D! Some of the songs also have eighth notes. This is not beginning level! None of my beginners could play from the book.

I didn't forget any of what I learned but I did find it more difficult to come back and not be apprehensive as an adult. What I'm coming to understand through this book is how to go about getting horses to work with me instead of against me. It's easy to attribute problems to the horse but this book shows you that it's important to recognize the part you play as a rider in getting the best out of your horse. In reading this book, I cannot believe how much my instructors did not tell me that would have helped so much.

I personally know Homer Hickam and his wife Linda and can assure you that the personality of the book is exactly the personality of it's author. Keep up the good work Homer!! Coalwood, West Virginia and the world are awaiting for the next book. I didn't think it could get any better than Rocket Boys but was I ever fooled. Everyone should try to visit Coalwood WV.

I started laughing on the bus this morning reading it going into work and everybody looked at me. At lunch, I had to get the kleenex out. I couldn't put it down. I especially like that this is a very spiritual book. I learned a lot about life in it and God's plan. Solved my Christmas present problem, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I am impressed with Homer Hickam's ability to stitch together the story of his adolescent years in Coalwood, West Virginia, when launching homemade rockets into the sky served as a metaphor for six boys whose imaginations were ignited with every rocket fuse they lit. The Coalwood Way is a story with a memorable ending that is as surprising as it is meaningful.Hickam takes us down the road of his past, paving the way with delightful characters and true experiences revealing his adolescent heart with tenderness. I have recommended The Coalwood Way to several friends. It is a most compelling book, which leaves the reader well satisfied like a traveler who have returned home after a particularly good road trip."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I picked up &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; because I enjoyed &quot;The Rocket Boys&quot; so much, and I was not disappointed. This book explores the town of Coalwood, its people, and the mining operation in much more detail. Simply put, I loved this book. If you liked &quot;The Rocket Boys&quot;, you will love this book. It is a well-written, emotional, and sentimental look at Homer Hickam's home town through the eyes of a 17 year old boy with his whole life ahead of him, anxious to go out in the world, but growing to realize that Coalwood will be a part of him forever. Read it!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Homer Hickam has done it again, writing a worthy successor to his &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;. We return to his West Virginia coal town where we meet the characters of his first book, and some new ones as well, all skillfully drawn. Tragedy and comedy are woven together, tears and laughter intermingle as the townspeople draw us into this gentle, somewhat sentimental portrayal of &quot;company town&quot; life. Hickam's own journey into self-aware adulthood is an underlying theme. Like the high school girls in his tale, many women readers will find themselves falling in love with its author!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I strongly recommend this book for anyone who might be feeling sad or down on their luck. It is filled with insights that just make you smile and nod. My favorite: It's better to confess ignorance than to provide it. I told my boss that and he laughed and put it up on his partition. The book keeps building on events but it all leads up to Christmas Eve and the pageant so it's a great holiday read, too. Homer's writing is magical. The Coalwood Way is his holiday gift to all his fans."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"The Coalwood Way, by Homer Hickam, is the sequel to October Sky. It is 1959 and theRocket Boys are still making their handmade rockets. Homer \\"Sonny\\" Hickam is trying toprove to his father that he will go to college and succeed. Although with the mine notdoing very well, it does not look like any of the Coalwood children will get very far in life.A lot of the miners have lost their jobs and Sonny's father has to make some dangerousdecisions about what to do to keep the town and the mine from going poor. Sonny'smother feels cut off from her husband and the townspeople. Her role as thesuperintendent's wife makes things difficult with the wives of the union workers.In the bleak, cold winter months optimism is hard to come by in Coalwood. Sonnyis overcome with a sense of gloom and trys desperately to figure out what is causing it.When Coalwood is in need of some spirt-lifting, Sonny and his friends bring back the spiritof Christmas just in time.Hickam's story brings the characters from his childhood to life in a touching talethat provokes the mood of the mid-twentieth century. Sonny learns many things about hisbrother and his parents throughout the story. His father is a workaholic who feelsresponsible and inadequate, and his mother is very intelligent and perceptive who feelsisolated from her whole family. Sonny moves from childhood to adulthood in a few shortmonths as Coalwood changes in many different ways. The story reminds us of theimportance of keeping our dreams and not letting little things or big things change them.It also remids us that growing up is hard, yet possible. If we stay together with our friendsand family and we we pray and learn to live together, then we can get through anything."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Several years ago, I saw the movie, \\"October Sky,\\" and loved it. I ordered this book, and it sat around for years, but I finally got around to reading it and enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the movie. It's well-written, with plenty of surprises and several great stories wrapped around the dream of a young boy who wants to work in the space program.Homer Hickam grew up in West Virginia, during the 1950's and couldn't ever seem to please his father. It's a great book, about family, friends and growing up in a more innocent age. The book reads like a novel and you can't help pulling for Homer and his friends as you read it. Now I want to go back and watch the movie again."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Great book! Maybe as good as I've read. But I'm partial to coming-of-age books for boys - and if they graduated from high school in the same year as myself (1960), then so much the better. I'm in the process of passing around the book to friends and family. However, I can't convince my wife to give it a try. She thinks it's about rockets, but it's much, much more than that. And now for true confessions - I shed a couple of tears at the end - a combination of the story, as well as the fact that \\"Rocket Boys\\" and \\"The Coalwood Way\\" are the last in his series of non-fiction."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Dr. Werner von Braun once said, \\"Matters of faith are not really accessible to our rational thinking. I find it best not to ask any questions, but to just believe...\\" These words are truly conveyed throughout the second of Homer Hickam Jr.'s memoirs, The Coalwood Way, originally published in 2000. Although following his acclaimed, Rocket Boys, this compelling story does not continue where the last left off. Portions of the memoir take place during the same time period as the last, however, this tome portrays the life of Homer \\"Sonny\\" Hickam in a different light. This particular memoir focuses on Sonny's senior year in high school and the hardships he must go through when growing up. In addition to working diligently on creating improved rockets, Sonny must focus on achieving A's in school. Most importantly, he must focus on his family. In 1959 Coalwood, West Virginia is a ticking bomb and as it becomes more and more difficult to keep the mines running, the bomb seems to always be the verge of exploding leaving the people out of jobs, homes and, even worse, their town. Sonny must now try to keep his family together while the town falls apart and yet keep alive the dream of leaving in order to join his role model, Dr. Werner von Braun, at Cape Canaveral.Sonny Hickam is on his way to fulfilling his dreams as the book begins. However there a few obstacles on the way. Troubles in his family prevent Sonny from leading an easy, carefree life. His mother, Elsie, is growing increasingly impatient with Sonny's father. Sonny's father, Homer, is the mine superintendent and with the opening of a dangerous new mine, 11 East; ultimately, he is home even less often than usual. The strain on the marriage becomes too much for Sonny's mother and she insists on leaving Coalwood to escape to Myrtle Beach in order to sell real estate. In addition to his domestic hardships, Sonny is having troubles with himself. Every so often, although only lasting a few minutes, Sonny will find himself engulfed in an unexplainable grief. This mystery baffles Sonny day after day. As he searches for the origin of this mystery grief, he learns more than he ever imagined. Sonny's emotions and adventures are vividly depicted through a truly sentimental story, splashed with humor in all the right places. The writing style of Homer Hickam in this memoir is once again captivating and absolutely unforgettable.Although one may think memoirs aren't written well due to the lack of an experienced writer, The Coalwood Way reads like an old time fable. It is written in such a way that you are taken from your own world and thrown into the small town in West Virginia. Hickam depicts Coalwood in such a way that the image of every part of the quaint town is etched into your mind. His method of writing will bring you to tears when tragedy strikes and laughter when Sonny finds himself in a humorous predicament.This memoir is all about finding yourself and realizing that whenever life trips you up, someone will always be there to catch you when you fall. Throughout this lucid story, Sonny tries to find himself, and while looking down on his beloved town, he finally realizes the answer to what he's being puzzling all along. He understands his feelings, thinking: \\"My parents, and all the people of Coalwood, had given me the only true gifts they could ever give, that of their wisdom, and of their dreams, and of their love. All fear, sadness, and anger inside me had vanished. I knew who I was and where I came from and who my people were. I was ready to leave because I could never leave.\\" Once Sonny realizes he can let go of the past, he is able to finally leave his hometown with the closure he needs to succeed."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I read Rocket Boys (also known as October Sky) and fell in love with it. Then I read The Coalwood Way and I have to say Hooray for Sonny, the Rocket Boys, and Coalwood! May they forever live! This novel is a bit different than the first in the series but in its way as absorbing and more fun. I found myself laughing out loud many times, then reaching for the Kleenex at others. Sonny Hickam is a boy who is reacting to his environment - his father's coldness toward him, his mother's arch determination to let him figure out his own way, his discovery of the little fawn in the woods, his faltering love for Dorothy Plunk and his growing love for Ginger, then the aching reality of Dreama who only wants to be a &quot;Coalwood girl&quot; but never can be. I recommend this book for anyone who loves a good read. You will also grow in understanding of the general human condition. As Sonny says, the wheel keeps turning for us all. If you care for anyone, buy this book and present it to them with your love. They will always thank you for it."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"The book took me on a magical, nostalgic trip back in time when I lived my childhood in a small town just a few miles from Coalwood...such a wonderful trip!

Instead, you find yourself lost in the magnificent little town of Coalwood and its colorful and engaging citizenry. If all you know of this story is the movie October Sky, forget it. The movie is a surface treatment of a magnificent and deep story of life and love in Coalwood in the 1950's and early 1960's. The movie was a Hollywood treatment that left out the better parts of Homer's books. Homer is called Sonny in these books and, of course, his dad is Homer (Senior). It's just one place the movie got it all wrong. There is a Christmas aspect to The Coalwood Way that is exciting and strangely satisfying (I'm Jewish). For one of the few times in my life, I was able to understand the Christmas spirit. Sonny Hickam taught me that in his delightful way. This book made me laugh and it made me cry. What else could possibly be wanted from a book than that? Highly, highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I liked The Coalwood Way very much. It is every bit as good as Rocket Boys. I found myself laughing in many places and sad in others.In this book, Hickam revisits incidents covered only briefly in Rocket Boys, but don't worry. There's plenty of new material here to entertain. This time, though, the town of Coalwood takes more of a major role. We get to know both new and familiar characters as they alternately cope with and enjoy life in Coalwood.It is a vastly satisfying read!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Another excellent read from Homer Hickam! I can never truly know what it was like to grow up in Coalwood and to understand this small mining community's ways. But, for a brief time while reading this book I felt as if I had lived there, felt the turmoil, confusion, bitterness, love and happiness Mr. Hickam writes about. Homer Hickam does an excellent job of painting pictures with words."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"The continuation of the Rocket Boys story kept me reading with much delight. The additions to the first book help the reader to get to know Sonny and the rest of the Rocket Boys on a deeper level. Homer Hickam shares his life experiences with inspiratation and great sense of humor."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Hickam has managed yet again to captivate the imagination with &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; by bringing us into his hometown again. This is a wonderful story about a boy becoming a man, and the complex emotions that come into play during such a turbulent period. Hickam brings humor to the story in unique moments that catch the reader by surprise. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Although there is certainly some saddness in this book, the overwhelming feeling I was left with was that of warmth. Hickam shares much more than his early efforts at building rockets, he shares life's lessons and the importance of learning from what life gives you. The book is really about people.....and not just those from West Virginia. An easy-to-read, pick it up when you have time kind of book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"To Win Idle: I must say that I disagree with several of the points you make in your review. First of all, I loved &quot;Rocket Boys,&quot; and that is why I decided to read &quot;The Coalwood Way.&quot; &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; is a great novel with a fantastic story. It is unfortunate the sequel couldn't live up to the original.Where you love the \\"return to the fullness of [Sonny's] senior high school year,\\" I find it boring, and often confusing. The timeframe keeps switching throughout the memoir. Sometimes Hickam refers to things that he had already discussed in &quot;Rocket Boys,&quot; and sometimes he introduces new material. It is constantly hard to tell exactly what's going on, and where the story is taking place. Especially towards the beginning, I find this to be far from the great novel that you describe. Maybe the difference in opinion comes because you enjoy the detail that Hickam uses in this second book, and I find it tedious. It seems fairly obvious to me that all the action was used up in the first book, and nothing \\"good\\" was left for the sequel. This story is made up of filler material that was (rightfully) omitted from &quot;Rocket Boys.&quot;I, too, see the message you write of (what it's like to fight through the hard times), but I don't find the story as emotionally intense as you do. In this sequel, we learn only about some of Sonny's schoolboy crushes, but we don't discover anything more that really lets us come to a better understanding of Sonny as a person. It is true that the ending of the book is far superior to the opening. However, Win Idle, you are over exaggerating the amount that the reader will learn about himself by discovering Coalwood. You also over emphasize Hickam's use of emotion. For the most part, I see &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; as a rather dry narrative. To everyone: If you want to read the \\"meat\\" of the story of Homer Hickam and his amazing accomplishments, pick up &quot;Rocket Boys,&quot; because that's where the real excitement is."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Bought and reviewed Homer H Hickam Jr. 's. Torpedo Junction,The Dinosaur Hunter and Rocket Boys all 5 stars. October Sky DVD ... 5 stars. Homer Hickam Jr is a great author.His Coalwood Way is the 2nd of 3 in the series of Coalwood. So far Rocket Boys (retitled October Sky) was the best 5 stars plus. The Coalwood Way was close and a great book 4 1/2 to 5 stars.This is not a continuation of Rocket Boys but a deeper showing of Coalwood and its citizens during Homer's late teenage years late 1950s-1960. The town citizens development is superb. We gain much empathy with the true citizens. The book was a page burner. I read the 318 page big in a little over 1 day. No boring parts. Homer is a natural great story teller and The Coalwood Way flows easily as more people are introduced and activities happen. No boring parts.We see the dangerous coal mining method of \\"Long wall\\". Mine superintendent, Homer's dad must do what he can to try to increase tonnage produced to keep the mine open. The parent company wants to close it or lay off more and more men. We see the fighting of management and union coal mining workers.Further episodes with obnoxious big brother football player Jim are shown. A few more sprinkling of girls in young Homer's life as well as his Rocket Boys club members. More rocket description and flights. The reader sees the loving mother giving council and letting Homer find his own way; what he wants to do in later life. The strict Dad who finally starts showing more love for his second son Homer. Plus all the great kids,people of Rocket Boy and more!I gained empathy with an outside the town, young woman named Dreama who just wanted to fit in. The town women want nothing to do with her, She shacks up with an older, blasting miner jerk. He beats the hell out of her, knocking a tooth out out and messing up her face.Dreama goes back to him and eventually he stabs her to death. Previously at a Christmas Santa showing she sits on Santa's knee and says \\"All I want to be is a Coalwood girl\\". I shed a tear when she was killed.Homer's Mom's pet, half tailed, squirrel \\"Chipper\\" who had escaped comes back home for Christmas. Homer's Dad finally shows more love for Homer and the big Christmas Padget is saved.I won't ruin this great book by describing it too much. A great ending. I shed a tear.So far Homer H Hickam Jr. is 4 for 4 in the books I've read....5 stars all. Next for me to read is Sky of Stone the 3rd in the Coalwood series, plus I bought 3 more books of his to read. Again The Coalwood Way 4 1/2 -5 stars and recommended."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"&quot;Rocket Boys&quot; was indeed a great novel with a fantastic story. Its sequel is as well, although it is a decidedly different book, both in content and tone. I loved both and marvel anew at Mr. Hickam's ability as a writer to turn the mundane into glory.The novel begins with a brief retrospective (although Hickam is clever to place it within the action so it doesn't seem as if he's bringing the reader up to date, especially the reader who hasn't read October Sky). All his main characters are firmly in place by the end of Chapter One. Where October Sky was really about Sonny's relationship to his father, The Coalwood Way is really his mother's book so keep an eye on Elsie! It is important to realize that The Coalwood Way actually takes place during the same timeframe as October Sky, actually before the science fairs. Readers who think they know the October Sky book because they've seen the movie are often confused by this if they start the series with The Coalwood Way. People, the movie is filled with errors about this story - Sonny (Homer) didn't win a scholarship! Sonny didn't quit school! Sonny didn't go to work in the mine! The true October Sky story is vastly richer than the good but essentially simple-minded story told in the movie.In the Coalwood Way, we learn so much more about the Hickam family, its relationship to Coalwood, and the really harsh rules that govern the people who live there. Although she actually occupies only a small part of the story, probably the most fascinating character is Dreama, the girl from the rough town of Gary. All she wants to be is a Coalwood girl. I won't reveal what happens to her except to say her tragedy represents all the is wrong with Coalwood society although its aftermath represents all that is good.To sum up, this is a grand book. For Jan Karon fans, this is the Mitford tale told true, and far, far richer than those books. Still, if you like Karon, you'll love Hickam!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Homer Hickam has found his niche in Coalwood, as a member of the Big Creek Missile Agency, the Rocket Boys as they are known. Now a high school senior, he has come more into his own, his older brother Jim, away at college on a football scholarship. With only Homer and his parents at home, the subtle tensions of their lives take on more energy. Homer's mom, a dreamer like him, has to come to terms with small town life, being a company man's wife,and her unfulfilled dreams . His father, the mine superintendent, has to learn new mining techniques, deal with the union dissention and find some common ground with his son, who has absolutely no interest in mining. Jim discovers that college life is more challenging than high school. The mining company is leaning on the superintendent to make cuts, and Coalwood and the neighboring areas are suffering financial hardships like never before. In the midst of this all, Homer continues his quest to build a better rocket, and to some day make it to Cape Canaveral. But he and his friends also deal with the every day trivals of growing up, family disappointments, girls, the realization of both the good and bead people can do to each other, and the doubts that lie within. This is a sequel that is the equal of the first book...a delight to read. I hope there are more books to follow."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"The Coalwood Way is a book for all seasons but it has a built-in Christmas story, too. I'm looking for this one on television in a couple of years. Who could resist that final scene at the Coalwood Pageant when Sonny reads from the Bible except it isn't exactly from the Bible, is it? At every turn, Hickam throws us a curve. I was continuously surprised. I laughed out loud a lot, shed a tear here and there. Hickam is a marvelously gifted story teller. Hope he keeps writing these little gems."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"The Coalwood Way struck a resonant chord in me. &quot;Way&quot; has given me a lot to think about, about love, and parenting, and even religion. Homer is digging deep here. I'm going to read it again because the more I think about it, I believe there is real wisdom to be found here. It's a great read and I was enjoying it, thinking this is a wonderful story, but then something seemed to hit me right between the eyes, something profound. This is an unusual book. Something is going on here far more than a simple book about a little town. In a time when there's a lot of fear out there, I think we all need to understand the Coalwood way. It just might be the best way there is. I'm sorry I don't mean to preach. I'm not that religious but I'm really thinking now."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"But he did. Now, thanks to Homer, I've lost another night's sleep. Just as with October Sky, as soon as I started reading The Coalwood Way, I couldn't put it down. But at least my Christmas list is solved. Not only is this a great book, I realized it's a Christmas story, too. I don't usually cry when I read a book but when Sonny (Homer) and Sherman find the little fawn in the wood, I have to tell you I got pretty teary. Congratulations, Homer. You've told another great story. You've got a fan for life."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"If you're like me and you find the self-absorbed narcissism of recent memoirists like Mary Karr or Spike Gillespie to be fingernails on the blackboard of the soul, you just may adore the good old-fashioned literary sensibility of Homer Hickam. Lyrical, warm, empathetic, inspiring, tragic, funny, earnest, and poignant, Hickam's writing is to be read, savored, and read again. If you've read ROCKET BOYS, or seen the movie version, which was filmed as OCTOBER SKY, you have a sense of the treasures that lie to be discovered in THE COALWOOD WAY.Ms. Karr built on a successful first memoir by mining her sex life for cheap bathos and brutalizing (in a literary sense) her dysfunctional family. Hickam now builds on a successful first memoir by doing something far more instructive, worthwhile, and readable: he has constructed something meaningful out of his own family dysfunction, drawing lessons out of his painful past and, out of consideration for his reader, one surmises, delivering it in a way that acknowledges that readers today have choices, and need not stay with a memoirist who doesn't give a damn about them.Hop off of the rat race for a few afternoons, turn off Oprah and Jerry Springer, and immerse yourself in Hickam's fluid, enchanting story. You'll come away touched, and changed."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"There is something about Mr. Hickam's writing that draws you in immediately. It seems that each and every word that he writes is meaningful not just as a word in a sentence, but in the overall context of the novel. It is almost like poetry, but a kind of no-frills, down-to-earth poetry.But it is not really the words that you recognize when you read the novel. It is more the way he tells you the story, the patient, completely trusting way that you learn about him. He writes this book for the whole world to see, and you get the feeling that he bares his soul and trusts you completely. It is this trusting ability that he imparts that is so compelling about his works because although he is a great writer and shaper of phrases, it is ultimately his voice, even more than his message, which will keep you focused in the novel. Moreover, he has a gift of being able to impart whatever feelings he has at the moment onto the page, and in doing so, puts you into his world.This novel has been called an equal of Rocket Boys, but I think that in some ways, this novel is even better. It focuses more on the people of the town instead of showing Mr. Hickam's childhood. I also find this novel more honest and realistic of the his life. There are parts in Rocket Boys where you don't get the full story and which are covered in this book. These parts may not be the wonderful, life-always-turns-out-great kind of stories, but that's life. I think that the idea that life's not always fair, but you do what you can is conveyed even more clearly in this novel than in Rocket Boys.Having said all this though, I must admit that I like Rocket Boys more. It is not that this book is written more poorly (no, on the contrary, this book feels more mature), but simply because I enjoyed the details of Mr. Hickams early forays into the world of rocketry in that earlier book. However, The Coalwood Way is most certainly my second favorite book and I would recommend everyone to read this fascinating memoir."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I absolutely love this timeless classic by Homer Hickam! I'm just 17 years old, but know an awesome story when I read one! Homer's first book Rocket Boys changed my life. His book made me realize what life has in store for you when you take risks! The Coalwood Way is an excellent 2nd book in this &quot;series&quot;. Mr. Hickam writes in such a way that it grasps you and wont let you quit reading. His style is perfect to read out loud to students in a classsroom setting. In fact, I plan on reading these books to my class when I become the band teacher I've always wanted to be. Thanx Mr. Hickam for this truly generous and awesome look into your exciting life as a coalwood boy!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Homer goes deeper into his life in Coalwood, the tensions in his home because of his father's love of mining and his mother's fear of the spot on her husbands' lung, and also the mores (the ways) of the tiny mining town. But as with all of Homer's works, there are laugh-out-loud places (I love Chipper the squirrel) and other places that I swear he makes tears come to my eyes. It's not just the story - as good as it is. It is the writing. It is at times lyrical and has an ebb and flow to it I find a bit mesmerizing. In other words, it's just a darn good read and I'm happy to say so. This is my first review."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I did not want to put this book down. I just wanted to turn the pages and keep reading as fast as I could. The story is done in detail, giving the true deep-seated emotions felt by each and every character. Being a coal miner's daughter, I could relate to each and every challenge the characters were faced with in reality as well as in their own minds. This gives people of that era some food for thought about the life and times, trials, and tribulations that were common in those days even for the &quot;King of the Coal Mines&quot; (Homer, Sr). The author has a gift for telling a story so that the reader feels he becomes one of the characters. I hope the author will continue to share his gift for many years to come."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I'm 13 years old and i really enjoyed \\"The Coalwood Way\\". After reading October Sky for a class book in school, i bought this book. If you liked October SKy, i'd recommend this book to you. I loved reading about more of Sonny's adventures and some details not mentioned in Oct. Sky. Overall, i loved this book and i plan on reading the next book, Sky of Stone. HOpe this helps!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"The Coalwood Way is by far the best book I have read this year. The story and the writing style grab you back to the couch to read another chapter every time. The only bad part is that the story was not longer, but that's why this is a trilogy. I am now rushing to order Hickman's next novel in the series!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Another excellent book by Homer Hickam, If you don't read the trilogy you're missing a true West Virginia experience"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"i read Rocket Boys, which i loved, and then moved on to the Coalwood Way. i was rather disappointed when i started it. it wasn't that it was about a period of time covered in rocket boys - i knew that already. but what i loved about rocket boys was the portrayal of a small town, and the coalwood way basically repeats that subject, which i think was pretty well covered already in Rocket boys.so this book isn't a must-read, like rocket boys. but it's still pretty good, as i discovered after getting throught the first couple introductory chapters (which mostly just repeated things said in rocket boys). there's still plenty of new plot material - there's dreama, a girl living with an abusive man out of wedlock, who just wants to be accepted by the town's women. then there's sonny's girl-related woes, mostly centered around a girl named ginger (there's very litttle dorothy plunk, for those of you sick of her from rocket boys). then there's sonny's relationship with both his parents, and with his brother. (sonny is homer, in case you don't know.)this is sort of an alternative to rocket boys, telling some of the same messages from different angles. if you've already read rocket boys, read some of the other books on your list first."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Awesome! Homer follows his Rocket Boys book with, as a friend of mine put it, a WONDERFUL Christmas story! Definitely a great read."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"This book is not about rockets. But then, neither was Rocket Boys, when you think about it. Rockets happen to be the glue that held the vignettes in the first story together, but it's so much more than that. It is a memoir in the truest sense of the word, getting you into Sonny's skin and letting you see and feel the world, in all its coldness and warmth, through his eyes.This book is even more a series of vignettes than the first one, because some of the stories seem to stand almost on their own, ala James Herriot. But it is a deeper, more moving and more relentlessly heartbreaking read than Rocket Boys, because Sonny is experiencing some really tough times. Anyone who has a long-dead father they are still trying to please (I don't, so can't empathize as much) will be crying as they read this book.But I say this in a good way. The same warmth is still there, and even when it is not, when he feels cold toward the world or misses an opportunity, Sonny beats himself over the head, so you don't have to.All of Homer's books are too good to miss, and this one is no exception."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"The book The Coalwood Way by Homer Hickam is an excellent read. Out of a five scale rating, I give it a five. It was truly, an incredible book. Memoirs are very hard pieces to write and Homer Hickam did an outstanding way of helping the reader know what it was like growing up in a town during the 1950's and 1960's. Another reason a rated this book a five out of five was that he has first-rate description. He describes incidents that happened over forty years ago almost flawlessly. \\"A serious little rocket (Auk XXII-E), it began its journey with a mighty spout of flame and turmoil and its shock wave rattled out wooden blockhouse as it climbed.\\" The Book starts out in the fall of 1959 when Homer and the Big Creek Missile Academy (BCMA) launch the Auk XXII-E. Homer Hickam talks about a variety of subjects in this book. He talks about the hazards of 11 East, his friendly pet squirrel Chipper, and obstacles they had to overcome with improving their rocket design. And last reason I rate this book five out of five is because it has a message within. The book, for me, told me that you can achieve anything if you put your mind to it. Homer Hickam co-founded the BCMA with a few friends just wanting to have some fun with rockets. And with his gain in knowledge of rocketry, and payload, he wound up working for NASA. If that isn't an inspirational story, what is? In conclusion, I recommend this book to any Homer Hickam fan or even a person who has never even heard of him before. This is truly, an unforgettable read."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"This book is the story of a Christmas miracle unlike any you've ever read. Coalwood in a time of snow and crisis, where Sonny is afflicted with a strange sadness, Homer (Senior) is fighting against a terrible enemy in the mine, the deer are starving, Mrs. Hickam is cut off from her friends and neighbors, a poor girl only wants to be a &quot;Coalwood girl&quot; and then... a miracle, a truly wonderful miracle all the more miraculous in that it is true. I shant spoil it except to say that I had tears streaming down my cheeks when the deer came out of the mountains during the Christmas Pageant. Why this isn't an annual television Christmas special my goodness I really don't know. Television is missing something special here - I hope maybe next year we'll see it."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I notice there's quite a number of other favorable reviews. I'll just add that I enjoyed this book as much as any I've read in the past year. The term 'modern classic' is thrown around quite often these days, but this book may very well be one."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"My heart and soul have been stirred by this book and now I have the experience of hearing from my students to whom I assigned it this past year. You see, I had been trying to figure out some things about myself and then somebody gave me this book. I hadn't read October Sky but I have since - it's magnificent, too. Homer (Sonny) Hickam tells a story here of true values, of miracles, of passionate truth. I'm in love with all the wonderful people of Coalwood. I intend to attend the October Sky Festival there this year. I especially liked the story of the deer on Christmas Eve. I will be assigning this one to my class permanently so that my students can appreciate how a memoir should be written. I believe Homer Hickam will ultimately be classified as among the greatest of American authors. May there always be another in this wonderful series!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was. The same story told second time is just boring. The first one had a backbone: boys trying to achieve the goal despite the circumstances. The second one - ranomly selected stories about this or that - I simply don't care. Meaningless and boring"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Homer Hickman \\"Sonny\\" has had an amazing senior year in high school. With a mixture of friendship, love, and death the story is amazing."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I'm more of a World War 2 fan and read alot of WW2 stuff, but even so this book was excellent. Homer is da bomb. I saw \\"Rocket Boys\\" 10 years ago and this book was very similar to that movie, even though they are of different periods. I didn't know how good these books were, but should have after watching rocket boys. This book is great."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"The first paragraph took me back to a movie about these same characters in the same setting. Sure enough, the jacket tells us \\"Coalwood\\" is from the author of \\"Rocket Boys\\"--the memoir on which the film \\"October Sky\\" was based.But this is not a sequel so much as it is a second look; nor is it a memoir so much as a stream of reveries, loosely woven around the disparate themes of Appalachian poverty, small town society, union-management conflict, teenage romance, and intra-family relationships. The author says he vividly recalls the episodes he relates after all these 40 years, and that, as Quentin would say, is prodigious.For all that, the book is fun to read in the same sense a Walt Disney movie is fun to watch. Both are G-rated and have happy endings, and both give us an escape. Moreover, the author and the characters,(except for the absurd Quentin), speak with a homey vocabulary.Though the book is as densly populated as a Dickens novel, chararacter development is not this author's long suit. Indeed, we're left with the feeling of having merely brushed by most of the people we encounter. Take O'Dell, who charms the socks off the staid Mrs. Hickam with such ease that I felt sure we were about to meet an Appalachian Eddy Haskell. Alas, he just never fills out.Then there are the nagging implausibles:In describing a new rocket nozzle the narrator tells us \\"[it was] a shade too large, probably because of me (sic) trying to design with a fat lead pencil and a large scale ruler\\". Come on now. This is a rocket engineer talking; one who must be well versed in mechanical drawing, and who's bound to know that though drawings are made to scale (within media limits) it's the written dimensions which determine exactly how a part gets built.As for the home-made theodolite the boys use calculate a rocket's apogee, we're told that they taught themselves how to do this after someone \\"gave them an old trigonometry book\\" (groan, groan). The author says he was studying calculus, for which, as any high schooler will tell you, trig is a pre-req, and calculating of the height of a flagpole from the length of it's shadow is one of the first trig exercises.Nor does it make any sense at all to suppose that a boy who studied physics and calculus wouldn't even recognize a slide rule or drawing instruments.I enjoyed the book for all that; of course I liked Davy Crocket and Old Yeller too."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"This is not to the same level of The Rocket Boys, which is a story much better told. However, The Coalwood Way is an interesting read, especially for those who truly liked The Rocket Boys.For one thing, i was a bit disappointed about the author's foreword. He swears that even though the events in the book passed so long ago (1959), he remembers everything in tremendous detail. If he hadn't said that, i wouldn't have even thought about it. As a person with very bad memory, i don't believe him.Some of the characters are described to a point that they almost seem caricatures. I couldn't help think of Martin on The Simpsons when reading about Quentin. Roy Lee reminded me of Elvis Presley in one of his cheesy movies.The memoir almost redeemed itself in page 267 (chapter 27), when Sonny finally realizes what has been bugging him all along (here's something i wish i had done: jot down the items on Sonny's list as you read along). That discovery makes the book worthwhile. However, the memoir ends with the Christmas Pageant, and that image really ruined the moment for me."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"\\"The Coalwood Way\\" is the part 2 contiuation of the \\"Rocket Boys\\", AKA:\\"October Sky\\". I just really like the way Mr. Hickam tells his story in his books. I find them to be \\"Americana\\" like- a success story from a humble start. I think the series could be a must read for middle and high school students as a way to see their potential in their own future and not just the here and now. A great book (and series) to read!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Brilliant, I took me only 2 days to finish this book, a great book to follow Rocket Boys (aka October Sky). Hickam is amazing, he can take you there to Coalwood and do what many cannot, really make you feel the emotions and story he is telling, it reads like a fiction novel, but it is his memoirs and very few writers can accomplish with fictional works what he has with this series of books. I hope he keeps writing, I cannot wait to sample his Back to the Moon (fiction) also."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"This coming of age tale is full of wisdom and insight,especially about one's identity. Though Homer Hickhamwent on to become successful as a rocket scientist, whatis most interesting and important about this story is hisawareness of his roots, gritty and trying as they sometimeswere for him, a gifted boy growing up in a poor coalminingtown. I always love to read about real people - the characters in this book are endearing and he's a very goodwriter. I would say it's a classic, it will last, and I think it ought to be given to young people to read. It would make a good Christmas or birthday gift for a teenager."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Homer Hickam's October Sky was one of the best books that I have read. Now, Hickum returns to Coalwood to detail his life further in the Coalwood way. Set during and slightly after October Sky, Homer and his friends have to struggle to have their normal lives as well as their rocket work. Homer disapoints his mother, who lost her pet squirrel due to his carelessness and refuses to forgive him. Homer's social life is failing and so is the mine that his father works at. Everything seems to fall apart.The one thing that seems to bind the town together is the Christmas pagent that is coming up, and the one that his mother insists on doing alone, without any help.It was hard to put this book down. I had to find out what would happen between Homer and his friends and family, and the book just flew by. It is a very good emotional piece of work and well written."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"After having finished Homer Hickam's &quot;The Coalwood Way,&quot; I am even more convinced that the author is a true national treasure, a man so good and wise that his moral compass should be the one we as a people use to set our public and private ethics. Not only is &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; a noble and vigorous sequel to &quot;October Sky,&quot; the memoir can stand on its own merits as it explores how an ever-growing and conflicted teen-ager struggles with incipient manhood and dissects the hiddent strengths and weaknesses of a small West Virginia mining town. Hickam's graceful narrative style includes absolutely marvelous dialogue and vivid, memorable characterizations. Towards the conclusion of the work, Hickam could well be describing his own work: &quot;Sometimes a writer has to trust his audience to understand that words are as much art as definition.&quot;&quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; permits Hickam to thoroughly explain the first semester of his senior year in high school, the seminally important fall and winter of 1959. Having experienced initial successes (after numerous failures) in rocket design and propulsion, Homer Hickam must come to grips with a series of anxieties which defy his understanding and sap his confidence. Increasing doubts ultimately lead to an uncharacteristic submission to self-pity; Homer determines to quit...to quit his dreams, his aloof, demanding father, his own commitments to himself. Yet, it is a late epiphany which gently guides the maturing young man to a true acceptance and glorious affirmation of the Coalwood way...of commitment to a task, a loyalty to friends and family, a sense of interdependence with local and global community. The narrative drive of the last one hundred pages is breathtaking and wrenching. I unabashedly was weeping the last third of the memoir.Yet, &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; vibrates with humor, irony and humor. Hickam's characterizations ring with truth, and several characters emerge as even more compelling people than they had in his marvelous initial memoir. Elsie Hickam, Homer's mother, is simplyan extraordinately admirable woman; her resolute strength in the face of her own dashed expectations and her prescient knowledge of the demise of Coaltown matches her commitment to her beleaguered husband and two sons. She is fierce in her love and unbreakable in her resolve to see Homer reach his full potential. The intellectual Quentin receives royal treatment; he blossoms as a young man acutely aware of his physical poverty and mental acuity. Hickam provides numerous examples of Quentinese (conveniently translated for us) and quietly holds up his friend as a model of steadfast dedication to the life of the mind. Homer's sex life receives wry (and often unheeded) guidance from the redoubtable Big Creek lovemaster, Roy Lee Cooke.Since Hickam is serious about his personal and social analysis, he draws the character of Dreama with enormous tenderness and compassion. Slandered by most of the conventional women in town, Dreama yearns to be accepted. This young adult woman, an outsider without credentials, so wishes for acceptance by the community that she submits to a catastrophic abusive relationship. Hickam painfully records her life and notes the intersections between Dreama's unfulfilled hopes and his own growing fears about his own self-sufficiency. Dreama will remain in our literary memory for a long, long time.&quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; affirms Homer Hickam's importance as an interpreter of our national character. This sure-handed, deeply satisfying memoir should find a place in our personal libraries."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"This is an excellent read--especially about a place we can all relate to. There is a little of Coalwood in us all. I recommend this book to anyone interested in life's lessons from a practical point of view. Although, I must admit I did enjoy &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; much better, this is more enjoyable than most follow-up books. In addition, the movie &quot;October Sky&quot; is a must see."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I just finished reading The Coalwood Way and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a magical book that really touches your heart. I loved it because I got to see a way of life that I will never experience. Hickam has done it again. Thank you for sharing your memories with us."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Homer Hickam's easy writing style and touching childhood remembrances take those of us who read Rocket Boys/October Sky back to Coalwood, West Virginia. Unlike many authors, Hickam's sequel equals the continuity and warmth of the prior volume. A well-written an entertaining memoir."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I bought this book and got it autographed a few weeks ago in Charleston, West Virginia. I didn't expect this author to come up with anything nearly as good as Rocket Boys, but he has. He really has. I can't wait for the next one. A fellow West Virginian."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I'm a big reader. Usually at least one novel a week. This is the best book I've read all year, period. Not too many books leave me feeling as if I am a better person after reading it but this one did. I keep going back and re-reading parts of it. In one place, Little Richard explains to Homer (Sonny) what happens to us after we die. I have to say after hearing all these sermons over the years about that, for the first time I think I have heard the truth. It is toward the end when something awful happens in Coalwood (I have to say it was a big surprise) and I was kind of sad and then there was this great big TRUTH, something I have always wondered about. All I can say is you have to read it to understand what I'm saying."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"If you enjoyed Homer Hickam's Rocket Boys or the movie October Sky, this book is for you. Homer doesn't so much pick up where he left off at the end of Rocket Boys, but rather returns to the fullness of his senior high school year. He weaves a tapestry that provides detail in breadth and depth that keeps the pages turning. You'll suddenly discover it's well past bedtime and you are content to keep reading.Homer discovers truths about himself and others, even as he's about to move away from home. There is always more to learn from one's parents. There are many emotional highs and lows in Coalwood, but lessons learned from both will leave you feeling hopeful for the human spirit. The people of Coalwood continue to display a dogged determination to get though the difficulties, even if they stumble along the way. Not one to cry easily, I found my eyes welling up with tears during the last chapter. It is possible to find great joy and beauty in hard times.Homer doesn't miss on emotion. There's anger, joy, fear, excited anticipation, sorrow, laughter, and contentment. You may very well learn something about yourself while reading The Coalwood Way. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Homer Hickham has done it again!! I loved Rocket Boys so much and didn't think it could happen again. Then along came The Coalwood Way!! This is a marvelous book about life. Homer takes the reader on a journey to a time when lives and times were changing, not always for the best. The author shows us a picture of a coal town and the Country in a period of transition, much like Sonny and his friends in their period of transition from high school, stepping into their future. The story tells us that no matter how bright or strong or motivated someone is, that life can throw some hard curve balls, and it is always good to know that you can count on family, friends and neighbors. Mr. Hickam also points out the importance of looking out for each other and knowing when it is time to step up to the plate for others. The story ends with a brilliant Christmas scene that really tells the reader that we are a wondrous creation molded by all the experiences in our lives, those that happen to us and those that we initiate ourselves and that always, always, the Creator's hand is with us. That he can do all this in &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; without once being preachy is unique. This was an inspiring book, that takes real life examples and attempts to draw the readers along to look at the big picture of life. This book was fun, humorous, introspective, open, honest and very touching. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"While not as lyrical as &quot;Rocket Boys,&quot; Homer Hickam still tells an engrossing tale in his new memoir, &quot;The Coalwood Way.&quot; The same people we grew to love are here: Sonny, Elsie and Homer; the Rev. &quot;Little&quot; Richard; Quentin, Roy Lee and all the Coalwood boys. But instead of focusing on his rocketing exploits, Hickam delves into the psyche of a town that's changing in ways it doesn't even know. This is less a story about Homer Hickam than it is a story about Coalwood, West Virginia. As readers, we're richer for the experience.With the clear eye of a scientist, Hickam focuses on two watershed events in the Christmas of 1959. One delves into the undercurrent of spite and envy that marred his beloved hometown. The other shows a proud man, Homer's father, feverishly working to save his town the only way he knows how -- in the mine. But even that battle has unintended consequences.The book starts a little slowly and the ending seems a little contrived. But it must ring true, or Homer's mother surely would have called him on it. And these are minor flaws in an otherwise excellent story.As someone who lives in West Virginia but didn't grow up here, I never will fully appreciate Homer Hickam's world. But as one who loves the Mountain State and wants to see it thrive, I thank Hickam for sharing Coalwood with the rest of us. Homer Hickam has a message for the Mountain State: Honor the legacy of coal, but let it go. Education and a refusal to quit will take you wherever you wish to go. If those of us he left behind work hard enough, we can make our dreams come true -- without leaving our West Virginia hills."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"In a time when so much that is published and shown in the media is negative and inconsequential, 'The Coalwood Way' uplifts the spirit with the honest reflections of a young man who discovers the secret of growing up. Homer Hickam reveals the deepest longing of his heart as the book carries the reader through a short but significant period of time that changes his life. Homer's heartwarming self-searching is so reflective of what I experienced as a teen that I'm certain that many others can also relate to his story. The Coalwood Way is not a sequel to Rocket Boys but rather an 'equal' that enlarges upon the relationships and complex personalities of the characters in the town. Homer (who is as sincere and nice as he comes across in the story, and is married to ones of the most beautiful and talented ladies around) seems to unroll the story like a red carpet, encouraging the reader to follow and explore the richness of this coal mining community in southern WV. My husband, daughter and I have visited Coalwood several times and spent time with the gracious people who live there and who are working so hard to bring restoration to this gem of a town. There is a proud spirit among the citizens and that rare closeness that the word 'community' stands for. The reader of Homer's Coalwood books are able to experience this spirit. If you are wondering what exactly Homer means by 'The Coalwood Way' I encourage you to read the book. It's one of those 'life lessons' we need to share with our kids, model ourselves, and encourage in others. Warm, rich, uplifting, thoughtful, and engrossing. It's a rare treat to find an author like Homer who writes with consistent integrity and unashamed joy. I'm so thankful he is working on a third book and can hardly wait to read it!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Aimlessly wandering the fiction aisles of the library, glumly looking over the \\"been-there-done-that\\" Grisham novels, wishfully scanning the Hiaasen section in slim hopes of finding something new, when out of the corner of my eye, I caught a name on a book spine: Homer H. Hickam Jr. I instantly recognized the name as a character from one of my all-time favorite movies, \\"October Sky\\". I pulled the book, expecting it to be \\"Rocket Boys\\", the memoir on which the movie was based. I had always meant to pick up that book and get more familiar with the story that so captivated me in the movie. Only, the title of this book was \\"The Coalwood Way\\". Instantly, I knew that my browsing malaise was cured (funny how that often works)!Not only did I now have a chance to get more familiar with the \\"Rocket Boys\\" story and characters, but I also had a whole other novel with which to do it. For, you see, this memoir isn't really a sequel to the aforementioned book, but actually an expansion of a section of the original story; a kind of story within a story. Think of it as zooming in on just one section of a fractal image to see all of the intricate details within the new image.The scope of the first memoir was pretty much the entire high school career of Homer (Sonny) and the Rocket Boys and focused predominantly on their exploits with amateur rocketry. But, the real charm of the original story came from the background setting and people of Coalwood, West (by God) Virginia. The boys of the Big Creek Missile Agency (BCMA) still play a big part in this story that spans basically only one year of high school from roughly Christmas of their junior year through Christmas of their senior year. However, this time around, rocketry plays second fiddle as we delve much deeper into the lush background and learn more about Sonny's deep roots in Coalwood and how really fortunate (and bittersweet) it was that he and the rest of the boys of the BCMA could escape that life.Having seen the movie first, I found myself constantly imposing the images of the actors onto the characters in the book, which wasn't always such a bad thing since all of the characters in the movie were wonderfully cast. The only time this was a problem was with the group of boys, which in the movie numbered four, but in the book numbered six! It seems that possibly as many as three characters in the books, Sherman, O'Dell and Billy, were all \\"merged\\" into one character, Sherman O'Dell, in the movie. Not much of a problem, though, as Hickam's eloquent prose quickly conjured up images for all six young men.In this story, the town of Coalwood really comes alive. I instantly felt like I could have grown up there myself and maybe, in a way, I did. Hickam has an uncanny ability to touch the heartstrings of just about any American man (and possibly woman as well) who grew up in and around that time period, regardless of geographic location. We all have either shared a common anecdote or experienced an unrequited, adolescent love like he describes in his books (I was just crushed when Ginger told him that they would just be great friends). The ending of this book did seem a bit sappy and contrived but, darn it, I felt like it really needed to have a storybook ending. The beleaguered folks of Coalwood deserved one, even if it probably didn't actually happen exactly like that (i.e. historical fiction).I immensely enjoyed this book. So much so, that I have since gone back and read the original \\"Rocket Boys\\" and then skipped forward to read the third book in the series \\"Sky of Stone\\". I'll probably also buy his non-fiction book \\"Torpedo Junction\\" and his true fiction novel \\"Back to the Moon\\". But, this is the one that started it for me. I think I have found another favorite author!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"When I started Coalwood Way, I thought, &quot;These are the same characters as those in OCTOBER SKY; how can I love them more? What more can I learn about them that will make this book enjoyable?&quot;Opening the book on a Saturday night, I could not put it down until I finished on Sunday. I watched Homer's &quot;problems list&quot; closely and felt as if I were right there in his troubled heart and pulled for him to solve the mystery- perhaps allowing me to solve mine. I listened to the credit he gave his father, although Homer Jr. felt as if he couldn't do enough, let alone good enough, for Homer Sr. and win his approval.Homer has done a wonderful job in exploring the age-old struggle between children and parents. He explores the parent-child, teacher-student, friend-friend, and self-self relationships by delving more deeply into the souls of each, even exposing us to the idea that the heavens indeed hold much more than we will ever understand. And it all is done with great humor! Homer's childhood friend, the preacher, was right-on when he said we are being shaped on God's wheel. We just have to believe in what we're doing.This book is a declaration for working families and an exaltation for all of us who are striving to become something for which we have a passion.I am awaiting another book by Homer Hickam with great anticipation. Cheryl"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Written by the same author of October Sky, about the same period in his childhood, the COALWOOD WAY and OCTOBER SKY cover the exact same themes-a son trying to shine despite the disappointment/disapproval of his father, rocket trial and error, etc-and have the exact same arcs. Minor characters and sub plots are different, however, and are very poignant and engaging.The protagonist, Sonny is an earnest boy with enough flaws to make him interesting. He is smart yet a little too proud; a friend but sometimes too self-centered to see when his closest friends are in trouble; he's handsome yet can't get a date to the senior dance. These imperfections make him the perfect Everyman, easy to root for. Minor characters are well drawn, and some are heartbreaking to watch. Dreama's tragic arc is painful but gives the story a darkness and depth. Her ostracization by town snobs is well-depicted, and shows that the author didn't just sail through his childhood without noticing the little evils that men do. Great read."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Several years ago, ex-NASA engineer Homer Hickam published the first volume of his memoirs, ROCKET BOYS, which was subsequently made into the hit film OCTOBER SKY. In these, the author remembers growing up in the West Virginia coal town of Coalwood in the late 1950s. From the moment he saw the first Soviet Sputnik traverse the night sky in 1957, Homer became obsessed with space, rockets and his hero, Werner von Braun. Along with several high school chums, Hickam built and, after some initial failures, launched several dozen rockets. As high school seniors, the group won a national science fair for their achievements in rocketry.In THE COALWOOD WAY, Homer expands on that period during his final high school year when he was steadily improving the design and performance of his missiles, but before he won the national competition that was the culminating triumph of his first book. This second volume of memoirs focuses less on rocketry than the other challenges Hickam faced in his hometown and personal life. His father, the mine superintendent, is a stern workaholic who demonstrates little overt love for his second son (while being more lavish with his firstborn, Jim). His mother, Elsie, is increasingly disenchanted with her marriage and life in Coalwood, and wants to move to Florida to sell real estate. Miners are being laid off by the parent company, an Ohio steel manufacturer. Families are going hungry. There's talk of a strike. Homer is driven to get all A's in school to be able to escape his environment, go to college, and ultimately work at Cape Canaveral. And, of course, there's the distraction of girls, and deciding whom to take to the Christmas Formal. After all, Melba June did sidle up close and say in a throaty voice, \\"I just love your rockets.\\"That THE COALWOOD WAY is less inspiring then its predecessor, and that Hollywood is unlikely to consider it material for the silver screen, shouldn't detract from the fact that it's a poignant coming-of-age story with an attractive hero. Delightfully, the author can be occasionally humorous in a homespun sort of way, as when he observes of preachers:\\"Did failure to volunteer information count as a lie? I didn't think it did though I wouldn't have wanted to put that question to a preacher. It was my experience that preachers could get snagged on the details and miss the big picture entirely.\\"Perhaps my favorite character in the whole book is Elsie. As Moms should be, she seems eternally wise. She doesn't hesitate to occasionally tweak her husband's stiff-necked obstinacy, and there are no shenanigans that Homer is getting into, or considering, that she doesn't know of. It is she I most look forward to reading about in Homer's next volume of memories, SKY OF STONE."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Today, I heard Homer speak to a group of Tech Prep educators in Charlotte. His talk moved many in the audience to tears and cheers. I hadn't read his book, just seen the movie, so I decided to give his new one a try. I am now a committed fan. He really knows how to tell a story, out loud, and in a book. He said Rocket Boys was being taught in a lot of English classes and some the teachers at the conference confirmed it. Now I know why. Coalwood Way is a moving tribute to a small town, to parents, to teachers, and to life."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"I have lived in West Virginia all my life. I know how hard life is, to find a job and raise a family. I also know how proud most West Virginia's are of the state. I have traveled all over this great nation, and I can honestly say, West Virginia is one of the most beautiful states in the Union. I have also visited Coalwood on several occasions. The people are great, they are willing to tell there story.Most of the housing that existed when Homer was growing up still exist and people still live in them. Homer boyhood home still sits on the corner in the center of what is know as Coalwood. There are no new houses in the town. I do hope that some day the people of Coalwood will be able to expand the town and have a greater tourism draw. If you ever get a chance to visit the town, stop by the only gas station/store and sign the visitors book and become a part of history."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"It is the fall of 1959 in the small coal mining town of Coalwood, WV. Sonny Hickam, the author, is a senior at Big Creek High School, and in the last year of his life as a full time Coalwoodian. He paints a picture of life in a community dependent on what has been called the most dangerous occupation. Through the fall, we meet some vividly portrayed residents including a pair of junior engineers, a poor girl from Gary, and Sonny's heart throb(s). We get to know Sonny's parents in more detail than offered in Rocket Boys and they do seem as the heart of Coalwood. And you will learn some WV lingo- I swan. It is a wonderful, warm and at times exciting story, quite different from Rocket Boys. Sonny has an insightful mind and a writing skill that is unique. It is an inspirational story that will make you feel good, and make you want to visit Coalwood. Take the book with you and find most of the memorable sites. Coalwood is alive and well, but still small and hidden 40 years after the events of Coalwood Way."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"My husband, knowing how much I liked Rocket Boys, gave me this book for my birthday which happened to all on the same day he saw it available. Well, back to Coalwood. Thanks, Sonny. There's no better writer out there, far as I know. One of these days, Oprah's going to figure that out. I wrote a letter to her today. Anyway, if you want a book that captures your imagination, this one will do. Lots of people think Homer's (Sonny's) books are about rockets and that but they're not. They're about the most wonderful people he grew up with. He was a lucky guy and I think he knows that. That's why he shares with us his story and the storie of Coalwood. You have to read them to understand."},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"How many wonderful works of literature were we denied by Homer Hickam (not Hickham or Hickman) going into Industrial Engineering?This is the type of book that makes you yearn for the simpler, more innocent times of your childhood, no matter when you grew up.

Then I saw the movie October Sky on cable, then I read the Coalwood series. However, before I read the books and as a long time aerospace enthusiest I was somewhat cynical about the stories, but happily, I've mostly been proven wrong except for one small thing. It seems to me like the kids in this book seem a little too 'adult' in their dialogue and thoughts. To me, it reads as more of an idealized reconstruction from an adults perspective. But then again, they were able to figure out on their own how to design and build some pretty sophisticated vehicles, launch systems and fuel. So maybe I'm wrong regarding the thoughts an dialogue? Either way, very enjoyable series of books. Look out, David Poyer, you got some competition!"},{"Title":"Coalwood Way","review":"Curl up in your chair, light a scented candle or two and get ready for a pleasant read courtesy of Mr. Homer 'Sonny' Hickam Jr. This novel transports the reader back, way back in fact, to a time that seems light years from the hustle and bustle of the typical American towns today.Homer is an execelent story teller, providing an easily digestable story, refreshingly lacking in vulgarity, that will warm the heart while offering a glimpse at life in the small town of Coalwood West Virginia.Although he embellishes some details, here and there, the book is a true joy to read and quite difficult to put down. It is easy to see Homer 'Sonny' Hickam had a good upbringing; surrounded by a pair of loving parents and the kind of towns people who once made small town America a great place to live.From the tales of his first crush to the tales of shooting off model rocks, this book leaves a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart. I am truly thankful that Mr. Hickam took the time to share the memories of his formative years in this and his other novel 'Rocket boys'.

The author takes you through an anatomy lesson where you learn about the different sections of the human spine: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacrum. The structure of the individual vertebrae and the differences among the vertebrae in the various sections are described. Then he goes into the actual spinal cord and nerves and how they are affected by problems in the vertebrae. Various back pains are discussed including 'referred pain' which is where you feel pain in one of the body's extremities that is actually caused by nerve trauma in the spinal cord or one of the nerves that branches out from the spinal cord to that extremity. All facets of spinal health are presented in easily understandable terms.The second half of the book proceeds by discussing the various surgical methods that can be utilized to treat spine related problems. Historical procedures are included along with current medical trends for treating spinal problems so that you can see how back surgery has progressed over time. Even future directions and experimental techniques are discussed to give you a feel for what is up-and-coming in the field of spinal surgery. Risks are discussed as well so that you can make an informed choice to have a particular operation and understand the related consequences.There are even chapters that discuss types of pain, pain medications and their associated complications, non-surgical methods for treating back pain and their effectiveness and potential consequences, genetic spinal disorders, recovery from spinal surgery, and even cost and health insurance matters. In fact, the health insurance chapter has valuable information describing the differences among the various type of insurance available such as HMO's, PPO's, and PSO's and explains the difference between 'contracted' and 'uncontracted' providers so that you'll know what to ask when seeking surgical help and how to control your costs.All-in-all the book was worth the price for the information you will gain. However, I found that there was little discussion about 'degenerative' spinal problems in specific though I could imagine some of the techniques described might be useful for these situations such as transpedicular kyphoplasty. I would have liked to see the book spend some dedicated time discussing this particular type of spinal condition with, perhaps, some information about technologies that are on the horizon. Perhaps a few references to internet sites where one could find information on specific disorders would be nice as well."},{"Title":"Do You Really Need Back Surgery?: A Surgeon's Guide to Neck and Back Pain and How to Choose Your Treatment","review":"This is a very informative book that anyone who is contemplating back surgery or has back problems should read to become informed of the pros and cons of having back surgery.

As an undercover FBI agent, he is closing in on the head of an international baby selling ring.

It's still painful and she continues to hide the fact that Andy is his son.This is a hot, passionate reunion story that keeps the tension building as the two former lovers untangle their misunderstandings and deceptions.

While it is a bit weak on Public Sector arbitration, it makes up that weakness in its overwhelming research and tenacious review of the trends in arbitration in the public sector. Since most arbitration law derives from National Relations Board actions, my slight complaint is somewhat mitigated.Some caution should be thrown to labor activists about this work: it is not a strategy book, but rather a book about the various awards and trends that have come out of many arbitration cases throughout the United States. It would be best if you knew what decisions are coming out of the area you live in, and try to keep up with (and sometimes try to buck) those trends. Also keep in mind that this is not a &quot;labor only&quot; book, but looks at both sides of an issue, and I've more than once have had management attempt to argue against my theory by using examples out of this book.All in all, this is the essential work for labor arbitrations."},{"Title":"How arbitration works","review":"Generally considered to be the &quot;bible&quot; for those involved in labor-management arbitration procedures, this book is an invaluable reference in researching workplace disputes. There is ample reference to past arbitration awards, but what I have found to be of greater value is the viewpoints of different arbitrators to different issues, giving one an ability to get some insight into the thought processes that arbitrators use in determining the applicability of various contract provisions to the arbitration process.As a union official, I have found that using this book while researching grievance issues has been a real time saver and, along with the use of other reference materials, has been valuable in determining whether or not to pursue grievances to the arbitration stage.While the price is steep, it pales in comparison to the cost of going into an arbitration proceeding less than fully prepared."},{"Title":"How arbitration works","review":"This book is a requirement for any union activist. It provides a clear explanation of the complexities of arbitration in the labor management relations process. The book itself is dry reading.

Archeology professor Mike O'Sullivan and his girlfriend Mary travel to Ireland to escape the living nightmare of a psychotic campus killer. Once in County Cork, Mike uncovers evidence of an ancient family secret so horrible the locals refuse to speak of it. Gradually, Mike's love for his ancestry takes a frightening, obsessive turn. Soon, he discovers a sinister legacy of forbidden ritual, one that worships an evil older than time. He learns, to his mounting horror, that it has turned the fog-shrouded hills and a house of unspeakable terrors into its own savage, sacrificial hunting ground. And across time and the countryside, Mike and Mary are drawn into a terrifying, inescapable realm on madness' razor edge, one in which nightmare and reality are one and the same...An auspicious debut by the author of \\"Online Learning Today: Strategies That Work,\\" and the new psycho-thriller, \\"Piggies.\\""},{"Title":"The Haunt","review":"It is not every day that one delights in the discovery of a new 'gothic' author in this shallow, digitized and thus desensitized world!

It is a very well made Bible and handsomely put together. The lifetime warranty is astounding, and yet I still find myself keeping it in the box, so as not to scratch or ruin it.It has been a great tool in study, and if you want conservative notes, has excellent notes in it.A few things:1. For those who are looking for &quot;THE King James&quot;, the spellings of many words have been Americanized (Savior instead of Saviour, etc.). This does not bother me, just thought some might be interested in that.2. I am NOT a KJV only person and I laugh every time I read the notes that help you understand what is being said in the old English. Usually, it is very similar to what the NLT would say.3. The 2 silk markers are very nice for doing read through the Bible and holding 2 spots.4. This Bible MAKES me want to read and study, it is so nice.5. Every once in while, I have found myself at odds with the opinions of the note writers (nothing unusual in any study Bible) and would recommend that readers determine doctrine for themselves, rather than take wholesale any note. (Always a good rule of thumb)6. There is some excellent introduction material on how to study the Bible at the beginning.7. Maps are OK, I guess I really like maps so am more inclined to use Baker's Bible Atlas or some such other resource.

The exam questions typically require a level of detail that you could only get by working with Windows 2000 Server in a real network environment.

I really like the layout of the book. The authors do a good job at focusing on important key topics. I consider this series a step above the Sybex books (at least the 70-217, and 70-216 which I read) that seem to be more of a step by step/screenshot owners manual. In contrast the Syngress book has many brainteaser example boxes and end of chapter two minute drills that reinforce and clarify what you just read. The two minute drills are also helpful for review as exam day gets closer. Each chapter has plenty of step by step lab type exercises also. The end of chapter questions are usefull for learning, but are not an accurate inidicator of exam readiness nor anything like the real exam questions with few exceptions. The exam I had hit real hard on disk configuration (dynamic versus basic, repairing, performance, and fault tolerance). After so far passing four exams (70-210, 70-215, 70-216, 70-217) I have come to a conclusion about W2K MCSE book reviews. Book reviews seem to be all over the board. I believe this is due to the fact that a lot of people are counting on a book alone to prepare them to pass an exam and when they fail they blame the book. As a NT4.0 MCSE I can tell you the new W2K exams are a LOT tougher. The new tests are not based on a regurgitation of facts but a clever measure of wide based competence of W2K Server technologies. The Syngress book in the preface does a good job explaining this. Microsoft is trying to separate the wannabees from the dedicated and knowledgeable. A MCSE study guide is just one part of the preparation process. Another is &quot;other souces&quot; such as help files, technet, Microsoft website, white papers,and Resource Kit. Lastly of course is a LOT of real hands on W2K Server experience which can be either on a real or practice network and assumed knowledge of basic networking concepts including tcp/ip. I feel no study guide can cover 100% of what is going to be covered on an exam (maybe 85% to 90%) after all the Resource Kit is 7000 pages long!

This book was not written by an author and it shows. It was mashed together using material from no less than 10 'contibutors' and some of them have very poor writing skills (which apparently the copy editors don't care to compensate for).The book starts out stating how important it is to know the 'why' as well as the 'what' due to the new format of the 2K exams, yet the book is filled with instances where a concept is introduced never to be explained (command-line switches, using CD-ROMs with RIS, etc., etc.). This tends to raise more questions than it answers and only confuses the reader. I wouldn't have the slightest idea how to correctly answer an exam question based on the way the information was presented in this book.The material on boot and system file locations was so confusing and poorly written that I e-mailed one of the editors for clarification.

We all grew up together during the 1950's & early 1960's in Leaside where we attended both public & high school. My sister even appears in the book in a circa 1951 classroom picture! There were many familiar sites, which brought back happy memories as well as information about Leaside that I was unaware of. The book is very well done, with wonderful pictures, historical facts & interesting stories. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever lived in Leaside; it is a real treasure to have! Thanks to Jane Pitfield for putting this wonderful book together. My only regret is that I didn't know about it sooner!"},{"Title":"Meriwether Lewis, boy explorer (The Childhood of famous Americans series)","review":"My husband will be delighted to receive this book for Christmas.

That we are at a hinge of history. Here we go, over the waterfall! Wheeeeeee! say Cupitt. Here looked at from a religious viewpoint. Stimulating. Dont agree with such postmodernist notions as &quot;language goes all the way down&quot; (but what a phrase) - hasnt he heard of emotion? Or preconscious processing? Profoundly hopeful (which of course I resent, but hey...). Informative. Challanging - the view that 'mysticism' is a late nineteenth century invention is MARVELLOUS. Well argued (and thats always fun). Readable - I DASHED through it. Then went back over."},{"Title":"My Marissa: Home Again in Oak Branch Woods","review":"I read Kimberly Shriner's 'My Marissa' in a matter of days (about four I think!) as it was surprisingly compelling reading. Told from both the human and the animal perspectives, it provides an informed, imaginative and captivating story. The plot revolves around the development of an area of woodland, where many species of wildlife, both animals and plants, can be found. The threat that mankind poses to the creatures is obvious from the beginning yet throughout the book is presented rationally and from all sides of the argument. The plot twists and turns and provides several unexpected surprises and keeps your attention throughout the tale.The style of writing (from the animal's perspective) in 'My Marissa' brought to my mind both the 'Animals of Farthing Wood' series by Colin Dann and the 'Redwall' books by Brian Jaques, though at times (particularly from the human perspective) it is perhaps more for an older reader than those books may aim at.My Marissa is a book that I would recommend to anyone from 12 or 13 years old upwards, and is enjoyable and enlightening. The book has a strong story and - a sign of any book that manages to keep you interacting with it - made me think about it many times since I closed the cover."},{"Title":"Nietzsche Within Your Grasp","review":"The new \\"within your grasp\\" series of books from Wiley Publishing (publishers of the \\"For Dummies\\" series) do just what the subtitle suggests, they summarize the work of great philosophers, bringing their body of work within the grasp of readers who don't necessarily hold degrees in philosophy.In \\"Nietzsche: within your grasp\\", author Shelley O'Hara competently summarizes the highlights of the profound 19th century German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, and does so in a style that is lively and fun, yet serious and thoughtful. The ability to understand complex philosophical texts, and to relay such texts in a way that is more accessable than the original, while still faithfully preserving the spirit and essence of the original work, is an all too rare talent, but Shelley O'Hara has done an outstanding job.Dave Stout--Technical Editor; \\"Nietzsche: within your grasp\\""},{"Title":"Nietzsche Within Your Grasp","review":"Many people read about the German philosopher Nietzsche rather than read his actual words. This practice leads some to better understand him and others to better misunderstand him. For example, readers of \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" a classic book by William Shirer, may think that Nietzsche was partially responsible for the coming of the Third Reich and the inspiration behind Hitler's concept of \\"the master race.\\" Those who read other books, such as the laconic \\"Nietzsche Within Your Grasp,\\" will know that Nietzsche was neither a Nazi, an anti-semite, nor a supporter of Aryan supremacy. This latter group will also realize that Nietzsche, though by no means uncontroversial (some refer to him as \\"a nut case\\"), remains one of the most influential and original figures in the history of philosophy.This small book - though much smaller introductions to Nietzsche exist - provides a decent and accessible outline to one of history's most misquoted philosophers. Though plagued by somewhat dry prose and a textbook tone, it nonetheless clarifies some of the main points of Nietzsche's thought. Following brief - well, everything within is brief - biographical and philosophical sections the book outlines the following works: \\"The Birth of Tragedy,\\" \\"The Gay Science,\\" \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\\" \\"Beyond Good and Evil,\\" and the enigmatic \\"Ecce Homo.\\" Some shards of \\"The Genealogy of Morals\\" also get intermixed with \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\" Throughout the text remains clear of jargon. Anyone can read this. Of course this approach has its drawbacks. Some concepts get diluted out of respect for beginners. \\"The Death of God,\\" Nietzsche's most famous attributed catchphrase, does not get explained with incredible nuance. Newcomers will close the book with only a partial understanding of this infamous statement. But other more advanced books will spackle these cracks. Regardless, as an introduction this book shines for not shying away from some of Nietzsche's more opaque texts. For example, many introductions altogether ignore \\"The Gay Science\\" as a book. They mention \\"the death of God,\\" \\"the Overman\\" (often translated as \\"Superman\\"), and eternal recurrence as concepts, but often choose to ignore the book in which they appear. This book has an entire chapter devoted to \\"The Gay Science,\\" one of Nietzsche's most important books. It also dwells on his humor, misunderstood in much the same way as Mahler's symphonic humor, and his central notion of laughter as vital in the search for knowledge. 80 pages can cover only so much, but these 80 pages manage to cover vast terrain.This book, as with all introductory texts, makes a great starting point but a poor stopping point. The real power of such books gets revealed as beginners take on more advanced studies. \\"Nietzsche Within Your Grasp\\" provides a good foundation to delve into longer books and eventually into Nietzsche's own works. We all start somewhere, and this book provides at least one great place to start with Nietzsche."},{"Title":"Nietzsche Within Your Grasp","review":"As an original fan of Paul Stathern's &quot;Philosophers in 90 Minutes&quot; series I have a confession to make. Shelley O'Hara's series of books is far superior. Not only does she provide a brief history of the author's life (Stahtern does the same) but she also provides a synopsis of the given author's individual books (this feature is unique to O'Hara) as well as insight into the author's main points and ideas. In short, if you are looking for a book that summarizes and explains a given authors ideas, O'Hara's series is superior to Strathern's. However, nothing can substitute for the philosopher's actual books themselves."},{"Title":"Nietzsche Within Your Grasp","review":"John V. Karavitis, John Karavitis, Karavitis There are a plethora of books that seek to give the reader a quick view of a philosopher's life and written works. Wiley's \\"Within Your Grasp\\" series seeks to do just that. This entry for Nietzsche is excellent. It covers \\"The Birth of Tragedy\\", \\"The Gay Science\\", \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra\\", \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" and \\"Ecce Homo\\". It is highly recommended. John V.

It's true that the text is difficult to read but great design does not have to be explained."},{"Title":"Mutabor 9 (Mutabor)","review":"This book gives a very, very good example of today's design trends. It has design examples from NIKE, MTV, AUDI and much more. The book features the big brands with today's designs. This is absolutely the newest trend what design is concerned. Klaus Mai and his design firm use a lot of vector graphics to enhance the accompanying pixel images. Which totaly a new and cool design approach.I agree with my fellow countryman that the reviews are not very readable (some black text over a dark brown background) but the designs are the thing that matter and they speak for themselves. It is a very cool book. If you should make a choice between Klaus' 2 books, buy them both. You will see Klaus' growth from the first book to the second, design wise....It is to bad that evil art bases his opinion on the review (text pages. Which is not what the book is about.

I reccomend buying the first KM7 book and not bothering with this one."},{"Title":"Mutabor 9 (Mutabor)","review":"I can't not give Klaus Mai's 2nd book the highest rating, since he is by far my favourite designer, but I wish it was a strong as &quot;License to Design&quot;! i remember seeing &quot;License&quot; at Borders for the first time and it was the most inspiring book on design that I had ever seen- beautiful, tight and meaningful design, with both strong typography and excellent use of images- quality of work that no other firm could even come close to! &quot;see&quot; is a great book, but does not have the magic of the first one"},{"Title":"Inner city nursery rhymes","review":"INNER CITY NURSERY RHYMES is a collection of rhymes highlighting some aspects of inner city life. The rhymes vary in length and are accompanied by bare bones illustrations. The topics of the various selections include: black hair, hunger, prayer, family relationships, and even roaches. The rhymes are set in the alleys, streets, and homes of the inner city. Some are frighteningly realistic while others are reminiscent of a tall tale or fable, but each piece is presented in a non-judgmental manner that fosters a sense of acceptance.Barbara Harvey has put together a collection that will educate some and affirm others. For parents and children with similar backgrounds, the book will provide a much needed reminder that they are not alone in their experiences. Even readers who cannot directly relate to the situations will enjoy the light-hearted rhymes and are sure to be reminded of the things they take for granted. Some of the selections were definitely better than others and the illustrations, although they related directly to what was being told, were so minimal that they didn't add much to the book. In my opinion, a book of rhymes targeted to this age group should be a multi-sensory experience; INNER CITY NURSERY RHYMES could have achieved this with further editing or removal of some of the rhymes and more elaborate illustrations. It was the overall impact of the book that caused me to rate it as highly as I did, as it was evident that the author is deeply committed to the social and emotional development of inner city children.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Waters Conspiring","review":"This is a fine book with great characters, local genre and mystery all thrown in together. As a native of Ohio, and descendant of a civil war veteran I especially appreciated it, and certainly hope Mr. Varner will write (and publish) more."},{"Title":"Waters Conspiring","review":"A fine mystery, set in a period of great upheaval. Mr. Varner creates a true and real world of change and trial."},{"Title":"Waters Conspiring","review":"A very solid first novel. The author accomplishes a very neat feat indeed, with the narrative shifting back and forth from the Great Depression/New Deal Era, to the 1860's. This creates a dual tension, so the reader feels the suspense of seeing personalities of days gone by affecting the present crisis. The &quot;sense of place&quot; is well established, I guess because the flood means so much to the plot-- the characters experience disaster slowly. If you've ever moved to a small town that values Things the Way They've Always Been, then the depiction here will get you in your gut. The people aren't one dimensional as is often the case in throwback novels. This is the kind of book you keep in mind to give to others-- it is a nice discovery, and I've given it to my grandparents (who vouched for its realistic depictions of time and place)."},{"Title":"Carthage","review":"Ross Leckie writes exciting, thrilling storys, but a writer should not work in historical fiction if he doesn't know anything about the period is writing.

If you want to read historical novels about rome, try Steven Saylor or the marvelous Colleen McCullough. Mr. Ross, You don't have to be a scholar to write historical fiction, but please...read one or two books before you write your novels."},{"Title":"Carthage","review":"This is actually the last book in a trilogy but the first of the trilogy that I have read. I very much enjoyed this novel. No, it's not pretty and there are no characters who are all good or all bad....pretty much like real-life. The previous novels have received VERY mixed reviews and I suspect this will be no different.This is not history romantacized so it gets pretty rough sometimes but it is a good story with seemingly excellent character depiction. Also, one must bear in mind, it is a historically based NOVEL....license is taken.If for nothing else....I was introduced to the wonder of the city of Carthage.I have since purchased the first two novels in this trilogy and am ready to proceed.....more so now that I have read the mixed reviews as I am now very curious to see what my eventual feelings are on these novels.In any case, I found this to be an intelligently written, thoughtful book and would recommend it.

I think that it captures the character of Laura and Rose because the stories and articles are by their own hand.I really enjoyed the photos throughout this book because while Garth Williams' representation of the Ingalls family is lovely, it is nice to see what they really looked like. Even though they are in black and white you can imagine Pa's eyes twinkling.Rose and Laura have very different styles, but both styles are very good. I especially liked Laura's articles because they paint a picture of farm life. The sections range in length so if you one have a few moments of reading time here and there it isn't necessary to worry about reading it in one sitting (though you may want to!).Other things I recommend are the Little House series (of course!), and the series about Rose that was published recently (it has its slow parts but it was written by someone close to the family so there is a lot of accuracy). If you want to read more of Laura and Rose's writing this book is the perfect solution even considering the high price."},{"Title":"A Little House Sampler: A Charming Collection of Early Stories and Reminiscences","review":"For those of us who want to know more about Laura Ingalls Wilder and her daughter Rose, this is a great place to start. William T. Anderson has hand-picked some of the best short writings of Laura and Rose and incorporated them into this book. My favorite stories in this book include Laura's articles on her kitchen and dining room in Rocky Ridge and Rose's short story, &quot;Innocence&quot;. The photos and Mr. Anderson's commentary add even more depth to our perceptions of LIW and RWL."},{"Title":"A Little House Sampler: A Charming Collection of Early Stories and Reminiscences","review":"A Little House Sampler is the perfect title for this book. It gives you a sample of both Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane's interesting lives. Rose gives us a look into her and her parents lives after The First Four Years. Grandpa's Fiddle and Grandpa's Fiddle II was very interesting. I really enjoyed that story. Rose's story about the Faces in the Window is a perfect ghost story to tell around a campfire. Laura's stories about remodeling the kitchen and the dining room was great reading. She had a real decorating flair with the colors she chose. Laura wrote for Almanzo too. His stories about moving the spring shows us his story telling ability plus he was a very smart man. The pictures show his fine carpentry work. What a talented family! I mostly enjoy Rose's stories that describe her family life. I found her fiction work good reading but I thought she did her best writing when she wrote about her family. This book is a must for Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane collectors!"},{"Title":"A Little House Sampler: A Charming Collection of Early Stories and Reminiscences","review":"I loved the short stories by Rose Wilder Lane, (especially \\"Innocence\\") and Laura's pieces are also touching & well-written -- definitely recommended for the die-hard Ingalls-Wilder fan and for anyone interested in good short stories. Rose Wilder Lane will really impress those people who haven't read anything by her before."},{"Title":"A Little House Sampler: A Charming Collection of Early Stories and Reminiscences","review":"This was the book 10 years ago that introduced me to the fact there was more out there beyond the Little House books written by my favorite author and her daughter. After reading her \\"Missouri Ruralist\\" writings, it puts the theories of Laura not really writing the Little House books to rest. It also introduced me to the thrilling storytelling of Rose; so much so, I broke my cardinal \\"no lending of Little House books\\" rule to disasterous results. I'm glad to finally have a replacement.Rose's interview with her father drives me nuts! You will find yourself wishing, after reading this and other snippets on \\"the man of the place\\" that Laura and Rose would have spent more time writing about him."},{"Title":"A Little House Sampler: A Charming Collection of Early Stories and Reminiscences","review":"This 'Sampler' is an absolute treat! I have completely enjoyed myself reading the stories in this book, the true and the fiction.This was my first taste of Rose's work and she is an excellent writer and as we already know, Laura is as well! My favorites are ~ 'Let's Visit Mrs. Wilder'; 'How Laura Got Even'; 'Grandpas' Fiddle I &amp; II'; 'It Depends On How You Look At It'; 'The Sunflower' and 'Object, Matrimony.'An extra treat are the many photos and the commentary by William Anderson. I seem to have a neverending curiosity about Laura and her entire family. This book was very enjoyable because I learned about Laura's life after what she covered in her children's books.I am acquiring quite a wonderful collection of Laura Ingalls Wilder books and this one shines brightly! Worth every penny."},{"Title":"A Little House Sampler: A Charming Collection of Early Stories and Reminiscences","review":"Laura wrote articles about being a farm wife for the local papers &amp; also a couple of magazines when middle-aged. Rose encouraged her, advised her &amp; helped her edit her stories. She had ventured into professional writing long before her mother began. Laura had a great talent for describing things so that you feel you are really there on the farm with her. Rose portrayed the emotions of her characters so well that you could understand how they felt and why they felt as they did. No wonder she won so many awards and also earned great sums of money for her published stories at the time.The short stories and litlle explanations before them are quite interesting."},{"Title":"A Little House Sampler: A Charming Collection of Early Stories and Reminiscences","review":"This book was sooo wonderful. It gave me goosebumps. You won't be sorry. It is full of beautiful photographs of the Ingalls and Wilders and wonderful stories and writings by Laura and Rose. One of my favorites is \\"Faces in the Window\\",Rose's account of a chilling tale her odd friend Gladys tells her. It is truly a bizarre tale! Normally I don't care for ghost stories; they are such bunk, and I don't really care for Rose or her fictional writings, but this one had me spellbound! Also when Laura talks about some of the things that REALLY went on when the Ingalls lived in Indian Territory, stuff to grizzly to mention in a children's book like Little House on the Prairie. I am like, oh my word, they could have died!! This book is definately a keeper!"},{"Title":"A Little House Sampler: A Charming Collection of Early Stories and Reminiscences","review":"This book is by one of my favorite authors.

It is not exciting, and they don't tell the main character's name untill halfway through the book! This book also has too many insults and bad words and is racist to African Americans. To sum it up, if you like exciting books, don't read this one!"},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Off hand I can only think of a few Western novels that have transcended their genre to become classics, and share with the world what all great art does; that being a universality of it's story and relevance no matter when or where. Shane, The Searchers, The Lonesome Dove books and certainly much of Frank Norris and Cormac McCarthy's work. I know there is more than these, but I am not a constant Western reader.Having said this, The Ox-Bow Incident joins that bunch, as a compelling novel of hysteria, aggression, moral confusion, the Outlaw spirit, American masculine relationships and the folly of vengeance and vigilantism.While other reviews may describe the story, I'd rather point out that it is a fairly simple one, simply presented and concluded. What stands out though is the characters and the depth to which Clark creates them. Sure there are standard cowboys, tough and grim-faced, but most of the characters suffer, whether in confusion, drunkeness, cold, moral despair, aimlessness, boredom or even arrogance, bullishness and myopia; territory I don't associate with Western lore/myth.The lesson of The Ox-Bow Incident is timeless, and most important today, whether it be on a schoolyard, in gang territories, our criminal justice system itself or geo-politcs."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"This story provides a great picture of what it was like living in the old west. In spite of attempts by some level headed men to control the town's outrage over a despicable crime, a number of men are roused into vigilante justice when some rustlers steal a herd of cattle and kill the owner in the process. This novel analyzes the mob mentality and how easy it is to fall into that trap. After all, these men are just trying to get justice for the murder of one of their own. The tension over the mob's shifting emotions is conveyed beautifully, and the lack of any patience for more information about the supposed murder eventually leads to tragic results. The story is a bit slow overall, being overly descriptive, but it really places you there at the time and place. I'm not a big fan of westerns, but this one makes a convincing statement about the importance and difficulty of assuming someone is innocent until proven guilty."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"When I began reading The Ox-Bow Incident for my term paper, I thought that it was just going to be another boring western story with stock characters who always get the bad guy - needless to say, I was wrong. This book was so much more than what my first impression said to me. For those people who have read it and thought that it was &quot;the most boring book ever,&quot; you obviousley do not have the brain power needed to understand the book, which I don't hold against you. For everyone else, I strongly sugest reading The Ox-Bow Incident."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"A powerful, striking novel, The Ox-Bow Incident is a refreshing look at human nature. Rich descriptions bring the West to life, creating an almost tangible world of dust, heat, and long hours in the saddle. Tagging along on the ride for justice you meet people you'll never forget. Most importantly, you'll never forget you aren't exempt from Clark's lesson."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"This story about mob justice provides insight into human nature. Discussions among the characters offer different theories and ideas about human nature. While the actions of some of the characters are shaped to prove points, the story is generally fast-paced and entertaining. An excellent read for someone who think that characters are the essential part of the book."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I really felt that The Ox-Bow Incident by Walter Van Tilburg Clark was a captivating novel. At first, I must admit, I was a little bored with the poker game, because I couldn't imagine that it would lead up to anything exciting. But when the plot finally started to heat up, I was really into it, and I was able to feel the way Art Croft must have felt. Truly, this was a well written piece of literature and deserves the title of &quot;classic&quot;."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"the book ripped, i haden't read a book for 2 1/2 years since 2001 space odyssey, and now, i think books rule. i thought this was going to be another retarded western, but it was like totally about right and wrong or &quot;omission&quot; and &quot;remission&quot;."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"The Ox-Bow Incident is hard to get into in the beginning. The author introduces a lot of characters into his story at once, and I had to check back a few times to where you first meet the character just to understand who he was talking about. The first hundred pages are slow reading, but after this, you start to see the story unfold, and reading it becomes worthwhile. It's interesting to see how each man deals with his own internal conflict at the climax. Overall, I enjoyed this book- it makes you think. It was depressing, but not horribly so."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I first read this book as required reading in high school. I didn't understand why I was being made to read it until the end. Honestly, it is one of the slowest books I have ever read. The first part of the book is boring - basically a bunch of men talking and talking and talking and not coming to any real decision. I believe that this is meant to be suspenseful, but it goes on far too long to sustain suspense. At one point, I literally yelled at the book, \\"Would someone just DO something?\\"It is the end of the book that makes it worth reading. The brain numbing chapters are worth it once one realizes what the whole book is about - personal responsibility. This book made me completely reevaluate my personal and political beliefs. A lot of what I believe as an adult was formed, not by this book, but by the thought it provoked. I wish that the preceding text was a good as the end - then this might be the best book ever written. As it is, this would be a much better short story than a novel.I would recommend this book if you have the time to wade through a lot of nothing to get to the end. Like many of the better things in life, it takes hard work but you reap fantastic rewards. However, if you are looking for a good summer read or something to take on vacation, skip this one. Or, just read the end."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I would imagine that this book was more powerful when it was first published back in 1940. But today, the plot seems very predictable, with bits and pieces falling into place too neatly all along the way. Nothing comes as any real surprise, including the ending.The book is worth reading, though, for its philosophical dialogue and its interesting look into the minds of true-to-life characters with varying points of view on justice and the law.As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, the book is hard to put down. And it's a refreshing read because its style is not unduly difficult.One sign of good literature is when the characters appear so alive that you feel a strong urge to step into the book and shake them to keep them from making fatal mistakes. Young Gerald Tetley was such a character for me. There's no reason he couldn't have stood up to his stupid father. And, if he had, things might have turned out better for everyone.Warning: THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK BUT PLAN TO MIGHT WANT TO SKIP THIS NEXT PART!!!One especially weak point in the plot for me was the idea that the murder victim never really died. That was so obvious that I saw it coming right from the start.Also, Kinkaid was shot for no discernable reason. The victims of the lynching bought the cattle legally, yet another group shot Kinkaid and coincidentally rushed off in the same direction. What was their motive? The author never offers any clue.To make the story even more difficult to swallow, the lynching victims happen to come into possession of Kinkaid's gun which has been taken by the shooters. The story treads dangerously close to becoming a banal political statement here in the way that the movie Dead Man Walking was. When every element of the plot is so carefully arranged so as to create the most gruesome case against vigilantism possible, the sheer unbelievability that results makes it harder to take the story seriously. Dead Man Walking was a dismal failure in this respect, but this book was saved by the care and intelligence that went into creating the intricate thought processes of each character and their interactions with each other.Also, the inclusion of the character Rose Mapen in the book along with that of her husband is not integral to the plot. I was bothered by this at first, but now I see that these characters help to lend the book the feel of a typical Western.I find it very satisfying how the book hints at the gendre of Western without actually stooping to its bland, commercial level. The last Western I read (_Cherokee Justice_ from the Trailsman series by Jon Sharpe) was a sickening blend of shoot-em-up bang bang and Romance-novel style sex scenes that made me want to wretch. (Anyone that finds the word 'rump' sexually enticing must have a screw loose. Sorry.)"},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I just completed this book in my sophmore english class. I feel that this book had alot of unused potential. It was very slow and uneventfull throughout the first three chapters, and I had trouble following the plot with so many characters popping in and out. The fourth chapter climax was a little easier to follow, considering the drastic change in action from people wandering the streets to the discovery of the accused &quot;rustlers&quot;. Chapter five went slowly again, but having less characters involved in it made it easier to read. Over all, I thought this book was fairly confusing and hard to follow."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Basically talking about this book is not a challenge to me because I loved this book and the plot and the ending was a key factor to that. From the beginning the characters were very truthful and it felt like that you could compare to some of the characters because this kind of thing could happen to any town. This story has a great story about a mob who takes matter of justice into its own hands. But some people were against it and some were with it. This book shows us all how matter of time can change a person's life in a matter of seconds.An emotional situation in this book was the feelings that young Tetley got out of him. Those feelings could be compared with me that we were bunch of people who just wanted to fight stones with stones and just went in too much of a hurry. I think Walter is a very good writer because of course if he wrote this book he is a brilliant man because it really exposes a man's feeling towards something even though he acts tough. Yes I would recommend any young adult to read it because this can show an outlook to a brand new life and how it can change your feelings."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I found the book to be dull not like westerns that I have read in the past I was told the book got better but it did not.

The first 100 pages just talk about people playing cards and walking around town. There is absolutely no action at all. Once the posse finally leaves the town they find the suspected rustlers right away. It is quite an anti-climax because you bore through the first two-thirds of the book only to find the climax very short and lacking the necessary action that you suspect from a western."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I'm sorry, I just found this book just a bit short of silly. And I am a western fan. The character development was shallow and the story line predictible while at the same time unrealistic.

This novel has no business being upheld as an American classic."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"This book, even though it was not even 200 pages, is the most boring book that I've ever read. The author, at one point in the book, took well over a page describing 3 pictures in the wall. I thought that since he was describing them so much, they would have some significance in the story, or maybe be important at the end, but they weren't. Those couple pages turned out to be just another couple of pages I wasted my time with that could've been used doing something else more useful in life.

Clark uses the &quot;incident,&quot; which in this case is the unjustified lynching of three innocent cowboys, to demonstrate the tendency of people to project their own fears and frailties on outsiders.This is a great book, and if you like it and the themes it explores, then be certain to read Frank Bergon's &quot;Shoshone Mike.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Walter Van Tilburg Clark's The Ox-Bow Incident stands as a classic and has earned that standing. It is peopled with all the usual characters of a western novel but this time the usual themes of rugged individualism inherent in such works are turned on their heads. The author puts all of these stock characters to use in showing his ideas concerning lynching and the true spirit of the west. Each chapter reads like a set piece with much dialogue. It often feels like it is trying to work as a play but, for full effectiveness, it was right that it be set as a western novel, the place where many of the myths of the West first became established. The novel picks up momentum and finds much tension and emotional truth strew among all the larger examinations of ideas. It is gripping, both in the gut and in the mind."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"This book is definitely not in the same mold as the adventures of Louis L'Amour or Max Brand. Rather than being bombarded with lots of gun-play action, the reader is drawn into the very real drama of the machinations of mob rule and it's outcome. The author also shows how easy it is for vigilantes to draw in people by appealing to their sense of justice or their desire for excitement.Art Croft is not, in anyway, concerned with the report of murdering rustlers but joins the posse of vigilantes simply because he has nothing better to do. Evidently, that is reason enough to join a pack of enraged fools hunt down and murder three innocent men, all the while having doubts about the justification of the act and not having the guts to say anything against it.Other reviews, I've read, focus on the mob and it's ebb and flow of emotion. For me, I focused on Croft's inability to speak out against what was happening, although he had clearly realised the injustice of what was happening. Since the book was written in the 1940s, during World War Two, the author is stressing that the enemy of the world is not the German, but a German political party. Croft symbolises the German people's apathy towards the actions of the Nazis. Rather than speak out and, probably, end up joining the three innocent men, Croft stays silent and \\"looks the other way\\".This book is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"The Ox-Bow Incident was a very interesting book. There were many changes in the storyline that made the book interesting to follow. What also made this book very interesting was the way it accurately portrayed the actions of a party of men out for their version of justice. The men took a few precautions to make sure that the mob did not look loke a lynching party. I also found it interesting how the author described the vision of the men at night and how the snow affected the moral of the posse. This book also took a good look at how most people regard the law as being tedious and procrastinated, but in the end the law men are always the ones who decide what is correct.This book is all about what some people view as justice and the opposing views of men and women who are controlled by their emotions. The emotion-controlled people have the view that if the crime is serious enough, everyone should just go out to find the accused and hang them. Regardles of whether or not the posse is sure if they have caught the people who commited the crime, they want immediate justice and so they hang anyone who seems to be guilty or is in an odd situation. The men who are the law try to stop them, but the emotions of the posse usually overcome the unobstructed notion of justice of the men.Emotions are a strong motivator, and that is shown in the actions of the posse and the individual actions of the men.In conclusion, this book was made interesting by the emotions and actions portrayed, along with the unexpected twist at the end of the story."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Sometimes books and authors slip right off the charts. I don't know why. Plenty of unworthy works are discussed years after the demise of the writers or after their comet-like flash across the skies of pop fiction. For example, Walter Van Tilburg Clark's THE OX-BOW INCIDENT is hardly ever mentioned anymore. If you draw up your list of the top one hundred American novels, it's pretty much guaranteed that this work won't be on there. Yet, I do feel it is a classic. Director William Wellman made a film of it way back in 1943 with Henry Fonda, and though the film still resonates to some degree, it may look a bit stilted to modern viewers. As usual, the film-makers changed some of the main themes, created \\"heroes\\", and came to a moralistic conclusion different from the one in the book.THE OX-BOW INCIDENT is a serious work of fiction, wrapped in the familiar disguise of a Western, complete with horses, dialect, guns, ropes, sheriff and posses. But don't let that coloring fool you. The fast-paced novel (it's only 217 pages) contains a great card game-cum-duel between keyed-up cowboys, a stagecoach encounter in a midnight mountain pass, the argument among men over the fate of the captured \\"rustlers\\", and the final denouement. But in the midst of all the atmosphere lie the key ideas---the dichotomy between men who think for themselves and men who go along with the crowd, between those who treasure justice at all costs, and those who wish for simple revenge with a mob behind them and some alcohol inside them. A major question has to do with law. Does not law spring from the conscience of society ? If it does, then men acting without the law constitute a direct attack on everyone. But what to do when there are lawless men and little justice available ? Should we sit there and swallow criminality ? But if people take the law into their own hands, the law is destroyed, because it cannot exist as the writ of one man or an angry group. How can people overcome their fear of the crowd, their fear of being scorned by others, to do the right thing ? These are serious issues played out in Nevada in the year 1885 in a remote valley where rustling had been occurring and murder alleged. The author could have been making an analogy to possible rise of fascism in the USA, a phenomenon which would have heralded the collapse of the law and justice and the rise of bully-boy rule, when Hitlers and Mussolinis could egg crowds on to mob action.When there is a threat to society how should we react ? We must stand up to fight it for sure, but sticking to the law. Otherwise we become what we wish to conquer. When terrorists attack us, should we become terroristic ? How many \\"rustlers\\" have we \\"hanged\\" wrongly in Iraq ? This novel is not outdated in the least. It is a beacon of wisdom for freedom and justice in a top literary form. That's why it's worth reading and that's why I'm giving it five stars."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Walter Van Tilburg Clark writes a classic western in 1940 that challenges previous westerns by drifting away from the usual cliches. This is a novel that is the forerunner of my favorite westerns:'Shane'( 1949 ) and 'High Noon' ( 1952 ). While Shane studied greed for land and High Noon studied cowardice, The Ox- Bow Incident analyzes many emotions, including regret, sorrow and remorse. It rivals 'To Kill a Mockingbird' for themes covered in one book. According to CliffsNotes, the reviewers loved this bellwether novel: \\"The Initial response of the critics to The Ox-Bow Incident was that here, at last, was the classic western cowboy novel: His motive for writing The Ox-bow Incident was largely personal. He wanted to recreate, for his own psychological satisfaction, a nineteenth-century American West in its true dimensions, and to see what kind of story would grow out of that\\". This is the story of an incident that happened in 1885 Nevada.The novel begins with our narrator, Art Croft and his cowpoke friend, Gil Carter, riding into the town of Bridger's Wells. They go into Canby's saloon to drink and play cards. Would they have gone anywhere else? Anyway, during the card game Gil gets into a fight with a cowboy named Farnley, who accuses Gil of cheating. At the same time, a young cowboy rides into town and tells everybody that a cowhand named Kinkaid has been shot in the head and cattle rustled at Drew's Ranch. This incites the crowd since rustling has become an epidemic for the town's ranches. Farnley, a rancher named Bartlett, and Major Tetley ( an ex-confederate officer ) provoke the crowd into becoming a lynch mob. A preacher named Osgood and a store owner named Davies try to talk the crowd out of pursuing the perpetrators. Judge Tyler warns the mob of legal action against them, but it goes unheeded. Off they go looking for rustlers with no real idea of what actually happened at Drew's Ranch. This is a disaster in the making. I'm not going to tell you what happens, but I will tell you that it is sad drama! If you are into reading classics, then put this excellent novel on your list.Without using descriptive writing, Mr. Clark has somehow bewitched the reader with plenty of empathy for the characters. How did he do that? There were at least 30 characters in this novel and I felt like I knew all of them. Even minor characters like: Sparks ,the ex-slave; Butch Mapes, the bully deputy; Ma, the boarding house owner and Monty Smith, the town drunk are clear in the mind of the reader. As University Writing Center states:\\"Characters are the most important component of any narrative. Without them, there would be no story. Character development is an important skill to master because characters are important parts of any creative writing from books and short stories, from biographies and autobiographies, to poetry\\". Well done, Mr. Clark! This is a novel that leaves the reader with a taste of incongruity for the mob and feeling of agitation for the sitting ducks."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"In 2007, I was transferred from the United States Penitentiary in Pollock, Louisiana to the Marianna Federal Correctional Institute in Florida, which required that I spend two months in the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Two months is a long time when all you're allowed to do is play cards, watch TV, or read, which is what I spent most of my time doing. They had a little push-cart in the unit with a hundred or so books on it, and they'd swap it with the carts in the other units once a week. If you actually stumbled upon a good book, you'd better read it fast because they don't tell you when you're leaving, they just wake you up at two o'clock in the morning and tell you it's time for your flight on \\"con-air.\\"Toward the end of my stay, I started reading a western called \\"The Ox-Bow Incident\\". I don't particularly care too much for the genre, but this was no ordinary western. It's considered a masterpiece according to the blurb on the front cover, and indeed it is. The more I read, the better it got, and I was coming to the climax at two o'clock one morning when I got the knock on my door letting me know it was time to go.I recently got a chance to read it again and the ending is even better than I thought it would be. It deals with mob violence and the lynchings that were common in American frontier life. It makes me realize that I'm very lucky to be living in the time and place that I inhabit now, contrary to all appearances.Review written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I recently reread The Ox-Bow Incident after a hiatus of 30 years and was astounded by how good I found it. At the granular level of English prose, this novel is sparely, tightly, yet eloquently written. 70 years after publication and I didn't find a single word that I would blue-pencil or a false emotional note that makes me wince. This book could and should be studied by readers of almost all ages (let's say 15-95) for its economy and expressiveness.It is a gripping story, simple in narrative line yet rich and complex in moral viewpoints. The concepts of justice and action, group dynamics and individual conscience, appearance and reality, that are explored in this novel are eternal and, in this sturdy and robust version, well-preserved. The incidents develop in natural yet surprising ways and, even after finishing, you are compelled to start reading again, to see how the author accomplished his effects. The book is simultaneously highly realistic as a portrayal of how people act under the stress of uncertainty and urgency yet clear and basic, like a fable. Its strength reminds me of Antigone.If the measure of a classic is how well it stands up to time, then this book deserves to join the ranks of the great novels in the English language."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Nearly twenty-five years ago, this book was on my \\"required summer reading list\\" when I was a student transitioning from ninth grade into tenth. I vividly remember loathing the experience of slowly plowing through this book. Even the old version of the cover, with the yellow background and dangling noose, brought back the memories of spending nearly an entire summer loathing this novel. Ever since then the title held a place in my memory as the single most boring, painful reading experience of my life.Fast forward twenty-five years, and the other day I found myself with a few spare minutes in the local library, looking over authors like Dickens, Steinbeck, and Melville, and my mind wandered back to required reading lists. I had remembered the title THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, but not the author, but after a quick search \\"Walter Van Tilburg Clark\\" flashed across the screen, and I again cringed at the recollection of that name. I went to the shelf out of morbid curiosity, and the paperback was jutting out. I picked it up, read the first page and thought, \\"I'm going to give this another try. There must be some reason it was on my reading list.\\"I read it in three days, staying up until 1:30 in the morning last night to get to the end. How can a book can go from being one of the worst reading experience of one's life to being one of the most enjoyable? I am convinced more than ever that some books should never be on required reading lists, but should rather be discovered and enjoyed when you're at a place in life where you can appreciate them. Enjoying this once-hated book so much all these years later has made me want to go back to the other books from those days and give some of them another chance. (Maybe THE JUNGLE won't be so dull now that my primary focus isn't trying to impress girls. Maybe THE GREAT GATSBY is worth another look. Will BILLY BUDD hold my interest, I wonder?)This review says more about me than about the book, but if there is anyone out there who, like me, was forced to read classic literature before they were ready for it, don't be afraid to go back to even your most hated high school reading experience and give it one more try. THE OX-BOW INCIDENT is a great novel. There's a sentence I could never have imagined writing even one week ago."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"THE OX-BOW INCIDENT is a classic tale. It also is a classic Western, and because the Western is so central to American culture, THE OX-BOW INCIDENT surely is more important -- more \\"classic\\", if you will -- for Americans than for others. To be sure, at times the writing is somewhat dated, but that \\"flaw\\" is negligible. The cast of characters (at least 20) is very finely drawn, with only one (the uncouth town drunk Monty Smith) tending overly towards a stock portrayal. By and large, the psychology underlying the characters is astute. And there is some very fine writing of scenes, especially the one a quarter into the novel of the weather changing and the storm coming on. But the reason to read the novel, even if you have seen the movie, is for the story. It was powerfully presented in the movie, but is even more powerfully presented in the book.My one and only complaint or reservation has to do with the last chapter. It is superfluous. I suppose that the two additional deaths contained in that chapter and Davies' \\"confession\\" tend to make the book more of a Greek tragedy, but that's not really necessary: this is a quintessential American tragedy, and it doesn't need any retribution or retrospective moralizing.An aside on the subject of lynching, which is at the dramatic center of the book. Like the Western, lynching is a peculiarly American phenomenon. It is a blot on our history, but one we should remember, not repress.

After long months on the winter range, they have pay in their pockets and they're looking for whiskey, a good barroom brawl, and a few days of relaxation. Unfortunately, they're in for an unpleasant surprise.The same afternoon, after Art and Gil have settled into the local saloon and downed a couple of drinks, a rider rushes in to report that rustlers have shot and killed a well-respected local rancher and driven off several of his cattle.Because the sheriff is out of town, a group of twenty-some citizens, led by Major Tetley, an ex-Confederate officer, sets off--in spite of a plea by Davies, the owner of the general store, to wait for the sheriff to return and properly deputize a posse--to find the and lynch the offenders.What happens next is not pretty, certainly nothing akin to the popular Westerns of the day. Of The Ox-Bow Incident, Clark once said, \\"I had become irked at the way the West was treated in popular fiction and the moving pictures, with two-gun cowboys stuffed with Sunday-school virtues, and heroines who could go through a knock-down without getting a curl misplaced...I decided to write a Quixotesque \`western' that I hoped in my youthful enthusiasm would make the whole thing look so silly that people would stop writing or reading such junk.\\""},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Assuming you had some reason for doing so, you could dig up all kinds of critical commentary claiming that Walter Van Tilburg Clark's Western classic \\"The Ox-Bow Incident\\" transcends the genre. \\"Transcends the genre.\\" What does that mean? That's one of those dumb things critics like to say when they accidentally like something they're not supposed to. \\"Wait a minute, this is really good. It can't be Western/scifi/horror/etc.; therefore, it (music swells) TRANSCENDS THE GENRE!!!!\\" Nonsense. \\"The Ox-Bow Incident\\" doesn't transcend the genre. It's a fine example OF the genre and what good genre writing can accomplish, though it's not the finest example. \\"Ox-Bow\\" is a short book, but it still feels about 50 pages too long. It meanders and repeats itself. I'd like to see an alternate-universe version of the book, written by Elmore Leonard or Joe Lansdale, something more economical, something sharper-edged and snappier. Clark kills too much time lovingly describing every posy of the field. He didn't have to transcribe every word in the seemingly neverending debate over the rights and wrongs, ins and outs, yeas or nays, and backs and forths of a ranchers' necktie party. And his vigilante posse could stand to lose a handful of characters who do little but clutter the trail. Still, if flowery passages and levels of political allegory are what it takes to wrangle critical favor for a lowly genre work, then write em, cowboy."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Some reviewers at this site gave one or two stars to The Ox-Bow Incident because they expected to find the elements of a traditional western -- morally pure heroes defeating evil outlaws in gunfights -- and were disappointed by their absence. The Ox-Bow Incident does not follow that formula. It is a novel about good (and not so good) men who do an evil thing, men who succumb to a mob mentality, who (in today's language) fear being seen as \\"soft on crime\\" and take the law into their collective hands to assure \\"justice.\\" The novel is in large part a condemnation of vigilantism that, while set in the past, remains relevant to the modern world.One of the characters in The Ox-Bow Incident complains that \\"law, as the books have it, is slow and full of holes.\\" The current version of that complaint holds that \\"criminals have all the rights.\\" People who utter those words forget that those rights protect the innocent from undeserved punishment. The Ox-Bow Incident reminds us that the rights conferred by law do not hinder justice; they are an indispensible component of justice. The men (and one woman) in The Ox-Bow Incident who arrogantly or blindly decide to dispense with the law because \\"it is slow and full of holes\\" learn that the law, while imperfect, is more capable of achieving justice than men handing out punishments on their own authority.Yet The Ox-Bow Incident is more than a condemnation of vigilantism. It's also a psychological study. A reviewer here complained that the plot was too obvious, but this isn't a whodunit or a mystery. The novel isn't so much about what the men do as why they do it. Clark reveals the minds of characters who are afraid to show emotion, who connect with others only in very superficial ways. Most of the characters are constantly worrying about how they look to their peers, always ready to start a fight to defend their honor against the slightest affront to their manhood. They live in dread of their own feelings and are afraid to speak out against injustice if doing so might make them seem weak.A one star reviewer here complained that he didn't want to read philosophy in a western. That's fine, but the engaging philosophical discussions are, to me, the novel's strength. Clark didn't settle for a simplistic view of the Wild West that pits good men against evil-doers. The characters are a mixture of good and bad; even when they are basically good, they commit \\"sins of omission\\" by failing to stand up for their beliefs. One of the characters likens the posse to a wolf pack, none of its members willing to think independently for fear of being perceived as a lesser man than the rest. Other characters debate the nature of justice. One talks about how much easier it is to have physical courage than moral courage. The narrator (Croft) and another character (Sparks) wonder whether vengeance is God's work or man's.The Ox-Bow Incident asks compelling and fundamental questions about the individual's role in society. On top of that, it's a well written story. Look elsewhere if you want to read a traditional western, but pick up The Ox-Bow Incident if you want to read an entertaining and thought-provoking novel that has something important to say about human nature."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"The inhabitants of a ranching community get up a posse to go after a band of rustlers who are thought to have stolen cattle and committed a murder. The small number of men who try to act reasonably and thoughtfully are easily swept aside by those who are ruled by their passions, leading to disastrous results.Walter Van Tilburg Clark is a wonderful writer who has produced a powerful novel that succeeds in every way. His simple, evocative language brings the Old West to life. His characters speak with distinctive, authentic voices. Most importantly, the novel is very astute about mob psychology as it depicts the ebb and flow of the men's passions through the final tragedy in the pitiless morning sunlight to the aftermath of guilt and regret. This classic story still has much of value to say about the danger of retribution unchecked by law."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"This classic western takes a raw and realistic look at frontier justice and mob mentality. Author Walter Van Tilburg Clark (1909-1971) shows how easy it is to be caught up in the mentality of a howling mob with its inherent peer pressure, not to mention the difficulty and often danger of trying to reason with or stand up to such a mob. The OX-BOW INCIDENT involves of group of westerners in 1885 that turn to vigilantism after hearing that their friend has been killed by cattle rustlers. The men form a posse and ride out of town determined to avenge this despicable crime. The posse soon comes across three men that may be the perpetrators, but the evidence is far from certain. At this point the vengeful posse becomes a kangaroo court - despite some dissent - disdaining judges and the court system, not to mention the idea of taking their captives back to town to stand trial. Instead the mob simply hangs their captives from the nearest trees. Sometime after this rash act this vigilante group discovers that they've indeed done wrong.I gave this solid 1940 novel just four stars because it drags a bit in places, but it carries a very valuable message. The OX-BOW INCIDENT was soon adapted into a very good 1943 movie with Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I read The Ox-Bow Incident in my ninth-grade English class.

Two innocent men are caught by the mob who then invite them to a necktie party, (a hanging), and one of the people in the mob tries to stop it realizing their mistake.

I think this is a good book that reminds you to think before you act."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"What's frustrating about this novel is that while what the other positive reviews say is true, there are problems that could have easily been corrected if there had been a firmer editorial hand.First, the novel relies too much on coincidence and makes little effort to make certain implausibilities convincing. Others have written on this so I won't say more.Second, this novel is told from first person, but at times, the author seems to be so engrossed in his descriptions that the prose ceases to feel like it's from the perspective of the narrator, whose handle on florid descriptive English would likely be limited. There's a reference to his being a bookworm, but it feels like that comment is inserted specifically to address this criticism and isn't that believable, as the narrator doesn't appear to have access to books.Likewise, there are three or four sustained scenes in which the characters talk social philosophy and ethics in such a way that seems completely out of character: it's simply the author talking. A teenager muses as he's riding along, \\"We've all had those dreams. In our hearts we know that they're true, truer than anything we ever tell; truer than anything we ever do, even. But nothing could make us tell them, show our weakness, have the pack at our throats.\\" I don't think anyone talks like this; it's simply book prose.This is particularly painful in the final chapter, which feels like the author is bludgeoning the reader over the head to make his points. The conversation in which one character -- the person who probably has the least reason to feel guilty -- insists that he is the guiltiest. . . it is quite frankly tedious psychological jumbo. If I were a teacher assigning this, I wouldn't have my students read the final chapter but instead write their own ending. That would encourage more critical thinking on their part and wouldn't likely be that much clumsier than what Clark does.Finally, at the risk of sounding hyperbolic when I'm not being so, variants of the word \`grin' average out to something like once per page. This is distracting once you notice.Also, I would note that this book will take longer to read than you might expect from the length, for two reasons. The novel contains a lot -- a lot -- of set-piece descriptions of the landscape and characters (no matter how minor). Individually, these are very well done, but they're piled on so thickly that they hurt the pacing and exceed the reader's memory. (So I see where the one- and two-star reviews from students are coming from.) Also, the Modern Library edition crowds too many words on each page (e.g., thin margins). I assume this helps keep the price low, but I suspect it accounts for many of the comments that parts of this novel are a slog.These issues aside, this novel has a lot going for it. It's quite vivid, and it's able to create tension and plot reversals out of the smallest turns in conversation. I love the idea of westerns but have found that I can't stomach the cliches, which this work manages to studiously avoid. And this is one of the extremely rare novel that reads in \`real time' as it takes as long to read as it takes for the events to take place, making it a novel analog to the film High Noon. I wouldn't want to read too many novels like this, but to do so once makes for a novel experience."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"This book starts off as a typical western with gambling, drinking, and a threat of a fight. However, about 1/3 of the way through, things change and the book gets interesting and the characters begin to talk about justice and process of law. The book isn't too bad. However, it takes a lot of patience to get into. I found myself fairly bored by the first third of the book, but really getting a lot out of it by the time the posse leaves the town. There is a lot to learn from this book. It is a shame that it takes so long to get there. The author also does a fantastic job of showing each person's grief and emotional struggles throughout the story."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I am an English teacher. I came across reviews of The Ox-Bow Incident while doing a search for a student. I have always regarded this as a book which should be required reading, both for its literary and social value; and when teaching 11th grade, I have used it as a class assignment. The first part of the book which some readers found slow is really quite necessary; it provides the background that shows the reader that these are quite ordinary people - people that one would meet everyday. It contrasts with the violence in which they later become involved. The lynching of three innocent men is really not the crux of the story but rather the pivotal incident which allows the author to lead the reader to see what happens when one abandons law and order and then, when there are tragic results, must come to terms with his own conscience. I would also recommend the film with Henry Fonda and Anthony Quinn which is well acted and true to the novel. I have generally found that once students get into the novel, the book generates a good deal of thoughtful writing and discussion."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"This classic novel by Clark is a superb study of mob rule; of how normal men can allow their inner anger and authoritarianism to control their judgment and honesty. The story is told in the first person by Art Croft, a trailhand who rides into the small Nevada town of Bridger's Wells in 1885 with his friend Gil Carter. The first chapter (there are only five chapters) has all of the structure of a typical western novel (bar, poker game, fight), yet when a young rider arrives to say that some cattle have been stolen and a man killed, the story about how men let anger goad their actions sets the novel apart from other westerns. It is a true classic. In 1977 the Western Writers of America named it one of the top twenty-five western novels of all time (it was ranked second after Wister's &quot;The Virginian&quot;). The book was also made into a classic film starring Henry Fonda. I recommend this book highly. I really don't understand the comments of the reviewer from Massachusetts (of Jan. 10, 1999). The tale is very realistic."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I teach a literature class that focuses on crime and punishment in America, especially capital punishment. Among the books and films on this course are Sister Helen Prejean's &quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; Walter Mosely's, &quot;Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned,&quot; and &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident.&quot;Since &quot;Ox-Bow&quot; is the oldest of the works in terms of both writing and time period, I begin with it. This story of a mob hysteria that begins in righteousness and boredom and ends with the lynching of three innocent men never fails to stun and intrigue my students, most of whom could at first care less about &quot;Westerns,&quot; whether they be novels or films. What gets them primarily is the relentless of the action. Everyone who reads the novel at some point wants to throw it down and shout, &quot;For god's sake, these men are obviously innocent, let them go!&quot; The laconic, collective insanity of the &quot;posse&quot; is so severe that the hangings push the novel's premise very hard, hard enough that the deaths of the men are almost unbelievable. Yet that is Clark's point. Mobs don't reason; one or two men can sway them. And from this dangerous combination, utterly unreasonable events can happen.The faceless mob that goes along with its leaders is possibly instructive in the debate over capital punishment in America. Other than Japan, which still hangs a few criminals ritualistically each year, the United States is the last industrially-advanced country in the world to execute prisoners. The pro-capital punishment forces in the U.S. tend to be led by politicians and district attorneys with political agendas and egos not entirely unlike Tetley, the leader of the mob in &quot;Ox-Bow.&quot; Of course, the faceless populace of America goes along with these leaders - although recent polls show that support for executions is declining here.&quot;Ox-Bow&quot; was written sixty years ago and takes place 115 years ago (in 1885). Yet it is still an important American novel, driving as it does to the hearts of men and how mindless retributive justice can lead them to horrific acts of violence."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"This is a study in mob violence. It is definitely slow starting and preachy in its first 100 pages. It demonstrates how a charismatic leader who is significantly above most of the gathered cowboys and townsfolk in social status, can override the voices of reason and turn ordinary people into a lynch mob. It plays on the distrust of the law (see the OJ trial for a modern example) common to everyday folk in the West of 1885. I wish there had been more character development. One knows little about any of these people, including the victims. However, it provides a valuable insight into the ease with which a crowd can be turned into a mob, and how hard it is for an individual to speak up against a mob. Definitely a worthwhile book to read."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"When I think &quot;western,&quot; I think of some piece of pulp that features cowboys 'n' injuns 'n' good guys 'n' bad guys, all shooting at each other and using words like &quot;Partner.&quot;But not this book.What a raw, powerful, insightful story. It doesn't follow your typical western formula. No, this is a character study. It gives you a cold, unflinching look at mob justice, at how hard it is to go against the crowd, at how sometimes natural leaders should NOT be leaders, and the terrible, tragic results of acting on incomplete or outright false information and taking justice into your own hands.If you really read it and let yourself become immersed in the events and characters, when you reach certain parts of the book it literally feels like you've been punched in the stomach.It's moving, forceful writing that leaves you exhausted and almost despairing after the last page is done. It's rare that I read books that physically affect me, but this was one.By all means, read it. Learn from it."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Walter Van Tilburg Clark's classic novel begins like many Westerns: two ranchers, Art Croft and Gil Carter, ride into the town of Bridger's Wells. They stop at the saloon, have a few drinks after which a poker game begins followed by a fight. Things change quickly when a young man storms into town with a tale of murder and cattle rustling. Though he hasn't actually seen any of the events he's describing, the young man's tale is strong enough to insense the men in the bar. They form a lynch mob and go after the murderers and rustlers.&quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; is told through the eyes of Art Croft. From him, we see and hear Farnley who is dead set on forming the mob to exact justice; of Osgood and Davies, who both try to convince the group that justice can only be handled properly by the law; and Art himself who has doubts about the lynch mob but goes along, like every other man.This is a story about who determines what is right and wrong and how justice should be determined with all the facts instead of partial truths and one-sided ideals. It deals with the mob mentality and its consequences. Not your typical fare with a Western. Clark expertly handles the subject matter, and as I was reading, I felt as though I were part of the mob, knowing the mob is not right but powerless to do anything to stop it, swept along for the ride and the outcome. A definite classic."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"In modern-day America it seems that people are constantly questioning authority. Law after law is challenged, or even disregarded, by Mr. and Mrs. John Doe. However, American citizens of today are no different from those of the Old West. &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; is a powerful story that explains what happens when the common man (or men) takes the law into his own hands. Centering around a supposed murder, and cattle thievery, a group of men form a posse to exact their own idea of retribution. Van Tilburg Clark lets the reader know how anger leads to irrational and hasty action by the way the characters' emotions shift from moment to moment. The posse fears that the law will not punish the criminals in a &quot;just&quot; way (death). Therefore, the posse sets out for a lynching. The story is told in a manner that never allows the reader a moment of rest, always wondering what will happen next. I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a work of art."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Forget all the rest of the politics and big ideas. What stuck with me most about this book was it's structure and lauguage. It is a perfect circle, with the narator starting off looking forward to hearing a meddow lark sing it's song after a long winter holed up in a sheep shack with his partner/buddy. The sound of \\"tink a link link\\" answered after a pause by \\"teenk a leenk leenk\\". Then, after a day and night and another day and another night of chaos, he and his partner/buddy are heading out of town and he hears the meddow lark sing. The lauguage (except for a short bit near the end when it dates itself) is very simple and mostly just descriptive. The way the sky looked and what the wind did and what the horses did and how raw beef is wrapped inside a saddle bag and how a room looks in the late afternoon sun.You get all the great moralizing and politics, but what will really stick with you is the language and the structure."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"I was so enthralled by this book I read it in one day. I was so spellbound I had trouble putting it down at all. Clark's description and dialogue are superb. The theme of the law verses the mob is well known. There is a deeper theme of what happens when the minority who know better don't stand strongly enough against the majority about to commit wrong as evidenced in Davies confession to Art Croft in the hotel room towards the end of the book. The Ox-Bow Incident is not only a classic western but a classic of American literature."},{"Title":"The Ox-Bow Incident","review":"Many are only familiar with this book through the screen adaptation starring Henry Fonda. While a good movie, the book has so much more. Forget the movie; read the book.Clark sets his book in the old west--immediately post civil war. He takes a typical western scenario--a rash of cattle rustling in an isolated town cries out for \\"self-help\\" justice by the ranchers who are being driven to bankruptcy. Clark then turns this well worn premise inside out and uses it as a foundation on which to build a novel which explores what justice means and whether it can ever be implemented outside of established rules and procedures, how one acts justly as part of a group, and the causes of mob violence.Written in the 1940's, the Ox Bow Incident has clear implications for what was then a rash of lynchings across the South (and all too many in what we today think of as the \\"North--Illinois, for example). Clark brings this issue into the novel by giving a Black character a leading role (and having him speak as one of the voices of reason).Read today, the Ox Bow Incident remains highly relevant. Clark's powerful examination of the dangers of justice without process applies equally well to current events in Guantanimo and Abu Grahib as it did to lynching in the forties, and frontier justice in the 1880's.This is a book which should be read by anyone interested in gang violence, abuses in the military, national security, lynching, and human nature in general.Books become classics because they have something interesting to say about human beings. The Ox Bow Incident deserves its nomination as a classic, and should be much more widely read than it is."},{"Title":"Casa de Arena y Niebla (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is the Spanish text edition of \\"House of Sand and Fog\\", a book that is simply a masterpiece. It is an exceptionally well written and brilliantly told story of two people whose destinies become intertwined through a simple twist of fate. It is the story of what happens to them and to those who love them, when their respective worlds collide in a climactic and tragic ending.It is the story of Colonel Behrani, a formerly wealthy Iranian, who had thrived under the regime of the Shah, only to lose everything during his country's revolution. Now, he and his family find themselves undergoing the immigrant experience in America, working to maintain appearances among their fellow exiles, and finding the going hard. Working long hours at menial jobs, Colonel Behrani longs to be a master of the universe again.It is also the story of Kathy Nicolo, a woman with some serious issues. She is a sad and pathetic bottom feeder, who has lost nearly everything in life, including the one thing that has kept her somewhat anchored: the house she inherited from her father. She is a loser and innocuous bumbler who has totally squandered her life. When she loses that which she holds most dear, her house, and is summarily evicted from it, she meets Sheriff Lester Burden, a married man with children, who is smitten by her. His obsession with her would lead him down a path from which there would be no return.When Colonel Behrani's quest for the American Dream finds him with an opportunity to buy a house at a bargain basement price at a county auction, he plunks down the remainder of his family's life savings. At the time, he knows nothing of the circumstances of the county's possession of that house, Kathy's house. He and his family move in. Colonel Behrani's head is filled with dreams of selling the house at a large profit, becoming a real estate speculator, and leading his family back to its former glory and place in society. He truly believes that America is the land of opportunity. He still believes in the American Dream.Kathy, on the other hand, has done nothing with the opportunities afforded her. She has simply squandered them by marrying the wrong men, boozing, and drugging herself into oblivion. Living a marginal existence by cleaning houses and proving herself to be an untrustworthy and totally amoral person with little regard for others, her life is the antithesis of the American Dream. Still, she has this house, and when she loses it due to a bureaucratic error, the bottom totally falls out of her life. For now, she truly has nothing. Like a dog with a bone, she refuses to let the issue go and will stop at nothing to get her house back from the Behranis, whom she views as greedy usurpers. Her view of the situation is supported by Sheriff Lester Burdon, who becomes embroiled in Kathy's struggle and takes it to a level that not even Kathy could have anticipated.As the author takes the reader to the book's climactic ending, the reader will not be able to put down this beautifully crafted, literary tour de force. The author evokes a distinct mood in his narrative of the Behrani family through a clever use of language and sentence structure that seems to match the syncopation of their first language, giving it a rich, three dimensional flavor. The language of Colonel Behrani has a rich infusion of the cultural milieu out of which he arose. It is a wonderful literary contrivance used to great effect by a very talented and gifted writer.When the author writes about Kathy, the language and sentence structure of the narrative is simpler, looser, baser, and reflective of the individual around whom the author is trying to create a mood. Again he succeeds, as Kathy is a very primal character, unlike Colonel Behrani, who is more introspective. She is someone who ruins almost everything that she touches without meaning to do so. She is a person totally lacking in self-control. When she meets Sheriff Lester Burden, a tightly wound, conflicted man, very much in control of himself, his passion for her causes him to begin to lose his self-control. He begins a downward spiral that ends in a personal meltdown. The character of Kathy is somewhat pitiable, as she is the catalyst around whom the tragic events unfold. They unfold, however, in a way that she never intended.This modern day Greek tragedy, with its layers of moral and cultural complexities, is a spellbinding and suspenseful page turner, crafted by an enormously talented author who is able to construct a rich and powerful novel of the first order. It is simply a great book. Bravo!"},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"In Dubious Battle was written before Grapes of Wrath, and when read you can see the later, and better book taking shape.

This site has always been reliable and trustworthy. Thank you for being so rare at a time when no one seems trustworthy."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"This isn't Steinbeck's best work. His battleground seems to be too contrived.

Solid and moving. Pre GOW. Super edition and with an excellent introduction and suggestions for further reading. LImited in scope, compared to the epic journey of TGOW, but just as powerful, and with the same fine work."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Published in 1936, this book is Steinbeck's fictional investigation of a strike by migratory fruit pickers in California. It narrates a clash between struggling manual laborers and the corporate owners of apple orchards. The owners have surprised the workers by suddenly dropping the rates they are willing to pay. Enter two Communist agitators spouting their Red doctrine and attempting to incite the pickers to strike and riot against the Capitalists. The agitators have well-organized socialist backing that provides them with funds and contacts, food and propaganda in their pitched battle. The responsibility of the duo, Mac and Jim, is to get the strikers to follow one of their own, London, with his leftist leanings, in the uprising. Steinbeck is sympathetic to the organizers and workers. But, is that sympathy warranted by the facts? The workers were willing to pick at the lower rates, although that would probably mean lower rates for harvesting the upcoming cotton crop as well. Mac and Jim stir them into action using psychological tacticts they have used in previous organizational attempts. On the other hand, the police appear willing to keep mayhem to the minimum. Yet, vigilantes, on the side of the corporations, elicit revenge in the form of shootings and arson. I have read the book carefully, but I must admit that I am confused. As a person who grew up during the years of Commie hunters, the Cold War, and all things Red are wrong, this book forces me to take a long, hard look at my ingrained beliefs. I guess that's good. Anything that makes a person think has to be beneficial. I don't know if I can resolve this issue in my mind, but it has given me things to think about when I am trying to go to sleep at night; and keeping me awake, too. It should also be noted that Steinbeck joined the the League of American Writers, a Communist organization, the year before this book came out. His Communist aspirations led to government scrutiny, especially by the IRS. Oh, if you are trying to quit smoking, I would avoid this book. Steinbeck does a masterful job in recreating the physical and social joys of lighting up. Almost made me go out and buy a pack."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I admire Steinbeck for his beautiful descriptions, his mastery of dialogue and his ability to weave tension and dynamism into his stories, and all three qualities are abundantly on display in this early novel, which I believe is often overlooked. It's one of his best."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Though perhaps I have not trodden the halls of American literature as thoroughly as some, it seems to me that there are few American novels whose heroes are Communist organizers. This is one. An experienced labor organizer and strike director (Mac) takes an enthusiastic tyro (Jim) under his wing. They are soon called to lead a strike among the apple pickers of a California county. How they do it and the conduct of the strike is the subject of the book. The two organizers arrange support from sympathizers in the community, some of whom pay a heavy price for their ideals. Mac operates on an ad-hoc basis, using anything as grist for the mill of Revolution. The strike surfs on waves of violence caused chiefly by the so-called forces of law and order, which servilely do the bidding of the orchard owners and bankers. I wondered, as I read, if Steinbeck would turn against collectivist ideals, which hold that the individual is of no importance in the struggle to overthrow the ruling class. No, he does not. I happen to believe that the end does not justify the means. Here, you will find the opposite argument. That's why I felt that these were tarnished heroes, even if bold and ingenious, struggling valiantly and selflessly for their cause. Social justice is, at last, more important than simple class struggle. Overthrowing everything seems---in the light of the last century of history---to be equivalent to throwing the baby out with the bath water. A character called \\"Doc\\" intimates as much, but his voice is less heard. But, the title intrigues me. What does the adjective \\"dubious\\" actually refer to ? It could be Steinbeck's own question---why is this battle necessary? Or, is the fight against capitalism and oppression of workers the right one ? Or again, is such a fight at all possible, given the power that the owners can wield ? Readers will come to their own conclusions, but you have to admire the ability of the writer.The prose flows swiftly and with masterful dashes of color, interludes of calm, and perceptive portraits of working \\"stiffs\\", as he calls them. Insights on mob psychology and the nature of protest and strikes fill the pages. IN DUBIOUS BATTLE was one of Steinbeck's earlier novels, when his anger at the condition of the working class in America waxed white hot. If you ever wondered why Steinbeck was so popular in the USSR, you will understand after reading this work. It seems to me that it is not much talked about today in the USA, when there is rising resentment of an unjust system, but it should be."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"\`In Dubious Battle' is the first of Steinbeck's depression era books (which also comprises \`Of Mice and Men' and \`Grapes of Wrath) and whilst often overlooked in favour of the later two books, it is very much in the same vein. It has tight, richly evocative language and a story line that highlights the struggles of the time whilst offering up an engrossing plot. Following Jim Nolan, who helps in an apple pickers strike, this book makes you feel the anguish and frustrations of the workers being bullied and exploited by their employers and by the end you are feeling wrung out and exhausted as only a great book can make you feel. There was some controversy when this book was published and it was deemed to be sympathetic to communists and communism, but more than anything else it is a book about the down trodden and overlooked in society. I admit I am a fan of Steinbeck and his work, but even taking that into account this is exceptional even by his high standards. The language captures you immediately and you feel yourself admiring certain turns of phrase on a regular basis and your emotions being stimulated throughout, whether they be anger, sadness, loneliness, happiness or a whole gamut of other feelings. The story keeps you engaged until it's shattering conclusion and like \`Of Mice and Men' and \`Grapes of Wrath' it hits you with full impact and imprints itself on your memory to play over again and again over the coming days after you finish the book. This really is an exceptional novel and shows a master writer at his peak. This comes highly recommended indeed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"In Dubious Battle, along with many other Steinbeck's, really shows the life and hardships of life from the depression.

The story is propelled along at a quick pace as the situation worsens with each passing day. This is Steinbeck's first in his labor trilogy (\\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" followed). You can see the beginnings of those classics in this one. I read it in a day on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"When the depression hit and there were more workers than work, landowners were paying workers less and less income each season. The laborers had little recourse and no bargaining room.This story chronicles the birth of the union. It is not how the war was won, but how the battles were waged. These pages are filled with the unity of the men. How they came together and how they fell apart. How leaders were raised and how a directed mob could operate independently of direction.Steinbeck was so committed to the tale. It is timed coinciding with the Grapes of Wrath but it is a completely different story. In this book a reader will not find the starvation aspect that was so present in Grapes of Wrath, nor will they find the family element that bound those pages. It is unique.As always, I am amazed with John Steinbeck. He knew something of man and he shared a bit of it in each of his books. In Dubious Battle he wrote:\\"There aren't any beginnings,\\" Burton said. \\"Nor any ends. It seems to me that man has engaged in a blind and fearful struggle out of a past he can't remember into a future he can't forsee nor understand. And man has met and defeated every obstacle, every enemy except one. He cannot win over himself. How mankind hates itself.\\""},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"John Steinbeck's 1936 novel, In Dubious Battle, follows a labor strike by apple pickers who are attempting to combat a reduction in wages. The novel mainly focuses on the efforts of Jim Nolan, a new member of the Communist Party, who is mentored by Mac McLeod, a long time Party member and experienced labor organizer. Together, these two men try to motivate (and manipulate) the disgruntled workers into standing up for themselves against the land owners who have cut back their salaries.Nolan is emblematic of the disenfranchised worker. He comes from poverty and has watched his father fight against the system only to be beaten down by it. His mother took solace in religion, but it also provided no answers, merely a short, hard miserable life. Jim eschews vices like drinking and smoking, as well as the company of women, mainly because he doesn't want to get \\"nibbled to death\\" by responsibilities that stem from having a family to care for. He only feels alive when he's fighting the system.Mac is more cynical than Nolan, willing to use anything and anyone to achieve his goals. He coaches the younger man on the best ways to organize the striking workers, but also draws strength from the fiery Nolan.As the novel unfolds, it becomes clear that there are two sides surrounding the striking men. On one side are the interests of the land owners and on the other, the interests of the radicals. The outcome of the strike itself (and the men involved) becomes less important than the statement it sends to the other side. The landowners wish to crush the strike to make it clear that their authority is absolute and to prevent future challenges to that authority. The radical organizers don't care whether the strike succeeds or not, so long as it inspires more men to join their cause. Lost in the middle are the men who merely want to work for a decent living and need the strike to make their point.Steinbeck doesn't take either side, but his compelling characters and descriptive prose illustrate the conflict, painting a portrait informed by reality. I enjoyed this novel almost as much asThe Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics),East of Eden, andCannery Row: (Centennial Edition). If you're a fan of Steinbeck's writing and haven't read this one yet, make sure you pick it up."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"In Dubious Battle (a quote taken from John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\") is a short powerful novel which will hit you in the solar plexus of your literary being. John Steinbeck wrote three powerful novels of labor unrest in California in the 1930s:\\"In Dubious Battle\\"; \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Of Mice and Men\\".The Plot: Young Jim Nolan joins the Communist Party. He becomes a field worker who is assigned to foment a labor strike in the apple growing region of California. Steinbeck is good in describing the physical setting of the Torgas Valley where the action of the novel transpires. Nolan works with veteran organizer \\"Mac.\\" Mac is a tough old bird who has seen it all!The book is filled with bloody conflict between the orchard owners and the strikers ending in a tragic climax. There are many fascinating characters in this novel including London a striker and Lisa a young woman who gives birth during the strike. Battles between the scabs and strikers show the bitterness of this Depression era narrative. The book is a \\"bildungsroman\\" as we see naive Jim Nolan become a leader among the workers fighting for better pay. As a result of his struggle he gains in maturity and his potential for leadership is realized.Steinbeck's forte is the earthy dialogue he handles so well. He narrates the story in a reportial style avoiding author commentary. He was always on the side of the poor and oppressed.Your reviewer despises Communism! This is, however, a worthy entry in the Steinbeck canon. The author won the Nobel Prize for Literature."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"This book is great.

Dos Passos' U.S.A. boiled down to around 300 pages."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I am a huge Steinbeck fan, and have always been. There are a some of his works that I appreciate more than others. Steinbeck captures the heart and the soul of the poverty stricken, the worker bees that keep the social wheels turning.

He brings a warmth and almost acceptance to the idea of being a Communist in America."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"It is one book i read over and over.

No other time in American history exemplifies this best than the Great Depression when transplanted Okies worked up and down the West Coast. In In Dubious Battle by John Steinbeck, a group of migrant workers courageously decided to strike against the powerful and wealthy landowners. Wonderfully written, In Dubious Battle engrosses the reader easily eliciting reaction ranging from outrage to shock.First of all, I was outraged at the owners attempts to break the strike. The owners seemed to have control over just about every thing in the city. For example, the owners hired people called vigilantes to start trouble and then the coops blamed the strikers for the trouble and tried to arrest them. Next, the owners had the newspapers write that the people who got shot were shot by the strikers. A wonder example of how the process used by the owners worked was when a farmer naned Anderson, who let the strikers stay on his farm. The vigilantes burned down his farm, and the papers placed the blame in the strikers. Clearly, the vigilantes and the papers worked for the owners. The puplic did not really know that the strikers were the good guys. The public thought that the strikers were organized crime. For that reason the owners outrage me the most, for decieving the public. However, I was also shocked at how the police and newspapers were seemingly controlled by the owners. The police are supposed to uphold the law at all times. But when one of the strikers was shot and killed by the vigilantes, the cops tried to blame the rest of the strikers, even though the cops knew that the vigilantes did the killing. The papers were also aware of the truth, yet they also blamed the strikers and print editorials written to make the strikers look like organized crime. One of their editorials actually endorsed violence against the strikers:&quot;We believe the time had come to take action...This paper doesnto ad has never believed inviolence; but it does believe that when the law is not sufficient enough to cope eith these kinds of malcontents and miderers, an aroused citezenry must take a hand...&quot;Besides being impressed with how the story got my attention, I was also impressed the the main character, Jim. He was knew to the whole strike idea and was literally learning as he went along. During the story, Jim is under the guidance of a man named Mac, who is in charge. What impresses me the most is Jim's ability to be the only person who is thinking rationally in times of disorder among the rest of the strikers. THis is illustrated best when the strikers turn into a frenzied mob after someone got beat up. Jim, who is at the moment injured, uses his head to not join the mob to attack the owners, who have used the police to barricade the roads. I often thinkthat rationality is the only advantage the strikers have.To sum uo, In Dubious Battle by John Steinbeck is a wonderful book to read, as are all John Steinbeck novels. A person would read about the hadship endured by the migrant workers in a history book by they would only understand whoat happened by reading one of Steinbeck's novels concerning this subject."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"This is one of my favorite books. After reading The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, I came along In Dubious Battle. This is one of the best portrayals of labor strife in the 1930's. It read as though you are present with the protagonist. It is exciting and suspenseful, and the reader establishes a true connection with the characters. I learned about strikes, blacklisting, suspected Communists and their treatment, and more. One of Steinbeck's finest masterpieces."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Steinbeck, through In Dubious Battle, shows yet again how great a writer he is. In Dubious Battle is a great tale that incorporates the lifestyle of an applepicker with the idea of forming a union. He follows his tradition by keeping the content of his novel in a fashion that portrays a realistic and timely picture of the life that was lived by the workers in the Torgas Valley, and the others around the nation. Mac and Jim (the main characters) provide an indepth look at the times when a union was considered Communist, and themselves being &quot;Red&quot; for promoting the idea of striking, picketing and forming a union. Not only does In Dubious Battle include the realism already mentioned, but also has many places where Steinbeck infuses his ideas about the world into his characters. In Dubious Battle is a classic story of the common American worker trying to make a decent wage and live a fulfilling life."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"&quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; reads like the last few chapters of Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;: polemical, propagandist, and two-dimensional. Of course, Steinbeck is always a fabulous writer, but this work simpply can't compare to &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;East of Eden&quot;. The characters are types (the cold-blooded radical, the hot-blooded radical, the straight and simple working-class leader) without the perfect nuances of individual character that one usually finds in Steinbeck's creations. The prose is less poetic than in his earlier novels; if you're the sort that hates Dickens and Hardy and you skipped the rambling descriptive chapters if &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; I guess that wouldn't be a minus though. But unless you're a die-hard Steinbeck fan, you might as well skip this one in my opinion."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I love this book! I don't know how many times I've reread it, but it is my favorite of all of Steinbeck's works."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"This is novel was an interesting book to someone who is interested in history, but for most others it is rather dry. The main character, Jim Nolan, is at time likable and also despicable. The other characters are not as endearing as those from &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Of Mice &amp; Men&quot;. If you are looking to read a GOOD Steinbeck novel then read one of the aforementioned, but spare yourself from reading this novel. It reads quickly and is easy to understand, but it just doesn't grab you like his other books. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the highly accurate portryal of migrant life in the 1930's."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Good Service, received on time, book was a bit beat up but was acceptable since it was used. No Complaints."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"East of Eden.\\" Instead I have focused on \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and his lesser known works, such as \\"To a God Unknown\\" and, my personal favorite, \\"Pastures of Heaven.\\" I've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.When I began reading \\"In Dubious Battle,\\" it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck's work. Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac's radical cell. There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers. Early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.Suddenly, Steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again. After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, I expected the sense of excitement to continue. It simply never does.Summary of \\"In Dubious Battle\\" - Workers get mad. Workers get tired. Workers get mad. Workers get tired. Workers get mad. Workers get tired.The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking. And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book. Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense......and eating. Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food. There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.Steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters. But I advise any reader of \\"In Dubious Battle\\" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down. You won't miss anything. Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.I suppose now I'll give \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" a go. Perhaps if it isn't one of his \\"greats,\\" it isn't worth reading."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I know it's considered sacrilige to be critical of the great John Steinbeck, but this book is an insufferable soap box bore. If the characters didn't repeat themselves so endlessly, 100 pages could have been shaved off, and the book would be better for it. There was not one character in the story I cared about, and I was relieved to reach the end."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I am a big Steinbeck fan and have read most of his books. I like them all, but this one is a very gripping tale about farm labor and unions in the California central valley. It is a very moving book."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"This book is solid. Steinbeck engages with the reader with symbolic themes such as struggle of the exploited proletariat and the dissenting views of 1930's America in this story about the rise of a local fruit pickers strike. As usual, Steinbeck does a great job throwing the reader into a vivid setting he has created- while at the same immersing the reader into the everyday struggle of the \\"working class\\" American with nothing to lose. Steinbeck's inclusion of real characters who are not shy to have a opposing opinion about the importance of the drive of the primary protagonists plays an vital role in the story. A must read for anyone fascinated with the frustrations of everyday workers, including their failure and successes."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"The other reveiws say something like how it teaches you how hard life was or something or other, but I just thought that it was a great story. I have read 8 Steinbeck books and there was only one I didn't like he can really write some good books."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"A teacher once told me that the hallmark of a good book is that it changes your mind. This book changed my mind about a good many things: the nature and results of capitalism, labor unions, socialism, work, wages, the individual and the group, destiny, and free will and choice, to say nothing of Steinbeck himself. Once I was able to break out of the mindset that Steinbeck wasn't saying what I felt he should be saying about America and our way of life, I was able to see that to be a part of our lifestyle is not necessarily to agree with it, and that our adopted lifestyle is not inherently good and fulfilling for all. Challenging things to consider, that all things are not black and white, cause and effect. What courage Steinbeck has to see and believe these things, let alone write about them with such honesty, objectivity and grace. It is not his most complete work, but to judge it against &quot;Grapes&quot; or &quot;Winter of our Discontent&quot; is to do disservice to this book's own merits. Steinbeck, through this book, opens my mind and touches me in a way few other created things can, and I thank him."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I read my first Steinbeck work for a school project and, I guess, became addicted. He is such a powerful writer. I am doing yet another Steinbeck project because he is such a captivating author and extremely talented writer. I have read so many of his novels and it is interesting to see how they all tie together and connect to his own life as well. In Dubious Battle is a powerful story of the apple pickers and their struggle for justice. Steinbeck paints wonderful pictures for his readers. He captured the essence of migrant living in his novels. Steinbeck paved the way for more daring writing in the twentieth century. He was the most influential modern writer.

A powerful, compassionate novel on the struggle of man for justice."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I'm glad that I read &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; because it offered a new perspective on Communism and mob mantality. It made me see through the eyes of California's oppressed field workers. Steinbeck paints both beautiful and frightening pictures of what people are like in the face of adversity by showing their reactions on both individual and group levels. In a sense, reading &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; is an educational experience in safe voyeurism. Steinbeck illustrates the cycle of the fight against injustice and the loss of self that can ensue in the process. The novel shows from beginning to end that in accomplishing something revolutionary, it is of utmost importance to &quot;never submit or yield.&quot;"},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"\\"In Dubious Battle\\" is basically the first of Steinbeck's socially-engaged novels, in which he portrays a strike staged by itinerant fruit-pickers against price-cutting orchard owners. This is hardly a pamphlet for the labor movement or the Communist Party, though, as Steinbeck is less interested in pontificating than showing the frustations of the workers and the toll that their resistence actually takes on them and the local community. It also shows the organizational difficulties involved in getting a diverse group of dissatisfied workers to work for a common cause. The characterization is vivid and brilliant. Aside from its obvious literary value, this novel also has historical value, for like Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" (although with greater realism and much less pathos) it provides a powerful description of the plight of working people in America earlier in the 20th century. \\"In Dubious Battle\\" gives readers a good idea of the type of courage it took, and still does take, to fight for positive change and social justice."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Steinbeck masters several different purposes with this book. First, he provides us with, in typical Steinbeck fashion, an in-depth character study of several figures worthy of discussion. The characters are intriguing, life-like and hold our attention as they move through their existence.Second, he weaves a picturesque and spellbinding story with this ability to animate scenes with his words. He truly captures the idea of &quot;suspension of disbelief;&quot; the reader has no doubt he/she is reading about real places and people.Last and most important, Steinbeck turns the tables on the reader in the last paragraph of the book. While this book may superficially appear to be a scathing commentary on the ruthlessness of unchecked capitalism, its really a singular question on human nature, regardless of the dominant socio-economic system, be it capitalism or communism. The reader must make up his/her mind at the end on which is the worse crime: exploitation of the masses for profit or exploitation of the masses for personal power and position, especially at the expense of a friend and allie.One of the most powerful books I have read in such a few number of pages."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"By far, Steinbeck had his finest moments writing this story. That says a lot about a man who did such great character studies as Of Mice And Men, The Grapes Of Wrath, The Winter Of Our Discontent, and The Pearl. In this story, Steinbeck hits a raw note rarely reached in American Literature. Few people would have it in them to write a story about the &quot;Reds&quot; in the 1930s. Steinbeck not only wrote the story, he made it his masterpiece. The story alone is the best he ever published. A story about a migrant worker strike in California and the effects of an ununionized strike unfold in the novel. The more important part of the novel is the humanist views Steinbeck took. Every man can feel the hate of the system tearing you apart. He captures that hate in all 300 pages of this story. In every aspect, he captured people who have been pushed too far in In Dubious Battle. He told the story of men who had nothing to lose and in the end lost anyway. This is not another story of the underdog. This is the story of the American Dream being left unfulfilled."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Like the preceding reviewer, I felt that Warren French's essay offered a very poor introduction to this novel. It isn't simply that French gives too much of the story away; that could be solved simply be reading the 'introduction' later. More bothersome is how his analysis is based mainly on elements that are exterior to the novel (a few comments in Steinbeck's personal letters, historical anecdotes...) but remains largely at odds with the novel itself.Contrary to French's convoluted claims, the novel is first and foremost a careful study of various aspects of worker/capital confrontation, played out in the form a depression era fruit pickers' strike. Steinbeck uses his two main characters, Mac and Jim - two 'communist agitators' who are instrumental in whipping up sentiments of resistance among the workers - to offer a 'big picture' perspective of the organizational aspects of the confrontation. The bulk of the novel explores tactics, with many of the typical property owner ploys and worker counterploys represented, and it attempts to dissect and explain the vicissitudes of worker morale (and, to a lesser extent, to explore the psychology of those acting on the side of the forces of repression). The specifics may be dated, but anyone involved in social struggles today will immediately recognize most of the tactics and the psychology. I am thinking less of contemporary strikes in North America, which have generally evolved into less violent confrontations, and more of struggles where people are still fighting to gain the power of solidarity. Worker struggles in the third world come to mind, but also the larger struggle to establish unity against the neoliberal agenda. Participants in recent 'antiglobalization' protests, for instance, will see many familiar elements in \\"In Dubious Battle\\" .French's contention that \\"In Dubious Battle\\" is a 'bildungsroman' is also pretty far off the mark. It is true that Jim, undergoing his apprenticeship as an organizer/agitator, is revealed to be a natural tactician. But generally the characters remain constants throughout the novel. I would agree with other commentators here who have complained that the personalities are somewhat stiff - ceratinly, that is, in comparison with the depth with which Steinbeck usually imbues his characters.Steinbeck is only minimally concerned with 'character development' in this novel. He is more concerned with the ways in which broad social solidarity develops, and also with some of the concomitant tactical and moral issues. Steinbeck shows strikers resorting to violence, and yet he describes the overall situation accurately enough to make the reader fully aware that, faced with an enemy which has overwhelming control over property and legal apparatus, these are very often the only means for workers to trigger awareness of the need for larger solidarity.French claims that the battle \\"is dubious not because the outcome is uncertain... but rather because it was the kind of struggle that should never have occurred at all.\\" This, in my mind, totally misses the point. Steinbeck clearly recognizes that the battle *must* be fought for workers to improve their lot. The failure of the apple pickers' strike is certain, but just as certain is the fact that it will pull workers together in future and discourage the growers from being quite as mercilessly exploitative. The \\"dubious\\" part has to do with the means by which the battle is fought, and particularly the tendency to sacrifice individuals and small groups unscrupulously to a larger cause. Doc Burton is the only character who fully grasps the implications of this; namely, that the ultimate goal towards which Mac and the 'reds' are fighting - i.e. a classless (and non-violent) society - is undermined by the means which they are using.For those who are new to Steinbeck and are looking primarily for a good read, I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" offers a much more moving evocation of exploitation and discrimination. \\"In Dubious Battle\\" has its fair share of excitement, but it is a primarily a practical (and consequently more prosaic) analysis of the realities of fighting exploitation ."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"The best book by Steinbeck. Gritty down in the dirt daily lives of workers. In today's world people forget that it was the Communists who fought and won many benifits workers enjoy now."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Having just come out of a 49-day strike myself, I can say Steinbeck captures the logistics of a strike: the manipulation by the media against the strikers, the changes moods of the strikers, the importance of gathering public support. Steinbeck gives a balanced view of manipulators on both sides:the leaders of the strike and the employers. Jim Nolan, the protagonist,is lead by an over-zealous racical, Mac, into riling up disenfranchized apple pickers in a fictious town in California. Steinbeck's talent is in making you experience the strike in real-time, ugly warts and all. Although I felt the ending was harsh, Steinbeck gives the reader a lasting and haunting image of the kinds of sacrafices that were made to fight for the rights of working stiffs. I was most impressed by the vivid characters, an economy and dimension of a Doesteovski novel, as well as an ability to capture scene. I wanted to see more of the aftermath of the strike, but Steinbeck ends the novel like a kick in the gut. Almost too abrupt for my taste, but, alas, this is a classic and well worth the time of anyone wanting to better understand the dubious nature of a strike--its work never finished in a single lifetime."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"\\"In Dubious Battle\\" is not Steinbeck's best novel. It's heavy on the preaching of workingman values, uses characters to convey belief in that awkward way you see in blatantly political novels, and it ends abruptly and unsatisfactorily, as if Steinbeck were racing against a deadline.But it's refreshing to read the novel in light of today's capital-dominated society. While the poor get steadily poorer, and the rich richer, Steinbeck's message still resonates today. Steinbeck's characters fight barehanded against orchard monopolies and their collected police and vigilante forces armed with guns, tear gas, and money. The Red agitators at the center of the story spark the day laborers' fear and anger and incite a strike, which brings the men together brandishing hope instead of guns. We could take a lesson from the Depression-era strikers and demand a fairer, more just society, one they so obviously failed to win for us.Though stiff and ragged as it is, the novel also haunted me as I read it. While the conditions of oppressive capital exists now more strongly than ever, the workingman's struggle is long dead. In fact, today's average working stiff is the guy in the novel who loves his truck so much that he won't risk it in the battle for his own humanity. It's not until the truck is destroyed that he becomes truly vengeful.So when you're blue about suburban sprawl, when you spend day after day in a cubicle working on meaningless projects, or when you watch our nation's highest offices sell to the highest bidders, pick up this book and howl."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"This is one of those books that changes the way you see the world.I've read a few of Steinbeck's books, including the big ones and some of the smaller ones.In Dubious Battle is just as excellent as Grapes of Wrath, only in a smaller way. After I finished this book, I sat and thought for a long time, unable to get it out of my mind.This is not to be missed. Entertaining and thought provoking."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"I'm disappointed to read that some folks regard the characters in this great book as caricatures - rather, they reflect the hard-working, strong-willed people that struggled so during the Great Depression, and made huge headway in business, that we today benefit from. With this in mind, I want to sing Steinbeck's praises for a moment, and thank him for making a difference in his own time. He was unafraid of putting the spotlight on a difficult truth in American history, and doing so effectively.This book is distinct from The Grapes of Wrath, in that it studies closer the reality of an actual strike, and the involvement of the Communist Party therein. As the reader follows the experience of Jim and Dan, the lead characters, their strengths and flaws come to the surface, as they struggle to keep the strike underway, and the men and women involved strong. Their trials and tribulations are realistic, and depicted in an edge-of-your-seat manner. The ending, much like that of Grapes, is a heart-wrencher, perhaps even moreso. Any reader with heart and conscience is left stunned, and provoked. Although the book is a work of fiction, it is surely not far from the truth. Truly a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Efforts of workers in this country to organize and to fight for fair wages and decent working conditions have been long and extremely arduous. The history of the labor movement has been fraught with violence and bloodshed. It was not until Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal that Congress passed laws allowing workers to organize and to strike for the conditions which should have been rightfully theirs all along.Set in California in the 1930s, _In Dubious Battle_ accurately depicts individuals who strike when the owners of the orchard in which they pick apples decide to reduce their pay. The book documents these workers' extreme poverty and hunger, as well as their fears of bodily harm or even death at the hands vigilantes and police with whom they must contend during the strike. Their leaders, some of whom are on the extreme left political fringes, are men of fervor and dedication who are willing to sacrifice their own lives in the struggle. Steinbeck who often wrote of the sufferings of the common people, to his credit, presents a balanced portrait of these men. Bullying unarmed strikers into a fighting frenzy against men who possess deadly weapons, exploiting the martyrs in their ranks, and stealthily committing arson as methods of gaining them sympathy, were considered ethical acts that justified their worthy ends. One of the book's great strengths was its non-fictional, documentary feel. Admittedly, Steinbeck's matter of fact approach and dialogue sometimes dulled the book's dramatic impact. On the whole, though, I felt as if I were living amongst very realistic people, experiencing their disappointments fighting a dubious battle in an ultimately successful war for economic freedom of all working people."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Unlike Steinbeck's other works, \\"In Dubious Battle\\" exhibits much more of a social conscience toward the need of the average man. Aside from \\"The Grape of Wrath\\" and \\"The Moon is Down\\", this trait of Steinbeck is not always evident in his work. Although communism is never mentioned by name, the book is centered around the laborers that organize in a fruit strike in the California Valley. In his storytelling, flaws are revealed on both ends of the spectrum so it would be inaccurate to call this book pro-communist. Yet the pro-labor leanings expressed in the book may reveal a preference.Jim Nolan is new to the movement, leaving his past life with the idea of making a difference. While he initially seems to be the main character, the focus becomes quite broad. \\"The party\\" plans to incite a strike and seeks employment as pickers with this in mind. As the plot is sets up, the story moves somewhat slowly in the initial pages. The reader may find himself/herself waiting for the descent to begin as rage gradually builds among the workers.As the strike begins, the characters begin to take shape in a form similar to characters in Steinbeck's other works. As the rules of working life are removed, some of the men struggle without structure in their lives. While Jim becomes familiar with the life of the party, Mac and London act as a guiding force with the future in mind. However, Doc is the steady force in the novel as he provides a remarkably objective eye toward the movement. Although his role is less prominent, he may be the most complete character in the book.My only real disappointment in the novel is that I felt it ended to abruptly. The factions are headed toward what is seemingly their ultimate clash as the story draws to a close. While the answer of a war between communist and capitalistic ideas has seemingly been won in the real world, one has to wonder how it ended in the world created by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"This is a story of the attempt of the Communist Party to infiltrate the labor movement. Using the rage of migrant farm workers against the unfair labor practices of the California agricultural community, and anything else possible, up to and including the dead bodies of their friends, labor organizers convince growing numbers of workers to organize. The title of the book, &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; discusses the dubious choices made by the leaders of the labor movement of that time, inserting socialist ideals and abdicating conscience for the &quot;cause&quot; in many cases. It traces the slow evolution of its main character as the plight of workers versus values such as the rights of farmers, and morality, to name two, bring him to make choices."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Steinbeck has an amazing way of just grabbing you by the neck and thrusting you into the full swing of a strike. He manages to keep up so much tension and suspense throughout that you're just dying for more and more. One word of advice, don't bother reading the introduction by Warren French. It not only gives away the ending, some parts of it sound more as if he were venting some personal vendetta against the Yale professor and literary critic, Harold Bloom. Smack of jealousy? Anyway, it may seem irrelevent to be reading a book about commies in this age of time but I really liked the way Steinbeck was trying to humanise the other side and to show that at the end of the day we were all just human beings. Especially poignant was the constant reference to the mob mentality and how people change completely and adopt animalistic characteristics void of humanity or those associated with the individual. It's scary, how we can degenerate. Just look at the world around us today. Both 'good' and 'evil' are guilty of this i'm afraid. Oh well..."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"By far, Steinbeck had his finest moments writing this story.

It's about the effort of a group of farm workers to organize and their ultimate defeat by the field owners.Jim Nolan joins the Communist party and goes to the camp of a group of fruit pickers in Torgas Valley for training. Soon the strike breaks out; the orchard owners try to bribe the strike leaders (Dakin and London), to no avail, and then bring in strikebreakers from San Francisco. Things get nasty and violent, with men getting beaten up, some shot (Jim and a character named Joy), and the strikers destroying some of the orchards. The book ends on an exciting and passionate note when Jim is ambushed and shot and Mac, another strike organizer, retrieves his body and pleads the striker's cause over his dead body.Steinbeck's novel is insightful and dramatic. It is written almost totally in dialogue, and the men's speech is raw and brutal. Although his sympathies are obviously on the side of the strikers, he doesn't deify them or demonize the opposition. Mac thinks of the strikers as mere pawns and feels the right to do anything to succeed. Doc Burton who comes to the striker's camp in charge of sanitation, is an interesting character because of his neutrality - he doesn't care about the politics involved and refuses to moralize. Steinbeck ends the book in uncertainty: we never really find out what happens with the strikers, their cause, their success. The chief strength of the book lies in Steinbeck's characterizations; the men are well drawn and true to their natures (though one-dimensional, a fault here that was magnificently corrected in THE GRAPES OF WRATH). A powerful book and a defining book in Steinbeck's canon."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"after i read this book I had a feeing of depression, anger, and inspiration all at once. steinbedk has a frighteningly sharp insight and imagination"},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"The novel is, from its shell, seemingly one of Steinbeck's most objective novels. However, analysing this work, you should find that it is in fact a wonderful experiment in psychological writing for mister Steinbeck. The novel analyses mob mentality and the devestation it can inflict, but also is one of the first of his works to include his &quot;group-man&quot; theory, that a cooperative group is man. As for souls, they do not exist in an individual sense, only when man is one, together. While Steinbeck ardently disagreed with the tactics of Communists, this &quot;group-man&quot; suggests a natural socialism... Also, the book is wonderfully fascinating as a kind of modern-day metaphor representing Milton's Paradise Lost. A great read."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"In Dubious Battle seems to be a continuation of Grapes of Wrath, though I considered it far superior to Grapes when I was young. I read this one half a dozen times between the ages of 20 and 30 and loved it each time. Tried it again at 50 and didn't care a whit for it. We live, we learn, our tastes and ideas change."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"Well I came on to write a review about a really good book I read. Something that struck me as interesting was that almost every review for this book was given 5 stars. There were a few 4's and one idiot who gave it 3 and didn't even state his reason. Anyway its a magnificent book and you should definatly read it. If you have read this or Cannery row please do not go on to read Grapes of Wrath. The book itsn't a fun read. I have read many of Steinbeck's works and of all of them I loved this best."},{"Title":"In Dubious Battle","review":"The book's imagery of the mob is amazing. Being a high school student, I've been *ever so lucky* to analyze this book and take it apart until it was nothing but mush. The ending offers a lot of interpretation and the book allows the reader to debate about topics of great variety as the book goes on. The book offers vivid pictures to paint in the reader's head. If you read the book, don't go about analyzing it, it just ruins the story."},{"Title":"Mathematics, Second Edition (3 Volume Set): Its Content, Methods, and Meaning","review":"This Russian work of 1956 was translated in 1964 by S.H.

As the title suggests, the Haitian people's struggle for freedom from oppression is the focus, but the editors manage to weave a lot more than history and politics into the work. The selections are interesting and concise, and well organized into chapters with equally concise introductions. Lib&egrave;te is invaluable as an introduction to Haiti, but also will fill in knowledge gaps for most Haiti veterans, and is a handy reference on the bookshelf.The book's breadth is striking: 187 selections, mostly excerpts, are grouped into ten chapters, including history, politics, rural and urban life, refugees, culture and literature. The selections are well chosen, and represent much of the best that has been written about Haiti. Selections date from the end of the 15th century to the end of the 20th; their authors hail from Haiti, Europe, North America and the Caribbean. The selections include primary and secondary non-fiction, as well as novels, poetry and photographs. The writers were (and are) participants, chroniclers, anthropologists, scholars and artists.Lib&egrave;te's brevity is equally impressive: all that is crammed into 352 pages. Each selection can be read in a few spare minutes, each chapter in an hour or two (I first read it over a month of breakfasts). The price of this breadth and brevity is depth: although the editing is skillful, no skill can distill a book adequately into a page or two, especially a great one, nor adequately treat a complex subject in two-dozen pages. In this sense, Lib&egrave;te is not an end in itself, but a starting point. The reader should keep this limitation in mind, and use the book as inspiration and guide to further reading.Each chapter begins with a short introduction by the editors, which places the selections in context and fills in some of the gaps between them. Lib&egrave;te ends with a comprehensive index and citations for all included material. It does not, unfortunately, contain a bibliography discussing the useful material that did not make the final cut.Although the various authors represent a diversity of perspectives, Lib&egrave;te is assembled consciously from an activist point of view. The principal editor is the coordinator of the London-based Haiti Support Group, and a long-time supporter of Haiti's democratic transition. The book reflects an activist's adoption of Haiti's poor majority as the starting point for analysis, as well as an emphasis on the adverse impacts of a host of \\"isms\\" - colonialism, imperialism, racism and capitalism - on Haitians' struggle for freedom, especially freedom from poverty.About half of Lib&egrave;te chronicles the series of oppressions that have kept Haiti's majority vulnerable to exploitation. They include outsiders, from Columbus' explorers to the French slave-holders, the occupying U.S. Marines, and the current enforcers of neo-liberal economic policy. They also include home-grown oppression - brutal political and military potentates, and the economic elites they served. The book shows how the poor in Haiti were kept in their place with force, including slavery, war and civilian massacres, but also with law, politics, diplomacy, land tenure, social structures, the economy and the education system.Lib&egrave;te does not, however, treat Haiti and Haitians as mere objects of these large forces. Its other half chronicles the courage, creativity, resourcefulness and persistence of Haitians as they wage their perpetual uphill battle for freedom. This resistance uses brute force when it has to, but also art, literature, song, politics, social organization, work and even botany where it can. Although it often seems to be losing the war, Lib&egrave;te points out the many areas where the struggle has carved out space for freedom to express, to create, to vote and to live. The book highlights Haitians' agency by featuring Haitian voices, in works of fiction, newspaper articles, interviews and essays, many of them for the first time in English.Lib&egrave;te does not speak directly to some of the current debates raging about Haiti, but that may be one of its strengths. By focusing on the issues that are important over the long-term, it provides an example of looking past the petty internecine battles that have plagued Haitians' struggle for freedom, to the more vital long-term work to be done. The long view also extends the book's shelf life: by not depending on today's events, the selections, and the editors' analyses ensure their relevance for a long time to come (sadly, until \\"Lib&egrave;te\\" is achieved).Lib&egrave;te is an excellent introduction to Haiti, possibly the best in English. A student, visitor or solidarity activist who had read nothing else on Haiti would have a pretty good idea of what was going on in a variety of fields. It is equally useful for veterans: it points out the gaps that we all have in our knowledge, and shows where we can go to fill these gaps. It is also a good reference for the specialist's shelf, for quick access to subjects outside one's expertise."},{"Title":"A Haiti Anthology: Libete","review":"Haiti is a country that provokes strong responses and Libete is the perfect introduction to the wide variety of voices that have commented on the country and its history. Inevitably, there is much tragedy to relate both in the brutal history of slavery and in the later oppression and exploitation of the Haitian peasantry by the wealthy elite and the consistent interference from successive U.S. governments, which sadly continues to this day. Each chapter focuses on a particular topic, drawing on around 20 different commentators, both foreign and Haitian. Many of these are contemporary reports, relating true life stories from the city streets and country villages, showing a life that many people living in affluent Western culture simply have no concept of at all. Yet the story of Haiti is also one of struggle and courage in the face of adversity and these voices are clearly heard as well in Libete. Many good people working in small ways to the best of their ability to improve life for the poor, who form such an overwhelming majority. Another message that comes through the book is that it is this majority who constitute the soul of Haiti, which is so vibrantly expressed in Haitian culture. In the section on literature, it is significant that Haitian authors, largely drawn from the elite class, either celebrate peasant culture or despise it - it is clearly too strong to simply ignore. Vodou is also an integral part of this culture and the extracts included reflect the diversity of attitudes towards this much maligned spiritual tradition. One of my favourite sections is the selection of proverbs, amongst which is \\"Money goes where money is\\" which seems to sum up current economic theory very neatly. Buy this book and find out how the majority live!"},{"Title":"A Haiti Anthology: Libete","review":"\\"Libete\\" is a comprehensive and concise anthology of writings on a wide spectrum of topics, including the history, religion, art, and politics of the country.

Hence I was very eager to get my hands on the latest installment of this series, \\"The Hunters\\". The book started off at a good pace in Hungary but as it progressed the protagonist got involved in endless discussions with various agencies and the storyline kind of dragged on without much steam. I honestly had trouble reading till the end. I have also started disliking Griffin's idea of removing female characters from the stories abruptly. This time it was with Betty Schneider. She was seldom mentioned during the entire story and at the very end she just ditches Charley!! I've seen similar ending with his other female characters in the other series that he has written (\\"Men in Blue\\").I really hope that he brings in a bit more action in his next installment of the \\"Presidential Series\\" which is due in January 2008."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Mr Griffin -- I hope you see this and think about it.

For the first time, I thought that it took forever to get into an of his book's with the constant repetition of what has happened in previous books, endless dialogue and details that somehow seemed irrelevant. Yes, there are moments of suspense and the characters are believable, but in all, not up to par to what one might suspect with as relevant a theme as \\" oil for food\\"."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I am very rarely moved to review on amazon but this wretched doorstop has compelled me to do so.For what is billed as an action novel, there is hardly any action. I had expected something like the rollercoaster rides of Matthew Reilly. If you get the action, poor writing style can be forgiven. Here the author appears to have been paid by the word.In the 800+ pages of mind numbing story, there are less than 70 pages of what you would recognise as action. Instead the ludicrously large number of badly drawn characters (they are just names and you stop caring who each of them is supposed to be by page 500) firstly recount what has just happened to them, they then discus what it all means, then they discuss what they will do next. Then a decidedly non-gripping event happens, which sets them all off again.There are pages and pages of characters recounting the plot.There is some merit in the depiction of the modern intelligence apparatus but a novel should not transport you to the brain-sapping tedium of much intelligence work, it should concentrate on the periods of action and terror.This book just picks up where the previous one left off - it does not provide the beginning, middle and end that a novel is supposed to. There is no early dramatic event to kickstart a new plot. Hundreds of pages in, the reader still has no idea what the characters are trying to achieve or why anyone should care.We readers of pulp airport novels do not expect Tolstoy's scope, Dickens' characters or even Le Carre's poetic writing. What we do expect is an exciting read, driven by a convincing plot (self-contained within that one book) and compelling characters. Griffin fails on all counts.I hope this is the worst novel I read this year because they don't get much worse.Save your money."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Griffin is a great story teller and he does all the research to make it credible, the international settings are great and the local knowledge is great!i enjoyed the whole series"},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Yet another great book by the best military writer of our time. Seriously, Griffin has done it again - the war on terror is huge and Charlie Castillo is just the man to fight it. The book takes us into the highest offices in the Land and implementing the President's wishes are right up Charlie's alley. A great book in yet another terrific series about our Military. Kudos to WEB Griffin on this one."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"The problem with WEB Griffin books is that they end and it's a year long wait before another one is published."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"There's no need to recycle comments already made detailing the plot.This book kept me glued to the page throughout an entire night. Others have complained about \\"non-essential\\" details; I found them fascinating. Like a good police-procedural, much of the payoff is in the details.I enjoyed the political skirmishings that underlie any military and intel organizations, that are sometimes as vicious as the thud-and-blunder parts of such adventure stories. We also meet some interesting characters, or get more development of previously met characters."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I've read all three books in this series. Really liked the first one, second one was ok, but this one was disappointing. Very little plot advancement and FAR too much of the characters rehashing events that had already occurred with each other. I'm sure that kind of thing probably happens in real-life FBI and CIA investigations but it's not necessary to subject your readers to it. I can't figure out why in the world Griffin felt it necessary to use up valuable page space with so many plot rehashes, unless of course he was intentionally doing it to meet his publisher's requirement for manuscript length.I actually put this book down about halfway through and was able to pick right up where I left off about a month later without having to go back and refresh my memory about what had happened earlier in the book, because a) there wasn't much of it, and b) I figured (correctly) that Griffin had built in more rehashes later in the book. And no, that's not a compliment."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"The Hunters is typical Griffin fare in an expanded format. Longer than usual but satisfying none the less. Someone should tell W.E.B that scamblers use algorithms not logarithms, but that is a minor point."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I have have enjoyed some other works by this author. This was also an interesting story line but it could have been done in half the pages. If you want a very detailed view of what top operatives might do in a day (where and what they eat, how they manage to keep their cell phones charged, what credit cards they use, etc.) then this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"The third book in the Presidential Agent series continues right where The Hostage left off with our hero Charley Castillo trying to unravel a mystery that could have far-reaching consquences. Griffin's level of detail and sheer knowledge of how the various levels of government and military operate are only surpassed by the witty dialogue that truly brings his characters to life. You really feel as though you're a member of the team traveling across the world trying to figure out what's going on, and each of the characters has a distinct personality and background that makes you feel that you could get to know each and every one. The detail put into the locations comes from the author's travels across the world and it really feels authentic and immersive.If you're expecting gun battles at every turn, you won't find it in this particular novel of the series, but if you're looking for thoroughly entertaining dialogue and intrigue, then you will be satisfied. Don't worry though, there are thrilling action scenes, but not too much as to make it unrealistic. Each battle has an effect on the characters that can be seen throughout the novel, adding to the depth of their personality.If you want a contemporary military/espionage/counter-terrorism novel with witty dialogue and incredible attention-to-detail, then this is a great choice. Just be sure to read the first two novels in the series to get the full effect."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I enjoy W.E.B. Griffin's writing.

Griffin's books. I think I have read every book he has written beginning with his marvelous stories of WWII. His characters are unforgettable as are the actions of the individuals, the units, and their leaders. However, this book set me back a bit with its huge length and stretched out storyline. I realize the author has to bring readers up-to-date with his characters if they have not read his previous books, but The Hunters drags this process out far too long. The story itself has its good areas and suspense of actions by agents assigned by and for the President of The United States that allows them to go any direction they wish to go and/or control.Presidential assigned Charley Castillo reports only to the President. He has far-ranging power in his actions, his selection of those that he wishes to assist him, where he wants to go in the entire world, and who he does and doesn't wish to associate with no matter who they are. This assignment however places Charley too close to being controlled by other government agencies and this he does all he can to circumvent any of these that would have themselves boss Charley around. This is not Charlie's way of doing anything in his work.As I said, there were many action parts of this book if you can read through to get to them. You will tour the world several times, meet all kind of official government leaders, foreign and domestic, secret agencies and their leaders, hired killers and those that would hire them to kill anyone, anywhere, and those loyal to Charley that would place themselves in front of a bullet for him. The main issue in the book is the scandal regarding the murders and missing money in a growing United Nations/Iraq oil for food problem that is growing continually. Charley and the many working for him and with him, again foreign and domestic, have to travel the world digging into all the \\"dirt\\" they can find as they attempt to recover the missing money and those that have killed many to cover up all the facts. Charley and all his cohorts are not immune to the attempts and/or actual killing or wounding by these desperate killers.Money seems to be no problem for Charley. He can get \\"blood out of a turnip\\" legally or illegally. Charley has so many working with him that have important knowledge that can use their brain to its fullest. Charley is also rich and very intelligent despite his young age and those working with him know they dare not cross him.There is a huge lack of any love in this book. The love connection that Castillo had was in a hospital since she had been wounded in a previous book. They did connect but for a short period of time in this book but not near enough in my estimation. If you like action books and have not read very many of W.E.B. Griffin's books, you will probably enjoy this book. If it were half its size the reader would be better served, again in my mind. I know Mr. Griffin didn't ask me my advice. I will probably read his future books but I am hoping he learns to reduce the monstrous size of his books and thinks of the readers."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"This third novel of the presidential Agent series completes the story begun in The Hostage. Carlos Castillo, the Presidential Agent has solved the mystery of the kidnapping of the diplomate's wife in the second novel. They have found the mysterious UN official and were successful in defeating the \\"ninja team\\" sent to thwart their plans. At the same moment that the end of novel two is developing, the opening of novel three takes place. An attempt to kidnap Billy Kocian, who was introduced in The Hostage, novel two, results in a quick trip to Hungary then back to Argentina. Now they are on the trail of the leaders of the kidnap plot of novel two. The pace is quick and the end of this novel ends the story begun in book two."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Griffin can talk the talk and in The Hunters I sense that he has talked with those who have walked the walk.I enjoyed The Hunters even though I did not care for the only other book of Griffin's that I read, years go: Honor Bound, when it first came out; I had had a belly full of the military after 4 years of active duty.The Hunters is similar in format to the books that I enjoy; like those of Vince Flynn, Andy McNab -his first two, Richard Marcinko -his first one, and those of Brian Haig. The Hunters even reminded me of Clancy's Rainbow books.In The Hunters Griffin's timing is excellent, his characters are believable as are the situations that he places them in. Although I initially had a little trouble with the one of the premises, I was quickly reminded of the real life situation with Oliver North.Griffin's description of Montevideo and the areas along the River Plate, to a little town outside of Riegelsville PA, -that have known quite well-, stay in my mind weeks after I have finished the book.If I enjoy the remaining books of his Presidential Agent series as much as I did this one I will give one or two of Griffin's earlier military books another try. ....It was that good."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"These books are so exciting one can't stop reading. They are about what heros really are."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"If you like W.E.B. Griffin you can get through this book without being too upset. If you do not, stay away. For me, I like him and even enjoy his political UNcorrectness. He really pushes it withan outrage of a rendition in his final chapters. For the rest of it, anyone who has been following the series knows about his hero, Carlos/Charles/Karlchen who following presidential direction manages to distress stuffed shirts and starched shirts across four, or is it five, continents. F.B.I., C.I.A.,State Department, Military establishment and members of House and Senate notwithstanding, he'll get the job done. Oh well, it's fun. Sometimes a bit too close to the news, still it can be a bit much and we need to remember it is fiction. Certainly the taste in Scotch raises questions; we all know the brand and I hope WEBG gets a bottle now and then gratis. Really, thats's my big gripe. Too much repetition, rehashing of previous events, repeated brand names, items,even old girlfriends. If you like Griffin then spend your dollars according to taste, this is a known commodity, maybe not the sharpest, but then he does not have the fiat accompli of WWII and Korea that he had in his Corps series."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Twenty years ago or so I picked up my first W.E.B. Griffin novel & I was hooked. Loved most of the Brotherhood Of War series & The Corps series became a favorite that I have reread many times. The Honor Bound series is another good historical novel collection though a little weak compaired to Griffins other work.Griffins latest work is lacking whatever spark he had in his previous series. The Presidental Agent series just doesn't have what it takes to keep me reading late into the night. The latest release, The Hunters, can be summed up as booring in the extreme. The plot drags as the characters repeat themselves over & over throughout the novel. Griffin must be getting paid by the word.I believe that I will pay closer attention to other reviews in the future & stop purchasing hardback editions. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I like W.E.B. Griffin's books--usually. But he seems to have developed some really annoying habits that his editor should have addressed--and which could have greatly reduced the sheer bulk of the books in this series. For example, why all the repetitive retellings reiterating and rehashing (okay, you get it) what has happened?! Get the story out once, then move on. Save a few trees.Also, what is particularly irksome is Mr. Griffin's fixation with certain things that are so incongruous with reality as to make parts of the story seem just, well, silly. Two examples: Madsen submachine guns?! What? Madsen's are collector's items and--for their time--were excellent weapons. But no modern-day operator would carry a Madsen; modern weaponology has far surpassed the Madsen in quality and effectiveness. Yet they keep appearing all over the place in the hands not only of the \\"bad guys\\" but even the Secret Service. That is simply unrealistic and silly--I though Griffin was supposed to be a foremost authority on military/special forces practices and equipment. This certainly does not help to burnish that image.Similarly, I am not sure I have ever seen a bottle of \\"Famous Grouse\\" whiskey; but wherever Griffin's characters go, there is sure to be a bottle in the bar and everyone's drinking it. Again, get real. The more realistic image today is of a bottle of Grey Goose in every bar, or at least Jim Beam.If the editors had done their jobs, the books in this series could have been distilled down to two, average-length thrillers, packed with action and suspense. Instead, those two decent novels get lost in the window dressing--some of which is badly in need of an update..."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"This was another great read by Griffin. I hope he plans to continue the series as I am still getting over the end of The Corps. and needed this new thriller.Griffin uses his ability to take people from extraordinary backgrounds and make them seem almost plausible. Carlos/Karl goes from being an orphan to multi-millionaire stud pilot/special operator/ presidential fix it man. Amazing.The ending of this one was kind of open ended and I thought flatter than the other two. In By Order of the President (1st book in the series) the ending was conclusive. Book II, The Hostage, was less so. This was OK as you knew there was a sequel and the purpose of The Hostage was clearly to set the stage for the third and final book, The Hunters. Understanding this, I was a little disappointed at the ending of The Hunters and wished it had been more developed. Over all though, still a great read!"},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"To start, I'm a huge Griffin fan, going back to the Brotherhood of War series. The first time I read the B o W series was in the 80,s and I actually remember thinking when he meantions a young officer named, H Norman Schwartzkopf at the tail end of WWII that he had to have made that guy up - then in 1991 I saw that he hadn't with the advent of Desert Storm. Anyway, this series has all the favorite themes of most Griffin readers. Namely, rich guys who happen to find a home in the armed services and who break the rules from time to time. Especially those rules involving their sexual behavior. Interlace that with men with a very strong sense of self and of justice and it's all quite appealing. Not as strong as either the Brotherhood of War nor The Corps series but worth the time."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Same characters picking up immediately where Book 2 left off.

And all this while operating at a security level that only Griffin could envision.It is all just plain good reading with an authenticity of plot, scenery, persona, weapons and aircraft, and modus operandi that makes it very hard stopping to place your bookmark and putting the book down. Read it -- you'll like it!"},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"WEB Griffin has set a high standard for himself...and his latest fails to reach that standard. He has his heroes jetting around the world and has continued his love affair with high tech special ops weapons but just sort of tosses their usage in randomly. I think he has now succumbed to pressure from his publisher to produce or perish. \\"The Hunters\\" simply doesn't tell a convincing story or have many interesting characters ...not like his previous books in this or his other series. Take a break and come up with some compelling tale! Perhaps he can talk to some of his Army Aviation friends and write about their exploits in Afghanistan or Iraq.

In a nutshell: the main hero of this book constantly travels around the world, meets lots of people, many of whom support him because they are old buddies and while traveling he works on a presidential mission. While it is a nice idea of the author to use foreign language to show off his expertise, a lot of the German language is plainly misplaced. Oops! While this is just a bit annoying there is a lot of repetition - the hero tells the story of his chase to basically everybody he meets - and the characters do not develop into more than superficial want-to-be cool action heros.

If not, it is at least not that voluminous..."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I have read every one of Griffin's books. This one is a yawner. There is almost no action or suspense in all of the 815 pages. Also, Griffin has developed and refined his irritating writing habit of constantly giving the character's title whenever he comes back into the story. The mouth twisting name of the newspaper, the Gossinger Beteiligungsgesellschaft, G.m.b.H wasn't really necessary and a shorter name could have been chosen. I turned page after page awaiting some action to happen. All I found was more dialogue rehashing the previous events, frequent long airplane flights to gather information when perhaps a phone call might have done the job, and everything minutely detailed except for sleep and bowel movements. The cast of characters is also confusing at times. Who works for whom and what are all these people on his \\"Presidential Finding\\" team doing? He now has an elaborate office in Washington a secretary, and people sitting around doing nothing. The cast of characters grows page by page. Griffin must be paid for the number of words written, regardless of whether they add anything to the story. At the end of the story I still didn't know who did in the Lorimer character for sure or who the mysterious villians were who attacked the Estancia. I only finished this book because I'm a Griffin fan. I fervently hope his next book in this series, The Shooters, has some action and suspense and not spend half the book rehashing what happened in the first two of this series.

It's just a globe-trotting, mish-mash of schemes, murders, and political figures.

Terrible in all regards."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"The main character Carlos Castillo is an egotistical, arrogant jerk. His cohorts are portrayed as little more than sychophantic lapdogs. And somewhere in the book is hidden a plot. But it takes hours and hundreds of pages to figure out it's a plot not worth reading. Unbelievably bad writing. How does this author get away with writing such drivel?"},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I was astonished by the number of mistakes in this book (hardcover version). It was either not edited or edited very poorly.Some other things continue to bother me about this series: the hero seems to divulge top secret information to almost anyone, civilians, foreign nationals, anyone except the ambassador in Uruguay. The details he discloses often go way beyond what was necessary. While US citizens may be bound by secrecy are we to believe that foreign nationals would be bothered about threats of being charged with a felony for disclosure. Good luck with the extradition.The hero also likes to drink. In fact most of the characters do. So do I, but I am not on a top secret presidential mission.The author has all but accused a real life foreign president of being involved in oil-for-food. I guess he is not planning on visiting Russia any time soon.One of the things that remains unresolved is the stuff in the syringes. At one point we learn that the stuff injected into mrs mastersons buttock would only have numbed her buttock. So the toxicology from her blood cannot explain her state when she was found in the previous book. Is this something that will be followed up in a subsequent book.Having said all that one of the redeeming features of this series is that it doesn't assume that every other foreign intelligence and police service are idiots. In fact they often seem to be more on the ball than the US equivalent services."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Having read Griffin's other books featuring Castillo I was eager to read this one.

Griffin is a wonderful storyteller who captivates your imagination with the story plot. As with his previous series a few years back on the Marines and Police, he continues to maintain a line in the novels for the characters that is interesting. It makes you feel when reading that you know the character."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"All I can say is that I was hoping that WEB Griffin was going to turn this whole thing around. But I can safely say that he's going to need another maybe 5 books on top this one, before his writing of THIS series gets any better. A slight improvement over the last two books, but still pretty much the same quality. Purchase these books with great caution, if you are a military buff.Just as WEB has done in the previous books of the \\"Presidential Agent\\" series, he takes us on a whirlwind tour of both North & South America, Europe, and then back again. I will not discount nor discredit his knowledge of terrain and tid-bits of local culture. But I seriously wonder why he is writing a story with so much emphasis on current events when the technology doesn't match the story's setting in time, all of which is supposed to take place in 2005. It seems as though everything that Griffin's character, Lt. Col. CG Castillo, deals with and touches seems to be more appropriately placed in one of Robert Ludlum's first novels.I can say this, because Castillo is still getting shot at with Madsen M50s- I mean this is going on ALL over the world, from Hungry to South America. Heck even US Secret Service agents are packing this relic in the previous book. Seriously, the Madsen is a relic, and Griffin should have just written that Castillo was getting shot at with flintlocks and/or muskets. I would think that in Europe and in most South American countries, an AK-47 would be the weapon of choice. But we will toss that aside for now, and say that it is a \\"nit-picking\\" point. As the story progresses Castillo arms himself, as the author tries to describe a weapons locker in a US embassy, with an array of weapons that somehow I feel would have been handed off to Lee Marvin and Chuck Norris in the movie \\"Delta Force\\" - a MICRO UZI and a suppressed Ruger. I can't think of any US personnel that still utilize these guns, let alone have them in an embassy weapons hold. I think that our overseas have been upgraded to HK MP5Ks and Sig Sauer's with suppressors to boot. However, Griffin makes a point to get modern when he makes mention of a SIG arms handgun in the very beginning of the book, but then it's back to the post-Vietnam era of weapons and gadgets for the rest. This part of WEB Griffin's writing has really upset me and makes me wonder just how much effort he puts into researching, structuring, and then writing his stories. He claims to be a life member of the U.S. Special Operations Association. Surely he would have had someone from that organization give him pointers, right?Unfortunately, I am going to be highly critical of his writing when it comes to the military genre of this series of books. And in my opinion Griffin writes up another 500+ pages of travel literature with some \\"pops\\" and \\"bangs\\" served up on a Cold War platter.There is a certain amount of change in technology when it comes up in any form of literature. Knowledgeable readers can feel this if they were to pick up a book written by Ludlum or Ian Flemming. Respectively, these authors were writing in their own time, and their understanding of technology was researched to be \\"cutting-edge\\". WEB Griffin is writing in the now, and his description of landscapes, historical sites, and historical data is right on. But he fails miserably to deliver, with respect to the reader that his characters are living in 2005.Additionally, his writing is convoluted at times, just as it was with the past two novels. His character development has potential, but for some odd reason Griffin makes everything seem so repetitive. As his characters develop in the story, you can't help but feel like most of them are one big character going through an out of body experience. For example, how many people do you know use the phrase \\"Jesus H. Christ\\". Almost everyone in this series does it, when they are surprised. As characters in this whole story casually mention something, it will be repeated by another character just a few pages over - all too coincidentally - in a similar circumstance. Griffin references and then re-references things - a 727 gone missing and found, a Gulfstream III, Madsen M50 machine guns, bottles of Grouse wine, and my personal favorite - everything seems to be \\"TOP SECRET PRESIDENTIAL\\". Just imagine sitting with a book and seeing the phrase \\"Top Secret Presidential\\" pop up in dialogue over and over and over again. (On a side note, I got a friend of mine to read the book, he started a drinking game based on that phrase.)Ok, so you ask, \\"If you hated his writing, why did you pick up the book?\\" I don't hate Griffins writing of World War II. And I honestly thought that this book was going to be the ONE that made me change my mind about picking up another WEB Griffin novel. Unfortunately, it is the LAST book of his that I buy, without first consulting with the local library.In conclusion, all it has done is made me pity the fact that Mr. Griffin's, Lt. Col. CG Castillo will be fighting the war on terrorism, as the personal Agent of the President with long winded tales of convoluted travel and dialogue; armed with the finest arsenal that the 1970's and 1980's saw in most third world nations - might as well have been a rubber chicken."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Griffin continues to present a detailed narrative in a a very interesting way. I look forward to his next novel."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Another novel in the series from the master story teller of military and special operations branches. A must have for the fans of Griffin, Clancey, Higgins and Walter j. Boyne."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"WEB Griffin is one of the most prolific and fun authors arounds. I have faithfully read his work, many of them several times, since the Lieutenants issue so many decades back. Most recently, I read his Corps series for the fourth time, anticipating holiday release. His prior co authored book, I did not even purchase -- and, for a number of reasons, one wonders if Griffin has simply checked out afer so many wonderful books.The book opens well, as all of Griffin's books do, with a taut ten pages or so that evoke a number of favorable memories. It then falls off the proverbial cliff, wandering for another hundred and ten pages or so before accomplishing anything of worth insofar as story line is concerned. (It does introduce a couple of notions I discuss below that I found quite offensive.)My copy of the book is 515 pages long. You can pretty much read the first ten and last ten pages -- and get it all. The middle is pretty much absorbed with the forgery of some documents to get 19 million in funds, about 10 million of which are used to buy a Gulfstream III. Communicating these two points took Griffin about as I long as I did just now. Literally dozens of pages are then expended -- as character after character learns these facts, discusses them, tell each other about them, decide that 19 million is a lot of money -- strangely -- because in Griffin's world 19 mm is a drop in the bucket. And if it is a lot of money, why on earth use most of it to buy a Gulfstream III? The only other topic in the middle two hundred pages or so of the book that consumes any more time is the relentless drumbeat of the fact that Castillo has a Presidential Finding, and you can or can't know about it and what it means depending upon whether you're a good guy or a bad guy, yada yada. It's sort of the equivalent of receiving or administering a beating in a Mickey Spillane novel. Agreed -- this is nothing new for a Griffin book, but in this one, it just seems go on more endlessly than in those that have come before with less substance.Griffin writes with a unique, idiosyncratic voice, striking a sweet note with his army memos and orders, describing the Army and Marine Corps culture of the WWII and Korean Era with occasional diversions to special ops in a joyous way. His sub plots bob and weave, and occasionally just end -- which was somewhat jarring in the early years until I got used to hit. His characters tended to be over the top, but inveiged with a strong sense of vulnerability to match their duty. His books read best as fine historical fiction illuminating the details of action and events against the back drops of the larger theatres of war -- expanding what might have been a line or two in an after action report or newspapaer article. Many traits of Griffin are a tolerable conceit (Drophead jags, Famous Grouse, fried egg sandwiches) which worsened considerably after the invention of the word processor. Others are more disturbing, such as his admiration of the cultures around totatalitariarn governments, particularly Argentina -- but until now these flaws have been somewhat tangential to his interesting stories.The Hunters is a \\"Presidential Agent\\" novel (the third). This is a weaker series that did not play to Griffin's strengths. His hero, Charley Castillo, is a pastiche of many heros who have gone before and is heir to several fortunes (Matt Payne, special operative). His best friend is a notorious and repulsive Russian gangster who helps him out of jams, known for the \\"beauty marks\\" all of which is delivered in a playful and tolerant style by Griffin that I found very difficult to handle against the current day backdrop of Polonium murders in the middle of london.Even this paled against the more serious problem for me of Griffin's \\"humorous\\" asides regarding \\"AAL's\\" or \\"African American lunatics\\" a concept he introduces along with the \\"wink wink nudge nudge\\" comment that this is \\"politically incorrect\\" The AAL's are apparently planning to blow up something with a suitcase bomb snaked from the Russians.You know what, this may be the kind of thing that passes for humor among veterans of the special forces and the retired police chiefs of south jersey do their one handed push ups over shot glasses full of Famouns Grouse, but I bet it isn't. Griffin is usually quite good about being color blind, and not being able to judge books by their covers. This is clearly a lapse, not a pattern, but it is one that I hope his other fans take offense at as well and ask him to correct.There are also a number of comparisons made to Castillo and Oliver North (right behind the number of references made to a Masden, but ahead of Famous Grouse, polo and AAL's). Griffin has made Castillo into such a narcissistic paragon over the past few books, that my one hope (and the only reason I read to the end of the book) that Griffin intends this to be a retelling of the parable of Oliver North, and the bad decisions he made to the detriment of the entire country by operating without meaningful oversight --But the Griffin fan can skip this one in the meantime and send a message that we expect some value for services -- without not funny racial references -- for my part, I think his best work was in the Corps series, although many of these newer weaknesses were manifest then. I, for one, would like to see that story finished boldly and strongly -- Griffin is clearly a craftsman who takes pride in his work, and maybe he can find the energy after a prolific and sastisfying career to put in a strong finish."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I read \\"The Hostage\\" first and thoroughly enjoyed it. From that positive experience, I decided that I should check out W.E.B. Griffin's books further. I just finished \\"The Hunters\\" and it was pretty boring and long winded.

It was my first book from Griffin and my last."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"In many ways WEB Griffin recycles types he has used before in the Brotherhood of War series. Charley Castillo seems to be a 21st century version of Craig Lowell-rich, good looking, irresistable to women, able to leap tall buildings at a single bound, produce his own airplane when he needs it. Yet, he is place into an interesting narrative involving the UN Oil for Food program/scandal,Russian expatriates/criminals and carte blanche authority from the President. It seems part of the struggle for this character (and perhaps where the next installment will lead) about whether he is becoming Ollie North II.The novel is full of action and bureaucratic infighting. It moves briskly and is well written. Like all of Griffin's work each book builds on another, and those who follow the series may find some of the catch up narrative tedious. Those who complete the book/series will find it to be a satisfying experience.

The only problem with this new WEB Griffin book is that I could not put in down. AT 2:30AM, I finally had to stop for sleep, even though I was only a little more than half done. Mr. Griffin's new book is full speed ahead, from beginning to end, continuing where The Hostage finished, but it seems to move at an even faster pace, which I enjoy.Carlos Castillo continues to build his team with the best people he can find, from the various intelligence agencies, as well as the military. I love this aspect of his books, because it is so much like true life, where people progress in their careers, or die, and new people join the team.The hunt for the bad guys crosses many international boundaries, proving that today's intelligence operatives need to be multi-lingual and very intelligent. An agent who only speaks English is no longer an effective agent against international terrorists. Hungarian, Russian, German, Spanish and English were the languages of choice for most of this operation. You have to read to the end, to find out who all the good guys and bad guys really are. Carlos Castillo and his growing band of experts move from country to country, progressing through firefights that reveal bad guys at the highest levels.As with any Griffin book, the winners are the people who have both the intellignece to analyze complex data, and the strength of character to act on it. In addition to people with military and intelligence skills , Castillo's team now has: a financial analyst (with the financial and computer expertise to track billions of dollars through the labyrinth of secret international bank accounts); a newspaperman (with the instincts and contacts to uncover bad guys at the highest levels); and Max (who can actually smell bad guys).For me, this book was as exciting and fast moving as Mr. Griffin's books on WWII, Korea and Vietnam, with so much action that you feel like you are in the middle of a declared war.This new series continues to highlight Griffin's contacts with, and knowledge of, the modern military and intelligence communities. Although he points out some infighting between government agencies, he also points out that there are good people in every agency, and if they work together, they can stop the bad guys. The book deals with heroes from Homeland Security, the Diplomatic Corps, the FBI, the CIA, Special Forces, and other US military units, as well as like-minded patriots in Argentina, Germany and Uruguay.WEB Griffin is truly the dean of American military story tellers, and this book reveals his understanding of the complex relationship that exists between varous intelligence organizations, as well as the military."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"W.E.B. Griffin released a book last year called \\"The Saboteurs,\\" which was co-authored with his son. It was horrible. Having read and enjoyed all of Griffin's other books, except for his police series, it was a major disappointment and the first time I had ever given a negative review of a Griffin book.Happily, Griffin's name alone appears on \\"The Hunters\\" and the story has many Griffin trademarks.Charley Castillo is made chief of the Office of Organizational Analysis, which is created by a Presidential Finding; a secret order from the President. With a few handpicked colleagues - and quite a collection they are - Castillo tries to solve the murder of an American consular official, the attempted murder of an old family friend, a newspaper publisher in Europe and unravel the secrets of the Oil-for-Food scandal.This is classic Griffin. Characters whizzing in and out. There's Aleksandr Pevsner, a shadowy Russian ex-patriate. A bunch of folks from the FBI, Secret Service, NSA, Special Forces, Delta Team play out their roles, as well as Castillo's grandmother and cousin.The action flies fast and furious on every page as Castillo makes up his own rules, ignores the law, does battle with the National Director of Intelligence. On his side, of course, he has the President.I'm not about to spoil the pleasure of a Griffin novel by discussing the plot line. Aone of the pleasures of reading Griffin is that every page delivers a new twist - and I am not about to ruin anything.Griffin does tend to talk too much in this novel; many points are repeated over and over without purpose. A small criticism. Maybe they changed editors on him or something.In any event, if you like Griffin, then you want to read \\"The Hunters\\". Be prepared to set an evening or two aside because once you start, you aren't going to want to put it down until you are finished.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I just completed W.E.B. Griffin's latest book in his Presidential Agent series and man it is long! The Hunters begins where the last book, The Hostage ended. Charley and company are tracking down the baddies involved in the Iraqi oil-for-food scandal. An interesting idea that does not realize its full potential. The characters of Charley Castillo, Col Jake Torine, and others are well drawn. But the various meetings and travel detail were at the expense of far less action scenes than there could have been. If there had been more action, it would have been a better book.I enjoyed the first Presidential Agent book, By Order of the President. I have become a fan of Griffin's excellent Badge of Honor series in the past few years as well. However, the only reason I finished The Hunters was my own stubborness. I will think twice before spending (wasting?) the time to read the next adventure of Charley and company."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"With more than 35 novels published, W. E. B. Griffin presents THE HUNTERS, the third installment in his Presidential Agent series. Griffin's protagonist is Charley Castillo --- tough, skilled in Special Operations methods and answerable only to the President of the United States. The story takes place in the summer of 2005, in locations from Europe to South America and the United States.Post-9/11, the Office of Homeland Security is in place. The Director of National Intelligence, Ambassador Charles W. Montvale, resents Castillo's presidential appointment as Chief Officer of Organizational Analysis. Montvale would rather supervise Castillo but accepts the President's wishes for the time being. Amidst subtle reminders that Montvale requires constant updates on his progress, Castillo steams ahead with his task.The action begins at Estancia Shangri-La in the Republic of Uruguay. Castillo and his small band arrive at the sprawling \\"big house\\" in time to find target Jean-Paul Bertrand, holder of a Lebanese passport. Bertrand's real identification is that of Jean-Paul Lorimer, who is suspected of heavy involvement in the oil-for-food scandal. Bertrand's sister had been kidnapped and drugged, and her husband was murdered before her eyes in order to drive home the serious intent of her tormenters. Castillo's mission is to determine the true identity of Bertrand and bring him back to the United States. By the time Castillo's group enters the man's office, they are under fire from unknown assailants. Bertrand has been murdered, and their Special Ops training kicks into place. Castillo's men return fire with deadly accuracy, killing all six unknown, dark-clothed, masked assassins.Before exiting, one of their own is dead, garroted by an unidentified individual. The garrote is much like the ones used by the Stasi or KGB agents in Cold War times. Castillo finds and takes into possession a sheaf of colored bank-type notes, proof that Bertrand accepted bribe money for his part in the scandal. Sixteen million dollars, when signed by the bearer, can be deposited into an off-shore bank account. Bertrand is dead and has not been identified as Lorimer. With the President's approval, Castillo establishes a bank account for his Office of Operational Analysis; Castillo's web expenditure is the purchase of an airplane.Meanwhile, Castillo's extensive international family becomes involved in the operation. His mother was German, which gives him exclusive German citizenship and a passport stamped as \\"Herr Gossinger.\\" He is heir to Tages Zeitung, the largest German daily newspaper, and is its Washington correspondent. Eighty-two-year-old Hungarian Eric Kocian --- Castillo's adopted uncle and editor-in-chief of the paper --- is deep into the investigation of the oil-for-food scandal and targeted by unknown assailants in Budapest.Castillo's American connection is by way of his father, a Huey pilot who had not yet married his mother. Upon her death, his dad's family, complete with an American passport, brought the boy to live in Texas.Griffin writes with gusto and rich characters, brimming near-calamities at the precipice with drama. Action moves from one locale to another with breakneck speed. When Castillo needs information, he jets to the source with little time lost. His military rank is elevated to that of Major, a fact few in contact with him learn before recognition can be acknowledged. He isn't concerned with the frills of rank or the petty interferences of Ambassador Montvale.Sheer numbers of military personnel, civil servants in numerous South American countries, diplomats, journalists and ambassadorial types make for a voluminous cast of characters. Each desires a \\"need to know\\" relationship with Castillo. However, repetition does not delay the action forward in THE HUNTERS.When the pieces of the puzzle begin to settle into a playable picture, Castillo uses all of the resources at his command to bring the solution to fruition. At the heart of blackmail, money-laundering and espionage, he sets the finished product before the President. Surprises abound when treacherous identities are revealed. We'll anticipate the next book in this series; THE HUNTERS cannot be finished with the job.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I have to say at the outset that I've been a Griffin fan for a number of years and I've read all of the other books of his various series. But I have to be honest and say that this latest fix for my addiction is very unsatisfying.The second book in this series was a welcome change from many other recent Griffin offerings, in that he didn't spend much of the book having characters make or carry out travel arrangements or order drinks and/or dinner. He also didn't use very much of what I have come to think of in his books as \\"novel helper.\\" Novel Helper is a narrative device that Griffin master in the past to fill out one novel's worth of plot into two or three books. It works like this, have something notable happen between two characters early in the book. Then, whenever the two characters meet again in the story, or whenever either meets another character, they relate in inordinate detail the events of the first meeting. He would also have characters spend copious amounts of time trying to figure out how they get from point A to point B. Or they spend page after page deciding what they want for dinner or drinks.As I say, it's unfortunate that Griffin has returned to form with this new Presidential Agent story. It is, literally, more than 450 pages of Charley Castillo making travel arrangements for his merry band, giving orders relating to travel arrangements, or figuring out what everyone wants to eat. There is only maybe 65 or 75 pages where the things actually happen and the story moves forward.Please, Mr. Butterworth, let's make the next one interesting again."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Just as Nora Roberts is the Queen of Chick-Lit, W E B Griffin is the acknowledged King of Stud-Lit. But more and more, his style is turning into the chick-lit formula with a major exception - there is no sex!The Hunters, his third book in the Presidential Agent series, has a story hidden somewhere but for the most part, all they do is talk-talk-talk. And now, he is leaning more heavily on the Inner Voice, where we are privy to the character's every thought. Somewhere in the Writer's Manual, there appears a line, \\"Show, don't tell.\\" Modern-day Griffin involves precious little showing but a heckuva lot of telling and thinking. Inner voice is like curry powder - used sparingly, it highlights and enhances. Too much just leaves the reader needing mental Rolaids.But...hidden amongst all the yammering are his great characters, interesting and well-developed - always Griffin's forte. But the action palls. Remember the great stories in the \\"Brotherhood of War\\" and \\"The Corps\\" series? Somehow, he's lost his knack of putting together a good action yarn ... but I still read every page hunting for it.Here's the story in The Hunters: Charley Castillo (another rich guy, of course) working as a special agent for the president, runs around Argentina, Uruguay, Hungary, Germany, and Washington D.C.. looking for the killers of an American diplomat in Argentina. (See book two, \\"The Hostage\\") Among his rat pack is a Russian Mafioso, a disgraced Argentine secret service investigator, an Air Force aviator, a crippled Army major and an elderly Hungarian news reporter. The conflict comes when the Director of National Intelligence tries to take over Castillo's band of merry men. There are spear carriers aplenty but none come through as being of interest except for Max the dog, who incidentally is the only one that ever gets laid. And that's not until the last page!I'm a lover of Griffin's books. I've read every book he ever published. But the older he gets, the worse he gets. Nothing was set up to follow The Hunters so hopefully, this is the last book in this series. Maybe Griffin will now finish his \\"Honor Bound\\" series, also set in South America and Germany. Its last volume set up a lot of historical action that could follow in another book.I walked away from The Hunters with the feeling that this was nothing more than a first draft that somehow got published. Keep in mind what Ernest Hemingway said of first drafts: \\"All first drafts are s**t.\\""},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"After really enjoying the first two books in this series, The Hunters is a big let down. I stopped reading it half way through because I was tired of both Griffin summarizing the previous 2 books for those readers who hadn't read them, and I was tired of Castillo continuing to fill every new character in on the \\"presidential finding.\\" It is as if Griffin is so proud of his Castillo character and his nifty lifestyle that he has to continue to pound it into the readers skull how special he is. WEB: we don't care, we want some action, and action does not involve reading for the 18th time how Castillo does indeed hold dual citizenship, answers only to the president, and flys around the world in a G3. Good lord there was no reason to turn the pages accept to hope that the author would actually start putting some suspense in the story as opposed to a grocery list of people that Castillo had to fill in on the story. Did I mention the book is repetitively dull?"},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"Normally, I like old W.E.B. ... might even say he is one of my favorite authors. However, this opus has horrid flaws, besides being just boring... He places some scenes in the Hotel Gell&eacute;rt in Hungary - which I have know since my childhood and of course I do speak Hungarian...Now, in Mr. Griffith's earlier novels (yes, I know it is Griffin, but he is a bit too liberal with everyone else's spelling, so let me be liberal, too) I have noticed that he quotes German speakers speaking in \\"German\\" ... but he has minor errors. Does the same in Spanish. His errors are not great - looks like \\"another American trying to speak our language, missing it here and there\\"...His \\"Hungarian\\" is another thing... Imagine a Hungarian author, on Page 1, in a Hungarian novel, quoting two English speakers, one calling the other \\"Kocian Mister\\" (consistently, not just once or twice). Now, if we wanted to imitate someone who does not speak English, fine, but that is not what W.E.B. does... He has no idea of the Hungarian language, but of course, for \\"local flavor\\" he continually quotes \\"Hungarian\\" sentences, which he obviously failed to have checked by anyone who actually speaks Hungarian...The travelogue is not bad, although he often mixes up minor things (in another novel of his talks about \\"North longitude\\", etc.). I wish Griffith Mister had the humility of one of the best known current \\"legal thriller\\" authors, who, at least when he goes outside the legal arena admits he knows nothing of his subject (so he makes a major the Director of CIA, etc...).Mr. Griffith has a standard recipe: \\"Rich American boy from well to do family with a private income is a somewhat unconventional military hero, there are few not-so-rich boys, too; a few rich girls go fall for either kind and have unbridled sexual encounters which is noble, and with the help of our hero we win everything...\\" Not bad, if predictable. (And, when he has real people as his models, like Wendell Fertig, he is very good). The problem is these novels made Mr. Griffith (or shall I call him Griffith Mister?) a bit too self-satisfied. Too many honors, so we are stars, we don't have to check.Well, happened to Tom Clancy sooner, and at least Griffith-mister is writing his own...In summary: it is not worth buying. Perhaps dropping sales will correct the course.... and we can get back the \\"old\\" W.E.B. Griffith..."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"This book, like the last ten or fifteen of his efforts (not counting the dog he wrote with his son last year) is fine for fans of W.E.B. Griffin. I had forgotten details of this first in this series, but it came back fairly quickly, but frankly, there were some characters apparently from the first book that I really never figured out where they fit into this one. That's one complaint, too many fairly interchangeable undeveloped characters.Griffin violates one of the first rules of writing, which is \\"show them, don't tell them\\" which is actually how every one of his books works, but this time it got a little too tiresome. Too many times the same details were told to one of the many characters. This book really could have used a strong editor who could whack about a hundred pages out of it.A couple of other comments: Griffin seems to be currently in love with cell phones as a means to further the plot. At least me realizes they have batteries that run down, but for heavens sake, with all the loose money in this story, didn't anybody ever think to buy a spare battery?I wonder when he will discover ipods?This is probably the first Griffin novel in which the main character does not guzzle Famous Grouse Scotch, although it is referenced a couple times. They all drink beer here, and smoke cigars.The lead also did not \\"make the beast with two backs\\" in this story, another first, although there is reference to two babes he nailed in the previous novel.In previous books set in Argentina, he painted such a lush picture I wanted to book a vacation there. Here it seems like any American town, just without a Wal-Mart.I enjoyed this book, and I have read all of them. It is kind of like the Hardy Boys series for military buffs."},{"Title":"The Hunters (SIGNED)","review":"I liked the first 2 books, but the Hunters drove me NUTS! It was beyond repetitive, the writing was trash, there were so many spelling mistakes that you wonder if it was ever edited! Please do not try to write in a different language without consulting someone that can speak it. The mistakes were unbelievable.Nothing happens until 3/4 of the book - all it is Castillo going from one country to the next telling a history of the last book over and over again to anyone that will listen.

It is a story of tenacity, beauty, perseverance, love, and success in spite of adversity.Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" is a book in the same genre of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and \\"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.\\"Elnora Comstock has Anne's spirit and Rebecca's pluckiness, but she is quite a different character altogether in totally different circumstances. Her story is charming to read and yes, perhaps unrealistic. But that is its secret. This is, after all, a story, and one that was undoubtedly written to inspire young women to achieve their intellectual and moral potential in the years just before the role of women began to change rapidly. Look at this book in its historical context. Read it, and come back to it years later. You will be echanted. You will hear and feel and smell the Limberlost and its secrets."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I have just finished reading the 75 reviews that precede mine and am amazed to hear the excessive praise--almost adulation--for this book. I do understand why rediscovering a book that meant so much to one as a child can be an emotional coming-home experience. That may account for some of the passion undergirding many of the reviews. I am 64, love \\"old-fashioned\\" books, admire greatly the writing of Montgomery (Anne of Green Gables) and Wilder (Little House on the Prairie), and am tired of gratuitous sex and violence in much contemporary fiction. Yet, having said that, I fail to see how Girl of the Limberlost meets the same standard of other period/regional literature about admirable young heroines. It is true that some aspects of characterization were good (especially of the mother, Katherine Comstock) and details of the setting memorable (especially of the description of the Limberlost swamp), but the disjointed plot was a core weakness I couldn't get beyond. Characters fade in and fade out, and scenes switch abruptly with little or no transition. In fact, the book seems to have two distinct \\"halves\\" that are only loosely connected. Rather than \\"sweet,\\" I would describe the book as \\"saccharine\\"; rather than \\"simple,\\" I'd say \\"simplistic.\\"I found the book interesting in the same way that I do old 1930's silent movies. Both have the kind of charm and innocence that allows us to step into another time and place. But just as I smile when I see that an old \\"movie classic\\" has \\"four stars\\"--probably only out of reverence for its age, I can only commend Girl of the Limberlost as a snapshot of a bygone era, and a relatively poor snapshot at that."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I ADORE the book (which gets five stars, in my opinion!), but the editing of the free Kindle edition was absolutely horrible. Someone (likely the \\"volunteer\\") must have simply scanned the book, \\"read\\" it with very poor text recognition software, and then formatted it for Kindle with absolutely no edits. Many of the words are positively unintelligible because of the way the software \\"read\\" them and it seems that entire sections are left out. The paragraph formatting is awful, when present at all, ditto the dialogue quotation marks, even punctuation. And the chapter titles, presumably at the head of each page in the hard copy book, show up in the middle of the text in the Kindle edition.This is one of the most poorly transcribed Kindle editions I've ever seen, and I've seen a great plenty. Thankfully, I already knew the book when I \\"purchased\\" the free Kindle edition, so I got through it, but it would be intensely annoying to anyone who'd never read it before.I hope another volunteer or Amazon fixes the Kindle edition.

However, I became more and more dissatisfied as the story progressed. The pacing was extremely erratic, and some of the important events seemed ill placed. The author often led me to think that certain characters and events were significant when they were not -- so many side plots were opened and never closed.

I read it at least once a year and it is a pure delight every time."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"This novel, published in 1909, stands out from other \\"Victorian\\" novels. It was interesting to see what's changed about public high school since then- tuition, daily Bible readings, and what hasn't- snobby girls and the importance of having the \\"right\\" clothes. There is definitely an element of realism in this novel which makes it timeless. In the details, it indirectly provides an account of how America was changing at the turn of the last century. The heroine and her mother live on the edge of the Limberlost Swamp, earning their livelihood through farming. All around them, their neighbors have sold their land to oil drilling companies; you know that the agricultural lifestyle will disappear in the area, even though we don't see it happen in the novel.There are a few subplots in this novel that don't seem to go anywhere, and it makes me wonder if it was initially printed as a serial. The first is the story of Billy, the neglected boy who becomes orphaned and then adopted. The other is the terrifying brief saga of the man who seems to be stalking Elnora in the swamp. Both of the plots seem to build up, and then not really go anywhere. I'm not sure what purpose they have in the novel.The last part of the novel deals with the love story, which is very sweet and is probably more like a typical novel of the time period. Still, it's an excellent story and does not detract from the rest of the novel.Dover Publications is marketing this as a \\"children's book\\" and although there is nothing offensive in it and it would be fine for children, I thoroughly enjoyed it as an adult. As far as reading level goes, I would say that if your child can read the Anne of Green Gables series, then she can read this."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I received this book originally from my favorite aunt many years ago when I was about 11 or 12 yrs old. I am now in my 50's so I have had it for some time. It had been hers when she was young. I have tried to preserve this particular book from damage through the years but still wanting to reread it and let my daughters read it also, subjected it to some damage that could not be helped. When I found that through Amazon I could get a new copy and in larger print I immediately ordered it. You do not know the joy I felt when it arrived.I love this book I guess more because it is about a girl very similar to myself. One who loves nature and education and had found a way to be able to get the education she wanted through her love of nature and the knowledge she had that not only helped her financially to get that education. But also helped to reunite her with a mother that she had been estranged from for so long. It helped her mother become a better person and take pride in herself and in her daughter's achievements with very little help from others, other than the Lady of the Bird's. (Called the Bird Lady in the book).I am still in awe that all this took place in an area that is very familiar to my family, as at one time more than a hundred years ago now, they owned land around the Limberlost Swamp. That is why this is so dear to my heart.I would reccomend this book to everyone, not just to children or teenagers. It really gives you a different perspective on life and how to deal with adversity and make the best of what you have available to you."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"It's hard not to fall in love with Elnora. Not only is her character development a journey of delight, you are allowed into the lives of the other characters of the book and feel their joys as well as pain. The story line is simple although deeply moving and best of all...REAL.Elnora's bitter mother does worse than MIStreats her, she barely treats her with any reagard AT ALL! Kindly neighbors know the real truth about her father's death and do their best to love this sensitive and bright girl. The mother goes through a life-changing series of events that transform her from a hard, compassionless shell of a woman into a truly repentant softened heart eager to love her estranged daughter. Her change is so heart-wrenching, I usually have a gut-ache by the end of those chapters.If you have a love for nature and boast a colorful imagination, Porter lays before you a smorgasboard of descriptions of Limberlost life in the woods. I have been to Porter's Limbelost cabin in Geneva. It's lovely. And there's actually a mounted specimen of the Yellow Emperor! (Read this book and that last statement will thrill you!)This book can help teach you the meaning of self-respect, determination, perseverance and love. Elnora does not throw herself at her boyfriend, rather allows him to persue and woo her after he discovers his fiancee is a manipulative shallow child he has only worshiped and not loved. The story flows with honor and respect.Please read you will not be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"My Grandfather, Dr. Henry Wingblade, a former college English professor and president of Bethel College in St. Paul, Minnesota, purchased Freckles for me when I was 10 years old and shared that it was his favorite children's book.

Enjoying it immersely, I decided to read more of Gene Stratton-Porter's work, choosing to read A Girl of the Limberlost. The incredible way Gene describes the life of Elnora, the main character, is both delightful and intriguing. Gene has a unique way of allowing the reader to actually live the story as one reads it.

The life she was living amoung the flora and fauna... so refreshing compared to today's stories of violence, sex, and less than noble characters. (I do still love a good thriller!)"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"This book takes you to a different world! It is written so well and the descriptions so vivid that when you look up from reading, you almost forget where you are. I have read Girl of the Limberlost several times; it's like comfort food, it soothes the soul."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"As a woman lepidopterist, can you imagine how many times people have seen me teaching about butterflies and said,&quot;Have you read 'Girl of the Limberlost'?&quot; Thanks to Amazon.com I found the book. The story I find charming though Victorian in the respect of its following a trite pattern of &quot;poor, good girl meets prince and lives happily ever after.&quot; Sweet and charming but perhaps encouraging a less than realistic view of the real world. The writer does know flora and fauna, however: behavior of the moths spoiling themselves when confined; collecting moths at night as they lit on her dress; the mother's fright at finding moths emerging on the kitchen curtain in the night. The first chapters of the book, with the woodlands and swamps described in such a manner draws the reader into those fern-filled leafy bowers--and into the young girl's life, empty and loveless save for the joy of nature. As the story draws to a close in the final chapter, I am left to wonder what kind of life she finds, marrying into a social set so far removed from her own."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I read this book after discussing it with an elderly woman who had read it when she was 12 and still delights in it. I was so taken by this book that I have half a mind to buy a ton of copies and give it to all the women in my life. It is a story of courage and persistence. I read this book in record time, staying up til 4am in order to finish it. Honestly a delightful book!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I wish more of the classics would be available. This was a fun re-read. I really like this author."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I love this book. I had initially read it many years ago and I absolutely loved it. Gene Stratton Porter was a wonderful author who depicts the \\"Limberlost\\" vividly in her books. Also, the way she also very poignantly describes the relationship struggles and joys between mother and daughter brings you to tears and full laughter in places. This is just a terrific and wholesome book. I give it a big thumbs up and I believe that everyone should read it at least once."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I am disappointed that this was rated a children's book. This is a book for ALL ages! While my grandmother read it to me, and I have read it to both my daughter, and granddaughter, my mother and grandmother both read it themselves as adults, and I have read and re-read this book many, many times since childhood. It is sad that whenever a story is clean, heartwarming, and has familly values, that it is deemed to be just for children.The story is a wonderful and timeless story. Elnora is like an old friend that I love to visit every few years. My mother has worn her copy out and at the age of 80 has requested this book for her 81st birthday, along with a few other Ms. Stratton has written. This book is a timeless story, and was made into a movie (by the same name) a long time ago, however the movie does not cover the entire book.These books by Ms. Porter sell for over $40 for the original copy in the antique stores! If you want a great read, and a story that you will want to read over and over, buy this book, and any other Ms. Porter has written! I also love Her Father's Daughter, Laddie, Freckles, etc. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"When I was a child an old copy of A Girl of the Limberlost landed in our house; I think neighbors were housecleaning and got rid of some books. We lived in a fairly rural area and when my mother read that book to me (one chapter every night) I identified with it SO much. It still means a great deal to me.By the way, DO read Freckles too. Probably it was intended to be read first, but if you read it after it works well as a \\"prequel\\" to A Girl of the Limberlost..."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Elnora Comstock, the plucky, resourceful heroine of this classic novel, first published in 1909, is a character who is still relevant and fascinating for today's readers. \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" was one of my favorite books as a girl, and it was one of my mother's and my grandmother's favorites. Like other timeless literary heroines who overcome great odds to achieve happiness (such as Anne of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and Jo of \\"Little Women\\"), Elnora is eternally fiesty, admirable and loveable.When the novel opens, Elnora is determined to attend the high school in a nearby township. Her neglectful, sometimes abusive mother, Katharine, is equally determined to discourage her and ruin her dreams. Elnora and Katharine live in a cabin on the edge of the great Limberlost swamp, a place of wonder and danger, located three miles from the township where Elnora wants to go to school. The hard, cold Katharine is haunted by the death of her husband on the very day Elnora was born. She blames her only child for the death of her beloved husband because her birth kept Katharine from having the strength to aid her husband when he was drowning in the swamp.On the first day of high school, Elnora's tacky clothes and inability to fit in with the snooty mean girls, along with the fact that she learns she will needs an unexpected amount of money for books and tuition leads her to brief despair. But her own ingenuity, along with the help of a loving neighbor couple, Margaret and Wesley Sinton, solve some of Elnora's problems.I love the many intricate details in this book about Elnora's life in a rural early twentieth century world. For instance, the Sintons purchase clothing and accessories so that Elnora can fit in with her classmates. One article is a wonderful leather lunchbox which contains lidded dishes to hold small sandwiches, salad, condiments, dessert, milk, utensils and a cloth napkin. The descriptions of the different foods which are used to fill this lunchbox, and how Elnora's lunches eventually play a part in her meeting some destitute children whom she ultimately aides, are just fascinating.Elnora is able to earn her way through school by her mastery of the natural world around her. She collects moths, butterflies, old Indian relics, bird's nests, specimens of tree leaves, flowers and grasses, and then either sells them or uses them to teach classes in natural history to grade school children. Her forays into the Limberlost, and what she finds there are described in loving detail.The characters in the book are also memorable. How Katharine Comstock comes to change her outlook on life, and learn some hard lessons about the importance of motherhood and the real character of her dead husband is told with great depth of feeling. But this is not a cloying or overly sentimental book. These characters are very real and hold up very well to a twenty-first century reader's more sophisticated tastes.Even the romance at the end of the novel, between Elnora and a handsome lawyer from Chicago, who are brought together by their love of the outdoors, is believable by today's standards. A deliciously malevolent and spoiled ex-fiancee who seeks to ruin Elnora's chance at true love is introduced, but all ends happily for everyone.I recommend this novel highly. Gene Stratton-Porter was an important, prolific writer, and if you like this book, you should seek some other titles, especially \\"Freckles\\". \\"Freckles\\" is the prequel to \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" and is also a wonderful story about a young man overcoming adversity and finding love.This review is for the Library of Indiana Classics paperback edition of the novel. This edition contains the complete text, but does not contain any essays or criticism. The Library of Indiana Classics also issues a hardback edition of the novel. You can also get the complete text of the novel at no cost for your Kindle, as the text for the novel has entered public domain. The same is true for \\"Freckles.\\""},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I received this book for Christmas in 1962. My mother had read it as girl.

It was too long, too natural-sy looking and seemed too boring for me to read for a long time. When I did read it, it became part of me but I could never guess at how important it would become to me until some twenty years later.A couple of years ago I decided to write an honours thesis in my chosen area of English Literature. And what was the most valuable book I'd ever read and that was more worthy of academic study than any other? A Girl of the Limberlost. It is the flagship book for my studies in American nature writing. Although I'm currently journeying through all the big guns - Thoreau. Whitman, Abbey etc., none as yet hold a candle to the Limberlost, an intriguing mix of swampland and some of the tallest timber in the United States. Admittedly, the plot is trite, the ending disappointing, the characters slightly unbelievable, but there is something that lifts this book above its own flaws and I really think that's the nature writing sequences. And the way people are incorporated into that nature.It's also the deeply rooted sense of Americana in the story. From the descriptions of food and clothes to the long, unsealed roads, I think this book is the best introduction for young female readers into American ethics, style and enterprise in the early twentieth-century. It certainly gave me, an Australian, a taste of Americana which has proved more useful and comforting than I could have ever imagined. I recommend it without reserve for any reader, but particularly young girls. I just wish I could remember who gave it to me. I'd love to say thanks."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"For anyone who thought they weren't perfect and worried how they looked, where they came from or how they appeared to others, this book will warm your soul and show that all can triumph as long as you persevere.

I can't believe I found this book still available in print on Amazon. This was one of my mother's favorite books as a child. She gave it to me to read when I was a girl. I read it several times and was fascinated with the strange but beautiful evolution of the relationship between the mother and daughter in the story. I will also never forget the parts about how the girl collected bugs against a white sheet at night or how her mother went to the hair salon and had them style her hair several times so she could learn how to do it herself. I cannot wait to get my copy and read it again. I never thought I would find it. But if this story stayed with me all these years and with my mother before me, it must have an extraordinary magic that transcends space and time.

I believe it was also made into a family movie which I am going to find and buy!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Elnora, the title character of A Girl of the Limberlost has captured my heart and will be one of my favorite heroines. The book reflects so many wonderful values that are as true today as when they were written. I have often found in historical fiction that the qualities for which women are praised are subservience and obedience. Elnora is a kind, gving and humble girl - but she wins her respect from herself and others by excelling in every way possible. She craves education - and is first in her class in many subjects. She loves nature and persues samples of it in the swamp where she lives with the heart of a true tomboy. When she encounters obstacles, she thinks for herself and works to achieve what she wants - going into business for herself in a number of different ways. She master's the violin and composes her own pieces. She is also quite capable of behaving in society, wearing fashionable cloths and making friends with city girls. At the turn of the century she has already appreciated the threat to nature that mankind's rapid progress makes and lives a green lifestyle. She is a heroine that any modern girl could look up to.Many other characters of the book are well fleshed out and well written. Her mother overcomes great grief to rejoin life. A young semi-starved orphan Billy finds a loving home and begins to learn responsibility. A rich society man learns the values that are important in life and in a wife.I can't recommend the book enough. It's wonderful and an excellent read for both adults and young women."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"My daughter had to read books by Gene Stratton-Porter for a school project. This was a sweet story - not so simple that it was boring, but not too involved so she couldn't finish it easily. She enjoyed it thoroughly; the book describes many aspects of nature in the Limberlost swamp area of IN."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Certainly a period piece, yet there is a reason that A Girl of the Limberlost has been made into a movie more than once, with varying success. The story is a straightforward and wonderfully American one, of a young lady gentle, intelligent and lovely, who succeeds in work, life and love despite difficult circumstances.I have this copy, a hard cover with a flower design imprinted on the cover and several lovely period illustrations within. You may have seen this copy at a grandparent's house or a used book store. It is also still in print in modern paperback editions. I think that it is pleasant to read the old story from an older book with sympathetic illustrations.The Limberlost is a swamp, a real swamp in Indiana. You can Google it and find out where it is and how it got its name. The girl of the story is Elnora Comstock, who lives with her cranky, widowed mother near the edge of the swamp. Elnora is bright, and undeterred by her mother's scorn of her desire to further her education -- but they have no money (supposedly) to pay for the clothes and books and other expenses, and the high school is miles away. Elnora raises and captures moths, which fly at night, to sell to collectors, in order to meet her fees. She finds and sells many natural objects, such as moss and bird's nests. This was at the turn of the (20th) century, remember, when people did collect such things, and when they were used for instruction and the illustration of books. Perhaps you have been to an old museum or study, or even a relative's house that still reflects Victorian and Edwardian culture, and you can see how there would have to have been these woodsy entrepreneurs.I don't want to give away too much of the story itself, but more the style and sense of it, to help a person decide about reading it. There is constant description of Elnora's grace, beauty, gentleness, etc., and it can get a little thick, but it is in keeping with the genre of the time. Her mother is a real piece of work, but she has her story and her tragedy also, and she grows in the tale. There are neighbors, Margaret and Wesley Sinton, who are like a second family to Elnora, and a young rascal named Billy, and the handsome young man from town, Philip Ammon, and his shallow fiancee Edith, and the stalwart Henderson, and many others. With the beauty of the Limberlost, described in brilliant colors as by one who knows and loves nature, and the incredible variety of the moths (ditto), this story is a romance of civilized persons at the frontier. From time to time the writer veers off into bursts of purple prose about the hand of the Almighty in nature, but at other times her steady insistence of the triumph of gentleness and good influences over contrariness and shallowness seem truly classic.It is, as I said, a period piece, no doubt about it. But it is a good period piece, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"The book is a wonderful classic book but the reprinting of it was not too great.

This book paints pictures like John Steinbeck's descriptions without the wordiness. Up until about two years ago, when my copy, I'd read a total of 30 times. That's something I normally don't do.

Refreshing!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"A Girl of The Limberlost is about a girl who at the beginning of the book is about 16 and at the end of the book is a woman around 20. It starts out in the Limberlost with this girl, Elnora who lives with her Mom, Her Father was killed by a drowning in the swamp near their house. A few houses down live a man and wife named Wesley and Margaret Sinton. They had two little girls who both got sick and passed away. They end up adopting a little boy named Billy. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sinton were always like family to Elnora.Elnora decided that she wanted to go to high school. She had always been a curious little girl, and now she wanted to go to the city and go to high school. Her mother, who never had liked her very much and blamed her for her Father's death, said she did not care if she went to high school but not to ask for any financial help from her. So Elnora went off to school. The first day she was made fun of terribly and she was not sure that she wanted to return. She talked to Mr. Sinton and he told her to tell her Mom about everything. So she went home to tell her. That day Elnora had found out that she had to pay a $20.00 fee because she was a city girl. She also had to pay for her own books, which she did not know about. Well Elnora was a very poor girl and would not accept anything as a gift from anybody. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sinton went to town and asked some girls Elnora's age how they did their hair and who made their clothes and what kind of lunch box should Elnora have. They got her all of these things plus and umbrella, boots, new shoes, and a coat. They went to take it to Elnora and when they got there they had a wonderful surprise. Elnora had gone to town to figure out a way for her to pay for her school. She went to the bird woman because all Elnora's life she had collected moths and other insects. The bird woman said she would pay her for everything she could collect for her. Well, Elnora's second day of school was a little better. She got to wear her hair like all the other girls, and had on a nice dress just like all the other girls. Also, nobody pointed her out because she was different. They all liked her and she began to make a lot of friends. Also, she was able to pay her tuition and one of the teachers called up a sophmore and asked her to bring in her used books so that Elnora could have them to study with. So things started to look up for Elnora. The only thing was that her Mom did not know how great of a person Elnora was turning out to be or how hard she was working and how much she needed her Mothers love. For four years Elnora had kept this life pretty much a secret. She had learned to play the violin, she had taught other students about science, and she had earned all the money to pay for whatever she wanted. When she graduated Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sinton who had been there all along to support her, made her Mother go to town to see her daughter graduate. When Elnora played the violin her Mother was so proud and realized how wrong she had been in treating her daughter. She then began to love and do things with Elnora and they lived on as friends instead of strangers.Elnora had met a man named, Ammon. He at once fell in love with Elnora, but it took Elnora awhile to come around to liking him. He was engaged to a girl named Edith, who was very self-centered and did not care about anyone but herself. They were definitely a wrong fit. Elnora told Ammon that she could not be with him until she was positive that he was not in love with Edith. So, he went back to Illinois and Elnora went to a secret place where nobody would know where she was. Ammon soon realized that there was no future for him and Edith, and got very sick because he could not find Elnora and did not know what to do. His best friend, Phillip found Elnora in a country side house not far from where Ammon was. When Ammon found Elnora she decided to marry him. First their was a surprise visit from Edith. She swore on her life that she could get Ammon back and that he was hers, but it did not work. Ammon proved to Elnora that she was the one and they were going to get married."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Taking when the book was written into consideration, I suppose this was at one time \\"good reading\\". However, I found a lot of the narrative to be loquacious while being completely void of dialogue that actually flowed. I thought a lot of the conversation was very choppy, and I can't imagine one human conversing with another in the manner that is done throughout the book. The idea behind the story was interesting, but the manner in which the author decided to communicate this to the reader left something to be desired. I didn't feel the author developed the characters sufficiently enough to engage the reader beyond a very surface level. Overall, it wasn't the worst book I've ever read. But it was definitely not one of the best. My rating is a C-."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"It is easy to criticize this novel for young people from any number of angles. The language is stilted, the style is flat, the dialogue stagy, and the characters' psychology don't quite ring true. Even the source of Elnora's income seems implausible. Collecting butterflies for the kinds of sums she is ultimately able to acquire should bring in hoards of competitors. We should see whole species extinct by the end of the book, along with plenty of human violence and thievery, but perhaps I am reading too much modernity into this simple tale of almost a century ago, a story that remains appealing and affecting for its innocence, not its realism.At root, the story is the conflict between Elnora Comstock and her psychologically unwell mother (Kate, whom the author wisely does not try to make likable, though he does attempt to make her sympathetic) and how Elnora's intelligence, determination, and all around decency and goodness triumph in the end. Elnora in fact turns out to be quite a formidable foe of anyone who stands in her way, as her rival in love Edith Carr will discover. Yet despite her power, she struggles to grow in wisdom and humanity, never letting bitterness overcome her essential decency.Modern readers may roll their eyes at the sensibilities and sensitivities exhibited. At times, it seems that Elnora and her friends are living next door to where the pyramids are being built. But surely, that is part of the book's charm. Young girls of the time (pre-WWI) no doubt hoped for such a happily married life, as Elnora seems destined to have. And it is refreshing to see the young men portrayed as intelligent as well as romantic and caring. Characters grow, even mean, monstrous ones (e.g. Kate), and they grow for the better. One always wishes the best for Elnora and despite the book's faults that is a real accomplishment on by the author. They don't write books like this one any more."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Think of it as a Midwestern Cinderella story, but with no glass slipper and plenty of moths. Gene Stratton Porter was at the peak of her skills when she wrote \\"A Girl of the Limberlost,\\" which starts off as a young girl's struggle against her mother's virulent hatred -- and soon evolves into an enchanting little romance.Elnora Comstock has barely signed up for college when she discovers that she can't afford it -- tuition and textbooks cost too much, and her shabby clothes are mocked by her classmates. Even worse, her half-crazy, malicious mother refuses to cough up any money.But she soon finds that she can pay another way -- a strange lady called the Bird Woman is willing to pay money for moths, butterflies, caterpillars and chrysalids, which Elnora can easily find in a vast dangerous swamp called the Limberlost. And her friends Margaret and Wesley are happy to help her in any way they can -- clothes, a violin -- until the day when Mrs. Comstock comes to a shocking realization about her daughter.Then Elnora encounters a wealthy young man named Philip Ammon, who has the same love of nature that she has -- as well as a wealthy socialite fiancee named Edith. But when a party in honor of Edith and Philip's engagement is wrecked by a butterfly and a fit of jealousy, he begins to realize what his true feelings for Elnora are...\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" can be divided into two sections -- the first is a Cinderellaesque story about a strong, intelligent young girl who is pursing her music and education, despite her nasty old mother's loathing of her. But once that storyline is wrapped up, the second half of the book becomes a haunting, passionate love story.Stratton-Porter was at her peak when she wrote this -- her prose is overflowing with natural beauty (\\"the whole earth was purple with a thick blanket of violets\\") and some very tough personal situations, such as when Margaret and Wesley take in a badly-abused young boy. And both halves of \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" reach a emotionally harrowing climax as two of the characters are forced to see the raw ugliness of their actions.But the romance is also really adorable, especially since it's based on friendship and both parties only realize it belatedly. And Stratton-Porter adds in a touch of romance for other characters, including old married couples and snotty socialites.Elnora is a likable, realistic girl that you'd like as a friend -- kind, charitable and hardworking, but has flashes of temper. And Philip Ammon is a rather sweet if clueless guy. Mrs. Comstock starts out as a crazy old lady who wallows in her grief and obsession with her dead husband, but Stratton-Porter rebuilds her into a character you can like and respect; Edith also starts off as a nasty snotty rich girl who cares more about social status than love, but the author puts her through the grinder and makes her more likable.\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" is both a brilliant coming-of-age tale and a lush little romance, set against an epic backdrop of natural beauty. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"A lovely early 20th century book about a girl who lives in a rural area, catching rare moths to put herself through high school. This book is perfect for a girl in her young teens- an innocently romantic tale that focuses a on girl's growing understanding of her own role in the world. While the book's language and setting might seem outdated to some, the theme and plot are timeless classics.This is a book that I have loved reading and re-reading for the past 20 years, since I was about 13 years old."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I've read this book every few years or so since I was 10(I'm now 60) the first copy being my grandmother's. One is transported into a different world, one where goals were clearer . Elnora's struggles can be related to by any girl today, and her triumph is purely her own. A lovely theme in the book allows each character to come to life as a caterpillar, spend a time in a cocoon, them emerge finally as a beautiful moth. Elnora's mother's transformation is particularly splendid. The ecological concerns of the novel convince the reader that our &quot;modern&quot; problems are mere variations on a theme. The reverence for hard work, creativity, and strict moral standards are refreshing."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Elnora Comstock, the plucky, resourceful heroine of this classic novel, first published in 1909, is a character who is still relevant and fascinating for today's readers. \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" was one of my favorite books as a girl, and it was one of my mother's and my grandmother's favorites. Like other timeless literary heroines who overcome great odds to achieve happiness (such as Anne of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and Jo of \\"Little Women\\"), Elnora is eternally fiesty, admirable and loveable.When the novel opens, Elnora is determined to attend the high school in a nearby township. Her neglectful, sometimes abusive mother, Katharine, is equally determined to discourage her and ruin her dreams. Elnora and Katharine live in a cabin on the edge of the great Limberlost swamp, a place of wonder and danger, located three miles from the township where Elnora wants to go to school. The hard, cold Katharine is haunted by the death of her husband on the very day Elnora was born. She blames her only child for the death of her beloved husband because her birth kept Katharine from having the strength to aid her husband when he was drowning in the swamp.On the first day of high school, Elnora's tacky clothes and inability to fit in with the snooty mean girls, along with the fact that she learns she will needs an unexpected amount of money for books and tuition leads her to brief despair. But her own ingenuity, along with the help of a loving neighbor couple, Margaret and Wesley Sinton, solve some of Elnora's problems.I love the many intricate details in this book about Elnora's life in a rural early twentieth century world. For instance, the Sintons purchase clothing and accessories so that Elnora can fit in with her classmates. One article is a wonderful leather lunchbox which contains lidded dishes to hold small sandwiches, salad, condiments, dessert, milk, utensils and a cloth napkin. The descriptions of the different foods which are used to fill this lunchbox, and how Elnora's lunches eventually play a part in her meeting some destitute children whom she ultimately aides, are just fascinating.Elnora is able to earn her way through school by her mastery of the natural world around her. She collects moths, butterflies, old Indian relics, bird's nests, specimens of tree leaves, flowers and grasses, and then either sells them or uses them to teach classes in natural history to grade school children. Her forays into the Limberlost, and what she finds there are described in loving detail.The characters in the book are also memorable. How Katharine Comstock comes to change her outlook on life, and learn some hard lessons about the importance of motherhood and the real character of her dead husband is told with great depth of feeling. But this is not a cloying or overly sentimental book. These characters are very real and hold up very well to a twenty-first century reader's more sophisticated tastes.Even the romance at the end of the novel, between Elnora and a handsome lawyer from Chicago, who are brought together by their love of the outdoors, is believable by today's standards. A deliciously malevolent and spoiled ex-fiancee who seeks to ruin Elnora's chance at true love is introduced, but all ends happily for everyone.I recommend this novel highly. Gene Stratton-Porter was an important, prolific writer, and if you like this book, you should seek some other titles, especially \\"Freckles\\". \\"Freckles\\" is the prequel to \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" and is also a wonderful story about a young man overcoming adversity and finding love.This review is for the Kindle edition of the novel, which contains the complete text and is available free for download to your Kindle, as the novel has entered public domain. The novel is also available in paperback and hardback editions, some of which contain copyrighted essays and criticism."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Elnora Comstock , despite country schooling, lack of money, and a mother who despises her, uses her wits and character to get an education. Her absolute understanding of right and wrong may seem quaint to a reader today, but it earns her education, money, and the love of all who meet her. The moral values exemplified by Elnora are refreshing to read about. She blames no one for her hardships, but works with all possible verve to overcome them. The ecological issues, which were emphasized in the very inferior made for tv movie, seem to presage our present day concerns. The Bird Woman is even then trying to preserve nature for the city folk who cannot enjoy it. I first read by grandmother's falling apart copy about 55 years ago. Once a decade I would locate the book somehow. Once I got it from a high school student who had inherited it from her great grandmother. Recently it showed up in the public library, but ABRIDGED.I was delighted when I discovered it had been reprinted in its original form. This book casts a strange spell over me. Edith Carr's final act of graciousness is a masterpiece of imagery."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I loved this book! Considering its age, I was expecting thick, dragging description and stilted dialog that would drive me crazy. However, there was neither--I haven't been so pleasantly surprised by a book in quite a long time! The characters immediately play with our sympathies; I even felt sorry for Kate Comstock, after all she had done to Elnora, when she learns the truth about her husband. Some of the plot twists were quite contrived (for instance, Elnora searches for how many pages for a single Yellow Emperor, and then her mother, an inexperienced moth hunter at best, finds a PAIR the first time she goes looking?), but it really didn't bother me. &quot;Suspension of disbelief&quot; is an easy mode to get into when the characters are this interesting. I also just loved the &quot;test&quot; Elnora puts forth at the end of the book. She really is a true lady, never compromising her standards and keeping her feelings for Philip in check EVEN when he comes to her a free man. It would have been very easy to throw herself into his arms for the final kiss of the book (it was what they both wanted, after all) at least fifty pages before the end, but that would have been too easy. So to those who would gripe that the book is too long, I wouldn't take out a single event. Give it a zealous four stars if you don't consider the age of the book. But grading on a curve with other books I've read from this era, five stars isn't enough!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"This book makes you feel like you are there. When you read about Edith's ball, you can totally picture her dress. When Gene Porter talks about Elnora's gifts for graduation, you feel like jumping in there and seeing them for yourself, she descirbes them so well. This is a great story for someone who loves the outdoors and a little bit of romance and a tiny bit of suspense. That comes when you are finding out about Elnora's father. I just love the descriptions in this book! I cannot say it enough. I feel like I'm there, back in the time period with Elnora and experiencing everything that she experiences. With this book you can get a little bit of a lot of different types of writing. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves old stories. (Now, if you want me to tell what the story is about, here it goes.) Elnora is a girl who is growing up on the edge of a forest/swamp called the Limberlost. There she lives with her unattentive mother who has never really forgiven her husband (Elnora's father) for dieing and leaving her with a child to raise. This book follows Elnora through high school and her experiences with the &quot;city people&quot; and her struggles to become accepted and to earn her way through school and on to college. It also tells of her summers spent with Philip Ammon, a young man who is engaged to the most spoiled young woman one can imagine in my opinion. At the end, things are almost opposite from what they were at the beginning. At least with her mother and Philip. This story is a sort-of take off from &quot;Freckles&quot;, which is another book by Gene Stratton Porter. &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; continues Porter's great talent for placing the reader in the world of the characters and using great passages telling about different kinds of flowers, ferns, mosses, and moths and butterflys. I would definetly recommend this book to a nature lover. This is a great book"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Everyone who loves books should read this story!This is a VERY old Book! I am 58 years old, and I remember my Mother giving me her well read and tattered copy when I was quite young. I read it MANY times over the years, until it just fell apart! It is truly wonderful.I still remember much of it, and haven't read it in probably 40 years! I'm going to see if Amazon.com can find me a copy of it to give my daughter and grandaughter! Try it, you'll like it! Jenny Martin, Springville, Alabama"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"There are few books as readable, time after time, as this one by Gene Stratton-Porter. Its themes are as relevant today as they were when they were written at the turn of the century - overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges; fitting in; challenging relationships; the value of friends and family; grief; belonging; honesty; education - formal, informal and the school of hard knocks; the wonder and beauty of the natural world - moths, woods, and swamps in particular; the ecological impact of development; love; patience; creative thinking; jealousy; and commitment.First read at age 12 and later shared with my husband and daughters, we are enriched with every reading. Its lucid prose draws us deep into the northeastern Indiana woods, and we can't help but relish life, moths, and Elnora. Gene Stratton-Porter was once asked why she wrote such positive stories when more sensational, raw novels would probably sell more books. She said something to the effect that there is enough sordidness in the world, what we all need to be reminded of is that goodness is also there, and that she preferred writing stories which allow us to be uplifted and guided by that goodness!Now a grandmother, I still appreciate the good fortune of having had a grandmother introduced Gene Stratton-Porter's books to me. This and should be on Oprah's Book Club and a feature film!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Everyone knows that teenage girls are supposed to experience extreme mood swings, be obsessed with their appearance and have romantic notions filling their remaining thoughts. As Henry Higgins says, their minds are full of \\"cotton, hay and rags.\\" At least that is the popular stereotype, reinforced by the shallow portrayals of young girls in movies and television, who, when they aren't preoccupied with the mirror are busy trying to save the earth. That is why this book's heroine is a refreshing example of a young woman whose real attractiveness lies with her courage and intelligence, especially in the face of suffering, while she still has a healthy concern about how she is \\"carpentered.\\" She also embraces a deep love for God's creation without being a rabid environmentalist.Elnora Comstock is a 16-year-old girl who lives on the edge of a swamp called the Limberlost with her widowed mother. Elnora's life is difficult because her mother has retreated from the world since the tragic death of her beloved husband when Elnora was only a baby. Mrs. Comstock has become hardened and unloving, and Elnora's only affection is from a neighboring couple who have no children of their own. In this cold atmosphere, Elnora blossoms into a rare jewel of a person; rather than becoming embittered like her mother, she returns love for her mother's negligence and shows remarkable resourcefulness in meeting the challenges of pursuing her dreams while trying to remeain faithful to her mother's commands.Gene Stratton Porter has written several popular novels which were bestsellers in the time they were first published in the early part of the 20th century. Freckles was somewhat of a prequel to A Girl of the Limberlost, and both books are full of accurate natural history, especially about moths and butterflies in the Limberlost Swamp in Indiana, while asserting that the wonders of nature could only have come from God's creative Hand (the author was actually married to someone named Charles Darwin Porter!)Elnora is remarkably patient and loving while undergoing difficult trials, but rather than being an unbelievable, sickeningly-sweet character, she exhibits temper, anguish and sometimes walks a fine line between being obedient to her mother and justifying hiding certain things from her. Yet as Elnora grows into graceful maturity, her mother softens, and the reconciliation between mother and daughter is a touching reminder of how God would have us respond to providential trials. Even though we can't presently know the outcome of our daily battles, we can trust that He is lovingly guiding us to a wonderful end."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"This story is so beautiful, you'll want to read it over and over. If you're afraid of creepy-crawly critters, you should read this. It will change your perspective. This is one of those stories whose beauty makes you ache inside when it's over."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"There should be more books like this. My mother first read this book to me when I was 8 years old, and I just finished reading it to my husband. It's a wonderful, gentle story, with values that I miss - kindness and modesty, for starters. This book also stresses the importance of an appreciation of nature. It also shows - fairly realistically for a young person's book - that love and determination can save the day! A good book with a wonderful, sympathetic character in Elnora - you couldn't ask for a better role model!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I had read this book as a child in the fifth grade. It became one of my all time favorites. I never could find it anywhere. I now have two girls of my own, and imagine my surprise to find out that my fifth grade daughter brought it home to read. I read it again and fell in love with it all over. My daughter also enjoyed it. Now we really have something that we can share."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"My mother borrowed this book from her aunt and read it. When I was about 10 she borrowed it again and I read it. When my first grand daughter was 10 I bought her a copy and she read it. It is a timeless book."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"Okay, I'm gonna get all mushy. Not that I really need to jump onto this pile of praise. But this is a wonderful, decidedly old-fashioned, feel-good book. In my mid teens, a big barrel arrived at our house one evening. It contained all the books that my mother read as a child and was storing at my grandparents house. Among them were Freckles, The Harvester and A Girl of the Limberlost. I don't know what possessed me, being a guy and all, but I started with Limberlost. This is about me. The wild child bare-footing his way through the southwest Ohio woods, studying everything that caught his attention, collecting cocoons every winter experiencing whatever ecstasy is available to a 13-year-old when they emerged in June. And there I was, too, plotting, planning, and conniving to get into college. So, in my dotage, or maybe half-dotage, when I require myself to re-read a book that really impressed me earlier in life from time to time, I decided to re-read Limberlost. It's still wonderful. I'm a little wiser. I can see some of the formal seams in the writing, now. But that's fine. This is a good read. Now to buy The Harvester again and let it guilt me from my bookshelf until I re-read it too."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I can't improve much on the prior 5 star comments. This book has everything a young girl (or young at heart) would love. Strength, courage, compassion, \\"comprehension\\", love and inspiration. I received this book over 15 years ago and it continues to rank #1 through the hundreds of others. The writer is clear and concise about settings and people. I truly care for all of them (I wish they would make a movie, true to the full book). While many perceive \\"Oh geesh.. moths?\\" I see it as the literal metaphor for Elnora's life in the book. Her transformation from 16 through 20 is wonderful. Moths and butterflies can be beautiful, if you know what to look for, and not only does the book teach us this directly - it teaches us this with people as well."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I loved every page of this book.

I would highly recommend you read it!"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"I had read this book in the 1950's when I was a teenager. I loved it, and wondered if I would still like it as an adult. Now, being able to appreciate the 19th century thought that went into it, I think I like it even more. It is wonderfully written, and one of those stories that just leave you feeling good. This time around, I took the time to check out what/where the Limberlost was, the history of Gene Stratton Porter, etc., and it added to the enjoyment. Sometimes you really can't beat the old classics."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"The flaws in this book fall into two categories.(1) General style and structure: The book is written in a very sentimental and cloying style. People speak in long paragraphs in a way that's very unrealistic; writing dialogue is not the author's strong point (describing nature is more her thing). The explanations for the way Mrs Comstock acts make no sense. Also, sometimes characters appear, with all kinds of foreshadowing implied, and then are never mentioned again.(2) Historical issues: I understand that this book was written over a hundred years ago and is, as my edition states, \\"a product of its time.\\" But by the standards of our time, there are some troubling attitudes expressed in the work about race (specifically Native Americans/Indians) and gender. My edition notes that \\"views on race have changed\\" but is tellingly silent on the question of gender. On the plus side, the main character Elnora is not just a pretty face, she is brave and smart and has interests and ambitions. However, it is taken for granted that once she marries, all of that will take a back seat to keeping a home and rearing children. I'm not blaming the author for this, that wouldn't be fair (especially since we haven't really moved on so very much--vide Pretty Woman, etc). But younger readers, who are after all the intended audience of this book, may benefit from discussions challenging these ideas.Having said that, there is a cozy sort of feel to the world of this book. One gets a glimpse (albeit in rosy soft focus) of what life was like in another time and place, and some interesting ethical dilemmas are raised concerning nature conservation.P.S. Anne Of Green Gables, while published a year earlier, is far ahead in terms of gender equality."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"The book was as good as I remember it when I read it as a child.

It is a love story, a nature story and natural history story all in one. The limberlost does exist. At one time it was 13,000 acres of wetlands, forest and marshes in the state of Indiana. A much smaller amount still remains as a state park.The characters come to life and seem almost real. The young girl and her mother and friends search the woods and marshes for moths butterfly and other nature items. Little Billy made me laugh right out loud at some of his boyish games.As I was reading I wondered why would my father have enjoyed such a book?

Gene Stratton Porter was at the peak of her skills when she wrote \\"A Girl of the Limberlost,\\" which starts off as a young girl's struggle against her mother's virulent hatred -- and soon evolves into an enchanting little romance.Elnora Comstock has barely signed up for college when she discovers that she can't afford it -- tuition and textbooks cost too much, and her shabby clothes are mocked by her classmates. Even worse, her half-crazy, malicious mother refuses to cough up any money.But she soon finds that she can pay another way -- a strange lady called the Bird Woman is willing to pay money for moths, butterflies, caterpillars and chrysalids, which Elnora can easily find in a vast dangerous swamp called the Limberlost. And her friends Margaret and Wesley are happy to help her in any way they can -- clothes, a violin -- until the day when Mrs. Comstock comes to a shocking realization about her daughter.Then Elnora encounters a wealthy young man named Philip Ammon, who has the same love of nature that she has -- as well as a wealthy socialite fiancee named Edith. But when a party in honor of Edith and Philip's engagement is wrecked by a butterfly and a fit of jealousy, he begins to realize what his true feelings for Elnora are...\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" can be divided into two sections -- the first is a Cinderellaesque story about a strong, intelligent young girl who is pursing her music and education, despite her nasty old mother's loathing of her. But once that storyline is wrapped up, the second half of the book becomes a haunting, passionate love story.Stratton-Porter was at her peak when she wrote this -- her prose is overflowing with natural beauty (\\"the whole earth was purple with a thick blanket of violets\\") and some very tough personal situations, such as when Margaret and Wesley take in a badly-abused young boy. And both halves of \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" reach a emotionally harrowing climax as two of the characters are forced to see the raw ugliness of their actions.But the romance is also really adorable, especially since it's based on friendship and both parties only realize it belatedly.

One thing that was super annoying though was that Elnora was collecting caterpillars and moths from the swamps to sell. Then it says that every year, there are less and less moths. And who's fault do you think that is? It's Elnora who's capturing and killing them. Though I don't blame her; she has to earn money some way. Also, the book talked about God in a very annoying way.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"The story of Elanora and her travels as she comes of age is a true gem from an era known for serial offerings of young male adventurers as heroes. This thoughtful novel by Gene Stratton-Porter stands apart from the rest due to the following characteristics and more:- TGotL takes the reader on several absorbing tours of an Indiana swamp ecosystem. Smart kids will have fun researching moths, birds, and perhaps even some long ago-forgotten terms circa 1909, if they can overlook the prerequisite eye dialect so popular in American fiction at the time. No surprise that there are several Twain references in this story.- Elanora is a brave, intelligent heroine, who finds ways to achieve her goals in spite of her situation. Although her rewards always seem to be tempered with more challenges, she does not give up. Stratton-Porter wasn't the greatest writer, even she would admit that; but she did know how to develop characters to an extent, and she did a fine job with Elanora. One can't but root for her as she struggles to learn, grow, and fit in.- The characters are human. They are not perfect (except for our dear Elanora), but those who are not always good are also not always bad. Just like us, they undergo changes in personality and feeling over the some ten years we catch a glimpse of.This book provides an escape to another Secret Garden as had not yet been described. Enjoy it while reading outdoors in the fresh air. You might even recognize a butterfly or two after awhile."},{"Title":"A Girl of the Limberlost","review":"This was a book My mother spoke about in the 1930S This is the first time I ever saw it. I found it very interesting ."},{"Title":"Swami Premananda","review":"Swami Ashokananda (1893- 1969) of the Vedanta Society of Northern California (San Francisco) requested that a number of his talks be combined as a booklet on Swami Premananda (1861- 1918). Swami Premananda was one of six disciples Sri Ramakrishna called an Ishvarakoti. For the sake of harmony and unity of purpose in the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, Swami Premananda never made any disciples of his own (on instructions from Swami Vivekananda). His personality and accessibility attracted newcomers to the Order including the author, who first saw him in 1912. These talks are a warm tribute to Swami Premananda."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"If you are among those hoping that Ed Greenwood will develop his characters more as time goes on, Stormlight is sure to disappoint. In it, Storm Silverhand becomes involved in a scheme by a dead god to revive himself. (Those who have read TSR's Lost Gods offerings will find this a familiar theme, though Stormlight is not part of that series.) Despite several interesting moments, Stormlight falls short on at least two counts.First, Greenwood's characters continue to develop in raw power without any concurrent personality development. Even though she is likely the least powerful of the Seven Sisters, Storm is revealed to be a near-god by the end of this novel: she has lived for centuries; she has allies among the kings and archwizards throughout the land (and drops their names liberally in her dialogue); and, though not a wizard, she exhibits practically undefeatable spell-like abilities. Meanwhile, her personality remains shallow and inconsistent, e.g. bemoaning the fate of a long lost love at times and flirting with various male characters at others. Sadly, we learn very little of her past, or her connection to Elminster, Mystra, or her sisters.Second, the plot has roughly 75 pages worth of substance, but the author presses the formulaic battle-then-regroup button long enough to churn out the requisite 312 page TSR novel. A potentially interesting secondary villain is quickly introduced then defeated by characters only peripherally involved in this novel, leaving the reader to wonder if interesting subplots have been deliberately clipped out by a sadistic editor.In short, I recommend Stormlight only to those desperate for a Forgotten Realms story."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"Not a good book to read your first time through the Realms, but quite amusing if you know anything about Storm or the Seven Sisters.Ed Greenwood's writing is anything but stimulating here, but FR fans do get plenty of Storm's biting humor. However, there are frustrating plot-defects. Storm's habit of ending up nude distracts from the book and is plain annoying. I read &quot;Spellfire&quot; and &quot;Crown of Fire&quot; long before this book (found neither of them gripping) and there are mentions of Selune and the loss of Storm's lover which contradict everything in &quot;Stormlight&quot; from the appearence of Selune to everything else in Storm's life.The only other thing that trips up this novel is the fact that being a Chosen of Mystra makes Storm next to invincible, killing any hint of suspense that could have existed here. So if you are a Seven Sister's fan and can straighten out those little life-plot inconsistencies and like to see snobby nobles getting an earful, then go check this one out at the library or borrow it before deciding to add it to your collection."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"This book is a fine example of everything Ed Greenwood does wrong when he writes a novel. Ed seems incapable of creating characters who are anything short of omnipotent. Storm can always fall back on some poorly explained mystic power whenever her sword-weilding abilities or wits fail her. This is terrible because it dampens all of the excitement of the fight scenes. No matter how well the author could choreograph a fight ( and I'm not saying he does it well), the reader is bored because he knows somehow this Storm character is in no real danger.Ed's supporting characters are usually stereotypical, and the nobility described in this book are no exception. They are snobish, condesending, and incapable of displaying any intelligence that could save them from their impending doom. Ofcourse it is up to Storm to gallantly and selflessly save them from their ignorance. Please!Ed &quot;peppers&quot; his book with nude scenes of Storm that do nothing to develop the story, and are completely inappropriate to the moment at hand. Who is he catering to? Adolescents? He reveals more about Storm's anatomy than he does about her character, her motivations, her past, or her fears. Instead of writing a believable, living, breathing character Ed fails and creates a pin-up girl."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"Action in its finest form, appealing plot twists, and a very human character. Human in the sense of her attitude, of course, as she's pretty resistant. The plot always made me want to know the next events, and I couldn't let it down. Again, a great work of Ed Greenwood."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"Though the characters are a little flat and the plot a simplistic, the book was still a good read. The story has everything that a TSR book should, including the the dim but honourable soldiers, egotistic wizards, a sexy heroine who is almost godlike, and of course the all powerfull villian. But that is also the books problem because it becomes too pridictable and repetative in some of the action sequences."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"This is the classic example of Ed Greenwood being a dirty old man. Totally plot driven, populated with gaudy, overrrated characters who resemble a dominatrix rather than a fantasty character. I barely made it through the first 30 pages before I started skimming half heartedly through this haphazardly tossed together \\"novel\\".Perhaps if Mr Greenwood really loved the world he created, the publisher would not have destroyed it. Instead he beat it to death and stunned the fans with garbage like this, which didnt end here. He is not literary in the least-kitchy and childish, yes. Alas the Forgotten Realms, which held so much potential, has ended its appearance in our world."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"... Ed Greenwood has little grasp of plot, charachter development, or suspense. This book reads like a fifth grade book report. It is definately the worst of the Harper series and one of the worst books in the Forgotten Rhealms setting."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"The start of the book is ok. Anything about the silver sisters is somewhat interesting. The only problem is there is so much randomness going on in the book that it is hard to follow. Ed Greenwood is not the greatest writer, and I agree with others that anyone looking for a good fantasy book should look elsewhere. Too much random nudity, destruction, and plot lines."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"Someone, or something, is killing servants, armsmen and nobles in Firefall Keep.

It's worth the read."},{"Title":"Stormlight (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers)","review":"I'v read lots Fantasy books and on StormLight I had no clue what was going on.

She points out the great and often overlooked value of rhythmic repetition of even the smallest act, such as singing or humming at any time. Or lighting a candle to rememeber an event or a person.What Ms. Bruning does so well is to bring back the sacred to our everyday life by reminding us to pay even the scantest attention to a ritual. One need not attend a typical place of worship, but rather one can worship anywhere and regain strength and uplift.In these trying days of all the world's tragic actions, we need to focus energy toward keeping the spirit of life in our hearts. This book goes a long way to making connections in the heart through study, music, and extention of a helping hand.Read this book, it's very good for you!"},{"Title":"Rhythms and Cycles","review":"Somehow this book simultaneously gave me focus and set my mind to wandering. What more could one ask? Rhythms and Cycles' dialogue of opposites (sound and silence, solitude and community, for example) seems an invitation to draw on memory, to think about meaning. Nancy Bruning is conversational, engaging, generous, and even gently witty. Her exploration of patterns in everyday life in different cultures, different religions, offers lots of information; just as important, it encourages you to reflect on your past and present, on identities and contexts. It fills gaps and connects pieces of what you know. It's a fast and easy read, that you want to take slowly, to interrupt with your own reflections and insights. I'm giving it to several friends."},{"Title":"Rhythms and Cycles","review":"This book traces ancient rituals, as they have been adapted to modern religious practices. Primary focus is upon Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Hinduism, Buddhism and others are also examined.Common day-to-day activities that seem non-secular are explored and shown to have religious roots. Conversely, this book explains that many religious practices are simply modified celebrations dealing with the cycles of nature. I liked how Nancy Bruning wrote about this in a very open, non-judgmental way.I liked the image that common threads relating to natural cycles show up in the cloth of distinctly different faiths. I wish that the extreme fundamentalist believers in any faith could read &quot;Rhythms and Cycles&quot; and realize that perhaps there is only one God, a God that wouldn't be pleased with the notion of killing or dying.This is very timely given the recent WTC tragedy. For me, a chilling sentence on page 211 summed up the mindset of the hijackers: &quot;Martyrs of Islam have their evil deeds completely erased and they are sent to the Garden immediately.&quot;"},{"Title":"The State That I Am in","review":"I'm not sure what the B&S; Fan was talking about. I bought this book after listening to Scott's album (The World Outside by \\"Another Dreamer\\").I found the novel genuine and interesting, keeping me coming back. I'm not sure I've ever read anything quite like it before. What strikes me most is Scott's sense of honestly at all costs. But more than that, the inspiring and interesting love story itself...two teenagers naively going up against all odds for true love.Yes, there were parts that made me a little uncomfortable. There was a little more sex than I expected, a little America-bashing, and the main character comes across as arrogant at times...which, in my opinion, only makes the character more authentic (as unpalatable as it can be at times). But from reading his blog and listening to his music, it does strike me that the characters are at least part fiction...as the main character &quot;Daniel\\" doesn't sound all that much like the author in real life.Also, I really didn't notice any typos. In fact, often when the foreign characters speak, the imperfect sentences intentionally remind us that they aren't fluent in English. This might be what the B&S; fan is referring to.I'm giving this novel a 5 because it kept me turning pages, because the characters came alive for me, and finally, much like his music, because it is original and doesn't fit neatly into any genre."},{"Title":"The State That I Am in","review":"This story centers around Daniel and his reflections and struggles in early adult life. He meets beautiful Isabella and becomes enchanted by her, both of them willing to risk their content lives for their fulfilling love. This book is great for anybody who has girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband from eastern european countries or to somebody who would like to explore bit of Slovak culture. This book is a reminder of how one can try to live fully and its ending chapters make us all reconsider pleasure and its consequence.&#34;Nothing is inherently good or evil, right or wrong. It's matter of degree and matter of consequence. Practically everything people are motivated to do is in quest for perceived or actual pleasure, and the only thing stopping people from seeking this pleasure is consequence. It is this consequence that defines good and evil.&#34; Scott NeissI highly recommend this book, it is nice light reading with inspiring thoughts and you will never forget about the contagious, beautiful love between Daniel and Isobel."},{"Title":"The State That I Am in","review":"Alright, I admit that I found this book solely because I am a huge Belle and Sebastian fan and thought I would check out a novel that had been 'inspired' by them. BIG MISTAKE.I guess I should have been warned: the title of Neiss's pretentious dreck is a fictitious book that characters on occasion read (or even write) in B&S; songs... this author wants to put himself in the songs? Yeah, well... no one would waste their precious few minutes of indie-song fame reading this.The story is second-rate: boy falls for foreign girl, parents and continents threaten to drag them apart, boy and girl grow up, get married, and stay in love against all obstacles, and the writing is even worse. Every noun and verb is preceded by a facile adjective, making the book about 1/2 times longer than need be. Sloppy writing to the extreme. The most appalling factors, though, are the continuous misspellings, bad punctuation, and grammatical errors that permeate this book. Jr. High kids are more consistent than this. Maybe this was some 'hip' thing to do that I just didn't get, or maybe the editor died while trying to muddle his way through all the extraneous adjectives, but whatever the cause was, it still is painful to read.By the way, B&S; is only mentioned in a handful of places, in case you thought maybe you should just read it to get a good 'plug' for your favorite band.Do not bother with \\"The State I am In\\". Go listen to \\"Tigermilk\\" and read Stuart David's \\"Nalda Said\\" instead.I have never so badly wasted 4 hours of my life on a book."},{"Title":"The State That I Am in","review":"I'm a Belle and Sebastian fan and heard about this book from my friend. B&amp;S makes several references to a book called &quot;the state that I am in&quot;, and so I just had to read it. Anyway, it is an interesting, fresh perspective from a talented young author. He so effortlessly covers so many themes...the struggle between responsibility and pleasure, the loss of innocence, and the struggle to find true love in today's high-tech world. I noticed how he looks at everyday things with a unique, multicultural perspective. It's been several weeks since I finished the book and I haven't been able to forget about Daniel and Izabela."},{"Title":"Sleeping beauty (Lift the Pictures/Find the Words)","review":"Yes, the prince kisses Sleeping Beauty, the curse is broken and everyone lives happily ever after.

Overall, a good book for young people."},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Physics","review":"As a physicist I thought this book would be handy to have around, but my experience with it suggests that the authors' goal was to use as many trees as possible while providing as little information as possible.

Many are traditional like lasagne and chicken enchiladas and many are newer, more creative ideas. Honestly, we don't cook the recipes as fat-free. We live in Germany and fat-free food doesn't exist here so we cook with normal cheese, sour cream, tomato sauce, etc. and they taste wonderful. I use this book more than any of the others.

The writing is quite simple and down-to-earth and the illustrations (14 in color, 52 in black and white), go along quite well with the text. The books takes us step by step the the maturation process in relationship the the child's art work, what to watch for, where to help and how to assess abilities.

It's a story about a little elephant who likes to dance but when he does so, he's disturbing a mouthy parrot, who in turn, tells him his skin doesn't fit him. The baby elephant tries to make his skin fit, gets a tiger to volunteer to chew some of it off, then meets up with a crocodile who volunteers to eat his ears, then meets a lion that would just like to eat him in general (there was no python in my book!). But, the baby elephant is saved by a herd of elephants and they all take up dancing. The parrot stopped laughing at the baby elephant then. It's a very cute story and if you have elephant lovers in your house, it's particularly sweet. The pictures are just darling, especially the one where the baby elephant is crying.

Apparently, the publisher has re-formated this book to ONLY be compatible with the Kindle Fire. So, notwithstanding the fact that I had paid for a legitimate copy of this book, I was no longer able to access it.

The book has about twenty-three pages with Sooki meeting other animals in the jungle.The Sappy Baggy Elephant begins with him dancing around in the jungle. While dancing his feet would pound the jungle so that it shook all around. Next his kicking would knock over trees as he continued further into the jungle.One day he met a parrot that asked him why he was shaking the jungle to pieces and asked him just what kind of animal he was. In answer to this question the elephant replied he had no idea what he was since he was alone. He had given himself the name Sooki and thought it suited him well. The parrot told Sooki that his ears and his nose were too big for him. He also thought his skin was much too big for him and suggested his name be Saggy-Baggy.The Saggy Baggy Elephant is a nice story of the elephant fitting in after all and finding his own kind in the jungle. This is a quick read and small enough for a toddler to hold and help turn the pages. The pictures are detailed and colorful.Many children can identify with the elephant feeling discouraged due to his large ears, nose and wrinkly skin. Along the way he meets many other animals similar to the way a child meets new kids that might not be friendly at first. We like to read this a few times a week. My son likes to see the page with the crocodile and the elephant blowing water out his trunk having fun. This also reminds me of the elephant scene with Bill Murray in the movie, Larger Than Life."},{"Title":"The Saggy Baggy Elephant","review":"This was (first published in 1947) and it is still delighting young readers and the young at heart to this day. Lots of words, so definitely a read to rather than read yourself for the very beginners"},{"Title":"Genet: A Biography","review":"Jean Genet's major works are considered masterpieces. His plays, The Screen and The Blacks are performed worldwide. During his lifetime, he received the Grand Prix des Arts et Lettres and he is remembered for championing the causes of the oppressed. Yet, surprisingly, for many years, no biography of Genet had been attempted. Writers could have been intimidated by Sartre's huge psychological study, St. Genet, published in 1952, or perhaps by the elusive nature of Genet, himself, and his complex morality.In 1987 Edmund White began what became a six-year study of Genet's life and works. The result of that work is this book, Genet, a shining and enduring biography that shares much in common with Starkie's excellent biography of Rimbaud and Ellman's Oscar Wilde.White read Genet's Our Lady of the Flowers for the first time in 1964. He responded to Genet's &quot;deeper, more extravagant prose,&quot; and, in doing so, he experienced a self-liberation as the gay world was presented without apology or explanation and gay men were afforded the experience of seeing their world, not as tacky but as glamorous and poetic. In addition, Genet's affectionate rendering of drag queens helped to elevate their view in the eyes of all.White, who had tested HIV-positive in 1985, was grateful for the chance to work on the biography as it also afforded him the opportunity to reflect on his own homosexuality, art and literature in a world not yet affected by the AIDS virus, for Genet had inhabited a world and culture prior to the outbreak of AIDS.In this sensitive biography, White takes us on a journey through the French welfare and prison systems; high society led by Cocteau; caf&eacute; society led by Sartre; and revolutionary movements as well.In Genet: A Biography, White shows us that Genet's work, like Genet, himself, is a terrain of contradictions, and he spells out both the kindnesses and the cruelty with sincere and translucent clarity.Genet began life in 1911 as a ward of the state. Raised as an outcast, by a young age he was attempting to come to terms with his sensitive and convulsive nature. At the age of thirteen he began lying and stealing; by fourteen, he was branded a thief, something he accepted with arrogance rather than shame. At fifteen, he was arrested and led, in handcuffs, into the Penitentiary Colony of Mettray.At Mettray, he worked in the fields and performed naval drills on landlocked ships. By night, however, the prisoners lived by their own code. The handsome, sadistic heterosexual was king, and someone, like Genet, passive and adoring, not only served, but blossomed as a princess and a scribe.As brutal as life was for Genet in Mettray, he cherished his time there, for he experienced many awakenings within its walls. The time in Mettray also afforded Genet a chance to look inward. What he saw caused him tremendous anguish, for he had to face the realization that he did, indeed, possess all the evil that others had attributed to him. His suffering, however, only made him strong.Destitute, but free at nineteen, Genet began a decade of wandering through Europe and Africa, passing from one prison to another for one petty crime or another. In 1939, in a prison cell in Fresnes, Genet began his masterpiece, Our Lady of the Flowers. Figuratively, he wrote in martyr's blood, for the book represented a reopening of all his adolescent wounds.As Genet wrote of his early loves in his cell at Mattray, modern literature found society's most marginal men portrayed, for the first time, without shame or remorse. White clearly points out that Genet never used his writing as a political or psychological forum, yet his books sparked furious debates over censorship in the courts of Europe. What Genet did do was open the door for future writers and, most importantly, confer dignity and understanding on society's least understood and most estranged.Genet had not set out to do so, but he had created a kind of miracle. Social change began to take place, and the president of France, at Sartre's urging, pardoned Genet of all his crimes. However, as White theorizes, this pardon also stripped Genet of his sacred individuality, his uniqueness, and he fell into a deep depression and ceased all writing.A relationship with the sculptor, Alberto Giacometti, however, conferred on Genet new meaning and purpose and he said, &quot;every man is every other man, as am I.&quot;Resuming his life as a vagabond, Genet discovered untapped inner resources and a wealth of creative ideas. His importance as a poet emerged.Genet's last years were filled with suffering, when, addicted to drugs and suffering from cancer, he dedicated himself to the plight of the Palestinians; rootless warriors lacking a champion, much like himself. His final work, Prisoner of Love, is dedicated to these people and to life, itself, and the power of the creative imagination. This was Genet's final miracle: the realization that we are all holy, that we all contain, both the whole and the part, of the divine.Genet died at the age of seventy-five, on 15 April 1986 in a hotel room in the thirteenth arrondissement of Paris. He is buried in Larache, Morocco and his grave bears only two sun-washed, sparkling white stones. Although Genet's body may lie beneath the Moroccan sand, his spirit still soars, crowned with the blood of his youth and the thorn-studded roses of old age."},{"Title":"Genet: A Biography","review":"Edmund White is perhaps best known as a novelist but this biography of Jean Genet may well be his magnum opus. (And I find it astonishing that it seems to be out of print as of May 2007, since there is no other decent English biography of Genet available.) It's a monster of a book, but it's one of the more readable literary biographies that I've come across--not least because \\"literary\\" in Genet's case also means social and political and scandalous. Readers who have never read a word of Genet may question the need for perusing this book, but it was my introduction to the work and, as I work my way through Genet's prose, I appreciate difficult or seemingly unfathomable passages all the more because of White's memorable explication (although I can't share White's enthusiasm for the plays).Genet's \\"rebellious\\" worldview--which often comes across as much a stage-managed affectation as a genuine philosophy--may be unattractive to those of a more traditional ethic (and I include myself among that group), but it's never boring. Much of Genet's writing depicts, glorifies, and justifies his careers as a thief, as an outsider, as an anarchist; he was also a notorious freeloader who forsook the attractions of materialism yet siphoned the wealth of others--and who sapped the remarkably patient generosity of his publishers).Genet idealizes his years at Mettray (a colony for adolescent delinquents), his life as a thief (which ended in 1944, after he had completed two books and earned the approbation and support of Cocteau), and \\"the erotic charm of prison\\" (his many convictions for petty theft earned him sentences totaled nearly four years). And it's a good thing his writing is so remarkable: as White never tires of pointing out, Genet was a famously bad thief who spent so much time in prison because he was most adept at getting caught.White covers far more than Genet's own life and work and lovers, however; this biography is also a decent introduction to the Parisian literary set that included such luminaries as Cocteau, Beauvoir, Duras, Giacometti, and Sartre. Since I was more interested in the literature, I had feared that the appeal of the biography would flag once I reached Genet's later years, after he had stopped writing and spent his time supporting various political causes (Algerian independence, pro-Palestinian movement, Black Panthers). But these chapters, too, were riveting and essential for an understanding both of his life's ethic and of his posthumously published \\"Prisoner of Love.\\"Overall, White makes a convincing case for Genet's importance, arguing \\"Genet and Celine are the most discussed twentieth-century French writers after Proust.\\" I'm not sure I would go that far (Camus? Sartre? Beauvoir? Ionesco? Beckett? Gide?), although I suppose it depends on who's doing the \\"discussing.\\" Nevertheless, White has certainly presented a solid case that Genet belongs in the top tier."},{"Title":"Genet: A Biography","review":"Following the rags to riches life of Jean Genet is an interesting reliving of French literature and history. Edmund White is certainly capable of empathy and psychological understanding for Genet, unlike in his biographies if William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. Though White makes the mistake of trying to incorporate some Michel Foucault, the homoseuxal philosopher, into his own penal insights into Jean Genet, the works and the man. Other than that fact, this handsome book is one long guitar solo at the altar of Genet.Most of Genet's life is well-known, and partly used as the subjects for his novels. Genet was an orphan, had foster parents, and went to reform school. He had a bunch of early gay relationships, and he stole a lot of books. In prison Genet wrote Our Lady of The Flowers, and later shows it to Jean Cocteau, who is pissed off because he didn't write a similiar work first.Genet wrote five novels and a few plays around and during World War II. They books are originally published anonymously. The books become an overnight sensation. As Genet becomes old and bald, and when the flamboyant Cocteau becomes bored with him, heterosexual Sartre and multisexual Simone de Beauvoir, both sort of yuppies of their time, become enamoured with the idea of hanging out and slumming it with Genet, a real thief.Sartre saw him as a good example of his existential philosophy, and wrote Saint Genet. This book of his life came out when Genet was in his mid-forties. Genet doesn't write very much during the last years of his life. He does become involved with the Black Panthers and Palestinians.Genet lived in Tangiers with his young Kiki. He wrote a final book that was banned before his death in 1986.Genet's life was one long homosexual rollercoster ride. Genet's long life is an achievement which White gives a literary form in this tribute and gentle biography. As far as literary biographies go, this one is up there with the biographies of Oscar Wilde, Sade, and Frank O'Hara."},{"Title":"Genet: A Biography","review":"Jean Genet was a precocious and complex human being at an early age, and knew it. He came into the world as a \\"ward of the state\\" and never ever learned to trust either his adopted overseers or the French society into which he had been remanded.The epiphany in this, Edmund White's outstanding biography, that defined both Genet's artistic ability and his normal life came while sitting on the outhouse toilet at the age of eight, peeking out at the world between the slits. This smelly self-imposed cage, this moment of transcendental peace in the midst of an outer world of foulness became a metaphor for both Genet's artistic as well as his normal life. His life time of petty thefts, homosexuality, and repeated imprisonment, either self-imposed or not, became the incubator for his staccato like bursts of creativity.The problem with Jean Genet is that he really never was able to (nor did he ever want to) negotiate the world just above his head, between the slits of the outhouse as it were. Oh, he understood normal French society all right? In fact, that was his problem; even from a birds-eye view from below, he \\"over-understood\\" it and thus wanted no part of the role it had assigned to him. The horizon for a \\"welfare brat\\" was limited and bracketed by pity and despair. Genet wanted no parts of that life; and thus he chose his own outlandish, rebellious counter-route.His avoidance of the corrupt reality of normal French society, the so-called \\"real world of haute culture\\" in exchange for his own alternative reality: the naughty (almost debased) side of the societal street came natural and it seems to me, was a profoundly existential choice. It was a choice between existing as another \\"ascribed and imposed zombie,\\" an \\"other\\" among the \\"normal living dead,\\" or becoming \\"alive\\" under ones own powers as an independent free and radical human being.Thus, Genet was always \\"fleeing from\\" everything, never \\"fleeing to\\" anything. He was fleeing away from a stifling world of proscribed nonsense to a world of random travels to sample exotic lands and cultures: often finding himself plopped down in the dead center of great excitement on the naughty sides of the street (the outhouse image again?). It was a charmed if an uncharted and an untidy if not an unclean life, one lived with gusto, and with maximum irresponsibility. It was a life with long periods of solitude and imprisonment interspersed with frenetic periods of creativity. It was a life in which he, never a committed ideologue, bumped into people and causes that resonated with his own. Somehow, he came to adopt them and was adopted by them. But life to Genet was always a random walk towards an unachievable freedom.That is why Jean Genet lived his life richly like his pants were on fire. That is why since the age of fifteen he was in and out of reform schools and prisons, deserter, general societal incorrigible, and never once throughout his life had a fixed address even when his writings made him a wealthy man. And that is why he continuously thumbed his nose at the very thought of being tied down by any of society's normal conventions or orthodoxies. This is a heady biography worthy of the subject it portrays. Five Stars"},{"Title":"Genet: A Biography","review":"It is very interesting to read Genet in French to get a real sense of where he is coming from and at. Interviews he did also provide some deep insights into the man. Given his totally odd and complicated background also, made worse by his own perverse behaviours, his writing is often astounding in its poetry and beauty and its capacity to get into and under things, throwing up endless meanings and interpretations. The Kindle edition of this excellent White biography has many textual flaws and errors, however, setting these techno things aside, White really gets into the bones of Genet and his flights of fantasy and myth, intermingled with reality and deliberately altered reality. He certainly was a complex person, possessed of idiosyncratic character details as well as being totally self-centered and difficult to understand and get along with. After WWII, he was fortunate to have major figures (like Cocteau and Sartre) in French literature and society, support his case so that he was not thrown in prison for life after endless offending as a thief and vagabond. At the end, one scarcely has any tolerance left for Genet, who used, abused and manipulated people - friends - for his own ends and who seems to have thrived on notoriety and unpredictability. A very good but frustrating read because of Genet's extreme personal flaws and his love of shock, perversity and unpredictability. One is left wondering, how much of his life was actually a grand performance wherein his writings are part of the essential detail to explain, after the event. One especially interesting detail is his adoption of revolutionary causes, starting with the Algerian revolt, the later Paris student revolt in 1968 and notably the Black Panthers in the US and the Palestinians, along with Meinhof-Bader. His unashamedly constant position on homosexuality seems at odds with this until one reflects that it was the other revolutionary cause where the revolution is actually communicated and brought about in part at least through his writings rather than through demonstrations. Surviving obscenity accusations and trials and dismissal by some as pornography, Genet's writing about causes remains an eloquent statement, on so many levels, far in advance of his time and offering much which in hindsight, predicted the future. Another aspect which comes through very strongly is Genet's extreme asceticism and lack of want of material things. Generously, he provided for many in his circus-like retinue but for himself, while he could afford much after his literary fame and success was established, he remained forever the vagabond and free spirit wandering at whim and according to interests and focus points of the moment. Finally, it is probably fortunate that he had Gallimard as his key publishers. Over the years, they developed an understanding of his modus operandi and even negated the need for Genet to have a bank account until the matter of his taxes in France necessitated this. However, tax obligations were yet another \\"official\\" duty and obligation to ignore and so, after his death, royalties had to be dedicated to back-taxes for some three years. In many ways, this was Genet's final judgment. He was French and France was still home but his blow-torch attitude to his nation and his love of being elsewhere tell an even bigger story. His final resting place was not to be in France at all but in Algeria at a place called Larache. It was another part of Genet's final judgment."},{"Title":"Genet: A Biography","review":"This is the most detailed study of Genet ever written - and it deffinately sheds some light on his character both in writing and in life.

Sullivan (Irish in the Civil War)","review":"An Irishman In The Iron Brigade, The Civil War Memoirs of James P. Sullivan...65th Wisconsin Volunteers, William Beaudot & Lance Herdegen; Fordham University Press (1993)If you've just finished reading a deplorable book, pulp it with a vengeance & then immediately commence reading the cure, AIB.The quality of the writing all around is superb. Sullivan [1843-1906], despite not having gotten far in school, was a natural writer with a great flair for self-expression & humor.As for Wisconsin politician & Army officer Benjamin Sweet: \\"He had been a state senator, & being restricted by the rules of the senate from talking them into insanity...\\"On incompetent Union Army commanders: \\"To say nothing about drunk Joe [Hooker], who had [Robert E.] Lee where he would have to fight him on his own ground or seek safety in inglorious flight. Our fellows thought Hooker did the inglorious part to perfection on that occasion.\\"And \\"Squad Drill\\" is a riot! Sullivan was given the impossible job of trying to train rookie soldiers - a German & an Irishman who could barely understand each other - how to march together with both left feet going forth simultaneously: \\"Wallschlaeger & Thomas proved to be good soldiers, & although [Thomas]...'couldn't shoot & hit a barn if he was within it...he was a divil in a charge.' \\"As for the authors... it's sadly obvious that university presses worldwide will publish practically anything.Random examples: \\"Chattanooga - A Death Grip on The Confederacy,\\" by James McDonough (University of Tennessee Press 1984); \\"Jubal, The Life & Times of General Jubal A. Early...\\" Charles Osborne (Louisiana State University Press 1992); \\"Eisenhower's Lieutenants,\\" Russell Weigley (Indiana University Press 1981); & \\"The Coming of The 3rd Reich,\\" Richard Evans (originally, Cambridge University, UK; custody of this literary Frankenstein was then awarded to Penguin Press; 2004*)...- All dreadful (& even at used-book prices, over the years, this been an expensive way to find out which of these pretenders to the pen should have been forced by court order to found an honest way to make a living).Well, Fordham University Press signed up Beaudot & Herdegen, historical writers of the absolute first rank. Their mutual ability to write with their own engaging & original style; passion for history itself; & most importantly, overall, their interest in & compassion for people as human beings - these are the reasons why AIB is so rewarding to read.And not only do they possess a good sense of humor & write well; the book is remarkably well-organized. For example, their system of locating their comprehensive & interesting footnotes at the end of each chapter is a vast improvement over the standard & cumbersome method of positioning FN explanations at the end of the book.And the living authors, two-thirds of the franchise, had luck on their side, as well. What are the odds of historians in the late 1980s, researching the life of James P. Sullivan (who died in 1906), discovering to their amazement & delight that his son, James F. Sullivan (born in 1901), was still alive & available for both interviews & as a contributor of the book's inspiring Foreword?!Yes, there are some redundancies, which might give the reader an uneasy feeling after having been exposed to all too obvious robo-cut-&-paste editing (yes, I'm curiously objecting to having to read good writing not once, but twice, which is why I'd just leave things the way they are).And the editor should have taken the liberty of breaking up some of Sullivan's paragraphs so that each runs no longer than one page each (I think that the concept of \\"new\\" paragraphs became fashionable only after the invention of manual typewriters, which Sullivan's post-war lectures may have predated. No I don't think that. Sit down. I'm pulling your leg).But my only serious objection to AIB is the indecipherable story of \\"Company K's Mule.\\" How did the repeated \\"kidnappings\\" &\\"rescues\\" of this animal result in financial windfalls?Never mind that. Let's see if the universities of Louisiana or Tennessee have any interest in publishing the just-discovered Civil War memoirs of Boo The Army Mule. Give Oxford a call, too, while you're at it.****If Cambridge University conforms to the practices of the Oxford University Press - which appears likely - this is an offering from the obituary of Charles Arnold-Baker (Telegraph, UK June 15, 2009):\\"But whereas...Dr Johnson had a team of some half-dozen copyists in the 18th century, Arnold-Baker wrote [\\"Companion to British History\\"] himself after being commissioned by the Clarendon Press at Oxford in 1960.\\"As the decades passed, he was pressed to accept the aid of young, more narrowly-educated, professional historians who refused to reveal their identities or the reasons for their criticisms - & he abandoned the project in disgust.\\"A sympathetic printer told him that being published by OUP was like going to bed with a duchess: the privilege was greater than the pleasure. \\""},{"Title":"Introduction to Criminal Justice","review":"A pretty good overview of the discipline.

Most of his novels deal with real characters from the real Wild West, and the stories offer those of us interested in it a splendidly honest account of the &quot;good men and true...humorous and happy and care-free and polite...But when it came to putting something over on them or their friends...these men were hard, and stern, tireless, loyal and grim, courageous and resourceful.&quot; Gene Rhodes knew men whose lives changed the Wild West and New Mexico, men like Pat Garrett, Senator Albert Fall, and Oliver Lee. He understood the wild land and the people who settled there but never tamed it. In this biography, author Frank M. Clark offers readers the letters that passed between Rhodes and his long-time friend, editor and publisher Charles Fletcher Lummis. Both were unusually gifted men, articulate, generous-spirited, and loyal; both knew the West and understood it in all its paradoxes and complexities. Author Clark brings Rhodes and Lummis to life in an intriguing way that makes for great reading for lovers of the West. Clark has the gift most biographers hope for: the ability to paint a generous yet honest view of his subjects. This biography is a must for every fan of the real Wild West and the true Western genre."},{"Title":"Baker Cat","review":"This is a great little book. It's almost a graphic novel, except it's a picture book--the illustrations complement the excellent story so well. I've brought this book for small-group read-aloud days at school (the pictures are too small to read to a full class). It's always a hit. And that baker is SCARY! Wish we had more of Posy Simmonds's books over here in the US."},{"Title":"Romans: A Courtroom Drama","review":"I bought this book as an after thought. I am glad I had this after thought. The book is a collection of radio broadcasts done by Mr. Westwood. I wish there were more broadcasts done today like this one. This format has some problems when being put into book form in that it is a bit repetitive. Westwood reminds the listener what had been spoken about last show, but for the person reading there is no time between one \\"broadcast\\" to the next. However, since this is the format, I can hardly turn this into a negative. I am about 3/4 of the way in and I am on the passages of Romans that deal with election. In this, he seems to be taking a Molinist point of view, but he doesn't push this envelope too strongly. This will obviously aggravate Calvinists, and to a lesser extent people who subscribe to Arminianism. He doesn't seem to have the exact formulation of Molina as he doesn't develop the actual system. He more relies on God's knowledge generally speaking. For me, this was a bit of a letdown (so far) but again I cannot fault him for this because it was based of a radio show, and who would tune in to a Molinist systematic theology?This is the brilliance of the book. He sets up the book of Romans like a courtroom where the Jews and Gentiles are being tried. This is a great way to approach Romans and helps open up the book for better understanding. He shows how both are guilty yet how both can be made innocent by Jesus' work. I would say this is a great introduction to the book of Romans, which many find to be a difficult book. It gives you a good device, the courtroom setting, to open your mind for the logical presentation that Romans is. One good way one might want to read the book is in a devotional manner. The book is set up perfectly for this. Just read on segment a day. I would highly recommend this book.

It instantly reconnects with Maryland's Prince George County's most memorable cast of characters who, for the most part, are still rich and still restless - a perfect combination for trouble and drama. Barbara, the wife of philandering millionaire Bradford Bentley, has sobered up and now takes her frustrations out in the gym instead of drowning her sorrows in Belvedere vodka. The results are fantastic - she is feeling good and looking even better. When her real-estate colleague, Noah, 15 years her junior openly flirts with her, he awakens feelings and thoughts that even the most faithful of attention-starved housewives cannot ignore. She wrestles with her feelings for both her husband, Bradford, whose womanizing ways led him to ignore and embarrass her for years by openly conducting affairs with younger women, and Noah, a handsome, attentive and sensual being, who is playing for keeps.A newcomer to Silver Lake, a one \\"Baroness Veronique,\\" befriends Barbara and plays devil's advocate to the blossoming romance between Barbara and Noah. However, it is revealed much later that this royal newcomer has ulterior motives with an interesting twist near the end of the story. The Baroness is the envy of the neighborhood after building a replica of a French chateau directly across the street from the conniving Jolene, the latest former mistress of Bradford. Jolene is a scantily clad pariah, shunned by most of Silver Lake for her involvement with Bradford. However, public scorn only fuels her desire to win back Patrick, her well-respected and admired ex-husband. She stoops low and uses their daughter Juliette in a ploy to seduce him. Patrick, however, is smitten with good-natured Pearl, the sweetheart of the neighborhood and friend to everyone. When Patrick rejects Jolene, she, in an act of desperation, retaliates against Pearl in such a mean spirited and hurtful manner that startles all of Silver Lake.There is no peace, even for the \\"nice guy\\" as lovable Patrick struggles to raise Lee, his troubled teenaged daughter from a previous relationship. Lee's half-sister, Juliette, adds gasoline to the fire when she starts to exhibit traces of Jolene (evoking a \\"Mini Me\\" persona of her man-chasing mother) when she sets her eyes on her Lee's boyfriend.Reminiscent to a daytime soap opera, the setting is posh. Everyone is beautiful, possesses an American Express Black card, drives luxury cars and wears designer attire. It seems like owning Armani suits, furs, Jimmy Choo shoes and Mikimoto pearls are an unwritten prerequisite for Silver Lake residents. Briscoe masters the storytelling aspects well by devoting alternating chapters to each main character which allows them to develop nicely while building suspense in an entertaining melodramatic offering. She adds solid doses of scandalous behavior, lying, cheating, double-crossing, and scheming to keep the pages turning until the end.Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClubNubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"Can't Get Enough: A Novel","review":"Gucci. Prada. Jimmy Choo. All the right labels adorn the black \\"new monied\\" denizens of Silver Lake in Prince George's County, Maryland. For two of these ladies, Barbara Bentley and Jolene Brown, money is of no consequence. They have luxurious homes in the north Silver Lake district, the wealthiest black enclave in the United States. Jolene is newly divorced after a scandalous affair with Barbara's husband, Bradford, the summer before, but Jolene can't let a little social humiliation get her down.Then there is Pearl Jackson, also divorced, but residing in a less tony townhouse in Silver Lake. Pearl owns her own beauty salon and is the love interest of Patrick Brown, Jolene's ex-husband. Without the financial resources of Barbara and Jolene, Pearl has no problems with priorities. Even though Jolene wants her man back, Pearl is more than enough for Patrick, although his ex-wife cannot fathom the attraction. When a new mansion is built in Silver Lake, the streets are buzzing with curiosity and rife with rumor. A huge gala is planned at the newcomer's estate to welcome virtually all of the tight-knit community. Soon everyone wants to be the best friend of the newly arrived occupant in a virulent outbreak of status-envy.From expensive hair weaves to designer duds to clandestine affairs, Briscoe whips up a froth of feminine follies, not the least of which involves a handsome hunk with dreads who has to beat the ladies off with a stick, his eyes for one woman only. And she is already married. This is upscale Maryland society at its dishiest and the author knows how to capture a moment and a man, her feisty protagonists fighting for dominance. There's a lesson for all, but especially Barbara, who finds out the hard way that \\"the devil you know is better than the one you don't\\".If there is such a thing as literate chick lit, Connie Briscoe has cornered the market, \\"Sex and the City\\" sistah style, with an excess of panache and spirit to carry off the whole crazy romp. It may not be brain surgery, but the difference is obvious: this writer isn't just name-dropping designers du jour and indiscriminate sex, she is a skillful writer with a sense of timing, interesting characterization and believable plot development.

This new resident is none other then a Baroness, and she wastes no time getting to know her neighbors.

Candidly written and expertly put together, Briscoe shows exactly why she makes a great storyteller. This book has something for everyone to love or hate, be it in the form of the self-made millionaires like the Bentleys, the do-it-yourselfers like Pearl, or the social climbers like Jolene. They all presented some very real issues to discuss, like living with and after adultery, being overweight and dating, revenge and jealousy, and blending families together. Integrating a couple more characters to the fray with a few surprise twists added just the right touch to keep me interested and reading into the night. This book could possibly stand on its own, but why spoil the fun? Read the first book also.Reviewed by Brenda M.

I expected this book to really wow me. Since the author decided to write a continuation book based on PG County, this book should have be more drama filled.

The review concerns the specific book edited by Dancy, and its worth in respect of its further contribution to understanding the Treatise.This book is to be strongly recommended as it provides a multitude of resources that contextualise, criticise, and clarify, the positions put forward by Berkeley in this work.The most substantial contribution is the extensive introduction comprised of 15 punchy sections, covering Berkeley's life, his academic heritage, and analysis of his thought (both internal and external to that given in the Treatise). Dancy is fair to Berkeley in setting forth the most robust defences of his position, and marshalling critical arguments against the Berkelian stance. This is supplemented by an extremely thorough set of endnotes that are continually present in the background of the text, offering detailed guidance whenever necessary, or desired.Additionally, the book offers a summarised concise overview of the arguments provided in the Treatise, a glossary of archaic terms(!), and a very helpful short section entitled \\"How to use this book\\" (why don't more books include this sort of thing?). There is also a manageable annotated bibliography of further reading to trail a path for academic expansion.Overall, I found that this book provided a systematic treatment of the text and provided a solid structure of support surrounding the subject. Also included, the letters between Berkeley and Johnson, provide an unexpected bonus. This book is relatively cheap, considering its breadth and depth. In my opinion, it is an ideal text through which to study (and enjoy) Berkeley's Treatise."},{"Title":"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (Oxford Philosophical Texts)","review":"This is a very important work of George Berkeley.

This book largely seeks to refute the claims made by his contemporary John Locke about the nature of human perception. Whilst, like all the Empiricist philosophers, both Locke and Berkeley agreed that there was an outside world, and it was this world which caused the ideas one has within one's mind; Berkeley sought to prove that outside world was also composed solely of ideas. Berkeley did this by suggesting that \\"Ideas can only resemble Ideas\\" - the mental ideas that we possessed could only resemble other ideas (not physical objects) and thus the external world consisted not of physical form, but rather ideas. This world was given logic and regularity by some other force, which Berkeley did his best to conclude was a God.Long refuted by most philosophers, Berkeley's claims are often felt to have been a form of rationalisation - Berkeley later became Bishop of Cloyne, and was a highly religious man. Treastise's suggestion that the world was made of ideas with an omnipitent force guiding was his alternative to the Lockean Empiricism popular at the time, which Berkeley felt led to skepticism. In spite of this Berkeley was a capable, respected and entertaining thinker. Some doubt exists as to whether he truly believed his conclusion that the world at large was composed of ideas; with modern thinking tending towards him indeed having thought this to be the case."},{"Title":"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (Oxford Philosophical Texts)","review":"This is a very important work of George Berkeley.

The arguments place the book among the most interesting on the top issues discussed in its time (empiricism, materialism, etc.)"},{"Title":"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (Oxford Philosophical Texts)","review":"Berkeley's treatise is hopelessly opportunistic and naive and cannot be taken seriously, at least insofar as it deals with mathematics and science (which it does quite extensively). I propose to prove as much by two examples.As our first example of Berkeley's childishly simplistic crusade on science we may consider his rejection of absolute space. Newton of course presented his famous bucket argument in favour of the theory of absolute space. Berkeley proposes to weasel out of this argument by redefining the concept of relative motion in a very opportunistic manner:\\"To denominate a body moved, it is requisite, first, that it change its distance or situation with regard to some other body; and secondly, that the force or action occasioning that change be applied to it.\\" (115)In Newton's theory, of course, such a separation of force and motion is impossible, since force and acceleration are interdefinable (F=ma). So apparently Berkeley has some other mysterious notion of \\"force\\" in mind, which he does not specify. All we know about Berkeley's concept of \\"force\\" is that apparently it is somehow logically prior to motion: before we can tell if an object is moving or not we must first decide if there is a \\"force\\" acting on it. Since Berkeley gives no indication of how to determine whether or not forces are present, his pseudo-definition of motion amounts to this: \\"an object is moving if and only if I, George Berkeley, self-absorbed dilettante, say so.\\"If we turn to Berkeley's discussion of geometry we again find nothing but unsubstantiated posturing. For example, Berkeley rejects infinite divisibility in favour of a sort of geometrical atomism:\\"There is no such thing as a ten-thousandth part of an inch; but there is of a mile or diameter of the earth ... The ten-thousandth part of that [one-inch] line ... is nothing at all, and consequently may be neglected without any error\\" (127).This idea, claims Berkeley, \\"at once clears the science of geometry from a great number of difficulties and contradictions ... which render the study of mathematics so difficult and tedious\\" (123). For while infinite divisibility has always been \\"thought to have so inseparable and essential an connexion with the principles and demonstrations in geometry\\" (123), this is a mistake, and, in fact, according to Berkeley, \\"whatever is useful in geometry ... doth still remain firm and unshaken on our principles\\" (131).All of this is arrogantly asserted without a trace of an argument; which is no wonder since it is such madness. Infinite divisibility is not \\"thought\\" to be essential to geometry, it plainly is so. Berkeley's rejection of this principle essentially nullifies every single geometrical proof that has ever been devised, while of course leaving us completely in the dark as to how \\"whatever is useful in geometry\\" is supposed to survive this geometrical armageddon. As an example, it is easy to see that Berkeley's claim entails the rejection of Euclid's axiom that a line is determined by two points: consider an equilateral triangle ABC with sides that are divisible into ten thousand parts; now take a line segment DE that is not divisible into ten thousand parts and place it parallel to the base AB and touching the other sides AC and BC; now divide AB into ten thousand parts and let F and G be two points one ten-thousandth apart; then, according to Berkeley, since DE is not divisible into such parts, the lines FC and GC both go through the same point H of DE; thus the points C and H do not uniquely determine a line."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Paton's Cry, The Beloved Country","review":"I am an English teacher and a book lover to the extreme. I use cliff notes in my class to aid students with ideas and concepts in books that might otherwise be lost on them. I like the fact that the summaries are limited on this particular version, so the students are forced to read and reread to comprehend. The book itself is one of the most beautiful, well-written, symbolic books that I have ever read. I suggest using it in a unit on South Africa, apartheid/segregation, racism, Black History, or perhaps as a tool on train-of-thought writing. The book is for mature readers--average or immature students will find the book \\"boring\\" because they are unable to comprehend the depth and meaning of the novel.

The following chapters embrace each of the highlighted hues (i.e. racy reds, shocking pink and purple, cool blues, and modern greens), and the final two chapters address practical issues like how to have a harmonious multi-color palette in one room and fast fixes for color-gone-wrong.Two items make this book a winner:1. Lynch's suggestions on how to tie things together, how to open up a room, and even how to make a space cozy.2. The photographs are amazing! Her words are brought to life with the photos that highlight how to make colors and spaces work.With Lynch's book under my belt as research, I felt confident in picking colors that were bold and still complementary to one another."},{"Title":"The Japanese Economy","review":"This is an economics textbook, not a journalistic report. It gives detailed and sophisticated explanations of how the Japanese economy functions. Often these differ from their American counterparts, especially in such areas as the financial markets and labor practices. The quality of Ito's explanations is such that this book was the gold standard for informed readers who wanted to get beyond the deluge of pop books written during the Bubble Economy (1985-1991: like Clyde Prestowit's \\"Trading Places\\" or James Fallow's \\"Looking at the Sun\\").However--this book was published in 1991, at the very end of the Bubble, and it shows. The Japanese economy has changed in important ways since then. For example, the bad debt crisis and the \\"big bang\\" financial reforms have changed the financial system significantly. Because of when it was written, it could not address the ongoing shift of Japanese industry to factories in China, and in a broader context, the \\"de-industrialization\\" of Japan (much like what happened to the US when industry went to Japan in the 1970s and 1980s).Overall, this is the kind of book that a serious library absolutely needs, but which interested readers should borrow rather than buy. Unless, of course, you are a specialist in Japanese economic history--but then you (like me) already have it on your shelf. :)"},{"Title":"Forex for Small Speculators","review":"This book was my first introduction to forex trading. I needed something I could wrap my mind around, that would give me the basic information, without going overboard. This book did just that. Written by an actual trader, it proved useful to me to understand the terminology, how to get started, as well as what kind of mindset I will need to have in order to succeed. From my experiences in trading stocks and futures I learned a long time ago not to look for a holy grail. Just give me good solid information on what it is I am dealing with and I can handle the rest. This is what this book did for me!

On the other hand, a good editor should have recommended against it being published in the first place.My advice to the small speculator is to make a list of all of the other readily available books on the subject of Forex trading. Once you have done so, put on a blindfold and then throw a dart at your list of books. Purchase whatever book the dart hits.

But the thief-murderer duo are apprehended long before the end, and the last part is his rather mundane account of how the jewels were stolen in India and life at the prison on the Andaman Islands. There's actually very little &quot;mystery&quot; or detection to it, since we know who the thief-murderer are early on. The boat chase on the Thames is not especially interesting or convincing, nor is the romance between Dr. Watson and the pretty client. What saves this is the almost palpable atmosphere of London in the time of Jack the Ripper, plus the outrageous conclusions drawn by Sherlock Holmes."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"As the second full-length story of Doyle's Holmes series, this book is a classic. It lacks the landmark status of A Study in Scarlet and the overall drama of The Hound of the Baskervilles, but nevertheless is a must-read for all Holmes fans and is strongly recommended to fans of detective fiction. The crime scene is a classic -- &quot;Watson, when you have eliminated all other possibilities, the remaining possibility, no matter how seemingly improbable, is nevertheless likely&quot;.... or something like that.While A Study in Scarlet deals rather unmercifully with the Mormon colony in Utah, A Sign of Four presents what would now be considered a strikingly politically incorrect perspective on India. It's an historically interesting British viewpoint from late in the last century.Whether you read a public copy or get it from the University of Virginia on-line archive, I strongly recommend A Sign of Four. It's a quick read, and certainly a better option for spare time than Holmes' seven percent solution."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"Published in 1890, \\"The Sign of Four\\" was Doyle's second work, featuring the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes. The first chapter is appropriately titled \\"The Science of Deduction\\", and serves as a wonderful introduction to the enigmatic man and his methods. Holmes asserts that there are \\"three qualities necessary for the ideal detective\\", namely knowledge, the power of observation, and the power of deduction. Holmes' abilities at observation are superb, as evidenced by some of the books he's produced on obscure topics like the tracing of footsteps, the influence of a trade on the form of a hand, or the enumeration of 140 forms of cigar, cigarette and pipe tobacco ash. He is careful to distinguish mere observation from clear deductive reasoning, and it is the latter which really is the essence of Holmes. To him the only thing that is important is \\"the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes\\" by which he unravels a case. Already in the opening, he demonstrates his powers of deduction by coming to stunning and perfectly logical conclusions about Watson's brother, merely by seeing his watch. What is obscure to everyone, is of course perfectly obvious to Holmes: \\"so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous.\\" He is the epitomy of deduction and cold hard reason.While Holmes is the embodiment of reason, Watson is the embodiment of emotion. Holmes is naturally critical of the emotional and romantic streak in Watson. \\"Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner.\\" When Watson comments on the attractiveness of Holmes' client, he replies \\"Is she? I did not observe.\\" Completely deprived of emotion, he looks not at beauty, but at cold hard facts. \\"It is of the first importance not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities ... The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning.\\" In this story Watson finds himself a wife, something Holmes would never consider: \\"...love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\\" Fortunately we need not share Holme's cold and emotionless tastes to love him, because we are involved in the story through the first person narrative of Watson, who has more than enough emotion and romance to make up for what Holmes lacks. Watson is a brilliant literary device for Doyle, because it enables us to portray Holmes with his cold logic without having to identify with him. Instead we identify with Watson as passive observers and view Holmes himself as a curious object to be marvelled at.We need not identify with Holmes to appreciate his passion for deduction. In \\"The Sign of Four\\" Holmes applies his powers of deduction to a remarkable case involving Mary Morstan, whose father disappeared under mysterious circumstances some ten years earlier. Investigation uncovers the facts of his death, and the suprising discovery that he has bequeathed her a tremendous treasure. The plot thickens as the treasure disappears along with a classic locked-room murder mystery. Mysterious notes with \\"The Sign of Four\\" seem to be the only clue to the mystery. Of course only Holmes can and does unravel the mystery, even when all the other police detectives are desperately misled by both clues and lack of reason. As usual Holmes will cooperate with them, but only on his terms: \\"You are welcome to all the official credit, but you must act on the lines that I point out.\\"As with \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", we're again introduced to the elements that typify a Sherlock Holmes story. Holmes utilizes \\"the unofficial force - the Baker Street irregulars\\" to help him. They consist of a dozen dirty and ragged little street Arabs, whom Holmes pays in return for information gleaned from the streets. \\"They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear everyone.\\" Holmes also utilizes the power of disguise, which he expertly uses to even pull the wool over the eyes of his companion Watson. But \\"The Sign of Four\\" also gives a glimpse of Holmes' weakness - an addiction to morphine and cocaine. The justification is that he only resorts to the use of drugs when he is not busy with a case. \\"My mind rebels at stagnatism.\\" \\"Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brainwork.\\" He much prefers the mental challenge of a case \\"...it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine.\\" But just as Holme's intellectual brilliance stimulates himself, so it stimulates the reader. In the process of his deductions, he evidences an astute understanding of people, articulating gems like this: \\"The chief proof of man's real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness.\\" On carefully asking people the right questions: \\"The main thing with people of that sort is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do they will instantly shut up like an oyster.\\" On women: \\"Women are never to be entirely trusted - not the best of them.\\" And as with most mysteries, as readers we are reminded of what lengths the passions of greed and revenge will go in corrupting human behaviour.As in all the Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes himself unquestionably emerges the hero. However, Doyle had not yet perfected the Sherlock Holmes formula, because in the lengthy extended flashback of the final chapter as the murderer describes his story Holmes himself falls to the background. The truth is, we want more of Holmes and his deduction, and that's what Doyle perfected in his later short stories. But if deduction is indeed a science as Holmes believes, then he himself is its greatest scientist, and there are few pleasures greater than seeing this enigmatic scientist at work in the laboratory of life. -GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"Timson is an able interpreter of these beloved tales.

Sure, it is old (over 100 years, in fact) but, being Holmes, it will always be as fresh and exciting as it was the day it was released. Although all the Holmes stories are great, and you will have a good time reading any of them, I reccommend reading the books in chronological order (this can be conveniently done with the omnibus The Complete Sherlock Holmes), it will only serve to make you like the stories even more.Anyways, this is the second Holmes story, and it is a page-turner, full of suspense. Also, it delivers the kind of intrigue and &quot;how did he know that! &quot; disbelief that only a Sherlock Holmes story can generate. It is because of this, and the stunning detail in which he is described throughout the 60 Holmes stories, that the hardcore readers of the Holmes stories cannont alltogether accept him as fictional. No character in the history of fiction has ever been more real to his readers, and none ever will be. Many Holmes fans have been known to feel remorse, even sadness upon visiting the Rickenback Fall (where Doyle originally tried to kill Holmes). That may sound fanciful, but indulge yourself in the 60 Holmes stories (including this one-one of the best) and see if you fall into that category."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"In 1890, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published \\"The Sign of Four\\", his second work featuring the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his trusted associate, Dr. Watson. The tale begins with a bored Holmes wallowing in cocaine before a young woman named Mary Morstan turns up at 221B Baker Street with an irresistible mystery. Her father mysteriously disappeared several years earlier, but for the last six years she has received a pearl from an anonymous source. However, that gift comes into question when she receives a summons to find out what happened to her father.Morstan engages in the help of Holmes and Watson, and the three meet Thaddeus Sholto, a man who is taking great pains to keep secret his dealings with Captain Morstan. As the group reaches the house of Thaddeus's twin brother Bartholomew, they come upon a terrible scene: Bartholomew is dead, and a mysterious treasure is missing. Scotland Yard is quick to make arrests, but Sherlock Holmes is convinced that they are wrong.What follows is an extraordinary tale involving the British Empire in India, an extremely short cannibal, a treasure box full of precious stones, double-dealing, a man with a wooden leg, and a steam ship that has seemingly disappeared into thin air. Will Holmes find his man in time? How do all of the events relate to Miss Morstan's father? And where exactly is this treasure everyone is preoccupied with?In \\"The Sign of Four\\", Doyle once again creates a mystery that is worthy of the great Sherlock Holmes.

But Doyle again tacked on a long, tedious flashback under the guise of the villain \\"telling his story,\\" which I skipped most of.

This book, more than A Study in Scarlet, sets the stage for the Holmes and Watson sagas to come."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"It is uncanny how the Hound of the Baskervilles remains so popular while The Sign of Four and the Valley of Fear lay somewhat forgotten. I find it especially odd because these three novels parallel each other in content, yet the Hound of the Baskervilles remains the most famous. The Sign of Four reads like an action novel and the plot is completely original-and yet it reads as well as The Hound, it has as much action as The Hound, but it is not as famous as The Hound.Either way, it is a book that absorbs the reader with death, crime, and treachery that only Holmes himself could solve. It begins mysteriously enough, and holds that position well throughout the novel as Holmes realizes that his adversary is much more than just a simple sailor (He's not even sure he's a real man!).If you liked The Hound, you'll be equally impressed with The Sign of Four"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"The Sherlock Holmes is really a lucky star, who brings fortune and happiness to everyone.

This was my first foray into the hailed world of Doyle - and oh, what a disappointing trip. I plan to try again, perhaps with some of his short stories, but I just pray that &quot;The Sign of Four&quot; is a not a prime example of Doyle's finer works."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"The Sign of the Four marks the second trip I have taken with the famed detective Sherlock Holmes, but the first written by Arthur Conan Doyle, the first being Caleb Carr's 'The Italian Secretary'.Doyle's Holmes, as described by his faithful companion and chronicler of his extraordinary accumen with detection, Dr. John Watson, is a cocaine-using enigma of a man, unable to 'rest' unless his keen analytical skills are being taxed to their fullest. Holmes himself admits that the greatest unease he feels comes with inactivity.This feeling of malaise is ended by the arrival of a young woman, Mary Morstan, who has been made aware that a great 'wrong' has been done to her, regarding the death of her father and a certain treasure that has lied in wait for many years while the 'rightful owners' have been imprisoned for their efforts.Holmes and Watson immediately take up the case, and are hot on the trail of the missing treasure. A locked room in which a corpse awaits them, with no seeming manner of entry to have allowed the killer in, marks the start of their trail to find the murderer and recover the missing treasure.Sherlock Holmes, known the world over (to readers) for over a century now is in fine form as he hunts down the perpetrator(s) of this crime, and works to restore the treasure to Mary Morstan that her father acquired before his untimely death. While this is perhaps not the most 'thrilling' novel I have ever read, it is nevertheless an entertaining work of fiction from one of the most clever minds that ever put pen to paper.A fine introduction for myself into the works of the true creator of Sherlock Holmes, this novel serves as an enticement to read the other Holmes escapades in the future."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"A young woman visits Holmes and Watson, relating the story of her missing father. This leads one of the most famous partnerships in literature into a strange case involving treasure, murder, and betrayal. As he did in the previous novel of the series, Arthur Conan Doyle tells two stories. One is the tale of Holmes, Watson, and the unraveling of the case. The other is the flashback to the story of the main villain, an adventure tale involving a native mutiny against colonial masters. As a product of his time, Doyle cannot, I suppose, help being sympathetic to the colonialists and there is an undercurrent of racism that can be troubling to modern eyes. However, it is encouraging to note that not a single racist sentiment (that I can recall) is attributed to either Holmes or Watson. This is a fine mystery that benefits from the strong evocation of fog-bound Victorian London."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"The Sign of Four, by A. Conan DoyleThis story begins with Dr. Watson advising Sherlock Holmes against dabbling with drugs because of the long-term dangers. Holmes observes a watch and deduces the habits of the previous owner. Miss Mary Morstan visits with her problem. Her father disappeared ten years earlier. For the last six years she received a large pearl in the mail. Now she received a letter telling her she was wronged and asking for a meeting. Holmes and Watson will accompany her. Their carriage arrives at a house in a new terrace. They meet Thaddeus Sholto, one of the sons of Major Sholto, the best friend of Mary Morstan's father Captain Sholto. Thaddeus tells why what he knows about the story. His brother Bartholomew discovered the hidden treasure. When they arrive they find Bartholomew murdered in a locked room and the treasure missing! The police are called. They arrest Thaddeus and the servants as accomplices.Sherlock Holmes borrowed a dog to follow the scent of the small man who stepped in creosote. They follow the scent to the water's edge; they look around and find information. Holmes sends the Baker Street Irregulars to search for the missing steam launch. Holmes himself locates the \`Aurora', and the police launch later chases it downstream in a wild chase. Holmes and Watson shoot the Andaman islander, then Jonathan Small is captured with the treasure chest. Watson gained a treasure (Chapter 11). Small tells about the Agra treasure from the time of the India Mutiny, and has the last laugh (Chapter 12).The story about the Agra fort and the mutiny shows the attitudes of the English public. The English conquered India for its loot, just as in other wars. But the Four decided to enrich themselves and follow the example set by the royal rulers, English or Indian. A double-dealing rajah straddled the conflict and split his assets; it failed because of others who took advantage of their position. But their plan failed because of an unforeseen watcher. The Four who killed for riches were swindled out of their fortune by a clever liar who took advantage of his position. Was Doyle mocking the English system of purchased offices in his story of Sholto and Morstan?"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"Despite some very compelling moments and the, of course, wonderful premise and characters, I've never found \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" to be very satisfying. The little novel just loses course for too long in the American part of the narrative, leaving behind our stars, and the ending is a but much of a deus ex machina for me. I remember the first time I read it thinking, \\"If it began this poorly, how did Sherlock Holmes ever become as popular as he did?\\" The answer is that Doyle didn't go wrong for long. The Sign of Four is a wonderful mystery, deepening the characters substantially and providing an atmospheric and exciting adventure.Basically, Holmes and Watson are visited by an attractive woman, Miss Morstan, whose father had once disappeared in mysterious circumstances. Then, years later, she begins to receive letters and gifts from a benefactor. When that benefactor hints at some knowledge of her father's ending and promise her justice if she will come to meet him, Miss Morstan seeks out the great detective to help her decide what has happened and what she should do. So, things don't begin with murder, but they quickly get there. This is a pretty fascinating Victorian tale, featuring the depths of London, lost treasure from India, eccentric old treasure hunters, and chases through the streets and waterways of London.I really enjoyed the further characterization of Holmes, as we learn of his depression and of his reliance, in the face of boredom, on cocaine. We also get to see more of Holmes's network of communicants in London and of his peculiar way of handing and mixing with people. I enjoyed, too, the contrast between Watson, as the good doctor is falling in love, and the cynical Holmes. And the plot is moody, mysterious, and chilling. This is a very good read, definitely, to my mind at least, the work that really started the Sherlock Holmes series to rolling."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"The Sign of Four- DoyleAudio version performed by Michael Page4 starsThis story was Conan Doyle's second novella featuring the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. It was published two years following A Study in Scarlet. The story introduces many of the defining elements of a Holmes and Watson adventure, including Holmes' drug addiction and Watson's love affair with the female lead. The plot involves a lost treasure, a peg-legged ex-convict, a pigmy with a blow gun and a river boat chase scene. There is a lot of action packed in less than 100 pages. Overall this is not my favorite Holmes story. From a 21st century stand point this is one of the most politically incorrect stories in the collection. And although that is only to be expected for the time period, it makes this one less enjoyable for me. I also think that Doyle's style and story telling improved as he tightened up the adventures and made the stories even shorter. However, it must be said that this story has some of Doyle's most colorful characters. Michael Page did a great job bring the whole motley crew to life. This was a fun, quick book to listen to while running errands in the car.There's a very interesting bit of trivia concerning this story. Doyle was commissioned to write this story at a dinner with the editor, James M. Stoddart. At the same dinner, Stoddard commissioned Oscar Wilde to write The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"One of the best stories in the Sherlock Holmes series and full of action. Highly recommended. The scan is not the best but it's great for the price."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"First of all this is a wonderful story and the second in the Holmes canon. This not a short story but a novel, actually the second novel (total of 4 novels) with the other 50+ stories being short stories. This ideally should be read second, afterA Study in Scarlet (Sherlock Holmes Vol. 1)(where Watson and Holmes meet). Sign of Four is where Watson meets his wife but that is not the focus of the strory. After reading The Sign of Four, and assuming you are still into reading SH, and you will be, your next book should ideally be the short stories in theThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. This is the order in which they were written and the character introduced to readers in the late 19th century.This work is a real page turner with 12 chapters - the 12th and final chapter takes up almost 25% of the novel and is the back story which shows the motivation and context for the crime - much like part 2 in Study in Scarlet. The story begins by introducing us to Holmes between cases, where he may sit around all day, everyday, injecting himself with his 7% solution of cocaine to pass the time. Yes, cocaine was legal back then and even Freud prescribed it to patients and used it himself - no wonder he was obsessed with sex. Of course once a case comes his way he no longer needs cocaine or morphine to pass the time and becomes energized unravelling subtle clues missed by Scotland Yard's best. Here is an excerpt...\\"My mind,\\" he said, \\"rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession,--or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.\\" \\"The only unofficial detective?\\" I said, raising my eyebrows. \\"The only unofficial consulting detective,\\" he answered. \\"I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection...\\"Regarding this Kindle edition three points. 1) It is well formatted 2) there are NO illustrations in this free version and 3) 'on my Kindle' you cannot 'Go To' the Table of contents directly but there is a TOC. However, once at the TOC page there are no usable links to each chapter but strangely there are links to each chapter on the Kindle app for both my Mac and my iPhone but I read this story on my new Kindle. No big deal just useful to know but you can't beat the price. Wonderful read!!!"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"Those responsible for this edition of one of Doyle's great creations of detective fiction have done a yeoman's work. They can justly take considerable pride in their efforts. Bravo and thank you!"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"Read: 5/09, 8/10, 6/11Rate: 5/55/09: The Sign of Four is the second book, after A Study in Scarlet, featuring Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. John Watson. There are new changes that would set the tone for many later adventures. One interesting change occurs to Dr. Watson, as we learned in the first book, is that the war wound has been relocated from the shoulder to the leg. I know Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a brilliant writer, but I find this oddity perplexing. At the end of the story, Dr. Watson undergoes a life-changing event which I had, like his friend Sherlock Holmes, hoped that wouldn't occur. The tale of The Sign of Four is as thrilling as the one of A Study in Scarlet, and this time, the author makes improvements in how he presented the story. I complained of the first book being less thorough for an experience of being there for the reader due to the lack of sleuthing details, but in The Sign of Four, the author almost makes it entirely possible for the reader to actually think what the best course of action would be and which suggestion is the best possible before application. In other words, The Sign of Four is a real thinking man's mystery adventure. Again, there is a ton of wisdom contained within the lines that are quite useful for anyone. I found two quotes in the story that struck me the best parts of the book. One is Sherlock's instance of disallowing emotion to be factored in the equation by stating, \\"I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule.\\" Another is quite true when Sherlock offers a political advice, \\"The main thing with people of that sort is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you.\\" In both tales, the motives are quite similar in the manner of Edmond Dantes, but in A Study in Scarlet was vengeance for a loved one while in The Sign of Four for a robbed treasure after an act of betrayal. When the chase is on in Chapter 10 of The Sign of Four, that's when the excitement sets in &agrave; la Patriot Games with Harrison Ford and Sean Bean. As Jonathan Small relates his tale of misfortune, I was left off the track when he failed to mention the fate of the other three men after the realization of the betrayal and also the life-saving of Tonga. The most disappointing moment, as it occurs in the beginning and also in the end of The Sign of Four, is Sherlock Holmes' cocaine addiction. I understand that this shooting up business of Sherlock happened in the latter part of the nineteenth century when its dangers weren't well-known. I am positive that it would be a very despondent moment when a kid says \\"But Sherlock Holmes did it\\" as an excuse. All in all, The Sign of Four is another thrilling tale of the Sherlock Holmes stories and promises more of the same in other works.8/10: Following A Study in Scarlet comes in with The Sign of Four, another brilliant detective tale. That boat ride in the end is so engrossing and captivating that I immediately thought of the one with Harrison Ford and Sean Bean in Patriot Games. It's just so exactly like that. The way Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are upon the scent of a gang of thieves is just thrilling as ever. The whole tale just speaks of volumes of how truly great these Sherlock Holmes tales promise to be, and remember that The Sign of Four is only the second adventure of many written. Probably the most distressing moment is when Sherlock Holmes is a cocaine addict. It's probable that by then, cocaine wasn't widely understood as a dangerous stimulant (not a narcotic as widely falsely portrayed as). Then again, I can see why many aren't introduced to the great detective in schools as these stories deserve a critical attention in terms of logic and critical reasoning. The way he reasons is brilliant and highly sensible. It is actually widely employed by people of all professions because it's how doctors, lawyers, scientists and mathematicians go by their work. I would love this revelation to be made to these kids at a young age and show them how people actually should think and perform. The story of The Sign of Four is so well-written as ever as other of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. All in all, enjoy every word of the tale of The Sign of Four, and you will be delighted once again when you finish it and move onto The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.6/12: I consider The Sign of Four to be the better story than A Study in Scarlet, and that thrilling boat chase will always be the most anticipated moment. When it happens, the whole thing really takes off at another level. Then, I knew that I was in for more thrilling stories to come. How weird that Watson's war injury had been shifted from the shoulder to his leg. What was the reason for it? It is true when Sherlock remarked, \\"Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.\\" Only the fantastic cases will be easier to solve since they stand out a little bit too much and have more details to offer to be readily cleared up if an outside of the box thinking is applied. Another is, \\"The main thing with people of that sort is never let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you.\\" The funniest scene is when the pretended merchant seaman came to Holmes' quarters and proclaimed, \\"Yes. I knows well where it is. An' I knows where the men he is after are. An' I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it.\\" Silly moment. All in all, The Sign of Four is among masterpieces in English literature."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"The story leaves a little to be desired, but the reading is wonderful.

I guess they will be even married in the next story.The case wasn't that interesting for me, but I liked how Sherlock and Watson managed to resolve it."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"The Sign of the Four, originally published in 1890, is the second Sherlock Holmes novel written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Following his successful resolution of the case of A Study in Scarlet, London's most ingenious detective is consulted by Mary Morstan, a young woman whose father had vanished years before. Since his disappearance, an unknown benefactor has been sending her a valuable pearl each year. Having received a note from the mysterious personage asking to meet her that evening, she invites Holmes and Watson to accompany her to the rendezvous. It soon becomes apparent that the disappearance of Ms. Morstan's father is somehow related to his military service in the Andaman Islands, a penal colony located between India and Burma.When compared to many of the Sherlock Holmes adventures, the actual crime that takes place in the book is not particularly mysterious. Many secrets are revealed early, and the guilty parties are determined midway through the book. All that remains is to track them down. The final chapter, in which the apprehended villain reveals a most engaging back story, does much to redeem the book as a whole. Although Sherlock Holmes is considered the quintessential literary detective, one must keep in mind that at the time this book was written the mystery genre was yet in its infancy, and Conan Doyle was still experimenting in style and form. This book represents an embryonic stage towards what we recognize today as the typical structure of a mystery novel, in which clues are doled out over the course of the narrative, in preparation for the big reveal at the end. As in A Study in Scarlet, the unconventional structure of The Sign of the Four is actually quite refreshing when compared to some of the later, more formulaic Holmes stories.Though the mechanics of mystery may be a bit awkward in this early effort, Conan Doyle's excellent writing still shines through. This book goes a long way in developing the Holmes mythos, the relationship between the two principal characters, and the personality quirks of each. In the opening scene Holmes's cocaine habit is revealed, and over the course of the book Watson finds romance. The true value of the Holmes mysteries lies not in the unusual crimes depicted or the deductive reasoning employed in solving them, but rather in the inimitable characters of Holmes and Watson themselves. Though most of Holmes's adventures were written in the form of short stories, it is in the longer form of the novel that Conan Doyle really excels, as it gives him the opportunity to explore these exceptional characters further. The Sign of the Four is a classic work of detective fiction and a must-read for any Holmes fan."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"This e-book was vintage Holmes and I can highly recommend this read to any mystery lover who wishes to be entertained by one of his hunts."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"I love Holmes, but this novel (the second featuring Holmes) is just so-so for me. The story - a tale of colonial treasure and greed causing mayhem in England - falls flat for me, especially when the action since most of the action takes place in the form of lengthy reminiscences of events long past. There's a little too much Victorian-style exotica/adventure and too little detecting for my taste. Cut away about half the window dressing (preferably the half with the murderous pigmy native and his poison darts) and I'd have enjoyed it a lot more."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"The Sign of Four, by A.

In this story a young lady named Mary Morstan comes to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to help he solve a mystery. She had been receiving letters with pearls in side them every year for the past six years. They go with her to a man's house where he tells them of a treasure that she should rightly inherit from her dead father. When they go to a different where the treasure was they find a man killed and the treasure gone. Holmes goes on a chase to retrieve the treasure which they find the empty box that it was in. This book is good because it is suspenseful.The way that the characters act is good because it adds to the suspense of the story. The book doesn't explain about what Sherlock Holmes is doing when he left. You keep on reading about Watson until Homes returns. Later, when they are racing to keep up with the other boat they have delays. They will get so close to catching them, and then have to swerve to get out of the way of a barge the gets between them. The author uses these things to keep readers interested throughout the book.The way that the crime occurred in this book was so complex that Holmes almost didn't catch the person. The last chapter of the book was the longest and the whole chapter was about Jonathan Small explaining how he did it and what his reasons were. The main part of the story didn't explain what the great Agra Treasure was and where it came from. First Jonathan escaped with Tonga's help in his little boat. They came and took the treasure and hid in the docks to try to hide the boat for their escape. Then they were caught but, Jonathan had time to throw the treasure all over the river.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle makes all of his descriptions of people and scenes vivid. When they see the dead man he describes his face as pale as the moonlight on a cold winter's eve. He uses similes and metaphors well in good places to help describe important things. Different places like the dock and the city make me visualize a place bustling with activity. The author does a good job at describing places so that readers can understand the story.This book is good because it is very descriptive and vivid. The characters and places are unique and have the own personal characteristics. They add to the suspense in the plot making the book and exciting read. Some of the vocabulary is tough, but it makes it a good form of literature. I would recommend this book to anyone.(...)"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"Great, very good quality. packaging is good.

The police are called. They arrest Thaddeus and the servants as accomplices.Sherlock Holmes borrowed a dog to follow the scent of the small man who stepped in creosote. They follow the scent to the water's edge; they look around and find information. Holmes sends the Baker Street Irregulars to search for the missing steam launch. Holmes himself locates the \`Aurora', and the police launch later chases it downstream in a wild chase. Holmes and Watson shoot the Andaman islander, then Jonathan Small is captured with the treasure chest. Watson gained a treasure (Chapter 11). Small tells about the Agra treasure from the time of the India Mutiny, and has the last laugh (Chapter 12).The story about the Agra fort and the mutiny shows the attitudes of the English public. The English conquered India for its loot, just as in other wars. But the Four decided to enrich themselves and follow the example set by the royal rulers, English or Indian. A double-dealing rajah straddled the conflict and split his assets; it failed because of others who took advantage of their position. But their plan failed because of an unforeseen watcher. The Four who killed for riches were swindled out of their fortune by a clever liar who took advantage of his position. Was Doyle mocking the English system of purchased offices in his story of Sholto and Morstan?"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"I have not long completed \\"A Study In Scarlet\\" which was Doyle's first jump into the world of Sherlock Holmes, and it was a jump I thoroughly enjoyed. Now, after just finishing \\"The Sign Of Four\\", I am now set in my convictions to make sure I read every single Holmes adventure written by Doyle. This is a longer and, indeed, more complex case than \\"A Study In Scarlet\\" yet the writing style takes a slightly different approach as it remains focused on the investigation of Holmes & Watson rather than split into two the story to try and explain the motive behind the investigated crime.The skills of Holmes this time are called upon by a young woman of the name of Mary Morstan who tells Holmes of her father's disappearance four years ago and then a mysterious appearance of yearly gifts which started to arrive four years ago. This leads them unexpectedly to the scene of shocking murder which reaches to the depths of far off India and the investigation is engaged upon with the help of a stereotypical detective, a gang of street Arabs and the keen nose of a canine.There are some fantastic aspects to this piece of Holmes fiction compared to his first outing. Still told from the perspective of Watson it touches upon the most interesting aspect of Holmes' personality that being his inherent drug use. This seemingly large flaw in what appears to be a man with an almost perfect skill is something that makes the character all the more human. It also gives a brief look towards the end of the story as to Holmes' perspective on emotional affairs such as love which he sees as opposite to truth and reason.This is another fantastic Holmes investigation and just makes me anticipate the further stories that I will delve into. For those not familiar with the Holmes stories, I strongly recommend that you begin your quest with the fantastic \\"A Study In Scarlet\\" and then move swiftly onto this as it is truly a gem of class English literature."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"In this second novel of Sherlock Holmes's Dr John Watson continues introducing the world to the singular methods of his strange friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.He starts the book with a study in deduction, looses his temper, and then cools down at Holmes's explanations. Then a singular customer appears in the stage with a strange case. This case leads to a terrific murder with outlandish murderers.As usual, Watson, as dumb as a frog, cannot see a thing that his friend Holmes, as cleaver as a fox, can spot so easily.The story here is a bit slow, especially in the capture of the villains, but it ends in a thrilling manhunt, and then in an unearthly account of the major villain.This novel, in my opinion, is the best Sherlock Holmes's ever written by Doyle. I think any Holmes's fan must read it."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"This was my first time to enter into the world of Sherlock Holmes and I was impressed. Not only are we allowed to glimpse 19th century England, but we are priviledged to undertake a classic mystery. Sherlock Holmes astounds with his reasoning and thought processes. I was also surprised to learn that Sherlock Holmes was a user of both cocaine and heroin. This was a bit saddening in that it makes the unflappable Sherlock...well, human.If you are a lover of classic mysteries, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"This is a story of a mystery which seemed impossible to solve. I really enjoyed the language and vocabulary. I enjoyed this book from the first chapter to the last. It's a real page turner! See if you can use the art of deduction as he does!

I'm sure he'll be the popular author on your shelf!"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"I really enjoyed this book its great for when your reading at night or at work (or when ever you get a chance to read:D) and best of all its free, so you cant go wrong, after all it is Sherlock Holmes!"},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"A fabulous treasure dogged by murder. A trans-racial oath of loyalty. A greedy major, a cannibal pigmy, and a peg-legged convict. Mix in a pig-headed police investigator and a brilliant-but-flawed amateur detective, and you have the makings of a first-class mystery.Miss Mary Morstan, the recipient of yearly gifts of pearls from an anonymous benefactor, receives a summons declaring her a wronged woman and promising riches if she replies. She enlists the aid of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, and finds herself in the middle of a locked-room murder mystery. If the mystery can only be solved, she will become the richest woman in England.Holmes, in a virtuoso performance, solves the murder, finds the missing treasure, brings the killer to justice, and learns the strange tale of &quot;The Four.&quot; Did I mention that Dr. Watson winds up married to Miss Morstan?The format of this sequel to &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; follows basically the same pattern as the original Sherlock Holmes story. Holmes visits the scene of a baffling murder, draws amazing conclusions from his inspection of the scene, and relentlessly tracks down the villian, who then tells his story and turns out to be not such a bad guy after all.I first read &quot;Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Sign&quot; as a pre-teenager, and they made an indelible impression on me. In my job I frequently visit murder scenes, and I believe that these two books are what have influenced me to perform inspections outside the crimescene tape.An earlier reviewer remarked on Doyle's &quot;politically incorrect&quot; view of India. &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; was written at the turn of the 19th century. We live in the 21st. We probably won't measure up to the 23rd century's yardstick for &quot;political correctness&quot; either."},{"Title":"The Sign of the Four","review":"The problem with literature that has been around so long is that any copyrights have expired so virtually anyone can republish it.

The only thing I would change is the size. It's quite a big calendar, which is great if you have allot of space.

I have read eight of Howarth's books and they are all fine reads. This is no different. Howarth details the life of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern day Saudi Arabia. Saud's sons still rule Saudi Arabia today. Even though this book was written in the sixties, Howarth details the reactionaries that influence the politics of Saudi Arabia today. Ibn Saud embraced a form of puritanical Islam (Wahhabi) and spread it through those parts of Arabia he conquered. Bin Laden embraces this form of Islam now, and you can see the problems it has caused.One chapter I was especially interested in was the terror these reactionary forms of Islam tolerates. The Wahhabis raided settlements in Iraq and Trans-Jordan in the twenties killing men, women, and children and stealing their property because they were &quot;infidels&quot;. Those they killed were fellow Moslem breathren. However because they did not embrace the Wahhabi form, they were infidels and ripe to be killed. I guess Bin Laden is just following in the footsteps of his forefathers.An interesting read about an interesting man. This book explains a lot about the present day problems with Saud's Arabia."},{"Title":"The desert king: A life of Ibn Saud","review":"An accurate and very interesting account into the history and culture of Arabia and its Bedouin warrior King pre and post oil discovery. The book profiles the personality, the mind, the strength and the vision of the founder and monarch of Saudi Arabia, as well as his sons and heirs, one of which brought the country into the 20th Century. Interested readers are given an insite into the rapid evolution of the country from ancient and historical lifestyle of the Bedouin culture to modern day progression."},{"Title":"Old Indian Days","review":"Heard about this author by watching \\"Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee\\" and loved it.

The book opens in London during the early days of the First World War, as young Letty Edgington meets Ollie Hobbs, a soldier who has been wounded on the French battlefield. Letty and Oliver fall in love and, despite their very different socioeconomic backgrounds and the objections of their families, the couple decide to wed. The novel follows the story of their marriage over the succeeding decades, through good times and bad.Pemberton invests his characters with real humanity, presenting them as living, breathing, feeling individuals. No one of them is all good or all bad, and he succeeds in finding redemptive qualities in even those people who at first glance would seem completely unlikeable. Pemberton delves deep into their minds and souls of Letty, Ollie, their family and friends, revealing what motivates their actions, giving us a real understanding of who they are.One of the most striking sections of Our Family is the portions set during World War II. I am Jewish, and I also minored in History in college. So I had some knowledge of certain events of the War. But I never really understood the horrors experienced on the Home Front in Britain until now. Pemberton's depiction of the Hobbs family's struggles to endure through five long years of almost-daily air raids by the Nazi Luftwaffe and subsequent rocket attacks on London, seeing their beloved city turned to rubble, watching helplessly as innocent civilians die in the terrible bombings, is incredibly powerful. Pemberton communicates all of this in a way that the matter-of-fact paragraphs and still photographs of a history textbook can never achieve. I was left with a profound admiration for the British civilians who endured half a decade of the horrors of war.Pemberton tells the story of Letty, Ollie, and their children up until the late Twentieth Century. When I reached the end of the novel, it was kind of a bittersweet experience. Throughout the course of the book, I had gotten to know the characters so well, and I was almost reluctant to part company with them. I almost felt like I knew these people personally. Pemberton achieves a definite emotional resonance in his writing.Our Family is a rich, stirring tale that left me deeply moved. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Isaiah: God Saves Sinners (Preaching the Word)","review":"Helps most in understanding the O.T. Text in light of the New Testament.

I have only gotten to the first three chapters, but have enjoyed it. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Isaiah: God Saves Sinners (Preaching the Word)","review":"The Preaching the Word commentary series, published by Crossway, has labeled itself as the commentary written by pastors for pastors, as well as for all who teach or study God's Word. I fall into the \\"teach or study God's Word\\" category and I must say that the commentary on Isaiah in this series lives up to that description. The commentary is very readable and anyone who is a student of God's Word will find it highly accessible, providing a clear exposition of the book of Isaiah.The Preaching the Word commentary series is currently going through a revision and the copy that I am reviewing is the new revision. I am not familiar with the old so I cannot compare the two, but I will attempt to communicate the layout and look of this edition. Ascetically speaking the commentary is very simple, a white dust jacket with minimal design, but it looks nice and stands out on a shelf filled with mostly colorful commentaries. Once, inside the reader will find a table of contents, showing the titles for each chapter, as this is how the commentary is divided. The verses are given in parenthesis for each chapter, so finding a particular verse and turning to it in a timely manner is easy. One thing I did notice is the lack of thorough introduction to the book. Most commentaries will give an introduction to the book, providing the layout of the book, the authorship, a historical introduction, etc. This commentary does not provide that. Instead it opts to go straight to the exposition of the text. I do not feel negatively about this format, I am only presenting it because if you are looking for a more technical commentary this is not for you.With that being said this commentary excels as what it was written for, namely a readable exposition of the text. Each chapter flows nicely, both in and of itself, and in context of the entire book. Each chapter begins with a short introduction and then is followed by an outline or structured layout of the section. The chapter is then divided by headings corresponding to the outline. This makes for great readability and flow to the chapters. It is quite easy to pick out a single verse in Isaiah and within a minute open the commentary and find the exact section that deals with the verse. This is not the case with a lot of commentaries. All lengthy passages of Scripture or other quotes are offset, which is always an aesthetic plus for me. I find this makes navigating through the book easier. The content itself comes from Ray Ortland who has taught in seminary, published books and pastured. He brings great wisdom and insight into the text and is a joy to read behind and brings many truths to light. I highly recommend this commentary on Isaiah to anyone who needs a good expositional commentary, and who may be cautious of more technical commentaries being over their head. This would be a great introductory commentary on the book of Isaiah for anyone who desires to know more of the Word of God."},{"Title":"Isaiah: God Saves Sinners (Preaching the Word)","review":"This is an outstandingly helpful commentary.

Either way, the illustrations aren't great; they look very much like the drawings / watercolors that young children would create.

The House on East 88th Street opens with the Primm family moving into their new home, decorating and unpacking. Mrs. Primm opens the bathroom door to find a crocodile soaking in the tub! Just as Mr. and Mrs. Primm are in the midst of panic, young Joshua Primm finds a man by the name of Signor Valenti at the front door with a note, explaining that he is leaving Lyle with the family and will be back later. In the meantime, Lyle has emerged from the bathroom and is ready to perform some of his trademark acrobatics to impress the Primms.Lyle settles in with the Primms and becomes part of the family. They take him everywhere they go, and he integrates well into society. When his tricks begin to attract the public's attention, Signor Valenti returns to retreive his stage partner and collect the profits for himself. Will the Primms ever see Lyle again?Being the introduction to Lyle the Crocodile, The House on East 88th Street is a bit rough and unpolished. The illustrations aren't as colorful and smooth as those in later releases, and the storyline lacks the moral undertone of Lovable Lyle. However, it provides some important background on how Lyle came to live with the Primms. It's still a fun story and my children didn't enjoy it any less than Lovable Lyle. In this case, I would even suggest readers to might want to begin with a newer Lyle book and read The House on East 88th Street afterward.

Lyle will bring a smile to anyone's face and kids will love the idea of having a pet crocodile in the bathtub!"},{"Title":"The House On East 88th Street (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've loved this one since I first bought it for my son 30+ years ago!Lyle in the bathtub is the best."},{"Title":"The Truth About Geronimo","review":"Britton Davis's reason for writing this book in the 1920's was to set straight some outlandish tales that were being published about who \\"captured\\" Geronimo, and some even more fictitious writings on the \\"Indian Wars.\\"This is an excellent book, as an adventure tale, as a look at the 'civilized' persons' outlook toward \\"the Indians\\" of the day, as a look at the horrific way our government tried to solve the 'indian problem' with a one-size-fits-all method (sound familiar?), and a look at Apaches as individuals rather than all-bad or all-good.For a tremendous balance of outlooks, read this book along with Eve Ball's \\"Indeh\\"."},{"Title":"The Truth About Geronimo","review":"In 99.9% of all books written by whitemen about American Indians it is hard to find even a grain of truth or fact. This book is the exception that proves the rule!While nothing is glossed over, the author does not attempt to sway the reader with sensationalism. He tells about his experiences and gives the good with the bad. He exhibits an almost unheard of ability to set aside any preconceived notions and actually see clearly both sides of the conflict AND views the American Indian as a human being, not some sort of subspecies.An exceptional view of reality that should be required reading in all American history classes from junior high/middle school through the college level."},{"Title":"The Truth About Geronimo","review":"For any one interested in the real facts of the Apache campains this is for you. It may take a little patience to get through the early reading, Davis is very detailed in names and dates but he has real first hand accounts of things that acctually occured. This is a man I think saw and admired the native people and did his duty in a fair and just manner. Davis is an admiral person and does a great justice to the Indian and the attrocities they endured but at the same time points out that just like in every culture a few bad apples can spoil the lot. He also points out that the government did far more decieving to the Indian they ever did to the government. I always respected the Native Americans and even more so after this book."},{"Title":"The Truth About Geronimo","review":"This book is one of the true historically significant accounts of events that have been forever shrouded in lies and fiction. If you are interested in historically accurate accounts of the late Apache wars, this is one of the must-read books. Davis just wanted the truth told, so he did it himself after watching glory-seeking sycophants take credit for, and be lauded for the heroic actions of others. Davis's views on his enemy Apaches, as well as the Apache scouts, show the wisdom and respect only a true and sage adversary can attest to. You won't be sorry you bought this book. Another must read is \\"On The Border With Crook\\" by John G. Bourke."},{"Title":"The Truth About Geronimo","review":"Instead of depending on the foolish politically correct hollywood movies to learn history about this country and the people involved, read about history from those closest to the actual events. This book appears to be generally unbiased and fair about the events surrounding the Apachie and Geronimo. Of course there is always some bias because people are influenced by their own perspectives and feelings, but on the whole it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The Truth About Geronimo","review":"Has some good information on the historic detail of the Apache Indians. Does, however, frequently get lost in the political approach in telling what should have been a more personal side of the story."},{"Title":"The Sorrows","review":"In his introduction, Randy Lee Eickhoff points out that the ancient Irish Bard was often required to deliver exact renditions. What Eickhoff has done with The Three Sorrows is to inflate the original texts, as we have them, with examples of every day life that is culturally relevant to the past and in some respect to the present. The translator of any tale often encounters a text that is so familiar to a classical audience that either the full expression of the text was considered unnecessary or the reverse, composed of only those parts that were remembered. Often this leaves the reader intrigued, or confused, as to what might be missing from the tale. Although much of the main action and many of the descriptions seem to follow the original texts very closely, (from what I can tell) it lacks the often archaic and abbreviated tone of Cross and Slover's, Ancient Irish Tales. Thomas Kinsella's elegant translation of the Exile of the Sons of Uisulu in The Tain, is much shorter than the version Eickhoff treats his reader too. In many ways, I prefer the prose of these earlier translations, yet Eickhoff's approach is fresh, informal and, perhaps, more enjoyable to the modern reader. He makes a sincere attempt to keep the action coherent and interrelated.Eickhoff's narrator begins these tales with a vocal enthusiasm that is very informal. With the enlarged dialogue come phrases and swears that have an air of cultural and historical truth, but that are not included in other translations and difficult to verify. Mr. Eickhoff's footnotes are very helpful at determining how he arrives at some of these \`colloquiums' and are much more erudite than anticipated. His attention to geography both ancient and modern is appropriate to the genre.As to Mr. Eickhoff's overall approach, what comes to mind is an exchange between characters in The Fate of the Children of Turienn. Brian, a fierce yet intelligent child of Turienn, masquerades as a poet in order to gain entrance into a guarded castle. He tells the gatekeeper that he and his brothers are \\"singers of fate and adventure, of heroes and tragedy, we are poets of the highest order, well-versed in divination and philosophical maundering,\\" when he is interrupted! It seems the gatekeeper wants to hear \\"stories dear to a soldiers heart... battles and wars and... a tale about a saucy tart or two.\\" Eickhoff's style is indeed a blend of the two approaches to storytelling.Developing the sexuality of the tale's characters, and supporting it with references from other tales via footnotes was a brilliant stroke in the retelling of these tales. Although some of the descriptions of the female physique were redundant, it could have been to emphasize that a certain phrase or description might have been just another tool of the narrator to illustrate a perception of beauty. Perhaps, he was trying to evoke something of the Sheela-na-gig with his descriptions?Many ancient Irish tales are written in a form that implies two types of action. Frequently, the prose will alternate with verse. Verse is predominately used when the Otherworld influences the story i.e. prophesy and vision. Eickhoff nicely rounds out the English verses with rhyme while maintaining much of the same meaning when compared other versions. Action, both bawdy and bloody takes place in the general, or prose portion of the text. Indeed, Irish heroes often embody both the traits of the poet or druid and of the warrior. Eickhoff's writing attempts to keeps pace with this dualism."},{"Title":"The Sorrows","review":"I can't speak to whether this is a faithful translation or if it is better than other translations, but I enjoyed the Sorrows very much. If you have any interest in ancient Irish folklore and culture, these stories give you interesting tales and a glimpse into past Irish society. There is a very good footnote section as well giving you valuable information about some of the terms and gaelic words used throughout the stories. The writing style is fluid and easy to read and quickly engages you into the story. I enjoyed the second and third tales the best. I liked the first one, but it was a little long and started to repeat itself."},{"Title":"The Sorrows","review":"Eickhoff's &quot;The Sorrows&quot; is a good fantasy in the tradition of Grahm Joyce. The book does tend to drag in places, but overall its a very excellent, well written book that captures Ireland's customs."},{"Title":"Knights Templars and the Complete History of Masonic Knighthood from the Origin of the Orders to the Present Time","review":"This is a reproduction of an earlier text, which you should pick up in the product description. It is almost as if they left room in the margins for notes because the reproduction does not begin to fill up the page.It is told from an insider point of view in that the author is a Mason. The text is organized in chronological and geographical sections. An effort is made to set the stage via sections of history. There are many references to other texts.This is kept from being five stars because: 1) it is not written to the quality of classical literature and 2) the format of the presentation is less than desirable to me.Having said this, I am enjoying reading through the text because I am reading about early Christian history and the pagan and politcal influence that changed events."},{"Title":"Knights Templars and the Complete History of Masonic Knighthood from the Origin of the Orders to the Present Time","review":"Anyone interested in Masonic history and Templar lore will love this book."},{"Title":"Knights Templars and the Complete History of Masonic Knighthood from the Origin of the Orders to the Present Time","review":"An amazing and in depth look at the history of the Knights Templar and the secret societies that follow - I have never read so much history on this subject in one place.

Who was the first pilot to fly across America, or cross the Atlantic from east to west? To find the answers to these questions, you need to meet the aviators, those dreamers, daredevils, and inventors who were always looking to find that &quot;momentary escape from the eternal custody of earth. As author, Bo Zaunders, tells us in his informative and intriging introduction...&quot;Throughout history, people have gone to extraordinary lengths pursuing the dream of human flight.&quot; They strapped on wings, built elaborate contraptions, and risked life and limb, all to defy gravity, rise above the ground and fly like birds. Mr Zaunders leaves the very well known and famous, like the Wright brothers, Charles Lindbergh, and Amelia Earhart in his introduction, and goes on to profile seven lesser known, though no less fascinating aviators, The Montfolfier brothers, Alberto Santos-Dumont, Cal Rodgers, Bessie Coleman, Jimmy Doolittle, Beryl Markham, and &quot;Wrong Way&quot; Corrigan. Each easy to read and engaging chapter is full of fun facts, history, drama, and humor, and complemented by Roxie Munro's bold, bright and colorful artwork, which enhances each biographical portrait, and adds to all the fun. Perfect for youngsters 9-12, Feathers, Flaps, &amp; Flops is an entertaining and inspiring read that's sure to whet the appetites of all young aviation enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Feathers, Flaps, and Flops: Fabulous Early Fliers","review":"I got this book for my 5-year-old who just likes to learn. He is interested in airplanes, so I was intrigued by the title. It was not written for young children, which is partly why I like it.

The pictures are busy, so they give him something to study."},{"Title":"Feathers, Flaps, and Flops: Fabulous Early Fliers","review":"This fascinating history of early flight is a hoot.

Dealing with the aftermath of that one momentary lapse is the premise of this book. Laurie Larsen weaves an interesting but relatable tale of a mother's decision. The topic of foster care and legalities of parental neglect is not a familiar topic to many but the story is so well written that you understand without feeling like you are being educated. Intertwined in the book is legal system protocol, family dynamics, motherhood, and dating as a widower. The story grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Good read and leaves you wanting to read more by this writer."},{"Title":"Momentary Lapse","review":"For Lydia Pisani, life is not easy.

What turns out to be her momentary lapse in judgement changes the fabric of her life for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Soul Samples (New Millenium Library)","review":"Though there were many disappointments, I read the whole book and looked forward to each upcoming page. Dr Sprinkle gave a very personal and close feeling to his work, yet he left the reader CONSTANTLY waiting and wanting more information. I mean, it is all good and well to thank Mr and Mrs so-and-so and refer to their experience, but what do I know of it other than what is in the book and he gives only the briefest of sketches, if any. Also, long whiny battles with institutions and the over use of parentheses do distract from the message (Is there one?) from the book. Lets hope his style improves before his next book because the content of this one is fascinating."},{"Title":"Soul Samples (New Millenium Library)","review":"A very warm, individualized account of Dr. Sprinkle's study and experience with the ET phenomenon, which includes scientific data as well as personal stories."},{"Title":"Casa Florida; Spanish-style Houses From Winter Park To Coral Gables.","review":"In my hunt for more information on Spanish Style homes, (I own a bungalow in California), I have been frustrated at the limited amount of books out there. I work at a Library, and many of the patrons share the same frustrations. In order to be able to find books on these subjects, I have had to self-teach about the many surrounding subjects; ie, tiles, Mexico, Moorish, Morocco, Spain, etc. This book is one of the better ones. It has beautiful pictures on how to decorate and landscape. I learned that air-conditioning changed architecture in a substantive way. I had also never heard about concrete ceilings made to look like wood before, apparently a Florida staple, due to humidity. These houses are oh-my-Gorgeous! The only problem was that the author frequently discussed beautiful rooms and details of the houses, then didn't show pictures. Maybe/hopefully, they're saving those pics for a follow-up book on interiors and details? I agree with the previous reviewer, how about a book now on Florida Spanish bungalows?"},{"Title":"Casa Florida; Spanish-style Houses From Winter Park To Coral Gables.","review":"I have been waiting a long time for a book like this! While the Spanish style homes of California have been documented in numerous books, the large amount of this architecture that was built in Florida during the same period has never gotten the amount of press it deserves. There are books on the architecture of Addison Mizner and a few other noted Florida architects, but nothing comprehensive on the style that was so prevalent during the boom years, and which was used in big cities like Miami and much smaller towns all over the state. This book covers houses from Miami to Winter Park and gives a nice overview of the style. I was very impressed not only by the amazing photographs, but by the histories that went along with each home featured. These histories allow the reader to put the home into its proper context and can be used as guides for people like me that are restoring similar homes. I wasn't as impressed with the newer homes in the back of the book, but there are only three relatively modern houses covered, so it does not take much away from the overall content. Since many of the homes built in this style were smaller bungalows it would have been nice to have seen some of them included, but the homes pictured are stunning! This book is must have."},{"Title":"Casa Florida; Spanish-style Houses From Winter Park To Coral Gables.","review":"The first town in the New World was in Florida and it was a Spanish town. Since then the Spanish influence on the arthitecture and culture of Florida has been large.In this book a selection of buildings has been carefully selected to illustrate the history of Spanish-style structures from across the state. From an age standpoint, there are some quite old (but certainly not run down) homes varying up through some modern homes built using traditional styling. A few commercial buildings such as hotels are also included.From a style standpoint, the homes of Florida seem to have been influenced more by a Mediterranean, even Moorish, look than the Spanish architecture houses more common in the Western States that have more of a Mexican influence.Beautiful pictures beautifully printed on a high quality matte finished paper add a warmth to the book that glossy magazine style printing imparts."},{"Title":"Casa Florida; Spanish-style Houses From Winter Park To Coral Gables.","review":"This book has a terrific collection of photos of old Florida, Tuscany-type homes.

After reading it, then re-reading it I find that it is much less than I expected. There is a tremendious amount of repitition, not just once but 3-4 time in many instances. I feel that 90% of the information can be found in the owners manual that is presented here. That is not to say that I didn't gain any new, relevant information from the book, I did but not worth the price. The book is well bound so it will lay flat on a table if you desire to read it that way and the print is large enough for most of us old foggies.It may be of help to a total newcomer to metal detecting with the MXT but not for anyone who has any experience at the hobby. Sorry I can't give it the rave review that others have on other sites but for me it didn't give me the \\"Edge\\" that I was expecting.I suggest that a new MXT owner take the time to read their manual carefully then get out and use the machine. It is an absolutely great detector and does as well at coin shooting as it does with relics. I have never had the ocassion to use it for prospecting but from what I have heard it excels there also. For those who have read comments about erratic behavior read your manual, turn down the sensitivity in mineralized ground and LEARN YOUR MACHINE. It will bring more good finds out of the ground than anything I have ever used and I have used a lot of different machines. Straight out of the box it is by far the easiest detector to use that I have ever owned."},{"Title":"\\"The MXT Edge\\"","review":"I have owned my MXT for 2 years with somewhat sporadic use, and gleaning any really useful operations information from the manual is difficult if not impossible.

The manual is organized in a way that makes it easy to pick it up for a \\"refresher course\\" before you head out when the detector has been sitting in the closet for a few months.

Shortcoming: in comparsion with German version, some translation is a bit vague or inaccurate."},{"Title":"J.S. Bach","review":"I really wanted to find out which cantatas a great mind has enjoyed. My first love was music. All the social structure that assumes people need an ideology to bind them in death or a dark prison like Christ in Cantata No. 4 are missing something that even Albert Schweitzer can hardly describe. This is a book about something great. Volume 1 called J. S Bach a culmination of what could be done with music within the theories that Bach had to play on way back when it had not turned into the music we now expect. I bought a complete collection of Bach organ works when that was considered unusual by the kind of people I worked with. I don't own many recordings of the cantatas. I wish I could love something without wasting all my time. Even the Eagles sang about what is on your mind has all been a wasted time."},{"Title":"J.S. Bach","review":"The photograph on the cover is a little odd. It is a railroad receding into the distance. You aren't sure at first glance whether it only seems to peter out as a trick of perspective, but if you look closely you'll see it really does peter out in the middle distance, next to the grain elevator.What does that have to do with Bach? There's a reference to the sudden end of certain \\"American high roads\\" in a footnote in the middle of the text, but that isn't specifically about railroads so I'm not at all sure that justified the photograph.That's a minor mystery.

Good biographical information on 150 artists. Excellant illustrations."},{"Title":"Modern Figurative Paintings: The Paris Connection","review":"This book will gratify those art lovers and collectors who have an interest in the artists who appear only in the secondary auctions of Sotheby's or Christies, if they appear in American auctions at all. The authors have provided biographical data, to the extent it may be available, on some of the many fine artists with a Parisian connection, who never had a reputation equal to their worth or lost their reputations through the attrition of time. They are fine artists as the pictures which appear with each biographical sketch suggest, yet they never made the breakthrough which, as any collector or dealer knows, is so much a matter of chance, dependent as it is on many factors outside the control of the artist. Hopefully, the great inflation of prices for contemporary and modern art, will stir interest in those, who like these artists, and those who appear in the second volume in this series, can provide considerable gratification, whether or not one can count on an appreciated selling price. Having seen original works by some of this group, I will attest to the worthiness of their efforts, although they may not match Picasso, Matisse, Cezanne or Monet. For a price often within the range of those collectors who hover at the lower levels of the intermediate market, one can own pictures which will give a lifetime of joy."},{"Title":"Modern Figurative Paintings: The Paris Connection","review":"After reading the 5 star reviews and having an interest in the subject, I ordered this book. I returned it after looking at it once. I gave it 2 stars as there were 2 artists in the entire book worth studying. Most of the work was done by unknown artists and the quality was poor. I am a painter myself and look for inspiration in the work of other artists. Sadly, I found none here. I wonder if the other reviewers have a connection to the book or own some of the paintings featured."},{"Title":"Naomi Wants to Know: Letters from a Little Girl to the Big Big World","review":"I heard Naomi and her father on NPR discussing the book, and I bought it out of curiousity.

I would recomend it to anyone who likes asking questions."},{"Title":"Linux for Embedded and Real-Time Applications (Embedded Technology)","review":"I bought this book hoping for an in depth look at using Linux for real-time. The table of contents would lead you to believe that this is the case.Instead I found that it covered this topic only at a very high level. It might be good for an introduction to this topic, but there is very little depth here. For example, the chapter on Linux and Real-time is only 5 pages long! While the description of configuring BlueCat Linux (seems pretty off-topic to me) is 14 pages.Unless you're a newbie to this topic, don't bother."},{"Title":"Linux for Embedded and Real-Time Applications (Embedded Technology)","review":"This book is VERY light on content (it's a pretty small book, 193 pages for the primary material). If you just look at the table of contents, you can get more depth in a couple hours of googling.It just isn't a very useful book. It has nothing to offer a programmer with any level of experience with Linux or embedded systems, and it doesn't really educate the guy who's new to those subjects. It's more like a collection of superficial magazine articles.The amount of real-time covered is really minimal. It touches on defining real-time computing, then has a (short and fairly useless) chapter on RTAI that doesn't do anything.Go with Yaghmour's \\"Building Embedded Linux Systems\\", it's a MUCH better book, and is probably cheaper."},{"Title":"Linux for Embedded and Real-Time Applications (Embedded Technology)","review":"This book is easy to read, and a good place to *START* for Embedded Linux. The organization of the chapters probably makes more sense once you're done reading it. It contains an excellent introduction to RTOS, multi-tasking, and relevant Linux programming concepts. The book is not intended as a complete guide to Embedded Linux or Real-Time issues, but rather helps the reader get started with an example using inexpensive hardware to drive a real embedded application. Important Embedded Linux concepts are covered including (remote) debugging, kernel modules, device drivers, and the available extensions to Linux for enabling an embedded and soft/firm real-time environment. Linux is not ready for hard real-time applications, but it's on the radar (which is why WindRiver is starting to support Linux based tools). I think this is a good first book for Embedded Linux in order to avoid getting lost in the wealth of other information available. I think I would like to see more/some real-world architectural based examples added to the book/CD. The book is not filled with useless pages of source code listings. If this book were to try and cover all real-time and Embedded Linux concepts and issues, it would be 1000 pages! A good book to start with!"},{"Title":"Renegade","review":"On the eve of her Richmond wedding, Henrietta Hanson is abducted by a mysterious stranger. But by dawn she recognizes her captor. The years have changed a boy into a man...a man who looks like a Viking warrior but lives like the Comanche who raised him. Once, Henrietta found sanctuary in his friendship, but now Silverbird is her enemy. Somehow, she must escape-before his burning embrace melts all her resistance. Silverbird has come to return Henrietta to her father-only to discover that the spirited Texas girl he'd known has matured into a stunning, self-possessed beauty no man can resist. Now, on their perilous journey through a sun-scorched land, his biggest challenge will be to win Henrietta's trust with a passion strong enough to erase the past-and a love that will flame brightly for the rest of their lives. This book would have been better if Henrietta wasn't such a brat. It's her fault they get into all the trouble they do. She really just got on my nerves."},{"Title":"The Management of Business Logistics","review":"I have used this book as a reference whilst as a student and recommended it as a lecturer.

I would not recommend it unless absolutely necessary."},{"Title":"The Management of Business Logistics","review":"we are in the logistics business and I reviewed this book as a potential teaching tool for management. The book is unfortunatley of little to no value. Most concerning is that the mathematics for inventory management, a critical factor in understanding logistics, are simply wrong.

While it is written from a Catholic perspective there is no black and white conclusions within these pages, no dogmatic statements of undeniable truth the reader is expected to embrace. It is an intelligently written, provocative and thought provoking quest for spiritual proof of the existence of the Divine and our understanding of the ultimate consequences of our personal belief system.The book is divided into six parts, each part consisting of between four to six chapters;Part One: Small MysteriesPart Two: A Spiritual DisneylandPart Three: Real PresencesPart Four: Wounds and HealingPart Five: Saints, Angels and ProdigiesPart Six: Powers of DarknessAs in anything some chapters are more enthralling than others, I guess what chapters you gravitate to depend on what you are primarily interested in. My personal favorite two chapters are;Chapter 13- \\"The Reluctant Prophetess\\" which contains an absolutely fascinating meeting with Conchita Gonzalez-Keena, the recluse Marian visionary of Garabandal, Spain.Chapter 26- \\"Victim\\" containing one man's personal encounter with Satan.Whatever spiritual persuasion you adhere to you'll enjoy and appreciate the honesty and candor of John Cornwall's experiences.My Highest Recommendation!!"},{"Title":"The Hiding Places of God","review":"this book is very well written and thought provoking"},{"Title":"The Hiding Places of God","review":"U-2's song &quot; I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; may well apply to Cornwell. Yet, what he does discover is far more compelling. There are doubting Thomases who may need some tangible, hoax proof sign to validate God's existence.Far more admirable are those he has met on his journey who need nothing more than blind faith.Miracles and mysticism are small steps to spirituality. I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Hiding Places of God","review":"This book and \\"Father Joe: the man who saved my soul\\"are the two best spiritual books I have read in years!"},{"Title":"Pete Rose's Winning Baseball","review":"Pete Rose is one of the greatest baseball players. In this book he will teach you how to be a good all around baseball player. He explains how to play every position correctly. It is important to practice too and he preaches that. If you can switch hit he believes that it is a great advantage to you and gives good reason why. Don Gullett, who was a pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds, teaches you how to pitch. He shows how to throw certain pitches and how to take care of your arm. Practically anything that you would want or need to know about how to play baseball correctly is in this book.I would recommend this book to all young players and any coach because it is a really good book for showing you how to play and practice. If you like baseball then this book would probably interest you. I liked it because it helped me understand the game better and how to play and practice better."},{"Title":"Pete Rose's Winning Baseball","review":"Pete Rose is one of the greatest baseball players.

He stresses the importance of teamwork and getting along with your teammates, as well as playing hard and playing to win, something that is often missing from timid youth teams or casual adult 'beer' leagues. Most remarkably, he equates winning with keeping morale on the team high: he frowns upon angry coaches and abusive teammates who criticize others. Instead of public anger, he recommends giving supportive advice privately and briefly with players who make a bad play. He gives unconventional advice about becoming a switch hitter early in one's career so that one never has to face a curve ball thrown the wrong way.The advice that he gives would probably be better for younger players, although after watching some adult rec league teams exploding into anger and self-destructing, it would benefit them as well.I found the more sparse information about technique far less helpful. This is what I was looking for when I bought this book, unfortuantely. Again, it's the mental advice here that is better, such as the goal of hitting the ball hard, rather than the result (getting base hits), that is his helpful focus.This book is useful for any player looking for a fresh psychological and team approach to winning the game."},{"Title":"Medical Spanish Made Incredibly Easy!

To give an idea of the depth of this book, I read this book in about 6 hours prior to taking a course in graph theory (an undergraduate and graduate student mixed course), and the material in the book was covered in class in about 4 lectures (there were about 30 lectures in the course). This isn't to say the book isn't good (because it is), but I just have to emphasize it is a basic introduction.What gives this book 5 stars is that it was written very well and made the material very interesting. I would recommend this book to someone looking to understand the very basics of graph theory, but I would not to someone looking for a thorough introduction to graph theory.For reference, titles of chapters: 1) Pure Mathematics; 2) Graphs; 3) Planar Graphs; 4) Euler's Formula; 5) Platonic Graphs; 6) Coloring; 7) The Genus of a Graph; 8) Euler Walks and Hamilton Walks."},{"Title":"Introduction to Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"Mr. Trudeau has done a fabulous job of introducing graph theory in a way which is understandable and intellectually provocative. He mentions that some of the problems are easy, and that some have been unsolved. In both cases, they both are fully illustrative of the subject matter. If you want to begin exploring graph theory, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"For anyone interested in graph theory who has not taken many upper level math classes, or has yet to take a course in discrete mathematics, this is a great introduction. For anyone, at any level, this is a fun and entertaining read. The book reads as if the author were standing in front of you at the chalkboard, masterfully teaching you the basics of the material, almost in layman's terms (but not quite), all with a witty sense of humor and a tendency towards anecdotes.The material is in no way thorough, nor treated very rigorously. All the basics are there and taught in an intuitive manner. There are numerous exercises, none of which is difficult, but all of which are interesting to someone who is new to graph theory. Some of the key results that are simple to prove are done so in the exercises, encouraging readers to discover things for themselves.Downsides: If you are looking for a rigorous book on graph theory, look elsewhere. But that is really the only downside!Overall: I liked graph theory before reading this book. I loved graph theory after reading the first chapter."},{"Title":"Introduction to Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"I like this book as an intro to graph theory. I already had a little background in graph theory and a graduate degree in mathematics before I got this book, but I think that less experienced readers with an interest in pure math will enjoy this book. It's readable and conversational, and special attention is given to introducing pure mathematics and proof."},{"Title":"Introduction to Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"This book introduces graph theory terminology and elementary results to the absolute beginner. It does a nice job of presenting the material in the format \\"motivation-example-definitions-theorem-proof-remarks\\", which I find pedagogical.Interspersed throughout the text are some historical remarks and a lot of author's personal opinions on what mathematics is or should be. This last piece of the text I liked least, since I do not agree with the author many times. He defends the position that \\"pure mathematics\\" is \\"real mathematics\\", and that \\"applied mathematics\\" follows from the \\"real thing\\" (he actually states this literally in the introduction of the book). This view has been debunked so many times along the history of the subject that it is quite irritating to see it expressed so categorically.But the book is not about math philosophy, so I recommend it as a warm up to those interested in more heavy-duty graph theory."},{"Title":"Introduction to Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"This book provides a good but not rigorous great introduction to graph theory. The best audience is someone with mathematical ability but little education beyond high school or introductory math. That is, knowledge of analysis or higher is not required. Having finished this book, one could go on to the book entitled graph theory by the same publisher. It's hard to beat Dover's prices and selection for math books. The style of the book is conversational except for one more proof-oriented chapter. At the end of each chapter are graded problems with answers, a great plus for self-study."},{"Title":"Introduction to Graph Theory (Dover Books on Mathematics)","review":"Wonderful book to read!

The concepts are first intuitively explained and then formally stated. The numerous examples are completely treated and then easy to follow. R. Trudeau devoted a large part of the book to the puzzling problems of planar graphs and coloring and explains them in a very pleasant manner. As a result, these problems almost appear as trivial (which of course is not the case).The main criticism I would make is the following. This book is a corrected and enlarged version of another book.

At the end of each section, a thorough set of questions is provided for study along with an exhaustive bibliography. The bibliography contains material from over 700 sources.

In painstaking detail he explains the distortions and misdirection of that system which would have us believe human strife is largely due genetic and biochemical deficiencies or imbalances. In exceptionally clear fashion he details research findings and clarifies how many psychiatric explanations for \\"mental illness\\" are distorted and flawed.In a very interesting fashion, Dr. Colbert examines various instances where drugs \\"appear\\" to work. He details this from both a theoretical and practical standpoint which greatly helps to de-confuse the mental health professional and layperson alike. Indeed, countless clients/ patients have experienced \\"relief\\" following consumption of various psycho tropic medications. Consequently, it is often very difficult for them to comprehend how one can challenge the helpfulness and apparent efficacy of drugs. Dr. Colbert offers cogent reasons for the experience of relief and explains why that is often a seductive outcome. But, that outcome so often fails to address fundamental personal and interpersonal issues that ultimately must be dealt with in order to achieve a true healing process.In addition to the clear and in-depth examination of the issues under scrutiny, the author offers humane alternatives to medicating of human beings who are passionately struggling with life's meaning. Here, the rich humanistic, psycho dynamic, and systems perspectives that impact living are examined via examples from case studies.As a psychotherapist and educator with a great many years of experience, I fully intend to make Dr. Colbert's work a required text in my classroom. In my opinion, it is one of the most significant books written in the field of mental health in the past 10 years.Sincerely, Tom Mabee, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Rape of the Soul","review":"I don't think I've ever read an entire book without blinking, but I came close with Colbert's masterpiece. I didn't want to miss a word. My own soul welled up with hope and passion as the simple understanding that emotional and spiritual pain cannot and should not be healed with drugs became crystal clear. This had always been my intuitive belief, but it is now buoyed by Colbert's thorough knowledge of the relevant research and his keen critique of the philosophy of the medical model of mental illness. In the past, whenever I read some new research &quot;breakthrough&quot; that screamed that biopscychiatry now knows the biological marker or cause for mental illness, my faith wavered. But it no longer does, thanks to Dr. Colbert's clear, passionate thinking."},{"Title":"Rape of the Soul","review":"My opinion is similar to most of the other reviewers - this book is great. For far too long, the unproven biochemical account of people's problematic behaviour has been the dominant view. And also, for that reviewer who says he has depression and scolds the book, just be aware, that having 'depression' symptoms does not make you an expert any more than a man who bashes his partner is an expert on wife-bashing disorder. This book was easy to read. I hope the author plans to write more. By the way, if you go to the website listed on the back cover of the book, you will be in for a big, big surprise."},{"Title":"Rape of the Soul","review":"In the past two years I have ordered numerous copies and recommended this book to others to read. Everyone has the same remark on the significant benefit of this book. In layman terms the author very effectively outlines how the chemical imbalance theory has risen to dominance in this country. It then shows why drugs are a dangerous and often debilitating result for many. Far from creating \\"dry-mouth\\" these drugs often cause the very behaviors they are supposedly designed to solve. Increased suicidal thinking, akathesia, increased hostility from these drugs are not minor side-effects. Our society has paid the price for trusting in unscientific studies put out by the pharmaceutical establishment. By the way sedating or masking symptoms as this author shows makes it much harder for the person to become truly functional emotionally as further evidenced by the angry reviewer here who supposedly was \\"helped\\" by these drugs. If that's healthy a growing concensus is now saying \\"no thanks\\"."},{"Title":"Rape of the Soul","review":"I am so tired of these therapists writing books attacking medications for mental illnesses. I am so utterly revolted. Did this author ever even get close to experiencing depression, or any other mental illness, himself? Do any of these authors even bother to read any research studies, at all? How can they so deeply sink their heads into the sand? I mean, it should be a crime. Or at least the publishers should have enough wherewithall and integrity to refuse to publish this absurd, ill-informed trash.Look, the IGNORANCE of these authors rapes MY soul and my mind. I am also a psychotherapist. I suffer from depression. A sister suffers from schizophrenia. She was homeless for 10 years my friends! That was because she wasn't taking her medication. When she finally started taking meds, she got better! Then she got a job and her own apartment! My lord in heaven, look at the research on schizophrenia, you foolish \\"colleagues\\" of mine! There is no doubt! There is brain damage when schizophrenia is untreated! Medication helps psychotic people to live a life, and even can prevent further brain damage. Hello! Anyone home? (As my sister would say, \\"Duh-eeee!\\")Same deal with depression. Please look at the research. Who is to say that people who take medication for depression can't also do other things to discover meaning in life, heal, and feel better? Prayer, meditation, yoga, Jungian therapy, depth psychotherapy, bodywork/therapy, acupuncture, etc. I believe in it all, all of it has helped me. So has medication. Why are these therapists so black and white? Why are they trying so desperately to divide the functioning of the mind and the emotions from the functioning of the body? That is not holistic, oh colleagues. It is sheer ignorance. And it is dangerous to your clients. Frankly, denying them medication when they need it is what is raping their minds, bodies and their souls!Absolute disgust. Perhaps they would tell a person who just had an amputation of their leg that their pain was \\"all in their head\\". That tylenol or, god forbid, motrin, or (shudder) vicodin would not only cause life-threatening side effects, but would inevitably cause a dangerous addiction, and that none of these medications was warranted in the first place! Or the same to a heart patient. The group of people that writes these books seem themselves to be suffering from a collective delusion of some sort, probably paranoid.Like because you might suffer from dry mouth or some other thoroughly manageable side effect, you should never take antidepressants, oh no! Like the benefit of taking the antidepressant (more energy, a life, not killing yourself, etc.) does not outweigh the dry mouth. No--The dry mouth is evil! And like, depression is something we can just magically get rid of! Like we can just will ourselves out of any depression, even a suicidal one, or the florid psychotic hallucinations of schizophrenia! Oh yeah. Or maybe a cup of herb tea will cure us. And like, for some strange and obscure twist of these author's logic, the fact that anyone might take a psychotropic drug automatically precludes them from doing anything holistic as well. How about this: how about the drug helping people to even get to the \\"place\\" where they can meditate? That is more the reality, my friends. But you wouldn't know, because you have not experienced any of the mental or emotional challenges that you write about, have you?The sane ones are those who take medication when they need it, whether it is to help to alleviate a physical or a mental or emotional problem. The really crazy ones, like the ones who write these books, think that we can rise above our mental pain, even though they would never suggest the same to someone with a physical condition. They think that because it is mental or emotional problem that there is no physical correlate, or if there is one, then our mind can magically and automatically control and cure the physical problem (as well as the mental or emotional one!). Some kind of God complex, what? And DE Nial is a river in Egypt. Who has the real problem here? I could psychoanalyze these writer's fascinating and uh, \\"eccentric\\" belief systems more, but I'll spare you."},{"Title":"Shrink to Fit: Answers to Your Questions About Therapy","review":"\\"Shrink to Fit\\" is a concise, quick reading handbook on the very important subject of mental therapy.

That notice should have been highlighted in flashing red lights. The quality of this publication is exceedingly poor. It's not a typo here and there; it's fraught with typos, strange line breaks, and the inclusion of odd characters. If only one -- just one -- person had bothered to read this book after it had been produced using OCR, the copy could easily have been cleaned up. As it is, the book is practically unreadable. The transcription problems are so numerous that they completely distract from the pleasures of the actual text. In their efforts to keep costs low, the publisher, General Books LLC, has produced a book that is un-buyable -- a complete waste of money. I had hoped to add this classic book to my personal library, but now it's only getting added to my recycling bin."},{"Title":"The Essays of Elia (Everyman's Library, 14)","review":"Lamb is one of the great secrets of the nineteenth century. He's witty, spiky, elusive and puzzling. His essays lull you into a false sense of charm and nostalgia, but within them are sharp and penetrating comments on human behaviour. They run alongside great Romantic works like Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 'This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison' or William Wordsworth's 'The Prelude' as wonderful, moving pieces of autobiography and self-examination. Plus they are beautifully written, with their descriptions of forgotten places in London, the slowly decaying 'South Sea House', for instance, or the pastoral green of the Inner Temple Gardens, hidden away in the midst of the capital. And behind them, always, is a sense that these nostalgic descriptions are all the more enjoyable because they are hard-won; they come out of the tragedy and courage of Lamb's personal life, and his lifelong struggle with his own depression and with his sister's serious mental illness. They also have a sharply political edge to them - they were published in the 'London Magazine' alongside essays by Hazlitt and De Quincey, and while they seem at first glance simply charming, they often slyly comment on contemporary prejudice.Lamb hasn't been popular through the 20th century - an attack on him by F. R. Leavis and his disciples in the 1930s was the start of the rot, and the gradual decline of the essay has meant he's been almost completely overlooked (though not by the Charles Lamb Society, who are still going in London and meet regularly for lectures - and for Lamb's birthday drinks). So a new edition of Lamb is really to be celebrated, especially one as beautifully produced as this.But alas! This is a lovely edition, but it has one huge flaw for me. There are only 27 essays here and there should be 28: the edition claims to be a reprint of 'Essays of Elia', but it leaves out one of Lamb's most important essays, 'Imperfect Sympathies'. There's not even a note to explain this omission. Why is this important? Well, 'Imperfect Sympathies' is one of the most difficult, challenging, shocking of Lamb's essays - it starts off with a funny skit on why Elia doesn't like Scotchmen: 'I have been trying all my life to like Scotchmen, and am obliged to desist from the experiment in despair'. Scotchmen don't get jokes. They're terribly literal:\\"I have a print of a graceful female after Leonardo da Vinci, which I was showing off to [a Scotchman]. After he had examined it minutely, I ventured to ask him how he liked MY BEAUTY (a foolish name it goes by among my friends) -- when he very gravely assured me, that \\"he had considerable respect for my character and talents\\" (so he was pleased to say), \\"but had not given himself much thought about the degree of my personal pretensions.\\"But then, terribly, the essay takes a darker turn, as Elia voices prejudices about Jewishness and black people. I've always read this essay as a reflection on the nature of prejudice. It's not LAMB who's voicing these opinions - it's Elia, and he's doing so (I think) to make us see how an innocent sounding joke (against Scotchmen), and a bit of 'harmless' prejudice can be the slippery slope to something much worse - as such, it's very timely.But it's up to us, surely, to read this difficult essay and decide for ourselves. Simply leaving it out - without any word of acknowledgement - is bad editorial practice (though the notes to this edition, too, are pretty much non-existent). And it's also giving people a false sense of Lamb - a kind of misguided political correctness which actually amounts to admitting that these editors do think Lamb is a racist old bigot and there are some aspects of his writing which we'd just better not mention. Disrespectful to Lamb, and to his readers, I'd say..."},{"Title":"The Essays of Elia (Everyman's Library, 14)","review":"Shamefully I had not read Lamb before. Delightful.

Not that it is a terrible book, but it simply is NOT THAT GOOD. For one thing, the author writes in a very cutsey manner, calling underwear &quot;underlovelies&quot; as one example. Another problem with this book, as I see it, is that there are no illustrations. Surely a book on image and dress should include some visuals!While this book is certainly comprehensive and the information it imparts did strike me as being on the money, I could not get beyond Ms. Nicholson's chatty writing style...I felt it diminished her credibility. I much prefer THE COMPLETE IDIOT's GUIDE TO SUCCESSFUL DRESSING by Karyn Repinski or even MASTERING YOUR PROFESSIONAL IMAGE, by Stephanie Petersen. While a bit outdated (1995) the latter book has wonderful sketches of different looks and provides good,solid advice."},{"Title":"Dressing Smart in the New Millennium","review":"Count me in as another perplexed reader wondering how on earth this book has scored so much positive press. Even under the lax standard extended to self-help titles, this book is a disaster: poorly written, disorganized and ultimately unhelpful.Did I say poorly written? The author reads like a graduate of the Cosmo Girl School of Writing, and the editor who passed this manuscript ought to be hauled in for an eye exam. Multiple exclamation points compete with italic, boldface and all-caps emphasis, all within in the same sentence.The book has no discernable organizational structure, just a rambling series of 200 &quot;Smart Tips&quot; (and, yes, this author puts every other phrase in quotation marks). Someone new to wardrobe planning would have no idea where to start, not in the book and not in her closet. Nor is there an index or a comprehensible table of contents to help the reader.Even being firm with myself and putting away the metaphorical red pencil, I still hated it. The content is insufficient and uneven. For example, there are no illustrations, line drawings, or color charts. None. There are literally no graphics anywhere in a book about clothing, color and style.Too many of the &quot;Smart Tips&quot; are sketchy, bulleted lists of catch-phrases. It's as if the author cribbed a substantial portion of this book from training transparencies.Then there are the annoying little self-adulation events, averaging one every other page. This author claims to have &quot;founded&quot; (yes, I &quot;caught&quot; Quotation Mark Fever from her!) the &quot;color and image consultant industry&quot;; she name-drops alleged clients every third paragraph, and makes constant references to her illustrious career, business, modeling experience, sexiness and all-round perfection. The absolute kicker is the entire &quot;Smart Tip&quot; which warns the reader against retaining any color consultant NOT &quot;trained by me, or by one of my fabulous directors of training!&quot;I am put in mind of the old adage, &quot;The rabbi who must praise himself has a congregation of one.&quot;I think this lady probably knows her stuff, and could likely do a good job in a one-on-one setting. IF you can get past the dreadful writing, the lack of organization, the absence of graphic help and the bragging, bragging, bragging, she has a few reasonable tips and pointers. However, the book's defects render it unusable.Instead, for style development, try the lusciously-illustrated, comprehensive and positive &quot;Triumph of Individual Style&quot; by Carla Mathis and Helen Connor.

I tend to just throw stuff on in the morning for work (fortunately I have a job that doesn't require a &quot;corporate suit&quot; look). I ended up picking up this book mostly because there were some handy tips -- things like what length skirt goes with what type of shoes, etc. that I thought I could use.However, I'm perplexed that a book that focuses so much on clothing styles and colors has not a SINGLE illustration or color panel! Does the author assume I know what an A-line skirt is, or that I can tell the difference between coral and pink-coral in my mind? She places particular emphasis on your skin tone and its color, because that is how you base your entire wardrobe's color system. According to her, it is very important that I know the difference between coral and pink-coral... and that which I choose depends on what my skin tone is. However, aside from listing celebrities with certain skin tones, she never really explains how to judge your own skin tone. A comparison wheel or something -- ANYTHING -- would have been very helpful. The only color you get is the book's cover.It's not until you read the middle of the book that you discover that the author is a founder of a color consultancy organization that charges people to find out what colors work best for them (the book's cover does not mention this). While I'm sure her certified consultants are quite good (after all, THEY must have that color chart that got left out of the book), after reading the book and visiting her Web site (which she advertises inside her book), I feel like I've just been sold one big infomercial on how to hire one of her consultants.

These tips can be utilized regardless of whether your lifestyle is casual, business casual or formal.Other tips will require more planning and effort than I really wanted to hear. But, I decided that I would do a 2 week 'experiment' and try to follow the thoughts in the 200 tips. The results have been unbelievable. I have received more compliments in the last two weeks than ever before. My self confidence has been the big winner. A huge opportunity has come my way at work just in the last couple of days.

Much of what is in the book you have heard before, but JoAnna's presentation creates a comprehensive reference that you will keep close by for a LONG time."},{"Title":"Dressing Smart in the New Millennium","review":"Although this book had a bit of useful information, I did not appreciate the MULTIPLE vague references to \\"magic dust\\" and the author's personal stories.

I am a married, working mother, and would NOT sleep in my husband's previously worn dress shirts as pajamas as she suggests.(My kids would look at me funny.)I was looking for more specific advice on keeping a simple, flattering, professional wardrobe. The author does not have a grip on the real-world demands on women of life, career, children, and family. Her book is projected from the single life of a New York fashion model. Not very helpful for the rest of us. Don't buy this one--you'll waste your money."},{"Title":"Dressing Smart in the New Millennium","review":"I must say, I can't understand any of the negative reviews. This book is so vital to looking your very, very best. I have read it 2 or 3 times now and I use the tips/principles outlined in the book to go shopping.Before I read Joanna's book, people looked down on the way I dressed. To be honest, I was dressing in the same colors that my mother wears (and wearing some clothing cut in an unflattering way). These colors look good on her, but they wash me out, even though at first glance, our complexions look very similar. Now, people are always complimenting me and I get a lot of looks from men, including my husband. In fact, I buy his shirts now based on the color principles. I really don't think that there needed to be a color chart in this book because if you think about what looks really good on you already, that is the first clue to finding other clothes that would look good as well.Also, the same advice applies to knowing what kinds of clothes to buy in the future. If an outfit makes you look too heavy or otherwise bad, then there is some design element in that outfit that is not working for you. For instance, I am a fairly slim person, but I have wide shoulders and wide hips and large thighs. If I purchase a blouse or other top that is not tapered at all along my trunk (from under the arms to my hips), I look about 10 pounds heavier than if I wear a tapered top. I also do not wear flared pants for this reason. But I discovered this by analyzing what looked good on me and pinpointing why. So now, I kind of have \\"uniforms\\" that I wear because I look good in them. The concept of uniforms is discussed in a fantastic book, \\"Simple Isn't Easy\\" by Olivia Goldsmith. This book is not in print any more, but I would HIGHLY SUGGEST finding a used copy, because it will complement this book. Many of the world's best dressed designers wear \\"uniforms\\" because it is their best look.Tip: Here is how I determine if a piece of clothing might look good on me. I put my hand on the center of the garment to see how my skin looks next to the fabric. If the skin on my hand looks healthy and my skin and the fabric are not competing against each other for attention, then I will try it on to see how it looks. What I have found is that blues, pinks, purples, and reds that are of a medium tone (not pastel and not dark or bold) look best on me. I don't buy anything that doesn't enhance my skin color. As Joanna says, color is the first accessory, and its free!!!Also, I have freckles and wavy hair. That is somewhat of a visual distraction, so I normally do not wear blouses/tops that have a print. If I had straight hair with clearer skin, then I would probably look a lot better in prints. Joanna talks about who looks good in prints.I cannot recommend this book highly enough, along with \\"Simple Isn't Easy.\\" Good luck to you all!"},{"Title":"Dressing Smart in the New Millennium","review":"I have visited another bookseller's website and I have been surprised at the number of rave reviews that this totally unimportant book has generated.
