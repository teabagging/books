For most of the book I wanted to believe that she was just being somewhat restrained, but by the end it becomes rather clear that Mary Roach's writing skills are better than her science, logic, or skeptical courage.In the final chapter of the book she professes that she wants to believe, despite all evidence, that life after death exists, but she admits that such a desire is unscientific. So, what's with the subtitle Mary Roach?? Believing something for the sole reason that you desire it to be true, is not only unscientific, but the cause of a great deal of the world's problems.Sam Harris, the author of the End of Faith, has a great analogy for this type of desire. If someone comes up to you and says they have the world's biggest diamond buried in their backyard, you might be skeptical and ask them for more details. If the person's reasoning is that the diamond must be there, because it if is not there, then their life lacks meaning, few people would take this as a good indication that there really is a diamond buried in their yard. Just wanting to believe something is utterly irrelevent to reality.Since every person she interviewed for the book, no matter how nutty, wanted to believe in life after death, how is Mary Roach's desire to believe in something more valid than that of the lunatics she interviewed? One expects more from someone who uses the word \\"science\\" in her subtitle."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I can't believe anyone would call Mary Roach mean (earlier reviewer). I thought this book was fun, interesting and thought-provoking. There are very few books about death that truly approach the topic from an open-minded perspective. Most authors are either hell-bent on debunking anything that hints of spirituality and the (possible) beyond OR they offer a simplistic view in which they seem to have it all figured out. I think she presented some very interesting (and at times, odd) historical information that I probably would never have encountered anywhere else. And I really enjoyed her various interjections and light-hearted humorous jabs. The book is also a little bit about the author and the journey she takes examining the various topics- it's meant to be a little bit autobiographical. It's part of the charm. Without her little interjections, the book would be interesting, but lack a heart. I sincerely got the sense she was searching for something, which I could appreciate because I'm currently in a similar state. Anyway, I really liked it. Thank you Mary Roach."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Mary Roach has a satirical whit and a skeptical eye that always keeps me bubbling with enjoyment. This book focuses on life after death, and the author's attempts to prove or disprove it. Mary Roach has a very easy, pleasant style of writing. She typically addresses socially controversial issues and uses a scientific approach to write about them. Her style of writing is very refreshing because she never takes things too seriously. She is very down-to-earth and yet still maintains an open mind. This book was a fun read, and I had to laugh out loud at times. Mary Roach is like that aunt you have that tells you stories about your parents when they were young and impulsive. She serves to remind us that those people in authority (that you're told not to question) are just people too. The audio edition of this book was very good, and read well by a great narrator."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Loved the humor, along with the facts. This author truly has done her homework. She has traveled extensively, and it shows. The differing points of view expressed by different cultures makes for terrific reading.Best of all, our book club was fortunate in having Ms Roach attend one of our meetings. We felt as if we had known her forever, and were so pleased to have her with us to answer questions. I have just ordered \\"Bonk\\", and look forward to seeing Ms. Roach at a local book store when she will be talking about her newest book."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I love Mary Roach's writing style. While she tackles all of her subjects with a journalist's integrity, she writes about it with a sense of humor. In this fascinating look at the afterlife, Roach takes you through her personal research into all types of phenomena associated with the human soul. Reading the book, you can't help but feel entertained and informed all at once."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This was the first book I've read by Mary Roach, and it won't be the last. Roach has a witty and skeptical mind, and she uses it to good effect in examining different ways that science has explored the afterlife. Roach isn't afraid to insert herself into the story, whether going along to interview a child that may have been reincarnated to enrolling in medium school. She brings a light touch to the subject, yet manages to work a whole bunch of science-cy stuff in a way that was fun and interesting. Although I didn't necessarily expect to entertained or amused by this book when I started, I was (entertained and amused). Plus I learned a lot of different things--some of which I wish I could wipe from my memory (e.g., the method in which mediums hid their \\"ectoplasm\\").Roach explores quite a few ways that scientists have used to quantify, prove or document the soul and/or the afterlife. Some of the areas explored in the book include: interviewing children who were allegedly reincarnated; how early scientists looked for the human soul ... in sperm; attempts to measure the a soul by having people expire on a scale; a look at \\"the giddy, revolting heyday of ectoplasm\\" and mediums; modern mediums (including the lady that is the model for the TV show Medium); using acoustics to hear the dead; telecommunicating with the dead; hunting for ghosts; and attempting to measure near-death experiences in the operating room.If you're looking for an offbeat read about a subject that I suspect all of us might be just a little bit curious about and you'd like a guide who is both an amusing and talented writer, then this gem of a book is for you. I personally enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. And although Roach's results are pretty inconclusive, she does hold out some tantalizing food for thought that won't leave readers completely empty-handed.An excerpt: Carpenter points out that leprechauns have a volume similar to that of a human Mac. \\"This makes me suspect, \\" he writes, \\"that Leprechauns ... are most likely discarnate humans.\\" This makes me, in turn, suspect that Donald Gilbert Carpenter is most likely not the staid scientists that his many equations and tables suggest.Another excerpt: \\"Right,\\" says the tutor after a minute has gone by. \\"Does anyone not feel a contact?\\" No one raises a hand. I haven't got my energy out the door, and apparently everyone else's is off in heaven at an ice-cream social. I raise my hand. The tutor comes over and puts her hand up to my face. She asks if I can feel my face. What does this mean? It's not numb, so I guess the answer is yes. I nod. \\"Okay, good, you've got it.\\" She turns back to the group. I don't read minds, but I think I know what's going on in hers: AVOID THE YANK. The Yank is trouble."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This book starts with Mary traveling to India to explore reincarnation and ends with attempts to prove the existence of near-death, out-of-body experiences. In between, she tries to find out if science can prove the existence of a soul, goes to medium school, and tries to hear (and capture) EVP voice recordings. All of this is reported with a sense of humor that is unique to Mary Roach. Though I didn't like this as much as Bonk, it was still quite enjoyable and a great audiobook to listen to (though the accents used by the reader are a little over the top). I won't tell you what her conclusions are, but I don't think you'll be surprised."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"In \\"Spook,\\" Mary Roach is at her witty best in discussing ways that scientists have tackled reincarnation, spirit mediums and the search for the location and weight of the soul. Roach combines a wicked wit and a skeptical, scientific attitude that is entertaining and informative. The worst thing I can say about the book is that her fascinating subject matter encourages the reader to devour the pages, while her witty asides and commentary require that the reader slow down. It's a little like eating ice cream ON a hot day -- you want to gobble down the treat, but have to slow down to avoid the brain freeze.Roach takes us to India to visit a scientist who \\"investigates\\" reports that the recently dead have reincarnated into newborns from neighboring villages. The scientist, who claims to be impartial and impervious to bias, clearly could use a bit more skepticism and rigor. Roach takes the opportunity to discus how a culture (like India's) that takes reincarnation for granted is more likely to read their beliefs into the random expression of four-year-olds that would we in the West. Of course, we tend to see the divine visage in flapjacks, so who is to judge?Roach does a nice job of investigating NDEs (near death experiences) and discussing the truth about these strange phenomena. Are NDEs real? Are they imagined? Whatever could they mean? Ever the skeptic, Roach takes them with a grain of salt while holding out a slim hope that they turn out to be real. A laptop computer, laid on a high shelf in a hospital emergency room and generating random images for the next soul-traveler, should eventually provide an answer.Roach's chapters on the mediums of the late 18th and early nineteenth centuries were especially interesting to me. Rarely do you get to see a competent skeptic take on the outlandish manifestations -- trumpets, moving tables, taps and blasts of wind -- that were part and parcel of s&eacute;ances during the period. Roach takes on the bizarre phenomenon of ectoplasm -- a material supposedly produced by mediums from contacts with the other world. Credulous scientists were fooled by the appearance of this matter, and could not explain it. Other scientists showed conclusively that the material was simple cloth or animal tissue that had been secreted by the mediums on their persons. Roach's description of a trip to Oxford to examine purported ectoplasm led her to determine (by smell) in which bodily orifice the medium secreted the material. Ewww!Lest we think that all scientific lunacy about death occurred decades ago, Roach tells about scientists who attempt to calculate, using Einstein's equation equating matter and energy, the energy lost when a soul leaves a human body at death. Ever the materialists, these worthies seems immune to the possibility that the soul could be non-corporeal.Roach, in \\"Spook,\\" is funny, irreverent and informative. A great read, one bite at a time."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"The first book I have read by Mary Roach. I really really liked her. The research was hardly new to me though, and I wanted something ELSE. I liked her skeptical but open minded approaches to it all. This was nice refresher for me because I used to be SO into the paranormal, I haven't been into it in recent years so I did like everything she covered. She was funny but some parts went on a little too long for me taste when I thought the evidence wasn't there. I was hoping she would find ANYTHING new or different but the conclusions were just 'eh', 'no', or 'who knows'."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"People frequently confuse a breezy style, humor and ability to entertain with being superficial. While Mary Roach's latest book isn't quite as compelling as \\"Stiff\\" it's an enjoyable journey one step beyond. When Roach is serious (which pops up between very funny quips)she asks some important questions about the afterlife, our perception of it, ghosts and reincarnation. Perhaps it's the subtitle that disappoints people but having read \\"Stiff\\" I knew what to expect. If you come to this book ignoring the subtitle (this skeptical humorist tackles the afterlife and science although more about that later with a sense of humor but doesn't quantify the afterlife with science herself).Roach asks some penetrating questions with humor. For example, she discusses an author that discusses reincarnation, birthmarks and how a pregnant woman can see the corpse of someone. The soul of the slain man turns up in her child. Also, she discusses a pretty creative idea--emotional imprinting from an event that can leave birthmarks on the skin of the unborn creating a duplicate of a birthmark from the person whose soul has flown into the unborn child. She goes on a journey to investigate a family that claims their child has memories from a previous life and while going as an unbiased observer using humor and logic to deflate some of these unusual claims.Yet she's always hopeful. She relates the story of a computer that is used for near death experiences. She discusses Professor Bruce Greyson's experiment in near death experiences using a computer with images that can only be seen if you were hovering below the ceiling. Patients that have had defibrillators put in have their hearts stopped to see if their defibrillators are working (they should restart the patient's heart). Many people claim to have seen the attempt to revive them floating above their body. If that's the case they should be able to see the computer screen and tell Greyson what images are on it. She also takes a look at cases involving ghosts and other related areas.Roach focuses on the scientific approaches taken by various people to try and verify the afterlife's existence. This isn't a \\"science vs. faith\\" argument. Instead, this is an attempt to see if the scientific approach works or not in these various experiments. Roach asks some practical and hard questions about these various experiments, theories and researchers. The subject is more elusive here than in \\"Stiff\\" for obvious reasons. This isn't a book about faith. Roach is trying to find some solid basis for faith in the afterlife and that is going to continue to be challenging.Roach discusses in her afterword that she starts all of her books in complete ignorence of the subject. Does that provide her with a sense of the impartial attitude that journalists need to write material like this? I'm not sure but it does allow errors, holes and mistakes to occur. It also means that she really doesn't have a whole lot to prove. Regardless of whether \\"Spook\\" is as balanced and informed as it should be Roach asks some provocative questions and tries to find answers. You may not be enlightened but you will be entertained and the questions that Roach asks are always interesting. While the answers don't always hold up to scrutiny Roach's journey to discovery is always entertaining."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I can see where Ms. Roach probably found herself a bit cornered while exploring the subject of life after death. First, she doesn't want to turn this book into a sprawling tome that explores the meaning of human existence. She also doesn't want to go down the long road of exploring every spiritual quest ever taken on by humanity. Then there are considerations regarding strongly held religious feelings; you don't want to step on the wrong toes. So, I think Ms. Roach took the right approach to the book in exploring a few areas of possible interest, looking at them as objectively as possible and seeing if anything raises an eyebrow.So, the shortcomings of \\"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife\\" may not be so much the fault of the author. If you've ever watched a Bigfoot documentary, you know that you're going to be disappointed if you expect some hunter to emerge from the woods with an eight foot tall ape-man on a leash. Also, you know that the blurry footage is a guy in a gorilla suit, no matter how much you'd like to believe otherwise. These documentaries always jazz up the footage with a little editing and some scary music. That's because simply showing how unrealistic it is to believe in Bigfoot after all this time doesn't make for entertaining viewing. They're taking advantage of us because we want to be taken advantage of, just a little.Mary Roach respects us more than that and gives us what she can. Unfortunately, it doesn't make for very entertaining reading. The one thing that was really missing for me was that feeling of \\"Aha!\\". I understood that Ms. Roach couldn't take on everything regarding the subject but I wished it had been a little wider in scope. I would've liked a little more philosophical exploration and perhaps a bit of sociological and psychological examination regarding our views on death. I'm not suggesting Roach should have done an Elizabeth Kubler Ross examination on the process of dying or re-written \\"Being and Nothingness\\", but something to chew on in those areas wouldn't have been bad.I think there might have been a little more to touch on regarding the subject other than debunking soul weighers and psychic mediums. For instance, the culturally independent archetypes that we all share, or the discoveries in physics, mathematics, biology and philosophy that entice us to believe that there may be a God or at least a design. Then again, this book isn't called \\"Science tackles God\\", its called \\"Science tackles the Afterlife\\", but the discussion of one seems to so inevitably tie into the other, which once again leads to the complications I mentioned above.I can't let the author completely off the hook, though. \\"Spook\\" pales in comparison to Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\\", a book that deals with similar subject matter, and more, in a more thought provoking manner. I also have a new rule regarding review snippets claiming a book to be \\"Hillarious!\\"; they are never \\"Hillarious!\\". I think \\"Hillarious!\\" is book-critic speak for \\"the author makes occasional off-the-cuff comments.\\" Then again, Roach didn't need to re-write \\"The Demon Haunted World\\" and I don't get the impression that she would claim herself to be \\"hillarious!\\" Perhaps my greatest criticism of Roach's approach is that she sacrifices some of the exploration previously mentioned for long, detailed accountings of her research. I think she could have convinced the reader that she thoroughly explored the subject without giving us so much detail. She may have mistaken our enthusiasm for her own when it came to the minutiae of her subject. The few inset diagrams and photos never seem to get to the heart of what we want drawn out. Maybe she could have even stepped on a toe or two. Also, I don't know that science tackles the afterlife so much in \\"Spook\\" as does a healthy skepiticism. This is another trap; you really can't \\"prove\\" a negative.\\"Tackling the afterlife\\" may look like a wellspring to a writer looking for a subject, but it turns into a blind alley. I can't say that its entirely the author's fault, and I wouldn't dismiss other work from Mary Roach, but \\"Spook\\" never really finds its footing. I don't think that anyone expects to find the truth of our human destiny in this book, but they won't find much else, either. Inviting as this book may seem, both skeptics and those looking for something more than life has to offer will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"If you're tuned in to her boisterous, quirky sense of humor, you'll find Mary Roach's book will take you on a sprightly voyage around the earthly borders of the afterlife. Don't expect any serious examination of whether there is or can be any real evidence of something beyond those borders, and you'll enjoy the excursion.Building on the success of _Stiff_, her well-received survey on the world of corpses, our author advanced to the obvious next stage. She set out to write a book about secular investigations into the hereafter, beginning from a state of utter ignorance and friendly skepticism. She lets us look over her shoulder as she pokes around rather randomly into reincarnation research in India, the vaginal and gastric origins of ectoplasm, the accuracy of industrial scales used to weigh the soul, near death experiences, tape recordings of the long-dead in Donner Pass, and testimony from a ghost once allowed into evidence by a North Carolina court. She has a great deal of fun, much of it gossipy, some of it delightedly gross. The list of eminent men and women who have tried to cage and measure spirits is long. (I had no idea that Alexander Graham Bell's Mr. Watson was a devotee of spirit voices plucked from the ether.)Ms Roach is game for pretty much anything, enrolling for example in a school for mediums. Skepticism wins almost every round, though never too decisively, which might spoil the party. The most interesting research is into possible correlations between hauntings and (1) infrasound or (2) EMF, each of which can induce a sense of uncanniness in a certain percentage of the population.In sum, you will learn nothing substantial from the book, but it's not intended to resolve any serious questions. It's an entertaining, anecdote packed ramble through some of the fringe science community's haunted attics, under the aegis of a tour guide whose chatty, brassy style will turn off some tourists and enchant many others."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"For me, this book was okay. The source of my disatisfaction is what caused one reviewer here to give the book 5 stars. The writing was beautiful, but never said much. I almost wonder if Roach was afraid to go any deeper than a superficial analysis, like she was holding back or holding out.The information introduced is googleable and, in that sense, the book really doesn't add to the topic. It's a basic primer, that leaves you wanting more.I also would have liked pictures. At one point, I fanned through the book hoping there would be pictures to go with the prose. There weren't and I really feel this book would've benefited from some visual aids.The book is okay. The writing is beautiful, Roach has a gift for prose, but in this case, not for the subject."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"A potentially interesting book is ruined by Ms. Roaches condescension towards her subject, all in the name of getting laughs. Granted, I am as skeptical as she, but that doesn't mean that I am not capable of viewing a particular 19th century scientist's views in historical context - and allowing for how comparably little information he had at his disposal - before relegating him to a list of \\"nutters\\". It just happens one too many times in her book to be able to stomach; she's like an adult making fun of a first-grader for getting a math problem wrong. By being so quick with her put-downs, she quickly undermines her own premise that she is going into her investigation with an open mind. It doesn't help that the bulk of her research seems to have been acquired from Google searches (\\"If you go to such-and-such website...\\" or \\"A Google search shows that...\\" seems to pop up on every other page). If anyone can find this same stuff out with the click of a mouse, why do we need Ms. Roach's wisecracking attitude to navigate us through it?"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Let me begin by saying that Mary Roach is an excellent researcher and a deft writer. That's the good news. The bad news is that she is immature and there is way too much Mary in this book. Reading this book is like spending an afternoon with a precocious 12 year old boy. At first she is somewhat amusing, but quickly becomes ill-mannered, whiny, and rude. By the end of the afternoon, you are quite eager to return the boorish, annoying little brat to her parents. She has a mean streak, and when I say mean I'm talking Ann Coulter-mean. She makes fun of people's names, looks, dress, and how they talk. (As a researcher, this shows terribly bad form--you do not insult those who have been kind enough to help you write the book). She also an unsettling and frequent habit of including something gross every chance she gets. I lost count of the number of times she digressed into some tangent involving bodily functions. Then she has the nerve to write something like, \\"It's always underpants with these guys.\\" No, Mary, it's always underpants with YOU. The title of the book is meant to mislead, by the way (I'm sure Mary snickered when the publisher informed her about the chosen subtitle as she knew it would pull in the \\"suckers.\\") The title should actually be \\"A Skeptic's Cynical Guide to Wackos who Believe in the Afterlife.\\" Mary should not be allowed out of her room until she becomes a grown-up."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife. Mary RoachSpook provides a light-hearted look at the current status of research into the existence and survivability of the soul. Mary Roach calls it \\"a book for people who would like very much to believe in a soul and in an afterlife for it to hang around in, but who have trouble accepting these things on faith.\\" At the end of the book, she admits that she began this project \\"from a state of near absolute ignorance.\\" This is one of the book's most endearing features, since the reader gets a glimpse of how Ms. Roach goes about researching a topic.The book does not end up with a definitive answer. If science had proof for or against the afterlife, it would have been big news. So this is an exploration of the current state of the research. The author claims that she does not approach the topic as a debunking skeptic, but she does throw in a lot of humorous asides in an attempt to amuse as well as explore.Chapter One, \\"You Again,\\" is about reincarnation. Ms. Roach goes to India for a week to visit Kirti S. Rawat, director of the International Center for Survival. Her purpose is to accompany him as he examines a claimed case of reincarnation. She meets the child, his family, and the family of the deceased man that the child claims to be. She also runs into cultural differences in a society where many people believe in reincarnation and don't need scientific proof.The second chapter is a historic discussion on past research by people who believed there was a soul. Questions such as whether the soul came from the sperm or the ovum, or whether it entered the fetus at some point in its development are reviewed. Also looked at are those who searched for the exact bodily organ that contained soul.\\"How to Weigh a Soul\\" is the third chapter. It explores the research done to see if the soul has weight. If so, can a drop in weight at death be proof of the existence of the soul leaving? The famous experiment by Duncan Macdougall that determined the soul weighs 21 grams is reviewed as well as other more recent attempts. The fourth chapter goes on to look at the attempts to photograph or capture an image of the soul as it leaves the body.The next couple of chapters delve into the claims of mediums who say they can establish communication with departed spirits. Chapter 5 is a history of the attempts by mediums to produce ectoplasm, a physical manifestation of spirit energy. Chapter 6 then goes on to look at current research with gifted mediums at the VERITAS Research Program of the University of Arizona conducted by Gary Schwartz. This is followed by the author taking a Fundamentals of Mediumship course at Arthur Findlay College in England.Chapter 8 \\"Can You Hear Me Now?\\" looks into attempts to use technology to establish communication with dead souls. EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) on tape recorders and radio static is the current trend, but Ms. Roach also looks into the history of this field.Chapter 9 begins a section where Ms. Roach looks to see if physical phenomena, rather than spirits, may cause the feelings of contact with the beyond. First she visits Dr. Michael Persinger at the Consciousness Research Lab at Laurentian University in Sudbury Ontario. He is studying the ability of complex electromagnetic fields to produce hallucinations that might resemble contact with the dead. Chapter 10 looks into whether low frequency sound waves (10 - 20 hertz) could do the same thing. Ms. Roach visits Vic Tandy who teaches at Coventry University whose research is in this area.Chapter 11 is my personal favorite. It deals with a 1925 North Carolina ghost who appeared to his son to tell him where to find the most recent version of his will. The case went to court and the new will was accepted by the family. Both the old and new wills were on file in the courthouse, and Ms. Roach brings in the president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners. Although the family decided to accept the new will, it turns out to be a poor quality forgery. Yet the story of family intrigue is so interesting that the chapter left me wanting someone to write more about this case.The last chapter looks into what Mary Roach feels is the most promising of the current research to prove the existence of the soul. Based on the reports of people who have had Near Death Experiences (NDEs) who claim they felt themselves rising out of their bodies and looking down on the room they are in, this research places an object that can only be seen from the ceiling in rooms where people might possibly experience an NDE. Interviews are then conducted to see if they experienced an NDE and saw the object. This research is being conducted by Bruce Greyson at the University of Virginia.The books ends with a 13 page bibliography that goes chapter by chapter through the resources Mary Roach used for the book. Some may criticize her for attempting to write such a book without being an expert in the field. I find that her newness to the topic gives her a fresh unbiased perspective. However, I feel that she attempts to cover her inexperience with humor that sometimes detracts from the work. If you can endure the jokes, the information provided is well presented."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Having told us all about what happens to people's bodies after death in the funny and informative book -Stiff_, Mary Roach has gone beyond, to tell us what happens to their souls. Well, not exactly; there are lots of opinions on the matter, not necessarily religious ones, and she investigates the more-or-less scientific explanations in _Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife_ (W. W. Norton). And just because she has a fine sense of the absurd, she is quite at home writing about, and even visiting, the nutters who do not like our ignorance of the regions beyond death and have made it their mission to clear everything up. That they do not quite succeed is not at all surprising. There may be little scientific evidence of the actual existence of souls, and anyway, as supernatural entities they would not be fit subjects for scientific investigation. Humans have spent thousands of years wondering about what happens after death, and most religions have something to say upon the subject, but when we got to the scientific age it was time to start asking about the issue scientifically. A lot of silliness has ensued, much of it has amused Roach, and she has unflaggingly communicated her amusement to us in wisecracking prose that is just the right tone for such a subject.Perhaps the most famous scientific investigation of the soul was the one that discovered it weighed 21 grams, an amount that has even been turned into a movie title. Actually, Dr. Duncan Macdougall, a surgeon, reported the soul to weigh three-fourths of an ounce, but as Roach says, \\"Who's going to go see a movie called _Point Seven Five Ounces_?\\" In 1901, Macdougall weighed a patient at expiration and found the expected weight drop; it did not seem to bother him that he was confusing the issues about souls by making them material substances. Such research is not dead; Roach interviews Gerry Nahum, a medical school professor, who wants to weigh and do other thermodynamic research on souls, but is having trouble getting funding, even from the Catholic Church. Spiritualism is here, of course, and Roach even goes to a weekend school for spiritualists in England. She gets advice on readings that sounds like the basics for making a television career as a medium: \\"Stick with the everyday. Try to be general because there's a better likelihood you'll be right.\\" And she finds herself looking at her partner's clothes and accessories for clues. She comes away, though, with the realization that mediums are not intentionally duping their clients, but have duped themselves into thinking they are channeling information from paranormal sources, and they profit from eager and uncritical subjects. Overall, she is disappointed with what the dead are able to tell us. They ought to be bursting to tell us all about the afterlife that has been the subject of our curiosity ever since we understood what death was. Roach wants to know: \\"Hey, where are you now? What do you do all day? What's it feel like being dead? Can you see me? Even when I'm on the toilet? Would you cut that out?\\" We don't get good answers, and we don't good advice on stock tips. One spook informed us that the afterlife was just like Florida without the humidity, and that fat people are thin there.Roach goes to India to investigate those who are researching the return of spirits to new bodies, in a chapter delightfully titled \\"You Again: A Visit to the Reincarnation Nation.\\" Beware if you are a rogue Brahman, as the pertinent scriptures say you may reincarnate as \\"the ghost Ulkamukha, an eater of vomit.\\" She comes across people who feel that spirits are communicating with them by means of anomalies in their computers' spell-checkers, and find that explanation \\"less far-fetched than a software glitch.\\" She goes to the Donner Camp Picnic Ground (which is a real place) with researchers who think that electronic gadgets might pick up the voices of the cannibalized dead. There are indeed sounds recorded on the outing, but their significance is uncertain: the enthusiast with her heard, \\"I need more milk,\\" while she herself heard \\"a rapid, metallic \`gobba-lobba-ob.'\\" She is a generous interviewer, wide-eyed but not credulous. In fact, she applies a sensible skepticism to all her research, but comes to the conclusion that such a stance isn't much fun; when she jokes, \\"The debunkers are probably right, but they're no fun to visit a graveyard with,\\" she is merely confirming that science is going to have little to say in affirmation of the issue, but we will keep wondering. It's a fine end to a book that has a huge amount of arcane knowledge and good humor in it. Where else, after all, are you going to find out that Elizabeth Taylor reported a near-death experience, but was pushed out of the spirit world and back to Earth by her husband Mike Todd who had gone before her. Roach adds, \\"Whether this was done for her benefit or his is not clear.\\""},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"My husband and I heard the interview with Mary Roach on NPR independently of each other. It was the first time either one of us felt compelled to buy a book immediately. We were going by a book store that night so popped in and purchased it (after much searching with staff help). Spook was not disappointing! Roach's witty but irreverent style of writing is most entertaining. She tackles, from a very unscientific position, science's search for the soul, ghosts, spiritual mediums, reincarnation, out-of-body experiences and the like. I laughed the whole time I was reading it and not until the last line do we find out if she is a believer or skeptic. I am going to recommend this to my book club even. I've already recommended it to a number of friends.After finishing Spook, I went out and bought her book, Stiff. I enjoyed learning about what happens to cadavers but I don't think my book club would be as keen on it. It maybe a touch gory for some.I certainly look forward to Roach's next book. My hope is that she writes about consciousness next!"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Whatever the topic or format, Ms. Roach brings to her work a wonderfully wry sense of irony. This book is no exception; it will keep you laughing and leave you wondering how we humans survive our own bizarre preoccupations and ambitions. Ms. Roach also has a unique gift of compassion and empathy, seasoned with rigorous skepticism, and is apparently completely without pretense. She gets quickly to the heart of any matter without ever losing heart or rubbing the noses of fools in their own folly.This book is similar in format to her first book, Stiff; it is comprised of a series of chapters in which Ms. Roach looks over someone's shoulder as that person goes about business. In Stiff, we learned of the many ways cadavers are used; in Spook, we learn of attempts to validate the existence and nature of the soul, or some entity that endures beyond a single body's mortal life. While the subjects in Stiff were mostly to be admired for pursuing valuable science no matter how revolting, the subjects in this book are often far afield anything most readers would call science or, in some cases, reality. To appreciate the work of the denizens of Spook, one must value the subjects for their hearts and aspirations instead of appreciating their scientific contributions.In Stiff, each chapter brought us to a new and different question of scientific process and ethics. In every new setting, a remarkable wealth of collateral information, fascinating asides, and thoughtful consideration illuminated the purpose and value of some individual's unique and arcane pursuit. Spook is similarly packed with information, all of it delightful and surprising. Due to the nature of the topic, the author's research took her to a far broader set of disciplines than just science and ethics. This is truly a work of cultural history and psychology as well as a study of how people use and abuse scientific methods.Whether your background and affinities lean towards or away from science, this book will entertain and inform you. It is a delightful consideration of, and example of, the human capacity to explore, connect, hope, dream and laugh."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Granted, it's a logical progression but Mary Roach's choice of book subjects does make a person wonder. Her first book was Stiff: The Curious Life of Human Cadavers. She's now followed that with Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife. Fortunately, the latter is told with the same light touch and playfulness as the former.Roach truly is interested in the scientific and rational aspects of what happens after death. Her tone and writing style, though, make reading about an otherwise somber subject relatively enjoyable. Her approach is seen in the introduction, where she indicates the types of questions that led her on this quest:What happens when we die? Does the light go out and that's that -- the million-year nap? Or will some part of my personality, my me-ness, persist? What will that feel like? What will I do all day? Is there a place to plug in my laptop?What she proceeds to examine is a mix of the scientific and non-scientific and the serious and almost laughable from the world over. Roach herself admits that she's engaged in a \\"random\\" exploration of the topic, \\"spirituality treated as crop science\\" as she describes it.The range is seen in her discussion of spiritualists and mediums. This topic alone takes her and the reader from examining a piece of ectoplasm in the archives of the Cambridge University library that was allegedly emitted by a spiritualist in 1939 to laboratory tests of mediums at the University of Arizona to a \\"fundamentals of mediumship\\" class at the self-proclaimed \\"world's foremost college for the advancement of spiritualism and psychic sciences\\" in Stansted, England.Roach goes far beyond mediumship, though. Spook looks at projects that aim at having people die while on a scale. The purpose? To see if a weight loss occurs at the moment of death, perhaps indicating whether a soul or something else leaves the body at the time of death. She travels to India to accompany a philosophy professor who is trying to systematize investigation of claimed reincarnations. She ventures into a soundproof booth in Canada where tests are underway to see if electromagnetic fields are what enable people to see ghosts (or hallucinate them). She joins a tour group trying to record ghosts of the Donner Party in an exploration of electronic voice phenomena, voices that mysteriously show up on tape although not heard at the scene.Roach makes clear from the outset and reminds throughout that she is in search of proof, not belief. Spook ultimately reaches no definitive conclusions about what happens when we die. That's because, from the standpoint of proof as opposed to belief, there are none. Still, the search is not only an intriguing journey, her survey also impacts what she, and perhaps the reader, ultimately believes."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I really enjoyed this writer's style of writing. I found that her self-reference made her research more transparent. You knew where she was coming from and where her prejudice's were. I felt she did well keeping an open mind throughout.This book was particularly helpful to me because it gave a pretty thourough explanation of the soul weighing experiments to see if body weight changed at the time of death and included modern thoughts on the subject. (I had been searching for this for my literature review about beliefs concerning the soul.) For instance, most descriptions don't go father than to say the experiments were not done thouroughly, but I was not aware that this was because of pressure from the hospital against the experiments.I did find parts of the book had too much info, but I think that was because I was focused on the soul specifically. If you want to learn about what research was done on ectoplasm, experiments on alternative theories about ghosts, and experiments about mediums this is a good place to look.Its a great book for anyone who enjoy's learning details and odd facts about an unusual topic."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This is a great read. I love Mary Roach's mix of information and humor. Fits right in with the rest of her great books. I can not wait for the next."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I almost didn't read this book -- I waited from 2005 until 2013 to pick it up, because science and the supernatural do not belong in the same book title. I sorta knew Roach would have to investigate NDEs and reincarnation and apocryphal ghost stories, and would have to conclude that there is no proof of anything supernatural.And she does.Her style is always witty & entertaining (like the columnist she is) and the book was a pleasant diversion, even knowing exactly what I would be getting. But she was a bit too credulous for my taste, a bit too willing to ascribe supernatural causes to coincidence and ambiguity, while ignoring the much larger issue that there is no credible explanation for how the personality could survive brain death.For failing to conclusively destroy the faith of the gullible, she loses two stars."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I totally enjoyed Mary Roach's book &#34;Stiff&#34;, this one not so much. I expected a more thorough search thru the many different modes of contacting &#34;the beyond&#34;, but I was disappointed with the limited scope."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I am fascinated by the after life or the possibility of an after life and by near death experiences. I loved reading this book for the scientific approach that Mary Roach took. I also enjoyed the personal stories and recounted experiences. It is a great read."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Mary Roach comes through as the most skeptical and hilarious writer on the afterlife, the soul, and similar metaphysical beliefs. Don't read it if you are not willing to be challenged on some of your metaphysical beliefs. Enjoy it if you are ready to let go of them."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"From the author who gave you \\"Packing For Mar's\\", \\"Stiff\\", \\"Bonk\\" and \\"Gulp\\"...

Between \\"ectoplasm\\", \\"mediums\\" and \\"The Vienna Sausage Affair\\"..."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This is just pure entertainment. Mary Roach disguises her non-fiction as fiction so that you learn things without realizing it. I'm amazed at how thoroughly she delves into her subjects, both the topics and the people she interviews. I find myself laughing out loud at topics that normally should be both serious and morbid as she turns them inside out to show us how they are really structured; often very different from how we percieve them in our daily lives. Also she takes on things we don't often admit, even to ourselves, that we are interested in. So if you want a fun ride and pick up some unusual information along the way, then pick up this book, as well as her others (this was my second one of hers I've read, Stiff being the first)."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Precise, realistic,and informatiive without being boring. Well written and intertaining with additional information and referances if you choose to investigate more. This author is not for the faint of heart as she is very factual and realistic in her writing. She really makes you think and question our existance."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I am not a writer... Not much to write besides the fact that EVERYONE should read Mary Roach. She is hilarious, brilliant, and intelligent."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"KOOKS. For that's all it is: a series of meetings with people who mainstream citizens consider \\"kooks\\" for their outlandish ideas (trying to quantify the soul, for example. She even includes an interview with someone from my former alma mater, Stanford. My view of that eminent institution sinks . . . )The first essay in the book is the best. Not because of the research, or any new revelations about reincarnation (which is the focus of the first essay), but because it functions as more of a travel piece (since much of it takes place in India). The dialogue between Roach and her companion, a Dr. XXXXX, is hilarious. Mary Roach, you are a keen observer of human foibles. Turn your next book into a travel piece, and I am sure you will be the next Paul Theroux."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I purchased this book half based off of reviews I read here and half based off of really liking Stiff and Boink!. Unfortunately, as many other has stated, the premise of the book is a little tough to maintain scientific neutrality on and Mary Roach falls off the neutrality wagon many times. Many parts of the book were rehashing of parascientific issues that were debunked forever ago, but the parts that weren't were approached with a nearly distainful attitude that made her studies hard to read.However, the book wasn't horrible. There was enough of the typical Mary Roach humor to make it enjoyable over all. While I wouldn't run out for this book, I am glad that I did sit down and spend a few hours reading it."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I think Mary Roach is a hilarious writer. Ever since I read Stiff, I've been waiting in anticipation for her next book. In Spook Roach jumps from the physical to the metaphysical. Whereas Stiff examined the ultimate fate of cadavers, Spook looks to the soul. In particular, the book examines scientists' efforts to to offer measurable proof of the existence of the soul, and their attempts to understand what happens to immaterial parts of personhood after death. To give a full picture of these efforts Roach's research takes her across cultures and continents. She brings us the story of the woman who could vomit large quantities of fabric on demand in the name of talking to the dead. She writes of doctors who attached dying consumptives to giant scales. As with her other work, Spook is infused with Roach's sense of humor and her clear fascination with the bizarre. The stranger it gets, the happier Roach seems to be. This book is, without question, a rollicking good read. Beyond pure enjoyment, Roach book also shows just how enmeshed certain sectors of the scientific community have become, in the past two centuries, in matters of belief. The very premise of this book, and what unifies these stories, is an attempt to merge seemingly incompatible thought systems. Ever since the arguments in Kansas and the Dover, PA school board case, the ability, and the desirability of merging these two thought systems in the name of education has become an issue of political significance. Roach's study suggests that scientists and lay people have been involved in efforts to merge the physical and metaphysical arts. It shows that at significant points in the past, large numbers of people have been drawn to efforts to apply science to faith; see, for example, her chapter on spiritualism. The experts involved, however, (scientists, doctors, etc.) have ususally been marginal figures, on the fringes of their fields, or at least respected only in their work outside of the supernatural. Obviously, the scientific question of the afterlife is never going to create the firestorm generated by evolution/creationism/intelligent design. The general consensus remains that afterlife is a matter of faith, not science. Public schools have little need or desire to teach about the fate of the soul. That is the work of clerics and philosophers. But here lies the great irony. It is precisely because there is such widespread agreement in the western world on the division of body and soul, that attempts to bring science to bear of matters of the spirit and the immortal may be able to proceed without the criticism and argument generated by by similar battles in which the divisions seem less clear."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Mary Roach has followed up her 2005 book, Stiff, with Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, which is even more clearly a book of interest for skeptics. With the same sense of humor, frequent use of interesting asides and footnotes, and a strong skepticism, she looks at attempts to apply science to the question of life after death. Spook covers experiments designed to locate a soul and find out what happens when you die. She looks at studies of reincarnation by Ian Stevenson and Kirti Rawat, the attempts to weigh the body at the time of death and see if it loses weight by Duncan Macdougall, attempts to X-ray the soul by Arthur Goodspeed. She went to Cambridge University and looked at their sample of Helena Duncan's vaginally-extruded ectoplasm from the archives of the Society for Psychical Research, which she describes as a ten foot by three foot piece of cotton fabric. She talks to Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona about his tests with Allison DuBois, who inspired the TV series \\"Medium,\\" and points out the criticisms of them by Univ. of Oregon psychologist and Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry Ray Hyman. She visits spiritualists, looks at Electronic Voice Phenomena or EVP, and tries out the \\"God Helmet\\" of Laurentian University psychologist Michael Persinger, and correctly expresses more skepticism about his work than some skeptics have. She looks at a couple of cases of claimed ghosts, at Warwick Castle in England, and the ghost of James Chaffin in North Carolina. And she looks at studies of near-death experiences. In the end, she is open-mindedly skeptical--she ends by saying \\"the debunkers are probably right,\\" but chooses to believe in ghosts anyway because it's more fun."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I gave this book a go, but put it down after the first few chapters failed to grab my attention. Then I picked it up again several months later, skipped over some of the old-school science chapters (like How to Weigh a Soul) and was thoroughly entertained throughout the rest of the book. Not quite as sharp and witty as Stiff, it was still a great book and Roach knows how to do her research and present it in a fun and engaging way. The final two chapters were definitely the best and most captivating. Her momentum kept building as the book approached its conclusion. I would have enjoyed it a bit more had it maintained that level throughout, but instead I was disinterested in the very first chapter on reincarnation and was daunted by the few proceeding it. Over all, it was well worth it for the read for the last half of the book, and I know I'll be interested in the next morbid topic Roach decides to tackle for her next book."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"The hysterical Mary Roach brings us yet another masterpiece with her latest book \\"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife.\\" Author of the acclaimed work \\"Stiff: The Curious Life of Human Cadavers,\\" Roach investigates the way science has tried to prove or disprove the existence of the human soul. With side-splitting humor and witty prose, Roach amuses and enlightens the reader at every turn.If you have never had the pleasure of reading Mary Roach, I highly recommend both Spook and Stiff. Roach is able to take subjects that might normally make the reader squeamish and turns them into laugh-riots. I found Spook to be highly entertaining and just plain fun to read. If you are looking for something new and different, look no further than Mary Roach"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Now I have read some bad audio books before, but this has to be one of the worst. First of all, the woman who reads the story evidently has never read an audio book before, she tries to make it seem very exciting, and it is not. The story doesn't really have much to do with the afterlife, it's just her story about her journey to speak with people who are supposedly afterlife experts, and they are not. I feel bad but I listen to audio books often and this is just the worst one i've ever heard, and I've heard about 100."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I was given this book for Christmas, a time many of us think as magical, a time some feel is filled with the spirit of God. They believe like a child, that there is more to us than trivial deadlines, PDAs, credit cards and cell phones. Perhaps it is unfair, reading this book during the Christmas Holiday, but I was put off with Roach's cutsy humor when she examined some of man's pitiful attempts to see beyond the bar of life.I had recently finished reading a book about the life of Marconi, and with modern hindsight, the laughable \\"science\\" of radio communications at the turn of the 20th century. The author of the Marconi book was able to describe those early, pitiful times well and yet refrain from fart jokes. Made it a better read. But then,a book about life after death is more serious than a book about radio, so maybe we need to hear a joke or two while we walk through the Valley of the Shadow.Roach traveled well for this book, from San Francisco to India and points between. She did great detective work too, as the thick bibliography proves. She uncovered quite a few obscure and interesting ideas (EMF causing hallucinations, using radio to hear the dead) which made the book a page turner. For balance, I would have liked to have read something about the Australian Aborigine and their 45 thousand year old culture. Steeped in Dreamtime, they may have had a thing or two to say about telepathy. And better yet, no one is paying them to do psychic tricks.Although I enjoyed this book, I felt that this story was being told at a San Francisco wine party. Almost everyone was laughing at the joke, the absurdity of an afterlife, and the fools who suffer trying to prove it while charlatan profiteers discredit it. Everyone is laughing, except for those who are facing death in the now and not the later, those who are looking for hope, and not a joke."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I listen to audio books while driving in the car. I've learned that there are two components that influence my opinion of an audio book: the author and the reader. The book itself has to be written well, and the book reader has to read it well. If either fails to deliver, then the book fails.Roach's descriptions of the history and the personalities involved in exploring the survival of bodily death were for the most part excellent. But the reader of the audio book, Bernadette Quigley, made an otherwise interesting book seem grating, amateurish and heartless. Quigley attempted to act out her interpretation of Roach's text with a variety of bad accents and over-embellishments.From the listener's point of view, this is very bad because it's easy to forget that you're not listening to Roach herself, but rather to an actor. The effect is that your opinion of Roach becomes seriously degraded, which is unfortunate since she wasn't to blame. The producer of this audio book should have told Quigley to stop acting and just read.I'd give this audio book version 1 star, but Roach's talent for writing is much better than that, so I'll give it 3 stars overall."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Clever and very well written.

She has a humorous and easy style of writing, but in this case, that's a problem rather than an asset. Although the book is an intersting read, it never really explores the questions I was hoping it would. It's a report of the author's experiences as she \\"researches\\" certain subjects, but there is no in-depth discussion of the issues or the research or experiential data. It's a fascinating field, but this book is more like the Hallmark card version."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Mary Roach is a para-skeptical wanna-be-believer, so it's not surprising that Spook is an odd mix of contradictions. At its core, Spook tries to be a skeptical science-based book about life-after-death while mixing in heavy doses of parapsychology. The book primarily relates anecdotal accounts of reincarnation, mediums, and near-death experiences, with Roach complaining all the way about anecdotal information. Roach talks science with academicians, while apologizing (correctly) about how little science she understands. So goes Spook.Roach has an easy and humorous writing style, possibly saving this unfocused and frustrating book. There is much in Spook that is interesting. The opening story about reincarnation, where villagers in India believe that some children retain memories from their past lives, was intriguing. But rather than giving this story some closure, when Roach's two week visit ended, so did the story. The sudden ending had to frustrate Roach; did she intend it to also frustrate the reader? Many other sections in Spook are similarly frustrating. Something interesting gets started, but time and money forced an ending, and that was that.It is not easy to see who would like Spook. Although I was often amused, and appreciated Roach's easy-to-read prose, I wished at the end of the book that I had spent my time elsewhere. Persons more inclined toward Roach's state of wanna-be-believer, and less in factual hard information, might end up being happier with Spook."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"In Spook reporter Mary Roach delves into the world of paranormal research to bring to light modern science's tenuous relationship with the afterlife. Like Stiff and Bonk, Roach's writing is peppered with anecdotes and diverting travel stories, although her own voice is far more aggressive towards her subject than her other two publications (born from Roach's own skepticism, no doubt). While Spook is both interesting and entertaining I believe Roach is at her best when she approaches more quantifiable subjects, leaving Spook at the bottom of the Roach-stack."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Exactly what I thought it would be.

Having been a Navy nurse myself during the VietNam war, I heard many accounts of military nurses during that war. But this is my first read about Iraq. I found it to be truly a terrific book. It was like reading Cheryl's personal diary of her every day encounters and struggles while serving in Iraq. I kept thinking that this was a relatively short time in that country. And I try to imagine what it must be like for the military who are there for a much greater amount of time. Reading about her experiences has given me a look at how much those soldiers must endure daily for perhaps a year or more. It makes me wonder how any human being can survive living in that country under those conditions and fighting for their lives and others at the same time.Obviously, Cheryl survived to return home, landing in the U.S. under her own ability to walk off that airplane. Reading about the war, makes me appreciate more what these men and women do for our country every day. It helps me know that they deserve much credit and support for their efforts and also makes me very sad to know that there are some who only return home in body bags. I'm very patriotic and proud of our troops. As an ex-Navy nurse, I applaud all they do and am proud to read of Cheryl's \\"adventures\\" in Iraq knowing she served our country and did what she needed to do. A terrifying time indeed but she gave us insight into that war and our military's endurance and dedication.I'm so glad I read this book.

It was an amazing read."},{"Title":"Ruff's War: A Navy Nurse on the Frontline in Iraq","review":"I was not impressed with this book at all. As a hospital corpsman who has served in Iraq I couldn't help but laugh at the complaints of CDR Ruff. We all endured the same situations in Iraq and unfortunately some of us had to be deployed for a lot longer then 122 days. I picked up the book excited to read about someone elses perspective on the war, I was very disappointed to read only about how miserable one person was on her very brief deployment. Iraq is what you make of it, and complaining only makes it worse. Don't get me wrong I have great respect for the patient care but thats where my apprectiation for this book ends."},{"Title":"Ruff's War: A Navy Nurse on the Frontline in Iraq","review":"We are now beginning to see the first person reports of people coming back from serving in Iraq. It's only when you start to get the books that you can begin to make sense out of what's happening. The newspapers and especially the television reports are so brief, so headline oriented that you can't get the real story. And it will be ten or more years before the history books come out to put the whole story of the war into perspective.Cdr. Ruff's story is one of a Navy nurse operating in close support to the Marines during the invasion of Iraq. She served with the 'Devil Docs' made famous by the embedded reporter Dr. Sanjay Gupta an embedded correspondent from CNN. This unit performed numerous surgeries under trying conditions on Marines, Iraqi prisoners of war, and Iraqi civilians. Cdr.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Ruff's War: A Navy Nurse on the Frontline in Iraq","review":"The parts covering actual medical topics were very good.

This account provides a detailed, vivid, personal account with a balance between facts and feelings which allows the reader to easily place themselves in the situation, the litmus test for any author! As a retired Navy nurse and experienced author, I would say to those who would critize this account as being contradictory to their experience, \\"muster up the courage and time to write your own personal wartime experience\\". We need more personal accounts of wartime, not cheap shots at those who have stepped up to the plate!"},{"Title":"Ruff's War: A Navy Nurse on the Frontline in Iraq","review":"I was in the Navy myself.

The writing style is accessible an not pretentious.As a young critical care nurse joining the military as a reservist andhoping to someday become a CRNA I am so grateful that the author shared her experience in this memoir. An invaluable read. Many memorable moments she described will stick with me."},{"Title":"Ruff's War: A Navy Nurse on the Frontline in Iraq","review":"I'm planning on entering the Navy Nurse Corps after I graduate from college. I've been searching for books about Navy nurses and found no luck, but when I found Ruff's War I was very excited. The author gets into the life of a hospital corpsman (woman in this case) and then as a Navy nurse anestic. The tours in the Middle East were the most enjoyable for me because I realize I may go to Iraq one day... but at least Ruff is honest about the life style over there. She adapted as best she could without complaining. Her bravery as a nurse goes beyond heroic and I'm glad she wrote the book. I want to do any type of nursing in the military. I believe this is a must read for any nurses who are thinking about nursing in the military or who want to know what the life is of a military nurse."},{"Title":"Ruff's War: A Navy Nurse on the Frontline in Iraq","review":"I am doing a senior thesis on women in wartime and was eager to read this book. However, after reading the stories of women trapped on Bataan in WWII and the nurses in Vietnam and Korea I felt that this one fell short. Not that her story isn't a good one, but it was rather trite. She seemed to complain A LOT about the sand, and while that sucks at least she was getting 2-3 nutritionally balanced meals a day whereas in WWII those nurses were starving slowly. I think her tour was too short to Really get a feel for the war, also she was just gassing them and moving on. Not actually performing the surgery. The more I read the more I felt like this was an excuse to get a novel out there. I look forward to reading the memoirs of the soldiers who are still in Iraq and have been for months and months now. Out of All the books I have read, her tour was the shortest, the least bloody, the most safe and she complained more than any of the others. I appreciate that she wants to share what Iraq was like and is proud to be a caregiver... but I didn't like this novel At All."},{"Title":"Ruff's War: A Navy Nurse on the Frontline in Iraq","review":"If you can survice the \\"What I Did on My Summer Vacation\\" writing style, it's worth reading.

She seemed more interested in walking off to the exchange than refilling the oxygen tanks. I really remember that time when she took her 9mm and waived it around at chest level saying \\"I need help opening it\\" as we all hit the deck hoping not to get shot. As other CRNA's did the work, and stepped up to the plate and saved he lives of Marines and solders; they were not off writing about it away from the surgical tents."},{"Title":"Hero-Surfing","review":"There's a rare richness, both of accomplishment and of imagination, in &quot;Hero-Surfing,&quot; Anne Sheldon's first full-length book of poetry. Sheldon is a rare contemporary poet who can inhabit the halls of history as a familiar, bringing figures such as Henry V and Catherine of Valois to pulsing life while keeping them absolutely true to their 15th-century world view. She feels no compulsion to condescend to them by making them &quot;modern.&quot; Sheldon is just as impressive when she addresses the topics of our own day, as in her moving poem, &quot;September 10, 2001:&quot; &quot;Bless you, toy plane in the sky,/preparing to land an hour late/amid the usual complaints.&quot; Sheldon is also that rarity, a 21st-century poet who writes moving and inspiring religious poetry. Her poem, &quot;The Last Breakfast,&quot; which closes the book, will haunt you whether or not you believe in Jesus: &quot;Surely they will smell the coffee and turn./How far he's come to make their coffee./Surely he won't be forced/To work another miracle./Surely, surely they will turn.&quot;"},{"Title":"How to Build Your Chess Opening Repertoire","review":"One shouldn't be confused when buying this book without the luxury of browsing it. This isn't a book recommending a certain opening as such. It's geared more toward someone who doesn't have a opening repertoire, jumps from opening to opening, or have faced roadblocks in deciding what opening to play.Steve Giddens introduces these possible familiar themes in the books introduction:- Most of us blame the opening for our defeat, unjustifiably- We never say, \\"If only I knew endgames better\\" or \\"If I could play fixed-pawn games better.\\"- We resign to saying, \\"It's that opening, I always lose with it. I'll have to give it up.\\"- Players under master strength spend a disproportionate time on studying openings.- We gain very little from this time wasted, due to constant switching around of openings, rote memorization w/o understanding, trusting authority rather than our own ideas, etc.- Too few players understand HOW to learn an opening and develop a repertoire.- Due to spending too much time on the opening, we seriously neglect the other areas.- When we lose, we usually blame the openings, oblivious to the fact that we lost because of our endgame, etc., then spend yet MORE time on another opening- This book will help you develop an opening repertoire. It won't guarantee wins, but will set you down the correct path, and help you see the true reason for losses, which is rarely the opening.The book then covers the following:How building a repertoire allows a player to become very familiar in certain positions, but can result in a limited view on the game, being only proficient with certain pawn structures, etc. An prime example being Fischer, who played the Najdorf and KID almost exclusively. But how today, with the incredible ease of accessing games through computer databases, that masters can 'bookup' against players with fixed systems. This can happen at your local clubs, as well.How growing pains exist in learning a new opening, and how it can take months or years to get comfortable with it. Example games are given when grandmasters have deviated from their familiar starting grounds only to show their lack of experience with their new opening show through in the middlegame (ie - Ulhmann, a French Defense player, starting out with the Caro-Kahn...Karpov, starting with a Sicilian Defense, etc.)How a player shouldn't be concerned with memorizing the latest theory on move 13 of the QGD. A game of Nigel Short's (playing White) introduces a novelty in an opening where previous White tries resulted in difficulties. Nigel plays a move after assessing the position and following his plan. \\"I have a terrible memory,\\" he explained, assuring the reader even more how great moves are made by understanding the position, and not through memorization or playing what's in vogue.Whether to play 'Main line' or 'Side variations'. Whether to play offbeat opening or classical ones. Also, a chapter covering reverse openings (ie - King's Indian Attack, etc.), with a move in hand are discussed. He discusses the misconception of these openings - \\"If the King's Indian is good with Black, it must be fantastic with White.\\" Yet, he give much explanation that these openings tend to lack the 'oomph', and that the extra move in hand, surprisingly, tends to be a disadvantage.How a player should have his game assessed to determine his style and what openings he should consider playing.When studying an opening, to beware of transpositions into lines you may be unprepared for (ie - Having mastered the Queen's Gambit, Exchanged variation and Queen's Indian, your opponent tricks you with 1. d4 e6 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.c4 d5!, and now you're in lines where your prepared Exchange Variation loses it's punch as Nc3 hasn't been played.The book at the end covers a dozen or so players and their repertoire, and each chapter's main theme is supported by at least a few example games. The book itself is also made of good quality paper and should last for quite a while.The book is an interesting read, with quite a few games backing up all of the book's major points. As mentioned, it isn't a book you go over in preparation for a tournament, but acts as more of a guide for those who have become lost in the sea of opening theory and need a little wake-up call. This book is not at all a must-have book, and if you're under expert, you shouldn't be concerned so much with booking up as you should be other parts of the game, as it's returns are diminished. But for those who have become addicted to opening theory (you know who you are), or if you're a strong player who has yet to developed a proper repertoire and isn't sure where to start, this book may be a decent guide."},{"Title":"How to Build Your Chess Opening Repertoire","review":"This is the single most useful opening book I have read. It's really a \\"meta-opening book\\" - advising the reader on how to approach opening study, rather than teaching any single variation.Giddings' advice, in a nutshell, is to pick just a few compatible openings, e.g. IQP systems for White and Black, and thoroughly learn the opening variations, typical middlegame ideas, and resulting endings. He backs up his opinions with plenty of examples, and the result is a pleasure to read.I wish I'd had this when I first became serious about tournament chess!

The author illustrates his points with a few examples and much more text than chess moves.Giddins chapter on transpositions is a delight; it shows a few example of how world class players handle the opening to achieve the positions they want to play as well as how to avoid being &quot;move ordered&quot;.Also the chapter on computer use in chess has an interesting example of a accidental discovery of a strong continuation in a variation of the Petroff Defense that led Anand to win a convinging game against Kramnik.His views on how to build/change one's repertoire surely will help the reader. I recommend it for those that are more serious about the game, from club players to those aiming at FIDE title norms."},{"Title":"How to Build Your Chess Opening Repertoire","review":"As a former chess master desiring to start playing tournament chess again, this book gave me insight into how the game has changed since I last played. How computers and databases have made it desirable to develop a broader repertoire, the importance of move order to avoid certain variations of the Benoni that gave me problems when I used to play and are still hard for black to meet. (It was helpful for the book just to identify which variations were the problematical ones). The book also reviewed recent broad theory on other lines like the Grunfeld and which variations were currently critical. This book was easy to read through from beginning to end, more like a treatise and less as a reference. (Therefore, it was okay to get the Kindle version, since reading the book did not involve jumping ahead and back much). This book was as ideal for me as I could hope to expect, much more on point than &#8220;Mastering the chess openings&#8220;."},{"Title":"How to Build Your Chess Opening Repertoire","review":"Very good for beginner through intermediate players.

Chesterton is a good author, and many of his works have deeply impressed me. This story not least of all. If you are a Christian, this book will encourage you, and by that I mean it will give you courage. The story isn't new. It's the classic tale of a dreadful battle, with unbeatable odds . The end hardly matters, of course, and the journey is brilliantly narrated by Chesterton."},{"Title":"The ballad of the White Horse","review":"I purchased this 1950 edition of *The Ballad of the White Horse* used and recommend it for home schooling families and Christian schools because it contains a 39-page teaching guide, three articles (\\"Living Values in the Ballad,\\" \\"Historical Background of the Ballad,\\" and \\"The White Horse in Reality and Symbol\\") as well as a biographical sketch of G. K. Chesterton. As a Roman Catholic, Chesterton approached his topic from the Catholic perspective, but the basic theme of the ballad should resonate with all Christians. Though Chesterton died before World War II and the cultural wasteland that followed in Europe and the United States, he correctly anticipated in this ballad the triumph of Freudianism, nihilism, atheism, evolution, fascism, communism, neo-paganism and theories of racial superiority that dominated twentieth-century Europe and have not yet run their course. If you think a young reader might respond better to a copy with new binding, let me report that I had this book on my coffee table while I was reading it, and more than one visiting student picked it up and thumbed through it, which tells me that serious young readers are not put off by the somewhat outdated drawing on the cover. Perhaps it was even the drawing that drew them to the book. The language and theme of the book shine in any edition, but as far as I can determine, only this edition has the ancillary material."},{"Title":"The ballad of the White Horse","review":"I'm not sure what the publishers were thinking when they chose a picture of a white horse and a cowboy as the cover illustration for this great poem about the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon king, Alfred the Great.

A retelling of the Alfred the Great's defeat of Guthrum and the Danes at the Battle of Ethandune (or the victory of the true power of Christianity over the inherent weakness of paganism), written to be read aloud or to oneself (but please do read it aloud).

Chesterton died in 1936 and The Ballad was written years before that, yet he could already foresee the bitter harvest that would come as a result of the growth of utilitarian humanism. The Ballad is the powerful retelling of the story of King Alfred's ultimate triumph over the invading Danes, despite repeated losses, decimated forces and overwhelming adversity. It's a great story of a significant moment in history, but in it Chesterton also teaches us much we can apply in our own cultural wars against the forces of the &quot;New Dark Ages&quot;. He brings his prodigious intellect and wit to the task and in so doing offers hope to the &quot;men signed of the cross of Christ (going) gaily in the dark&quot;. The book is filled with memorable quotations and insights that will leave readers inspired to perservere in the face of their own adversities. It is abook worth owning and cherishing for the ages!"},{"Title":"The ballad of the White Horse","review":"GK Chesterton, who took his Christianity very seriously, published in 1911 this beautiful and moving ballad about Alfred the Great, who also took his Christianity most seriously when he drove the pagan Danes from his land in the 9th century. It is a measure of how far Western civilization has sunk that, today, both Chesterton and Alfred would be considered fanatics, insensitive and most opposed to diversity. Particularly alien to the modern mind would be the response of the Danish king, who, after Alfred impossibly beats his forces, becomes convinced that Alfred's Christian faith must be true, and is baptized!'For not til the night's blue slate is wipedOf its last star utterly,And fierce new signs writ there to read,Shall eyes with such amazement heed,As when a great man knows indeedA greater thing than he.'The language is powerful, compelling, demanding that the poem be read aloud. This edition has very helpful historical notes by Sister Bernadette Sheridan--even the well educated will need them. An inspirational work of faith, from Alfred and GK. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The ballad of the White Horse","review":"I had read some of Chesterton's fictional books, most of which contain poems which he has written, and I very much enjoyed his poems, so I decided to get a book of his poetry. This too I really enjoyed, so I decided to get another book of his poetry, this time it was The Ballad of the White Horse, and this book simply blew away all of the rest of Chesterton's poems. In fact, it simply blows away most poems by anyone. I have read Dante's Divine Comedy, Milton' Paradise Lost, Eliot's Wasteland, Chaucer's Canturbury Tales, etc., but I can honestly say that I enjoyed this epic far more than any of them. I am not saying that it is a better written poem or that it should be ranked above these classics, but I am saying that it is much more exciting to read than the others. Somehow Chesterton makes his poem involving: you are drawn into it and cannot put the book down until you have finished the chapter. He wrote it in such a way that the verses beg to be read quickly, and as I read I found myself reading faster and faster, until I was stumbling over the words and had to slow down again. Chesterton, like no other poet whom I know of, paints a picture of glory, honor, bravery, and captures the true spirit of an idealized Medieval War. The poem resounds with the drums of doom, the cries of angels, the hordes of invading barbarians and great deeds of heroes of old. If I were to recommend owning one epic poem, this would be the one.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"The ballad of the White Horse","review":"A stirring epic poem with a message important for the future of western civilization...to act on hope when there is no longer any hope...

It is the crowning glory of Christendom's greatest wordsmith."},{"Title":"The ballad of the White Horse","review":"Whoever said that epic poetry is a dead art form? In Ballad of the White Horse, G. K. Chesterton not only proved that epic poetry yet lives, but that it can be readable and inspiring even to we jaded moderns. For me, reading this book was a great way to introduce myself to a period of history that was unfamiliar. The story of King Alfred and his desperate defense of Christian England against the invading pagan Danes is one that is not often featured in primary or secondary education (or college level Western history courses for that matter). But if not for Alfred, European history may have taken a decidedly different course. For me, the most compelling section of the ballad is toward the end where Alfred predicts that the Christian England he has just preserved will be threatened again in the far distant future by the forces of paganism. Clearly, Chesterton was not averse to taking shots at the contemporary post-Christian culture.If you enjoyed this book, fear not. Good historical epic poetry is being written even to this day! The Laviniad (available on Amazon.com), an epic poem in the more classical tradition, is also a great read. Or if you like fantasy literature, try The Mask of Ollock, an epic poem in octet form."},{"Title":"The ballad of the White Horse","review":"Out of the thousand or so books I have read in my life, if I were to put the Bible aside (since the Bible speaks with a special authority to believers and cannot really be compared to other books), I have read no more than five or six books that I would call truly great. That means there are only five or six books I would rate at five stars. This is one. Yes, it is that good.I have never read any author who could make the English language sing the way Chesterton does in this poem -- for over a hundred pages. In contrast to contemporary \\"poets\\" whose \\"poems\\" consist of a bunch of strange words scattered apparently at random on a page, whose meaning, if there is one, is far beyond obscurity, Chesterton had apparently unlimited ability to create rhyme and alliteration, and then he bound it all tightly in the sing-song ballad style that carries it all swiftly along. The words of this poem are glorious to hear, and really, this book should be read aloud, so that one might hear the music of the words.And few have ever been able to match the way Chesterton paints pictures with words. I will quote one passage, and hope it is not to long, to illustrate this. The scene here is Alfred's army making one final charge against the Danish camp:Then bursting all and blastingCame Christendom like death,Kicked of such catapults of will,The staves shiver, the barrels spill,The waggons waver and crash and killThe waggoners beneath.Barriers go backward, banners rend,Great shields groan like a gong,Horses like horns of nightmareNeigh horribly and long.Horses ramp and rock and boilAnd break their golden reins,And slide on carnage clamorously,Down where the bitter blood doth lie,Where Ogier went on foot to dieIn the old way of the Danes.It would be hard to imagine anyone anyone describing such a violent scene in so few words any better than Chesterton does in that passage. And this passage is but one of dozens of glorious word-pictures that Chesterton's poetry paints in this book.Beyond its magnificent use of the English language, this book also contains much philosophical insight -- insight that, although first published in 1911, is directly and clearly applicable today. Chesterton expresses very clearly the way that Christianity has formed the heart of Western culture over the ages, and the way that Christian faith -- which seems all about self-denial and thus sadness -- leads to unconquerable joy.The book, of course, is not perfect; no work of literature can be. There are places where it gets a bit too preachy for my taste. But the book's flaws are few and minor, while its good points are many and glorious.How good is this book? I have read it at least 50 times in my life, and I still enjoy reading it. In my opinion it is one of the truly greatest works written in the English language. It is one of the few books I have read that truly deserves five stars."},{"Title":"The ballad of the White Horse","review":"The greatest poem ever written!

Science fiction has, haltingly and with lots of recidivism, gotten a little bit beyond superheroes who can outgun/outguess/outfight everybody else in the universe. This book is a throwback. Our hero has no personality; the villain is scary, but of course the good guy drops him in one shot when they finally get together. It's pretty well written (hence the two stars) in between the cliches, but it's ultimately pointless."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Mr. Asher misses with this one. The main character \\"Ian Cormac\\" is almost a skeletal parody of the super agent. I found almost everything about this character underdeveloped and full of gimmickry. What kept me reading, however, was a well drawn universe of seemingly consistent and amazing technology peppered with unusual and plausible characters. Mr. Asher took the time to create an understandable history for this universe and skillfully shares it with his readers. Unfortunately he spends too little time on the main character and falls into an ending that is contrived, unsupported, and unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Let's differentiate here, okay? If you see 10 0ut of 11 reviews with at least 3 stars, the work is decent. Is it excellent? The charasters are fun, but two dimensional (that's better than one by the way), and the plot is fast. I give it high marks for originality, but do so with the warning that all Asher seems to get published are works about one universe. I say this because like so many authors who only write about one universe he assumes that his readers will understand everything by reading all his work.Be advised, this problem is on a nano scale, he is a good writer and you can pick enough up in his book to have a lot of fun. I read Line of Polity and I know I will read Cowl. Everything I have read so far is pretty good. This is spy space opera and it works. No less deep than early Flinx, about on par with Sten or Mcade. Read it."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Asher gets off to a slow start here. The last three books in the series are fantastic, so if you can't bear starting half way through, read this one. Otherwise, start with Brass Man or Line of Polity (which I haven't found so don't know about). This stuff is interesting in that it seems like action schlock, but is much more. As the series progresses, it becomes clear that it's well thought out, meaningful SF that just happens to explode with action and description."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"SF writing has been dominated by UK authors for the last few years, in my opinion. Alastair Reynolds, Charles Stross, Richard Morgan and others have injected some much-needed fresh air into the genre. Neal Asher joined the invasion early on, but only lately have I gotten around to reading this book.\\"Gridlinked\\" is part cyberpunk, part space opera, and part action/adventure. By and large, Asher keeps it moving, and keeps things interesting. The pace quickens toward the end, and this really becomes a page-turner that you don't want to put down until you reach the final page.But this is clearly a first novel. As other reviews point out, it runs out of steam about a quarter of the way in, and starts wandering around. This soft patch doesn't last that long, but it's there, and you have to force your way through it; the book gets better. At times it's hard to tell exactly what's going on, and the ending has some issues in that regard. And it's hard to put out of your mind that our designated hero, Ian Cormac, is an implacable agent of a dictatorial AI that controls humanity.Nevertheless, \\"Gridlinked\\" is at least worth checking out from the library. I plan to read the other Ian Cormac books to see how Asher developed as a writer."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"GRIDLINKED(2001) is Asher's first Novel, and the 1st book from the POLITY UNIVERSE series. It is 2nd book I've read from the Polity Universe (400 years in the future, mankind has spread out among 100's of worlds, and an Earth-based AI leads the \\"civilized world's\\" governments, with less civilized worlds at the edges of the human-colonized worlds in the galaxy).The story reminds me of stories produced by Peter F. Hamilton... there is an almost military bend to them, and there is a lot of action, intrigue, and killing, plus some sex and a few different alien worlds. Asher's aliens are somewhat better, and Hamilton's tech and characters are usually more believable and/or interesting than Asher's.I found the ending to GRIDLINKED to be haphazard, and that fact combined with the fairly common editing and grammatical errors led me to down grade my rating - otherwise this was an enjoyable story that I recommend to aficionados of semi-far future action-adventure SciFi."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"This book was a solid four stars until the last couple of chapters. If you've ever read a book and then gotten suspicious as you approached the end, because there didn't seem to be enough pages to wrap things up believably, then you know exactly how the end of this book feels.I'm not an author, so I don't know how this happens, but maybe the author gets tired of writing and just slams 4 chapters of revelation into a couple of paragraphs and sends it to the editor. Who knows?But as other reviewers here have said, the subplot of the rebel leader who wants Ian Cormac dead is a little distracting, but tolerable. The main story line is quite interesting. Basically, mankind (and Ian Cormac in particular) is caught up in some sort of struggle/conflict/police action between two very large, and powerful alien beings.But at the end, you are never really told what was going on between the two beings and what happened. I really thought maybe my book was missing the last chapter or two.Asher has huge potential. His writing is very readable and enjoyable. As another reviewer mentioned, some of his clever weaponry made the book even more interesting. It is space opera drama in great form - until the ending. Perhaps he will improve the wrap ups and become a good author, but I cannot recommend this one as the ending is too poorly done to leave the reader with satisfaction."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Like the reviewer below, I had some issues with the character development and treatments in this book.

Yet, while he spends a great deal of time in the first 1/3 of the book dealing with Cormac's inner world, I agree with the other reviewer that the treatment of Cormac's gridlink exclusion and its effects on him was rather glossed over in the last 2/3 of the novel, odd considering the title of the work. However, I got a sense early on that this book was setting up characters, technology and worlds that would re-appear later in other works, which of course I now know to be the case, as I've also read Line of Polity.Asher seems overly enamored of twenty-dollar words when five-dollar ones would suffice. I don't believe hard sci-fi needs to be so obdurate in its word choices - he sometimes uses obscure or almost archaic English in places. While some might excuse this of him as he is British, I've spent enough time in the UK with British intellectuals to know this isn't a universal trait.Overall, this was an enjoyable enough summer sci-fi read that I also have consumed his other books, but I don't think he's yet on par with his peers, such as Richard Morgan. All the same, I will keep reading his works."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"One word is sufficient to describe this book - Quality.Let's face it, there are an awful lot of bad books out there, especially in the Si-Fi genre, but this is a very good book, and an exceptionally good Si-Fi novel.Not least amongst it's many top qualities, was the ease of hurdling the first chapter, and getting buried into this quality novel.Different authors may resonate more with your tastes, but if you've read Altered Carbon or The Player of Games, and were left with deep satisfaction from absorbing a future reality you could feel, touch and taste, then pick up this book.

Even the author himself does so. Gridlinked is an action-packed tale from the future filled with dragon creatures, lizard men and powerful androids. Lots of gratuitous violence, a little gratuitous sex and an overall fun romp through the speculative fiction genre."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"The first novel with Asher's protagonist Ian Cormac is uneven in several respects. Cormac is an ECS agent, one who persues criminals against the intergalactic association of AI's known as the Polity. The novel is relatively well paced with interesting action sequences and compelling background information on this far future environment. The galaxy is connected by runcibles which make travel and information sharing possible at \\"faster than light\\" speeds. Cormac starts out as a 'gridlinked' agent, his access to the Polity's information AI's is at a top priority. But as becomes clear in the story arc this also has a detrimental affect on Cormac's humanity after the thirty years he has served. It also makes the novel's villains, Andre Pelter and Mr Crane, infinitely more interesting character studies than Cormac's gray 'AI-less' stricken characterizations. This combined with some occasional hackneyed exposition detailing the alien environments is jarring at times.Overall the star of Gridlinked is Asher's fully realized Polity universe. His hero is propped up far too much with historical hand waving that simply doesn't come across other than when the reader is told how important he is to the universe Asher has created. We can only take this with a grain of salt as the true stars of the book (Pelter and Crane) fade out with scarcely a whimper. The \\"real\\" enemy of the book (Dragon) seems to only be a placard for quoting - \\"wait here for sequel\\"."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Ian Cormac is a super agent of sorts.

McIntyre! Gridlinked, Neil Asher's first novel (a space opera of hard SF dimensions) had a good start but alas, nothing really new. Gridlinked began with a lot of promise (especially after all the hype it received). I found myself skipping some of the dross narrative and the writing was uneven where the plot line jumped around too much. The villain Arian Pelter and the sadistic Mr. Crane (the psychotic Android) where pretty cool yet all of the characters seemed too one dimensional for my taste. Then half way through the book, a new alien entity is introduced which appears as an after thought. The best thing about the book is the action and high-tech wizardry. Though in reality we'll probably living in a new stone age by that time. The book reminded me a lot of Alistair Reynold's Revelation Space saga. Even though the book does have a lot of shortcomings it's a fun read and one that makes you look at the future with a jaundiced eye. Glad I'll be long gone when and if this comes to light."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Gridlinked is a slow starter but ends up a fast burn in the second half. I was close to putting the book down after 100 or so pages, as the story line was confusing & the writing somewhat uneven.

It pulls no punches in describing violent outcomes, combat action, and character confrontations. If you are looking for an action novel in a futuristic setting then this would be for you.I however was disappointed. I was expecting more science in this story. There is very little description of the technology that is employed and the \\"grid\\" that is part of society play very little role in the story. There is also a striking lack of things that might be part of the traditional \`cyber punk' genre save for the withdrawal symptoms Cormac suffers when he become unlinked in the early part of the story. The theme of coming off the grid and how that affects a person should have been more fully explored. In fact the title of this book should really be something more like \\"un-Gridlinked\\""},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"The technician enters the runcible gate to star transport to the planet Samerkand, but something goes astray and his arrival ignites a nuclear explosion that kills at least ten thousand people.

Blegg also warns Cormac that his GRIDLINKED cybernetic implants that tie him into the AI network are destroying his brain. To save his mind he must delink, but can he survive without the technology he has relied on like a drug for three decades?While Cormac struggles to adjust to an unplugged existence, he makes inquiries into the explosion. However, Arian Pelter and thugs working for him want Ian dead because Cormac killed his sister while working a separatist's case. As Cormac acts and reacts clumsily, Arian becomes self-assured that he will assassinate his enemy soon.The technology is cleverly designed so that the reader can sense this futuristic galaxy has some unique gadgetry yet all the gizmos are interwoven into the terrific action-packed plot. The investigation subplot into whether an accident or sabotage occurred is exciting and hooks the reader even while the death count dramatically rises. However, the key to Neal Asher's fabulously complex science fiction is Cormac and Pelter whose cat and mouse contest makes for an engrossing and entertaining futuristic science fiction novel that runs at hyperspeed.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Neal Asher's book \\"Gridlinked\\" certainly would not fit well into much of my reading. It is certainly violent and has a number of characters with which one finds it hard to sympathizes. I generally don't care much for spy thriller types of science fiction (i.e. with James Bond licence to kill characters), but Asher has written one of the few I find interesting. It is his particular dark style that I like- one that I think tacks very unlikely events into a riveting fantasy-sci fi classic.Ian Cormack is almost unidimentional- but then he is supposed to be! He has been linked to a computer grid for 30 years and now has to leave it to accomplish his current task. He is required to investigate an apparent failure of an interstellar runcible (instantaneous space travel system) that resulted in the nearly complete destruction of the planet Samarkand. He is being stalked while he attends to this task. The stalker, his major bete noir Arian Pelter, is a monomaniacal psychopath and thus does not think beyond getting revenge for the killing of his sister Angelina, despite the fact that she was killed in self defense. He is essentially a space mobster posing as a separatist. As a weapon he has a nearly indestructible Golem (android)named Crane that can cut almost anything or anyone to ribbons. The complications caused by various unexpected aliens, including a huge dragon, associated Golems and humans with their own agendas add further interest to this hard core sci fi adventure.It is my fervent hope that society never reaches the amoral state described by Asher in this book, but then I will be dead before that time and thus will not see it if it does. I doubt that the technology will ever exist, but then that is the fun of sci fi - you don't have to ever live it! In the reverse of the fun of dinosaurs which are huge, ferocious and conveniently extinct, the sci future is not yet here and may never happen- we hope! It is that slim possibility that it could that adds to the experience."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"I enjoyed the romp through this future, for the most part. I agree with others that the characters where a bit dry. Not sure the storyline was very compelling but I was curious all the way through. I found it difficult to buy Pelter's need for revenge, but the aliens where quite interesting. Glad Dragon doesn't live nearby. How is it that humongous and powerful aliens are petulant and mean? I guess if they were benevolent and wise there'd be no story.Sorry that the plot device of Cormac getting unlinked didn't amount to much. I thought it would serve as some type of advantage to the story, but it may have been more of an advantage for the author in telling the story."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"This story has a ton of interesting and fun stuff going on. The technology is pretty good, the future government and culture is plausible enough. And the bad guys are great! Asher has created some very good characters that mesh together well. Mr. Crane, the \\"broken\\" android is excellent. Arian Pelter is perfectly despicable and Asher even succeeds in creating a bad guy I was rooting for. A few scenes were rather predictable but not terribly distracting from the overall story.Now for the not so good. I can't give this book 5 stars for two major reasons. The protagonist is about as interesting as my front lawn and the last 50 pages were dull and convoluted. Asher attempts to pull together his half dozen plot lines and fails. I was less than 10 pages from the end when I got interrupted and didn't even care. That's how ho-hum it gets.But I don't want to make too much of the bad, I still give it high marks for a first effort and I'm going to read another one."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"I have to admit that I bought this book mostly on the blurb on the back, and the snazzy cover and title. More fool I.So. The book starts off fairly well by describing how disconnected Ian Cormac is (his cover is blown when his contact sleeps with him and thinks he's a cyborg because his 'lovemaking' is too robotic, and he subsequently tries to keep his cover up by smiling at a woman while forgetting that he's covered in blood), but promptly loses it thereafter. As in, the Powers That Be identify the problem, tell him to go cold turkey, and involve him in a massively important mission. Meanwhile, a man he left alive behind him looks for revenge.There are many things I don't buy about this; he's just come out of a botched op, he's been identified as compromised, he's not even especially bright, and despite supposedly being undercover in his first mission, he's so well known he's referred to as either notorious or infamous by one party, and shows up as a 'mythical hero' in a tour guide brochure. Ian Cormac isn't just flat, he's a cardboard cutout. He's not only a spy, an investigator, an elite commando, but at one point he's the designated ambassador representing all of humanity to an extremely dubious alien intelligence. He has direct access to the central core AIs running the civilization, access to almost unlimited resources (weapons, money, armies)... and yet we're supposed to believe that a badly organized bunch of mercenaries gives him a workout. What makes it worse is that for part of those scenes, we're watching it from the point of view of someone who clearly knows how outclassed his client is.Other characters are just silly. It's not enough to have Harold, a senior agent, brief Cormac. Instead, Harold has to be semi-mythical, described as a Japanese immortal, a demigod risen from the ashes of Hiroshima, changing the course of human history, a man who vanishes as soon as Cormac takes his eyes off him. This is done entirely done through exposition and adds nothing to the plot. You never get to figure out why this guy is described as a demigod. You never even get to see how or why this guy's so well respected by the Polity. He's just, well, there.There are some things to like about Gridlocked. It's more believable in some ways than the Culture and John C. Wright's Golden Oecumene, because even though there are AIs essentially running the economy and political system, it's still not without its discontents, and AIs are very expensive to create and produce.The alien intelligence, Dragon, is also interesting and plays against type in some interesting ways. Despite being massively intelligent and incredibly powerful, it's disturbingly human in some ways -- it likes to cheat, and it even swears a blue streak when it doesn't get what it wants. I found this a little unrealistic in some ways (for a supposedly superhuman intelligence, Dragon can't lie for beans) but I really enjoyed the contrast between Dragon's physical appearance and its understanding of human emotions.I also liked the unclosed nature of the plot resolution, even as I was frustrated by the lack of information. I do think this was partly deliberate to set things up for a sequel, but in some ways it did help to have things dealt with at the appropriate speed.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone to read. Honestly, it's just not original -- the science is nothing you won't see in Richard Morgan or Iain M. Banks, the language, culture and mindset is standard 20th century, the characters are too clearly set up for plot purposes, the story is predictable with twists being laid out chapters in advance, and ultimately it's just too formulaic. It might have been more interesting if it had dealt more with its original premise of the perils of using net access as a crutch, but that aspect gets swamped under everything else. Maybe next time."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"This is the first book by Neil Asher I've read, and it's also possibly the last. While the book was not bad enough to stop reading, it was nonetheless a struggle against apathy at times. The more's the pity, since there are some interesting kernels of ideas in the book, but they're never explored or elaborated. It's very much a superficial skimming through a universe that would held more promise.The main characters of Cormac and Pelter are both flat. Cormac's early struggle with the loss of his Gridlinked state (a mental link to the successor of the internet) goes through a few motions but never acquires any depth, and later on he's back to normal without any comment or elaboration, lost in the narrative flow. Pelter's transformation takes place in the space of a few pages at the start and stays monomaniacally fixed for the rest of the book.The writing is poor, cliched and formulaic. There's too much tell, not enough show, and even the telling too often takes place in short sentences dropped in almost at random. There are passages where the writing picks up and can hold some interest, but it grates more often than not. An example of the combination of the poor writing and lack of depth concerns the backstory that reveals the benevolent dictatorship of the AIs: at several points in the book, it is simply posited that if human are allowed to govern themselves, war and chaos ensue, without any elaboration as to why or how.Gridlinked does qualify as space opera, but I have a hard time calling it SF. Technology just seems to be there without consideration of its effects, and the book is rife with errors in basic science (referring to a speed in terms of G's, for instance).I gave this book two stars because it was able to keep reading to the end, so it's a notch above the books that I could not finish. Since this is Asher's first book, I might be tempted to read some of his later works to see if his writing improves with experience."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Neal Asher has been a big voice of modern Sc-Fi in small press for years, but Gridlinked marks his first full length novel, and for Sc-Fi fans, it comes as a breathe of fresh air. What's going to hit the average reader first is the feeling of a completely realized world in which the story takes place. It is so well thought out and presented, it strikes me as almost familiar. Our protagonist, one Ian Cormac is introduced to us as a long time user of a cyber augmentation connecting him with a virtual network of information run by AI's which now run humanity's government in the form of the Human Polity, as they judged mankind to be not fit for the job to do it themselves. The use of this device is known as being gridlinked, which comes with it's drawbacks, such as the feeling of being removed from humanity, and the first obstacle Cormac needs to over come, in his search as a Earth Central Security agent, on the hunt for major players in the Separatists movement that is against AI control, and high technology in general. Not only does this serve as an excellent novel, but a vehicle for thought on society's embrace of technology at the cost of humanity, a theme that repeats itself through Mr. Asher's work.I cannot recommend this book enough, and I urge readers to follow up on the works of Neal after and prior to Gridlinked. I am almost a bigger fan of his short story works, but with the quality of novels he is putting out, I must say *almost.* his most recent novel is Brass Man and is released in the UK. it features Cormac again, and goes into great length of the background of an enigmatic character Mr. Cane, a Golem android.If you cannot find more of his stuff here on amazon, try amazon.co.uk as his stuff is published there first, and much earlier than it is released in the US."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Gridlinked is a good, solid read. It is a successful blend of galactic intrigue, espionage, aliens, and action. The story follows Ian Cormac, a 25th century version of \\"a certain agent with the number 007\\" (p. 341). Cormac is an agent for Earth Central Security, and has for decades fought insurgents and ne'er-do-wells to maintain order within \\"the Polity.\\" Cormac is one of the few people with internal access to the galaxy-wide information grid, being \\"gridlinked\\" to the AI's that effectively rule humanity. However, for the sake of this mission, Cormac must sever his link, and readjust to life as a normal human. (The title should more accurately be \\"No Longer Gridlinked.\\") He then has to track down an extragalactic threat to humanity, while fending off a revenge-crazed psychopath. Fun!Asher has done an admirable job of world building. The technology is well explained - they have some awesome weapons! - but it remains secondary to the story, as it should. The characters are well developed, with distinct, believable personalities. The story moves at a good pace, with lots of action and enough plot twists to keep you guessing.It's not entirely new ground; the book reminds me of Singularity Sky by Charles Stross, and Spin State by Chris Moriarity. And I did find myself scratching my head a few times in confusion. All in all, though, it was an excellent debut effort. The characters and world are rich enough to explore further, and I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Gridlinked is not bad for a first novel. It is basically action/adventure space opera. The plot moves along and their is a fairly continous stream of action. The future world that is depicted develops a number of concepts, but without a lot of depth. A number of the concepts are pretty much tried and true SF projections. The title stems from the fact that the protagonist has been gridlinked, i.e. directly hooked up to huge databases that he uses to be an effective government agent (note that very few people have this setup in this future world, so it is a major advantage). The main theme at first seems to be that you can't remain gridlinked for too long a period or it does you harm. The mechanism behind this is very obscure. The key in this story is that our hero has had to disconnect from the grid and do his work without it. Yet, this lack of access doesn't really enter all that much into the story or provide many interesting insights or plot twists. I would have liked to see this developed more.In summary, a moderately engaging read, but without much depth or character development."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"This is the second book I've reviewed by Neil Asher, and the second time I've found myself wanting to go out and buy another of his titles.Off World Sci Fi books at times spend way too much time developing worlds, cultures and such like, and quite often the story and characters suffer for it. Not so here! Adult fiction of this kind is far too scarce and because of this both Gridlinked and the Skinner stand out from the mainstream Sci Fi and grasp the reader's attention.Neil's style has a Sergio Leone feel to it, another reviewer mentions grit, and that's spot on. You can place yourself into character of any of the protagonists too, which can only increase the reading pleasure and experience.To many times I've picked up a Sci Fi book and felt that it was aimed at the 13-18 age group and am left with the impression that book radiated vapidity and substance, but Gridlinked reminded me that there are books and writers out there that can cater for my escapism needs. More like this please!"},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"The Good: A great world setting, the Polity is human space ruled by AIs. However, like any good empire, there are edges - the \\"Line of Polity\\" that forms the title of book 2 - where all the good stuff happens. Earth Central Security has many agents, and Ian Cormac is one of the best. The opposition is \\"Separatists,\\" those who claim they do not want to be subsumed in the well-run AI-ruled paradise, though usually for selfish rather than idealistic reasons. Personally, I'm not always sure who I want to root for - and that's good in my book. The only thing that really distinguishes the villians from the good guys is that the villians do their evil for the traditional (read: cliche) reasons of hatred, revenge, dominance, greed etc. and the heroes do it for the Polity, with a little sop toward the \\"greater good.\\" The technology is a lot of fun, very imaginative, and in a lot of ways is the real star of the book.The Bad: There's a lot. Having the polity ruled by enormous AI of vast capacity provides the writer with plausible gods as he subconsciously equates logic and sanity with goodness, although or a rather ruthless variety. So with synthetic Golem (AI robots) abounding, who needs humans? Well, I'm not sure, but it seems to have something to do with original thinking and creativity. Other than that, I wasn't sure why the AI need humans at all. Even if they feel obligation toward their sad little organic charges, why use them as their agents and enforcers when Golem and other AI-driven robots (like entire ships) using synthetic minds or those copied from dead humans, are so much more effective? Even with the addition of near-magical autodocs that can fix most organic injuries within minutes (though there seems to be nothing like this for the poor Golem), humans just seem to fragile for the big bad scary universe. One other minor irritant, the number of worlds in the Polity seems to vary from book to book from around a hundred to (if I remember correctly) eighty-seven thousand or so. Again, this may have been an editing problem but...The Ugly: The writing and editing. I will say it gets better (slowly) in later books, but Asher violates many nuts-and-bolts conventions of the craft without any concomitant stylistic benefits. Occasionally he hits a poetic note or two but mostly he writes convoluted sentences that must be re-read to parse out their meaning. In a book that's supposed to be an action-sci-fi, the writing needs to be more straightforward. I'm guessing Asher, as many new writers do, fell in love with his own prose and got published before he really developed. And I fault the editor(s) particularly, because it's those worthies jobs to speak truth to the author and fix these things. The thought that this might have actually been the case makes me shudder to wonder how bad the early manuscripts might have been. Bottom line, the writing gets in the way of the story.Some series start brilliantly then fail. Some start rough and get better. This is one of the latter. Read it to get started, read it for what it is, if you want to begin the series from, well, the beginning. I've read worse."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Quite terrible for a scifi novel, even allowing for this being Mr Asher's first major work. It's chock-full of terrible, overused cliches, wooden characters with no personal development whatsoever, childish asides, stilted dialogue straight out of bad action B-movies and a generic scifi universe that never explains all the plot holes and discrepancies it contains.If you're a fan of intelligent, well-written scifi, stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"An entertaining vision of the future with lots of action and interesting characters that you actually care about."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Neil Asher's first novel, \\"Gridlinked\\", is an attempt to put the James Bond genre into outer space. It doesn't wholly succeed, for most part due to the fact that the main character, Earth Security Agent Ian Cormac, has no character. Asher gives us a good reason why. It seems that he has been \\"gridlinked\\" or connected into the Artificial Intelligence Internet, for way too long and is more computer then man. For the first part of the novel, Cormac \\"unplugs\\" himself off this 'net, and has to deal with the consequences of finding his humanity and solving the galaxy's problems the old-fashioned way.Now if Asher had kept this train of thought going throughout the novel, it would have been a whole lot better. Unfortunately, he gets caught up in the dealings of his psychopathic bad guy and his maniacal robot, along with the sudden inclusion of two alien life forms, and Cormac's inner struggle just disappears. After a bad day or two, Cormac seems to completely readapt to his lack of easily accessible information and the whole point of the novel just goes away and is never mentioned again. The rest of the novel disintegrates into a typical \\"chase the bad guy\\" story, with the usual tricks and clever tactics, etc. etc. I wish the novel had stayed the course as first promised. It would have been interesting had Cormac's cyber withdrawal actually had some bearing on the plot, but it really never does. In fact, very little that goes on in the novel actually effects the plot or the characters. It is a shame, as this was an excellent idea for a story and not bad, all things considered.I wish Mr. Asher success in the future. I will be sure to read his next novel, in paperback, when it comes out."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Neal Asher's \\"Gridlinked\\" is a fast-paced, adrenalin-fueled, action-packed, idea-studded, fascinating look at a possible future for humanity. What's more it's a heck of a good read, loads of fun, and I had a blast devouring it! After reading this one, his first, I immediately went back to Amazon and ordered all his other books and now am anxiously awaiting their arrival. I whole-heartedly recommend this book, and if you enjoy hard science fiction then I've no doubt that you'll enjoy this book too. It's definitely a keeper.What a fun trip this was.....colony planets, advanced combat firearms, sentient hand weapons, genetic sculpting, enhanced nervous systems, intergalactic teleportation, inscrutable aliens, designer drugs, black market currencies, artificial intelligences....all fairly standard ideas, but Asher takes them and imprints them with his own unique take, and far more importantly, binds them up in a consistent, yet lavishly detailed universe.And what a universe it is! What made this book particularly fun was Asher's wry nod at today's international terrorist problem. In his imagined future nearly everyone is relatively wealthy, healthy, prosperous, and enjoys a grand standard-of-living. Governmental affairs are managed with wisdom, intelligence and compassion by vast artificial intelligences and everyone has every reason to be happy and just enjoy the heck out of life. With incisive insight into the human mind and human condition though, Asher realizes that despite the fact that they should be happy, not all people are going to be, and the outer planets are rife with bomb-throwing terrorists, fanatical plots, and underground movements that routinely try to wrest control of their planet away from the benevolent rule of Earth central, invariably so they can loot the planet for wealth, live out bizarre social rituals, or just because they're contrary. Of course, when they are successful, as happens rarely, the whole social order breaks down completely within 20 years with disastrous results for the population. These examples don't ever slow down the next crop of terrorists any more than today's examples do (think Cuba, Lebanon, Iran, etc.)This was so totally plausible to me that I loved this story. Create a paradise where everyone can live happily ever after, and then about thirty mintues later it will spectacularly implode because there are humans in it. Bigotry, hatred, paranoria, greed, idiocy, intolerance, fear, jealousy, religious doctrine, political dissension are all part of the human condition and have been around since day one. So it makes complete sense that they'll be around in the future as well. Therefore in Asher's delightful story it is no surprise that there is a small problem with people killing each other and blowing things up in Paradise. This of course gives his protagonist, Ian Cormac, an Earth Central security agent, plenty of bad guys to contend with throughout the book and makes for a jolly good romp. In a really neat way there is a fascinating inversion in this story; the villains are complex, motivated, and terrifically drawn while the hero is emotionally quiesecent, damaged mentally by his 30 year link to an artificial intelligence. This works well because the novel is also about the sympathetic characters regaining their humanity despite their past traumatizations, while the true villains have theirs consumed in hellish fires of psychic destruction of their own doing. I love books with clever, nasty, but intelligent bad guys and this one definitely qualifies.There is some FANTASTIC science fiction coming from Britain these days (and a relative dearth in the US) so if you are looking for good Sci-fi check out Richard Morgan, Peter F. Hamilton, Iain Banks, Alastair Reynolds, and now, but by no means least, Neal Asher. They're all frightfully good writers!"},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"I just finished this novel last night - and it left me with a feeling that the best has yet to come from Neal Asher.Many interesting ideas were introduced and Asher's 'Polity' promises to be a great backdrop for many future novels - likewise the main character Ian Cormac is interesting and complex enough to star in many more adventures. For me there were two things that kept it from scoring higher than 3 stars. What follows will not spoil the plot if you have yet to read the novel - however if you would rather dive in without knowing what to expect (like I do)I'd skip the rest of this review, and just buy the book - it is well worth the read.Firstly, the theme of Cormac being separated from the grid was never fully explored later in the book. I would have liked to see this continued throughout the novel. Asher seems to forget about it half way through and focuses on Cormac as &quot;action hero&quot; rather than &quot;social misfit with no humanity&quot;. Pity.Secondly, there are 2 main plotlines and 1 tiny one which never really crossover in a way that makes sense. The revenge theme just wraps up too easily for my tastes and never connects with The Maker storyline as I hoped it would. The Stanton story ended very poorly and added nothing to the novel for me - a real shame since Stanton was a great character - I was hoping for some real interaction between him and Cormac more than just the &quot;why choose a life of crime&quot; conversation they have that lasts for thirty seconds.In the end though I thought this book was quite good and I will definitely read his other novels. I would sum up his style as half way between the noir-action of Richard Morgan (Altered Carbon) and the space opera of Alistair Reynolds (Revelation Space) - both great British Sci-Fi writers who I would choose over Asher, but then again why waffle? Just read all three and don't forget to read Iain M. Banks' culture novels as well while you're at it!-- Ryan Buckley"},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Junked after 80 pages or so. Flickers of interest but a plodding, choppy read, with derivative ideas and lacking sympathetic characters. Not a universe I'd care to inhabit for long. I cut my losses and tossed this kindling material into the communal read bin here in Baghdad. If you're hunting for a fresher voice, read Richard Morgan instead."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Gridlinked by Neil Asher follows a complex plot that, is at times, hard to understand as it plunks you into a futuristic world without much explanation, although the details of the world are unveiled as you get further into the book, so that by the end, you pretty much know what is going on.The focus is on two characters, Ian Cormac and John Stanton. Cormac is a Special Agent who has spent many years \\"gridlinked\\", mentally linked to the controlling artificial intelligence. Because he is in danger of being subsumed by the AI, he is ordered to disconnect from the grid and conduct a mission on his own. His mission? Find out who destroyed a transport junction called a Runcible, killing 20,000 people in the process?The other character is John Stanton, a mercenary who is working for Arian Pelter, leader of a group that claims the goal of wanting to separate from the government, but largely concerned with enriching their own pockets. Pelter is a dangerous man, even more so because Cormac's last assignment before he disconnected from the grid was to infiltrate Pelter's group. In the process of doing so, he kills Pelter's sister, Angelina, and Pelter vows to kill him.If you're confused yet, that's okay, because if you stick with it, everything does settle itself out in the end and even makes sense. It's kind of like total immersion, though because Asher tosses all the terms around as though we should know what they mean, so it's like entering a world where everyone speaks a foreign language but you. By the end of the book, however, you'll be as fluent as anybody else.Cormac, himself, is a pretty one-dimensional character, largely because he's spent most of his life with his mind linked to the AI so he's almost forgotten what it's like to be human. It is easier for him to relate to the androids that also populate this universe than to the humans.The more interesting character is John Stanton who, for his own reasons, sticks with Pelter as Pelter descends further and further into uncontrollable madness.Asher gives a fascinating picture into a somewhat frightening future. At the end he brings everything together into an incredibly taut and complex resolution-- I wanted to skim quickly through it because I was so eager to find out what would happen, but I had to force myself to slow down and read it thoroughly so I wouldn't miss any important details. It's not a light read, under any circumstances, but it is a good one."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Every line of this debut novel crackles with energy and ideas. The backdrop is a society enhanced by connectivity (the Grid of the title) and cross-galaxy travel made possible by runcible technology; the plot has all the kinetic force of a runaway bullet train. I'm reminded of Bruce Sterling's Schismatrix, but I think Grindlinked tops that one for pure joy of reading. Buy it."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Gridlinked is very solid enjoyable space opera/action story. I found the A.I.-ruled Polity to be an interesting setting. The story moves at a nice, quick pace, and made me want to keep reading. In particular, the central mystery of the enigmatic alien Dragon's true nature and intentions kept me interested in what would happen next. The action scenes are exciting and well done, though not for the squeamish. I liked the characters quite a bit- Ian Cormac is a likable hero who has an interesting psychological challenge to deal with, the psychological and moral progression of the mercenary John Stanton is well done, and the terrorist Arian Pelter is very good as a villain.The setting is a futuristic A.I.-ruled human society called the Polity. Travel throughout the Polity is accomplished principally through teleportation devices called \\"runcibles,\\" which can turn people into energy and instantly transmit them across light-years. I rather like the way Asher addresses the idea of rule by machine intelligences- it is portrayed as neither a cure-all for social ills, nor as some sort of oppressive dystopian nightmare.I have two complaints. First, I wish more had been done with Cormac's adjustment to living without his gridlink. There's a lot of potential in the idea, and I don't think the book fully exploited the possibilities. Second, the ending seemed a bit rushed. These are only minor problems, however, and I definitely recommend the book, and look forward to reading more by Asher."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"At first, it may seem that the pace is maybe a little too quick, and that Asher has so much story that he has to squeeze it in. But that's probably just me - it does take me a little while to get to grips with a new book, even if it does feature a universe with which I'm quite familiar. Angelina Pelter may be swiftly dispatched by the fast moving Ian Cormac at the very beginning of this novel, but Cormac's master does allow us to catch up by ordering the removal of his gridlink. Cormac is warned that staying gridlinked for so long may well have dehumanised him. Horace Blegg, Cormac's legendary boss, decides to interrupt Cormac's current mission involving the Separatists on Cheyne III to dispatch him to Samarkand, which has unfortunately been devastated by the destruction of a runcible gate. Thus Asher cleverly gets us to identify with Cormac, since the secret agent seeks to regain his own identity. There's a quote in the novel which says that Neal Asher is just as good as John Meaney. However, where Asher supersedes John Meaney is in the strength of his characterisation (to such an extent that Cormac's strong line on crime and punishment could be jeopardized).Neal Asher's science is also good. The Runcible mode of transport seems much in line with the recent discovery of black holes at the centre of galaxies (and Asher has been writing about Runcible technology for quite a while). Where Neal Asher has always seemed strongest is in his creation of biological entities - mycelium and pseudopods are real science. However, Gridlinked has also finally revealed that Asher does have quite a whimsical tone. It's a delight to finally discover that the Polity's mode of transport was named after the runcible spoon in Edward Lear's nonsense rhyme 'The Owl and the Pussycat'. Some readers may think that the Polity is a bit like Iain M. Banks' Culture. However, Neal Asher is a bit of an expert in the martial arts, so he's far more knowledgeable about flying shuriken than other writers in this field. Besides, Banks didn't invent AI, as Asher reminds us by nicknaming Earth Central 'Hal'. There's a bit of Arthur C. Clarke in other ways - Dragon is a mysterious godlike being. But Asher also seems to have gone to the very depths of Science Fiction, by utilizing Prometheus in a way that Mary Shelley would have approved of (Dragon turns up in Frankenstein Monster mode, with exceedingly uncharitable thoughts towards its creator). The fantastic Golem android Mr Crane also gets to do his Bela Lugosi impersonation. Asher might have also been reading some literary studies on science fiction - note the term he uses when Dragon produces the first Dracoman on Aster Colora. Although Dragon doesn't have teeth like Spielberg's Jaws, he still has a considerable bite with the help of his pseudopods.The mention of a creature called 'Dragon' jars at first. But Asher has given his leviathan a character which can be greatly appreciated. Certainly, this seems to be the closest that Asher has ever come to replicating the fantasy narrative that he employed in his first (unpublished) novel. The wolverine substance of adamantium seems to be a marvel too, but Asher's use comes from the fall of Mordor in The Lord of the Rings. Like the great Victorian Gothic novels, today's 'Western' fiction still seems alternatively fascinated and appalled by the East, most notably here in the \`presence' of Horace Blegg. Although the concept of the 'dinosauroid' may have entered the realm of the players of fantasy games, it does have an actual basis in fact: Dr. Dale Russell is a real palaeontologist. I was also delighted to see that Asher named Samarkand after the city on the Great Silk Road. Movie makers looking for the next 'Matrix' or 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' would do well to come knocking on Neal Asher's door.I suppose I was a bit concerned that Anti-Grav Cars modelled on the Ford Cortina might date this novel, along with the pop tune (more Culture Club than Culture is 'Melting Pot'), but the longevity of Edward Lear's nonsense rhyme can be a powerful excuse - we just don't know what part of popular culture will survive in the years to come. Gridlinked deserves to live on, and there is much left in the Asher universe to explore (I was very happy to see mention of the gruesome leeches from 'Spatterjay' again). It turns out the retro Anti-Grav cars are also staple of the Asher universe - they were first mentioned in the Runcible Tale Blue Holes and Bloody Waters. Oh, and did I mention that Neal Asher also has great wit? The novel explicitly compares Cormac with James Bond - the book Bond, rather than the movie Bond, I'd say - Cormac is hard, but fair. The baddies may die in gruesome ways, but Cormac doesn't stand round trying to think of dismissive quips or pointless eulogies. Much of the humour comes from the excellent intros to each chapter (it's the best guide I've read to Asher's Universe). Gridlinked is a fast-paced action cyber-thriller which could beat the sushi out of The Matrix on any day of the week. And the good news is that Neal Asher's novel The Skinner is even better."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Tor has been picking up a number of SF novels that were first published in the UK, and giving them an American debut. And in doing so, we here in the US are blessed by getting access to some really good books. Neal Asher's Gridlinked is a case in point.The universe of this book (and others by Mr. Asher) is connected by \\"Runcibles\\" (based on the Owl and the Pussycat poem by Edward Lear). Asher has a great time with the Artificial Intelligences who control the Runcibles as well as the \\"Polity\\", but he also has created cool fighting men-machines called Golems, the most vicious of which is \\"Mr. Crane\\". \\"Crane\\" because he is tall and thin, \\"Mr.\\" because he is psychotic, and one would not want to be on his bad side.The primary character is Cormac, who has been linked to the computer grid (in other words \\"gridlinked\\") for 3 decades. After 20 years, one begins to lose one's humanity, and this is happening to super agent Ian Cormac. Imagine James Bond in the 25th Century. Unfortunately, what we find of Cormac in Gridlinked doesn't come near to fulfilling all the hype that is mentioned in the various news articles and book excerpts that try to add our understanding of the milieu of the Gridlinked universe. And the sense of disconnect that Cormac should feel just doesn't come through. He just sort of shrugs his shoulders and soldiers on.That having been said, this is an enjoyable book. Quite unnecessarily heavy on the foul language, but that's just MY idiosyncracy. We find the answers to the mystery of why a Runcible blew up, wiping out a planet, and who, or what is behind the explosion, and is feeding information to Cormac's enemy, a terrorist who was left alive after Cormac killed his sister (also a terrorist), and whose descent into madness is very well delineated.Lotsa space battles, violence, and derring-do, and when you read this you will be motivated to find more books by Mr. Asher."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"A feeling of detachment and apathy permeated my reading experience of British author Neal Asher's 2001 science fiction debut GRIDLINKED. The characters failed to capture, the plotting and pacing sagged while the fragmented prose stuttered. As with any science fiction and fantasy novel, world building and settings factor significantly because the SFF story's backdrop lies outside of a contemporary or historical setting. Although GRIDLINKED adequately builds its universe, I felt its clunky and tediously scientific prose swallowed any potential wonder or excitement in GRIDLINKED's universe. The science fiction What-If scenario in GRIDLINKED? Matter-transmitting \\"runcibles\\" controlled by AIs allow humankind to literally step from world to world light years apart. A threat to exploiting this technology forms the foundation of this novel. GRIDLINKED contains an overwhelming element of mystery in its characters (Dragon, the Japanese demigod Horace Blegg) and suspense in the plotting (Dragon's motives, Cormac's mysterious scheme at the end). A story may spell things out for its readers, essentially dumbing it down, or it may intentionally leave readers in the dark by obfuscating the prose. Instead of some balance in the delivery of the mystery, I thought GRIDLINKED chose the later in the extreme to the point of disinterest (fogging the prose and mystifying characters and their intentions to the point of apathy). There's terrorizing Separatists who detest AI's growing role in the universe, sympathetic mercenaries, mysterious dragons, androids, and our James-Bond agent in the center of it all: Ian Cormac. Unlike some science fiction novels, the AIs here aren't \\"bad\\" and they represent an extension of humanity. In fact the AIs exhibit more emotion and attitude than the characters. Like a quote in the novel, I found Ian Cormac's character characterless, and I just didn't care about our mercenary John Stanton or Stanton's lover Jarvellis whose boring perspective appears in droves later in the novel.I immediately compared James-Bond agent Ian Cormac with a book I read recently: Richard K. Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs, and boy, is Kovacs hundred times more interesting. Morgan's gritty protagonist makes for wondrous world building and a hard-boiled detective story in ALTERED CARBON (****). In terms of a gripping plot, pace and characterizations, Asher's GRIDLINKED pales by comparison.Possible SPOILERS ahead.At the end of the day, not only did the book bore me, but I failed to understand the point of it all. Maybe I just didn't get it, but nor did I want to; the book tried too hard to sustain a measure of suspense and mystery over 400 pages into a 426-page hardcover. The Dragon implicates the Maker in the destruction of Samarkind, Dragon wants Cormac to kill the Maker, Cormac agrees, but in the end, concocts a sheme to renege on his promise to Dragon after learning the Maker isn't all bad, and along the way he faces off against the psychopath Pelter. Oh and the mercenary Stanton (originally with Pelter) and his love interest the smuggler Jarvellis find each other after much hardship. Did I miss anything? It all seemed too dumb and the boring content and prose didn't help."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"As is my habit, I tend to reference authors more so than specific novels. So, I am writing this review of Gridlinked only because it is a great place to start when beginning to enjoy Asher novels. Please, consider this to also be an endorsement for all of the other Ian Cormac, Polity and Spatterjay novels... they just keep getting better (although expensive because they only seem to be published in the UK). Specific to Gridlinked, I would describe this novel as a synergetic cross between Richard Morgan's Takashi Kovac series and Dan Simmons' Hyperion series. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of original material in these novels. In fact, I like them much more than the Takashi series because they flesh out much quicker and have exquisitely evil antagonists. If that alone is not enough to get you reading, then you probably never watched Buck Rodgers, Dune or Star Trek as a kid and should be reading something else entirely (see Oprah book list)."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Neal Asher paints a fantastic word picture of a future where mankind has colonized space. It reads like a movie in ones mind. I thought that the plot and characterization were done in a journeyman like fashion and would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting space adventure."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's fast paced and complex with some very interesting characters. It is often reviewed as a hybrid of 007 and sci-fi world building; but the focus on the book is particularly on the villains.Deep, interesting villains that have justified motivations is something really lacking in most books. And I applaud Asher for this. If anything the bad guys were more fleshed out than the protagonist.There were a few plot elements that I disliked.. but I've already ordered more Asher books. I would recommend Iain M. BanksThe Player of Gamesmore; but Banks only writes so many books."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Neal Asher is one of those authors who manages to deliver something that is fast-paced and engaging without feeling like something you wish you'd borrowed from the library instead of buying. To be honest he borders on pulp at time, but in this case it's not a bad thing - \\"Gridlinked\\" is a great example of how he counterbalances the pulp factor with comprehensible science and surprising clarity at times, forgoing the fancy narrative and pseudo-poetry that a lot of science-fiction authors go for.He is concise and compelling for the most part - the downside is that the characters feel like film characters rather than real people, but when you're after this kind of action sci-fi, that is weird and wonderful stories filled with awesome gadgets and creatures, it doesn't matter too much. \\"Gridlinked\\" is one of the Agent Cormac novels to feature the brilliant Mr Crane, a bronze android with fearsome strength and almost tangibly intimidating personality. One of the most original characters I've read in sci-fi, he's the character who causes you to tut when his scene ends and grin when his next one begins. Cormac is almost as engaging, a man dehumanised by his integration with technology and his intellectual proximity to the many AIs that govern Earth and other colonised worlds.It's a fine novel and well worth a read, especially if you haven't read Asher before and want to branch out into new authors."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"\\"It's not only humans who know how to hate.\\" A tantalizing hook for this Gridlinked novel... yet not much was hammered out regarding the difference between how a human hates or an AI hates. AI characters weren't fully explored as being human or even being sentient. However, the concepts in tech and originality were big pluses, always providing a highlight in between the battles, gore and destruction (three more big pluses!). The only character development seemed to be orbiting around Ian, while the rest of the cast were left merely to interact with him."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"After reading Engineer and Cowl, I just got through this. I thought it was pretty good. The story was engaging and I feel came under good space opera. There was some detail left out, but I look further to more Ian Corman. I just wish I could get a Shruiken for myself!"},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"The current crop of British sf writers have restored my faith in SciFi. Hamilton, Asher, Morgan, Banks, et all produce superior stories, tech, and characters. The American debut of Gridlinked doesn't disappoint as Asher really delivers the goods with this story of revenge, xenoc explorations, a hi-tech universe and enough action to really get your heart pumping. What a refreshing change after so much of the mindless drivel that passes for Science Fiction these days, especially the Star Wars series, Star Trek , Honor Harrington and all the rest that passes itself off as scifi. Am I just ranting or do other's feel this way?"},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"Neal Asher managed to construct a decently fleshed out future vision, where egotistical AIs run an authoritarian society, complete with terrorists, mercenaries and other fringe types lurking around the edges. He plants a moderately interesting main character, Ian Cormac, a security \\"agent\\" for the who has been \\"gridlinked\\" (hard-wired) to the future version of the Internet for so long that he's lost some of his ability to interact with humans. He gets detached from the grid prior to being sent out to investigate a rather major event that's believed to be terrorist related.Among the book's strengths are a good bit of innovative thinking in fleshing out this future, a good narrative line, and smooth prose. Asher came up with some clever ideas, and gave at least a modicum of depth to some of the peripheral characters. The main character left me a bit wanting, and it seems that the premise of the book (Cormac's trouble reconnecting with the humans around him) gets left in the dust about 3/4 of the way through, as the focus of the book becomes the action leading up to the climax, and the characters start to behave in cookie cutter action. The various AIs were, to me, the most interesting characters in the book, and I would have liked to see more exploration surrounding the AIs' egos and arrogance.Asher is very clever in his projection of technology, a touch less so in his character development, and I found that I didn't care enough about the protagonists to worry about their fates. Still, I enjoyed the book, and will seek out more of Mr. Asher's titles."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"In my opinion this book, while decent, has been overrated. Asher is a pretty good writer, and the story and the milieu it inhabits is fairly interesting. A few portions of the book are exciting and absorbing,others are confusing. I liked the edginess of the book, including the psychotic, murderous robot Mr. Crane. But elsewhere, the character development was inadequate, for example, Cormac's difficult adjustment to no longer being jacked into the \\"grid\\", which could have been intriguing, is barely explored. A decision of one of the main characters near the end is completely ludicrous given his behavior up to that point, a contrivance that serves an outcome that can be seen a mile away. Lastly, the book is absolutely crippled by a climax that was underdeveloped, abrupt, and unexciting. Asher's got talent, which made this uneven novel a frustrating read for me."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"READER CAUTION: For those that care, this book has sporadic F-bombs and other language. Some sexual stuff, but not overtly graphic. The violence can get a bit bloody with decapitations and the like.I'd imagine this being rated-R================With that said. . .What happens when you combine cyberpunk with espionage with sci-fi with action? You get this book!The world Asher creates is easy to imagine and yet a wonderfully pushes the imagination at the same time.We avoid a lot of the politics in the universe even though the characters represent the arm of those politics. So if you are looking for an intricate maneuvering of political mind-games that isn't this book.I like the main character Ian Cormac but felt the author could have made the \\"disconnect\\" from being gridlinked more of a factor throughout. . .especially considering that is the title of the book. But the gridlinking is a minor note in some cases which is why I knocked this down a star.There was what almost seemed like a later sub-plot with Stanton that arose for no great reason, but he's a likeable anti-hero and so it's bearable.The main bad guy is truly \\"bad\\" and you can't wait for him to get his, especially since he has the upper hand in most scenarios that come his way. Ah, the injustice of the bad prospering!I like how Cormac doesn't gloat even though at times he has the upper hand. He simply accepts the fact that he has good reason not to worry (since he has the upper hand) and he takes care of business.There are no real strong female characters in the story, which may turn some readers off. That's because this is a testosterone action sci-fi ride. If you can keep that in mind you'll enjoy this book.If you like this book, there are more books with the Ian Cormac character.

This whole series is pretty fantastic, and the prequels are, surprisingly, just as good as the rest of the series. The later books remind me of some of Peter F.

Looking for a very cool main character well thought out action and plot as well? Looking for mystery and exotic locals? This is it my friend. Read this book it doe not disappoint and there are more after it. All of the Polity books are basically one big continuing story. I am currently on the 4th and it is going strong. The writting style of the author takes some time to get use to and there are times wher you are shaking your head saying \\"What the heck is going on?\\" but it's all part of the fun. Asher takes some common themes and combines them in new ways with likable characters, truely evil villians and a plot that just will not quit. If you loved Foundation, Ender, Gap Saga, Uplift, then trust me this is the next logical step. I suggest reading it with some hard rock or metal in the background during the action scenes."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"I had a lot of expectations coming in to this one and, for the most part, I wasn't let down. You get a futuristic world linked to AI, you get crime and police/agent figures that are all using said AI for their own ends. You also get to travel from planet to planet via the runcible. As I said, for the most part I was not let down at all in my expectations.I wasn't coming in to this one expecting some grandiose character development and ultra tight plot as many other reviewers were expecting. I knew this was Asher's first book, and I knew that it could be absolutely amazing or, as happened, it could be just a fun, adventure filled book with its own problems. With expectations not high it allowed me to actually sit down and enjoy the plot for what it was. So I'm not going to rehash that character development was lacking or the plot had holes. This is expected! What I will say is that Cormac as a character is a fun character. A futuristic intelligence agent, alien life forms that are more powerful than humans, an AI system that is believable and a all knowing father figure who is probably AI but defies definition (Blegg). Add all this together with a conflict with the powerful alien, a vengeful separatist criminal and androids and you have a rip roaring read.My only real fault is that everything kind of ended anti-climactic. For example, you expect a big showdown between the androids, and all you really get is a paragraph description of their fight and its conclusion. Granted, with such powerful machines you can expect that it would be very fast and very quick, but the possibilities were oh so tantalizing as so what the showdown could have been.Aside from the anti-climactic scenes towards the end I can say that I was fully satisfied with Asher and intend to read more of his in the future. I would recommend to those who are looking for a fun sci-fi read and leave your high expectations of a tight, character driven/developed book with a flawless plot at the door. Read for the adventure, read for the sci fi and you will enjoy Gridlinked.4 stars."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"This is action sci-fi. Don't come into this expecting deep character exploration or clever commentary on humanity, and you'll find a lot to enjoy. It's an interesting universe, and the author hints at depth that isn't elaborated upon. While I haven't read other books in the series, this one is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Gridlinked","review":"The opening chapter of \\"Gridlinked\\" is almost noir-like in its dark, macabre setting: a gruesome killing and a chase scene involving terrorists and spies. But the criminal activities of planetary separatists end up being a mere inconvenience to the imperial Polity; something far worse, probably of alien origin, is destroying entire human colonies, and superspy Ian Cormac's mission is to find our who--or what--is responsible for the carnage.The homage to James Bond is perhaps a bit too obvious, but, in some ways, Cormac is more like Jason Bourne: where Bourne has lost his memory, Cormac is separated from his Intelligence. The literally immortal Horace Blegg (in the Judi Dench \\"M\\" role) tells the spy that he must unplug himself from the AI grid because Cormac is beginning to lose whatever it is that makes him, and us, uniquely human.Asher's novel, then, sets up two somewhat disconnected plots involving terrorists and aliens in two distinct genres: a Raymond Chandler-style sci-fi thriller, and a Matrix-inspired story about retaining one's humanity in an AI-dependent universe. But, after the first few chapters, Asher pretty much abandons the noir atmosphere for a militaristic space opera, and he eventually drops the subplot involving Cormac's de-humanized personality; even unplugged, Cormac manages his affairs like some kind of invincible superhero. The rest of the book is pretty much standard sci-fi fare with the accompanying gadgetry--just lots more of it. Untrustworthy alien intelligences, interplanetary chase scenes, increasingly fantastic weaponry and armor, oodles of cool tech toys, amoral yet oddly romantic mercenaries, souped-up cranial augmentations, sadistic and indestructible androids--it's all in a day's work for the merely human Ian Cormac.Don't get me wrong: \\"Gridlinked\\" is often lots of fun, and there are some great moments in this page-turner, including one almost comical scene that most memorably involves a headless speedboat driver. But the real problem is that Asher's storytelling abilities can't maintain the pace with his kitchen-sink imagination; the lack of focus, the typecasting of the characters, the constantly shifting perspective, and the clunkiness of the prose keep things far more confusing than they really need to be. Moreover, the resolution of the book's 400-page chase across the galaxy is an extraordinary letdown. (You'll probably mimic Cormac's \\"puzzled frown\\" when you get to it.) Even in the future, sometimes less can be more."},{"Title":"Brokenness","review":"This book is Amazing! A friend recently gave me a copy. This book gives a very clear explaination of what brokenness is, and what it is not. The author also does a compare and contrast between pride and brokenness. This book is very convicting. If you let Him, God can give you a good look into your heart. This happened with me and the results were painful and definitely not pretty. But it was necessary. The author also uses real life examples. Both from her own life and others. Nancy is very honest about her own struggles with brokenness and pride. As you read, you get the feeling that she wrote this book as much for herself, as for others. This book showed me areas of pride that I never realized existed. If you want to remain complacent, don't read this book. This is one of the best books on grace and brokenness that I have ever read. Thank you Nancy!"},{"Title":"Brokenness","review":"This short book can be read in two hours but its potential benefit to your spiritual condition could last a lifetime. \\"Brokenness\\" is the first book of a trilogy (the others are Surrender, and Holiness), but it can stand by itself. In an approach that is non-condemnatory but convicting, Ms. DeMoss has written a wonderful resource that could aid us in challenging a stale faith and encouraging us toward a \\"brokenness (which) is the pathway to blessing.\\" (p.105). Chapter Four contains a list of characteristics that unveils the traits of proud people in comparison to those of broken people. (I found myself saying \\"ouch\\" more than once.) But she rightly observes that the Bible continually points out God's resistance to the proud and His willingness to draw close to the humble. If you want to read a quickly flowing book that will encourage you towards the true joy that results in being honest with God and with others, then I highly recommend this resource as a positive aid toward that end. I found it encouraging, convicting, and personally desirous to be open to whatever God thinks is appropriate for my spiritual condition."},{"Title":"Brokenness","review":"Every Christian should read this book.

I could write pages of what God did in my life through this book, but the work God does through this is His miracle, and perhaps I should just say that you would be enriched, changed and renewed by taking the time to read it (or as some may say, have it read you~ it's that sort of book). As it was for me, it may just be the \\"key\\" you're looking for in your quest to follow Christ, and help you work past issues of the heart you've struggled with for many years. Just know, you will never be the same..."},{"Title":"Brokenness","review":"Brokenness, by Nancy Leigh DeMoss, was born out of something God did at a Campus Crusade for Christ staff conference, which took place in Moby Gym at Colorado State University in July of 1995. The focus of the conference was revival, and the organizers, desiring a fresh work of God, intentionally departed from a \\"normal\\" conference schedule. On the third day of the conference, DeMoss spoke on the subject of brokenness and humility. When she finished, what God had been doing in the hearts of those in attendance became visible. DeMoss writes, \\"No human fully knows or could possibly capture what took place that hot July in Colorado. But I believe most who were present would agree that God was there and that His presence was manifest in an extraordinary way. As He began to move in the hearts of His people, all scheduled events for the rest of the day were cancelled; the same thing happened the next day and half of the following day. There were no official breaks during the service that began at 9:00 Monday morning and continued until midnight that night. Most of those in attendance had no desire to leave, though some slipped in and out as necessary for physical nourishment or to tend to needs of children. Throughout the day, hour after hour, people stayed glued to their seats on the main floor or in the bleachers as we waited, listened, repented, prayed, and worshiped.\\"There is much talk these days about revival: what constitutes a true revival, creating an atmosphere conducive for revival, how desperately we need revival \\"in our land.\\" The prevailing attitude says, \\"Let's figure it out and manufacture it.\\" But as DeMoss points out, there is not a formula. What we do have is God's timeless Word which teaches that he hates pride, but that He will draw near to and use the broken and contrite. DeMoss invites the reader to \\"encounter God in a whole new way. It is a call to discover His heart and His ways; a challenge to embrace a radically new way of thinking and living, in which the way up is down, death brings life, and brokenness is the pathway to wholeness.\\"The theme of contradictions runs throughout the book: those who appear to be most spiritual are in greatest need of revival, those who are waiting for revival oftentimes are the ones used to start it, those who die to their \\"self-sins\\" experience more life, those who are broken are most whole, the humble ones are exalted, those who weep know deep joy, and those who expose their sin and needs are covered. Though the path to brokenness before God and our neighbors will be a painful one, it will lead to healing and restoration, to personal revival, to greater intimacy with God and others, and to our increased usefulness in the hand of God. On the other hand, when we rely on ourselves and hide behind our spiritual facades, we cut ourselves off from God's blessings and grace.DeMoss uses passages from both testaments, especially Psalms and Isaiah, to describe brokenness. She also describes eight biblical profiles to demonstrate what brokenness is and what it is not. In Chapter 4, \\"Am I a Proud or a Broken Person?,\\" she shares, in list form, the characteristics of a broken person compared with those of a person who is proud. While it cannot be definitive, it is a very thorough list of characteristics which distinguish the broken and the proud. She has identified eight categories for these characteristics: attitudes toward others, attitudes about rights, attitudes about service and ministry, attitudes about recognition, attitudes about themselves, attitudes about relationships, attitudes about sin, and attitudes about their walk with God.The final chapter offers specific steps the reader can take to humble himself before God by using the tools He provides: His Word, our circumstances, and other believers. DeMoss notes the wisdom in choosing brokenness over being broken, writing, \\"The fact is, we will all be broken -- sooner or later. We can choose to be broken or we can wait for God to crush our pride. If we resist the means God provides to lead us to brokenness, we do not avoid brokenness -- we simply make it necessary for God to intensify and prolong the process.\\" She then offers four suggestions to enhance personal brokenness. They are not new, nor are they repackaged to sound new. She does not advocate getting something from God, rather she discusses rightly orienting our lives to God.As I was reading, two aspects of this book stood out to me. One is that DeMoss does not presume to know everything there is not know about how God works and brings revival to His people. She shares her experience and wisdom from scripture, but only refers to her insight as suggestions. Another is that DeMoss does not create any new rules to follow. She admits that God will deal with each of His children in a different way, so that what she shares about how He has dealt with her is presented as personal experience only -- not a prescription. Only He knows the intricacies of each of our hearts and is in a position to apply rebuke, conviction, forgiveness and grace.Finally, DeMoss offers a personal testimony of her struggle to remain broken and humble before God and her brothers and sisters in Christ. Brokenness is rarely a once-for-all-time experience; it is a \\"starting place for a lifelong cycle.\\" After six chapters of instruction, her testimony demonstrates, to a degree, the spiritual fight and pain that accompanies a deep desire to follow Christ whole-heartedly and see Him glorified in all things.Each chapter ends with questions for reflection, to bring conviction, and reveal areas of personal application. There is also a discussion guide for leading a small group or to enhance one's spiritual growth with even more difficult questions to consider."},{"Title":"Brokenness","review":"This book puts in perceptive the real work of the Holy Spirit.

Currently I am using the book for a small women's group and everyone is enjoying it so much.

In saying that, I think I have a pretty good handle on the book, the hobby and how it is.I know Jenny Thompson and she interviewed myself and a number of others when writing the book. Yes, it's brutally honest and does show some of the \\"puffy people\\" for what they are, but in doing so, Jenny gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the hobby... and YES, I did wince at some of the stuff, but it's TRUE.If you're interested in WWII (and WWI) reenacting, by all means, buy this book -- it will give you a pretty insight into the hobby.I read some of the other reviews and frankly, some are just \\"sour grapes\\" -- there were very few things in the book that I didn't agree with and got a big laugh to see myself quoted (a horrifyingly large amount of times)...Anyway, this is all my opinion, but since I've been in WWI since 1989 and WWII since 1991, I think I know of what I speak. If you're interested in the hobby, then buy this book!"},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"Being a reenactor of both world wars, I am pretty used to people outside of &quot;the hobby&quot; putting it down. While reenactors span a remarkably wide demographic, from high school drop-outs to PhD.s, from right-wing Republicans to left-wing Democrats, from conscientious objectors to combat veterans, we are often painted by academics and the national media with the broad brush of all being gun-crazed proto-fascists in desperate need of love and shock therapy. It is with this in mind that I approached Thompson's War Games with a mixture of both anticipation and dread; anticipation because I was excited to see somebody actually trying to explore the unique hobby in which I participate, and dread because I was afraid that the book would simply reinforce the incorrect stereotypes without attempting any sort of in-depth analysis of why people reenact.Fortunately, my anticipation was richly rewarded by War Games. Thompson, having spent seven years attending reenactments and spending a considerable amount of time with reenactors, has successfully dug beneath the surface to get to the fundamental question of why people reenact. The situations and personalities that she describes are very familiar, and in my opinion, are accurately represented. She raises many of the existential questions of reenacting that I have asked myself, and the answers she provides offer a great deal of insight.While Thompson obviously has a great deal of affection, and dare I say respect, for reenactors, she does not sugar coat the hobby. The fundamental issues of what represents &quot;authenticity&quot; and what relationship reenactors maintain with veterans and the public are often bitterly divisive among reenactors. Thompson also does not ignore the moral implications of reenactors portraying soldiers in the armies of America's enemies. But she addresses all of these issues with fairness and balance.I would hope that everybody who reenacts, or is considering reenacting, 20th century wars reads this book. More than that, though, I would hope that those who question the propriety or sanity of reenacting will read this book with an open mind. I certainly don't expect everybody to accept the hobby. But I would hope that, through reading War Games, these people would at least develop a better understanding of why people reenact."},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"The majority of books about reenacting fall into either the category of photo collections of reenacting events or &quot;how to&quot; manuals. One of the few books that has gone deeper into the subject was Tony Horowitz' Conferates in the Attic. Horowitz used the story of a colorful hardcore reenactor to examine America's fascination with its Civil War. His approach was typical of the &quot;New Journalist&quot; style of writing. Although a participant and observor, Horowitz was ultimately a talented journalist in pursuit of a good story. Reenacting was the vehicle he used to tell his tale.Jenny Thompson was also a participant observor in search of an interesting story. She spent seven years going to reenacting events and joined several reenacting units. Thompson used her training as a scholar to produce Reenacting's first ethnography. As a social scientist, her objectives were much more amibitious than Tony Horowitz. Thompson wants to explain the hobby of reenacting and the motivations of the people who participate in the hobby.I would not recommend this book for anyone who is impatient with intellectuals and scholarly discourse. By its very nature, an ethnography is a set of generalizations that are used as a tool to find deeper meanings. I would suspect that many people in the reenacting community would find this book to be overly intellectual.What I found to be so interesting about this book is that it is the first time that I have ever come across a book that discusses the motivations of what must be a decent percentage of the American male population that is fascinated by the many facets of war. As one of these people, on an intellectual basis, I know that war is a tragedy and that I would never want to participate in a war. Nevertheless, I am fascinated by military history and war's material culture. Although, I am not a Twentieth Century reenactor, this book nevertheless still spoke to me. I saw a lot of myslef in the people Thompson writes about."},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"I'm a WW2 re-enactor and I've been told I'm supposed to hate this book, the author and everything she stands for.I'd heard about the book on a Monday on a re-enactor message board, and by that Wednesday I'd read the whole thing.Now, the chips are clearly stacked against author Jenny Thompson. First, she's not really a re-enactor. To make it worse, she's a GIRL. Double ick!I cannot review this book as anything other than what I am; a person who grew up doing re-enacting events. However, I think I have the ability to take a step back and call a spade a garden tool.Thompson hung with several re-enacting groups over a long period of time and went to several events during that time. In fact, after looking at her photo, I'm pretty sure I remember once seeing her at an event, as small women are sort of rare at these events.A lot of guys in the hobby are really ticked about this book, saying it makes them look bad, she's an outsider and doesn't know what she's talking about. You know the type, &quot;I'm looking in a mirror and I don't like what I see, so it must be the person who made the mirror.&quot; Sadly, many of them haven't read the book, and some say they won't as they KNOW what it will say. Those people just won't see reason and without reading this book, they should keep their mouths closed.I have read it. I find it a fair, hold-no-punches explaination of the hobby. Thompson might be an outsider, but I feel she went into her research with an open mind. She reported what she saw. It's as simple as that.Personally, I've always known people who do this are nuts. What always baffled me was the sanctimonious nonsense people attach to themselves, like it's some lofty higher calling or something. Any justification they can find when simply saying they just like doing it should be enough. They just need to get over themselves...The book does a good job of calling BS on the hobby in general, asking the questions such as if it's for the vets then why so few events public, stuff like that. These are questions I've asked all along, and it's high time that all of us who do this should take a step back and look at what we are."},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"War Games is based upon the author's doctoral thesis in American Studies at the University of Maryland. This book looks at 20th century war re-enacting; World War I, World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War. The book does not directly address the more popular Civil War re-enacting or the less popular \\"Span-Am\\", Spanish-American War. In 20th Century re-enacting, World War I and II predominate, with Vietnam just beginning to be recognized as a venue for re-enactment.Ms. Thompson has taken a clinical or social scientific approach to her investigation of re-enacting. Not only was she an actual re-enactor for some ten years, but she distributed for her research several hundred questionnaires most of which were returned to her. She is in a very good position to describe this phenomenon and from what I can gather, she knows her subject.The central thesis of the book is stated on page xviii of the Introduction: \\"Instead, as I hope to show, re-enactors use the hobby in general and focus on the issue of authenticity in particular in order to cope with the real-life issues that reflect the broader culture in which the live. However much it masks its relation to the present through elaborate rituals, costumes and props, re-enacting is both a product of and response to the very society from which it emerged.\\" Thompson is stating that in spite of the emphasis on history, period clothing and weapons, what we are talking about here is life and all its aspects as it is lived today, not as it was 60 or 90 years ago.On page 153, Ms. Thompson begins a discussion which strikes at the heart of re-enacting. And that discussion concerns the fact that re-enactors spend very little time re-enacting actual historical battles. The definition of \\"re-enact\\" means to act that which has already been acted. With this definition, one would logically expect re-enactors to do this. One would expect that they follow the history of a particular battle in detail and act it out. However, they by and large do not. They will establish a general scenario for a mock battle with general goals which determine a \\"winner\\", and then proceed to skirmish, attack and out-flank one another to achieve those goals. She recognizes this fact when she discusses private battles versus public battles. Private battles are open and free-flowing, where as public battles are organized and scripted. Creativity with a basis in history is sought after in private battles which are largely the type of battle most often preferred by re-enactors.It is amusing that Civil War re-enacting is often referred to as \\"Silly War\\" by WW II re-enactors [Note: I refer consistently to WWII re-enactment because it represents the majority of 20th century re-enactors], and yet most probably Civil War comes closest to defining re-enacting through adherence to military historical fact. One reason that Civil War comes closest to true re-enactment is because the scope of the battles is limited to smaller areas. Opposing armies can establish themselves in ranks, facing one another, and have at it and according to the history of the battle, follow the action through to its conclusion with the appropriate side achieving victory. This is next to impossible in WWII re-enacting. The distances and battle areas between armies in WWII were substantial. Much of the fighting was mechanized and done in and around villages the types of which are not found in the US. But even if the re-enactor could duplicate the general landscape, very few re-enactment groups will sit down, read the history of even a small unit action, and plan out the process of the battle. Why? Because re-enactors do not want to be scripted, they want to proceed on a general basis with general objectives, they want to employ their creative abilities to overwhelm an objective and they, and it must be said, want to enjoy themselves. The point has been made many times over by re-enactors that they have spent considerable time and money on the hobby, and enjoyment is paramount. In fact, re-enactors will jump units and even organizations to achieve the goal of enjoyment.History to the average WWII re-enactor is only useful because it can provide a name for the scenario; \\"North Africa 1942, Normandy 1944, the Battle of the Bulge etc. Indeed this approach to history proves the general thesis of this book, re-enacting is about real life issues, not historical fact. To illustrate this point, Thompson relates the re-enactment of the Normandy invasion in 1994 at Virginia Beach. This was a public battle, and it was scripted. After the battle, one of the veteran re-enactors approached her and said \\"A realistic public battle? Now there's an oxymoron\\". Here was a scenario which probably stuck as close to historical fact as possible in a WWII battle, and we have a \\"re-enactor\\" declaring that the battle is a farce because it was scripted and witnessed by the public! Professional historians who criticize re-enactors have nothing to worry about. Most re-enactors are concerned with history only in the most general sense. After all, reading compilations of secondary history, let alone delving into primary source material is probably more than most re-enactors want to bite off. Veterans and critics who maintain that re-enactors trivialize war are also off base. And my assumption here is that \\"war\\" means frontline combat, not the other 90% of war which is boredom, drilling, eating and sleeping. This aspect of war can readily be re-enacted. Re-enactors are not at war, even when engaged in mock battles. They are essentially at play. They are at what amounts to an expensive game of \\"capture the flag\\".So if re-enactors are not re-enactors, what are they? As Thompson has suggested they are \\"commemorators\\". Their interest in history, clothing, weapons, the manner and lifestyle of the 40's commemorates the lives of the combatants who fought WWII. It is their way of saying, \\"We remember what you did for us and America, and we do what we do so that others may remember it also\\". Re-enactors also have been shown to have a wide variety of motives, and these are described in this book. Some re-enact because a relative was in WWII; some are avid collectors of militaria and re-enact to display and demonstrate what they have collected. Some are vehicle collectors and join a unit so that they can not only display, but use their vehicles in mock combat. And some neither know nor care about the history of the period or their particular unit in the war. They are there for the camaraderie and the excitement of mock combat. Re-enactors are as diverse as the military they seek to represent. Just as the average infantry company contained motivated individuals who wanted to become soldiers, it also contained those who bent the rules in order to get by. The industrious served with the slackers; the dedicated with the goof offs, the clever with the mundane. Indeed the average group of re-enactors is comprised of the same personalities as one would find in today's army or the army of 60 years ago. In this respect if not in any other, re-enacting does reflect historical accuracy.I believe Ms. Thompson has done an admirable job in describing the phenomenon of re-enacting. She approached it from the perspective of the social scientist. She not only immersed herself in the hobby, but she conducted extensive interviews and obtained additional data through questionnaires. Her conclusions are correct. I think I could hand her book to any fellow re-enactor and tell him \\"Read this, and herein you will find yourself and most of your buddies\\"."},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"\\"Jenny Thompson spent seven years attending war reenactments and getting to know the participants. She has a PhD in American studies and has taught at the University of Maryland and Roosevelt University. She lives with her husband in Evanston, Illinois.\\" (jacket)Of the many kinds of history reenactment groups and organizations throughout the world, this book is concerned with the reenactment of war, specifically of the wars of the 20th century. Straight off, you can see this is going to be a problem. By ignoring the broader topic of the reenactment of other types or periods of history, real or fictionalized, and by not situating that broader topic within the encompassing topic of the role of imagination within human psychology, the author is bound to simplify the reality of the motivations and experiences of those men and far fewer women who join with others to collectively reenact 20th century wars.In fact, any accurate analysis of the psychology behind the human behavior of reenacting history, real or fictionalized, contemporary or long past, would need to examine the nature of self-perception and self-identity, and also of group identity, in relation to the constraints, conventions and freedoms of a culture. It would also need to include an examination of the purpose and value of stories and even of static art. Within that is the nature and purpose of our knowledge of the past.Personal Note: I was once a member, for five years, in an Old West reenactment group and also participated in Single Action Shooting Society (SASS) events. One reason I left the group was a frustration with the lack of depth and realism to the collective re-creation of the lifestyles of the period. I wanted physical and psychological immersion. Vicarious experience of the past is possible and common because it is only psychological, all you need is a book or movie, but a physical experience of the past can only be simulated through the imagination supported and active within behavior. It requires the historically faithful, exclusive environment of objects and people accurately representative of objects and people of the past. Others can make it vivid, and others can spoil the illusion.The book brought back memories. Although the period I was reenacting wasn't within the 20th century and didn't include military portrayals, many of the pleasures, concerns, and conflicts among us Old West reenactors were similar. One significant difference from the war reenactors discussed in the book was our group included men, women, and children.This book could have been antagonistic to the enthusiasms of the war reenators and suspicious of their motivations, but Thompson doesn't explicitly moralize or politicize against them, except very occasionally when she's speaking personally about something she experienced or witnessed while participating as a reenactor herself, or until she reaches her epilogue, where she writes as a woman who apparently thinks that men should be women, too. A running subtext of the book is the moral ambiguity Thompson clearly feels about reenactors portraying WWII German soldiers, along with the enactment (usually only at private events and left out of public performances) of such warlike behavior as firing squads and the killing of prisoners.There are disagreements in the community on how and why the past should be re-created, so throughout most of the book Thompson allows the men to voice their own complaints against one another by reporting what she saw and heard, and what she gathered through a questionnaire. She reports on group dynamics, the specifics and rules involved in being a reenactor, individual behavior and backgrounds, debates in the community on how far authenticity should be enforced, and the troubles that arise in portraying the past when details of the clothing and gear of a period are important to everyone but attention to minuscule details is regarded by some as equally important and by others as excessive.The more an individual knows about the past, the more kinds of inauthenticity he will notice in himself and others. In Old West reenacting, for example, three prominent concerns are hats, boots, and holsters. TV and movie westerns often had all three wrong. Overall, the entire wardrobe is important. In reenacting 20th century wars, wardrobe concerns, and knowledge of what was worn and when, are equally prominent and they put the novice reenactor in jeopardy of being \\"period incorrect\\" and anachronistic in ways that an outsider would never notice. Even style of haircuts is important. More controversial are debates (obviously initiated by the young and fit) on age and weight. The participation of women, blacks, and asians (WWII reenactment is of the European war) is another dispute. How far should authenticity be enforced, and who gets to decide for the rest?The main failure of the book is Thompson's thinking that these men reenacting warfighting are somehow wholly unlike men, women, and children reenacting some other historical period and other kinds of events. She doesn't bring into her discussion and summary these other varieties of reenactment. I'm thinking not only of the Old West reenactments of my own adult experience, but of the Mountain Man reenactors (I've known a few) and the many reenactors of the Renaissance period who create a Renaissance Festival for the public every year.Although she never mentions those non-military reenactors, in chapter two, subtitled \\"A History of War Reenacting\\", Thompson does mention \\"living history\\" portrayals such as those at Colonial Williamsburg, and the American tradition of historical pageants (I once portrayed a Chippewa - now 'Ojibwa' - Indian boy along with other young boys and girls - few if any of us \\"genetically correct\\" - in the annual pageant reenactment of the fictional Song of Hiawatha performed at Pipestone, Minnesota), but in her epilogue Thompson talks about men pretending to be soldiers as if that's the only kind of reenacting there is. The epilogue, in fact, is the weakest part of the book, because it is here that Thompson allows herself to theorize and psychologize and play the social critic.She mentions a few books that may be worth mentioning here. I haven't seen them. None of them may be favorable to reenactors. I don't know. She mentions Horowitz's book as generally disliked by the war reenactors she met. Caughey, professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland, writes a blurb for Thompson's book, in which he speaks of \\"the disturbing world of war reenactment\\", so it's likely he's got a political agenda in his own book.David Lowenthall -The Past is a Foreign CountryRichard Handler and Eric Gable -The New History in an Old Museum: Creating the Past at Colonial WilliamsburgTony Horowitz -Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil WarJohn Caughey -Imaginary Social Worlds: A Cultural ApproachFor a fascinating look at reenacting that lays bare some of the issues and dynamics of the hobby but completely removes them from concerns of history or material realism see the filmDarkon, which follows a group that has created a fantasy world in which armies battle one another with homemade shields and swords."},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"Since I write about reenacting stuff for the MVPA (with an audience of 10,000 readers) I felt I needed to read the book. At times it made me cringe and other times it was brutally honest about the hobby, however I think she captured what she saw. I just completed the book two nights ago.Most troubling to me were the frequent firing squads and atrocities she observed at events, and how things such as racism and sexism were thinly veiled in preservation of authenticity. My 21 years in the hobby I have only seen 1 firing squad (done as a big joke for a friend of mine who accidently shot his squad leader during a battle back in 1983, my first year in the hobby), and I have never seen execution of prisoners except when people are doing stupid hollywood games during actions on the objective at public events.I do take exception with her history of WWII reenacting, because it does trace back to 1975 in the US and much earlier in Europe. I know of people that attended events in 1975 in the midwest, so her view of how it got started is very \\"east Coast\\" in my opinion. In fact, the entire book is written from events she attended on the east coast, to include many FIGs. I have not yet been to FIG, but I hear the horror stories after the fact, so perhaps this is not the best judge of character for the hobby. I have not been to east coast events however I think the hobby has different flavors in the different parts of the country, so perhaps her view is skewed by what she saw in her region. Also, I think the hobby has made several big strides in some areas she complains about. her book is a reflection of the hobby in the Mid-90s, and it seems to have moved forward in some areas.It can be a bit harsh to read, much like anything that challenges your day to day values and assumptions that you live your life, however I think despite the wincing I had reading it, it seems to be on target. It also shows several areas that the hobby needs cleaning up. If you don't want an honest appraisal of your hobby don't read it. If you aren't afraid to look deep into your soul of why you do this, then read it."},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"I have just finished reading Jenny Thompson's book \\"War Games\\". I know that a few of you attacked this book when it was first released, but now having read it, I do not think that any of those attacks were justified.The book is a deep look into our hobby. As I read it, it made me think more than a few times on why I have chosen this hobby, and why I continue to engage in it despite the frustrations and expense. I have found that it helped me clarify what it is that I do as a WWII re-enactor.The book is fair and even sided. Which means that it explains the value and purpose of our hobby as well as pointing out its problems. Unfortunately for Ms. Thompson the publisher decided to quote for the cover notes, the few university \\"Egg head\\" types that think what we do is silly because when they were kids, they never got invited to play army with the other kids on the block. Those liner notes DO NOT represent the work she has created.The book addresses many of the major topics of the hobby. Our fixation with authenticity and our compromises; How we \\"honor the vets\\" but get annoyed when they tell us we are doing it wrong; How wrapped up some of us get in the hobby, and how some of us do not take it serious enough. For me as a re-enactor the book was filled with descriptions that made me nod my head and smile. A few times I laughed outright.Jenny Thompson did it right. She became a reenactor and asked the tough questions. This book nails us to a tee. But in doing so, Jenny looked deep into herself as well. Reading the book, is at times, a look in the mirror, and it has made re-enacting clearer to me. I will never look at our hobby the same now that the details have been so perfectly pointed out. And now I am so aware of those moments when we say, \\"we're here. We're there. This is it\\" (read the book and you will know what I mean by this)I recommend this book to you all.Jonathan Krieger[..]"},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"This book is a must read if only because it's one of the few on the subject. Grunska's book is not worth reading, and \\"Confederates in the Attic\\" only deals with Civil War reenacting for a chapter or two. To be fair, I have not read Jay Anderson's Time Machines yet.Thompson's treatment is fair, honest, balanced, and accurate. If you are interested in the subject, it is a must read. If you are interested in reenacting as a study of history, get it.My only complaint is that Thompson was only able to meet East Coast reenactors. The Midwest and California both have active reenacting communities with a flavor all their own. Not to mention reenactors in foreign countries.Her book is not definitive, but it is an excellent treatment, and very valuable for it's rare subject matter."},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"While this book was published in 2004, the events and opinions discussed in the book are from the early to mid 1990's. As the members of the \\"Greatest Generation\\" are passing away, there is much renewed interest in WWII reenacting, in particular. The death of my own father two years ago sparked my interest in the period, and my subsequent discovery of reenacting. As I was new to the hobby, I was anxious to read the book and discover what all the excitement was about...the \\"infighting\\", the lingo, and the constant struggle for authenticity. When I read Jenny Thompson's book, I understood much of what I had seen in MEN's groups. The problem is, I'm a WOMAN doing a woman's impression- I'm not part of a man's group. When Ms. Thompson wrote her book, there were few, if any women's reenacting groups out there. Women in reenacting have totally different motivations and goals for participating in the hobby, and while we also have arguments over authenticity, there are many more problems that are unique to women's reenacting. Ms. Thompson wrote a great book that offers some intriguing insight to men's groups, but should have been updated to include research after 2000, when more women's groups were emerging. She also should have ventured into other areas of the country, where cultural norms are quite different from the Northeast. Overall an excellent book- particularly for anyone interested in, or new to reenacting. Just realize the info is based on a very small portion of the hobby, and is far from all-encompassing."},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"I was asked to read this by a fellow reenactor (yes, I am a female WWII reenactor) and we have passed it around our little group for discussion. I know some of these other reviewers are also reenactors, and I am a little surprised that they rated this so high.Yes, it is \\"interesting\\" mostly because we are very much an invisible part of society. But attending 2 reenactments a year, in the same 2 places is not representative of the hobby or its members.Jenny Thompson is neither historian nor reenactor. The University system-created \\"ethnography\\" major she sports no more makes her qualified than my cat. But I will give my reasons for why I take issue with this book.First, she never gets past the staid and boring academics' \\"need\\" to dote on the \\"social, economic and political causes and effects\\" of WWII (p. 109). Give me a break! Those are the things that have given history the bad rep of being \\"boring.\\" You have to know the background in this of course, but Real People want something to tangibly relate to -- the humanity of war -- and that's what reenactors provide. (explained on p. 160). Interviewed reenactors get it across eloquently about the lack of education in both the public and among academics and school teachers (p. 91).The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is the reenator acccounts. They are genuine and I can relate to them. They are entertaining -- but just as I was really getting into the real reasons we reenact by the real people who do it -- Jenny Thompson intrudes and ruins the tone by saying she finds it \\"disturbing.\\" She was the most disturbed person in this book all the way through. That's her favorite word. I'd like to run it through the computer for the number of times she used this word. Unfortunately there are no women interviewed. And I have talked with women reenactors who said they spoke with her during her interviewing and thesis work, but they didn't say what she wanted to hear.Her \\"quotes\\" from unknown scholars (and I'm pretty well read) and unnamed National Park Personel show what a narrow and critical audience she knows. I have participated at many NPS sites. Reenactors draw crowds to some places where these Rangers would hardly see a visitor otherwise. And some of these Rangers are wrong in their information. Many times she uses vague references to whatever critics she is depending on to carry her argument as \\"people\\" or \\"those who\\". Not very scholarly, Jenny! And as for her remarks about Reenactors knowledge -- most reenactors I know only read primary sources, and scrutinize historians' agendas when their work is not heavey on primary sources. Her accusation about the desire to \\"own\\" history is wrong. That implies not sharing, and the very opposite of what we do.I agree also with the reviewer who points out how dated this book is, with references to the Oklahoma bombing and Waco. (p. 170).Regarding female reenactors and her assessment (p. 79): She's wrong that women are not interested in war! The main problems with women reenactors and their participation are the limited roles women played historically, and also our modern lifestyles. Women with small children can't take them on tacticals. Jenny's just too overfeminist to strike a balance or understanding.The book gets very repetitive. Chapter 10 is virtually the same material as Chapters 5 and 8. Somehow around every 3 chapters she gets back to being puzzled why anyone does WWII Germans. Talk to a few German-Americans.For Readers who hoped this book would answer their questions: My suggestion is to just seek out some reenactors and ask them yourself why we reenact! I assure you there will be many different answers. But I think all reenactors will agree that \\"reenacting\\" isn't something in our intellect. It's in our soul. And Jenny Thompson never will \\"get it.\\""},{"Title":"War Games: Inside the World of Twentieth-Century War Reenactors","review":"This book deals with the hobby of reenactment. Reenactments are big throughout the USA, Europe (and even Japan) as well, attracting thousands of spectators.Unusually, the author limits her coverage to only 20th Century reenactments in the USA which limits the scope of reasons for getting into the hobby, I think. I am cross-reading this book with another book \\"Living History\\" (Brassey Pub)which covers other reenactment groups as well.Accoding to the author, these 20th century groups are focused on private events (no public involvement), with unscripted firefights using blanks being the primary reason for reenactment. The public events with scripted performances and living history presentations appear to be barely tolerable to most of the reenactors, who have to deal with the ignorant public on their displays. This gives the impression that these reenactors enjoy their hobby only within a tight network of similar minded folks.This would contrast with other period groups who appear to be more focused on the scripted performance, public displays and the historical aspects of reenactment.Given this approach, I doubt that the book or the hobby would appeal to many of the ignorant lay public."},{"Title":"The Hell of Social Phobia","review":"This very short, very readable book should be required reading for all sociopbobes like me.

This is a much read."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Mr Fukuoka spent 30 years developing his method of \\"do nothing\\" farming but has surprisingly little to say about how he did it. After all of his research, he grows rice, and wheat, and then more rice and more wheat (or rather, he did - I believe he toddled off to the great vegetable garden in the sky a couple of years ago). He does this very successfully and describes how. But that's in Japan, and specifically growing rice and wheat. What most readers would want to know about are the steps and stages that brought him to this point, so that they can trace the same path in different climates and growing different crops. There are plenty of asides and brief mentions of mistakes and successes, but not as much as you would think for a lifetime of hard work.Yet Mr Fukoka's experience, and his writing, is inspiring (philosophical rants notwithstanding, which sometimes get quite abstruse) and many other people have since picked up where he left off, filling in the blanks and applying similar principles elsewhere. His basic tenet - that science is only applicable in very simple, closed systems and rarely has anything useful to say about the immensely complex ecological webs that exist in the real world - is a important truth that most scientists (honest people, mostly) know perfectly well but are afraid to admit to themselves. Mr Fukuoka's answer to this conundrum is that each farmer should observe, study, experiment with and learn from his own piece of land: the scientific method, but applied to getting practical results rather than trying to understand underlying mechanisms.What he describes is, in fact, an early incarnation of permaculture, and any good book on that subject will probably fill the reader's need for more when he comes to the end of this fascinating but too-slim volume."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"In the coming decetralized world (coming for various reasons but coming in any case), this is a virtual how-to.

Both are no-till methods that shun the use of chemicals. However, Fukuoka should be set apart from farming in general and Permaculture in particular, in that The One-Straw Revolution is essentially a profound work of literary philosophy. Indeed, in many cases it reads like a naturalist's bible. Although the book is dressed in the language and anecdotes of a farmer, the message looms much larger. We read of a man who came to terms with the problem of death, and then decided to form a profoundly new (or is it old?) relationship with nature. In essence, the nugget of his wisdom is that, instead of struggling to control and command nature, we must learn to work with and learn from nature. Allow me to share one quote:\\"To build a fortress is wrong from the start. Even though he gives the excuse that it is for the city's defense, the castle is the outcome of the ruling lord's personality, and exerts a coercive force on the surrounding area. Saying he is afraid of attack and that fortification is for the town's protection, the bully stocks up weapons and puts the key in the door.\\" Now I ask you, does the following paragraph sound like the words of a farmer or a philosopher? From the face of it, one might think Fukuoka is here criticizing the nuclear arms race, but he is actually talking about the warlike mindset of farmers who see leaf-munching pests as evil enemies that must be fortified against, sought out and destroyed. Whether we are talking about bull weevils or communities, though, his advice is sound. We must change our frame of reference and establish a different relationship with the world. Concise and yet elegant, Fukuoka's prose is pregnant with meaning. Altogether, this work provides poetic an intelligent critique of industrial agricultural practices and the linear notions of nature and progress that underlay those practices. In fact, Fukuoka goes as far as to declare that the scientific method itself limits our experience and knowledge of nature. An invaluable, timeless work that will move you, even if you have never picked up a hoe.j.w.k."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Masanobu Fukoka was a laboratory agricultural scientist who worked on fighting plant diseases. He also had many unanswered questions about the interrelationship between man and nature. After a long sabbatical he resigned his position and took over his father's rice and mandarin orange farm. Fukuoka thought that by putting the subjects of his questions into actual material challenges he might find the answers he sought.Fukoka was immediately drawn to organic and natural farming methods, and over the years developed a type of natural farming that he refers to as &quot;do-nothing farming&quot;. Contrary to what you may imagine, this method does involve work, much of it menial, but at least in Fukoka's experience the benefits outweight the negatives. His method of farming is thus:After the seasonal heavy rains, the rice is planted by scattering it by hand throughout the farming area. The planting rice is rolled in a type of clay that will help prevent animals from eating it but will not inhibit sprouting. Clover seeds are also sewn at the same time in the same method. The clover acts as a natural barrier to the young rice shoots, and helps the soil from eroding.The rice will grow naturally over the course of the next few months without constant pools of water as are often seen in traditional(from 1600-1940s) Japanese rice farming, albeit shorter and stockier than the cultivated rice. After the rice harvest, the leftover straw is scattered over the field to decompose, adding nutrients back into the soil. Afterwards, barley is planted as a winter crop and to further enrich the soil for the next rice season.Fukoka does not use compost on his rice fields or on his citrus orchard as he finds that the byproducts of the plant provides all the soil nutrients needed. He does maintain a small compost pile for his vegetable garden, however. Outside of the rice season, he tends to his mandarin orange orchard, which is also kept on a &quot;do-nothing&quot; method of growth. From using this technique, he has not only kept up with modern(tractor, fertilizer, pesticide) farmers in quantity, but has a much higher quality of rice, barley, and oranges. He spends very little out of pocket and sells his produce for a very fair price.The great thing about this short book (192pp) is that it is not exclusively about farming. In fact, there are many pages where Fukoka expands on philosophy, history, nutricion, intentional communities, and sustainibility. There is also an excellent forward by Wendell Berry, one of my favorite authors(Jayber Crow is a must read) Highly reccomended although it seems to be out of print. I borrowed mine from a local library."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"I happened upon a copy of this monumental text while looking for books on soils and agriculture at my local library. As a graduate student in agricultural engineering, Masanobu Fukuoka's book really forced me to think long and hard about the philosophy behind conventional farming. As such, Fukuoka's book is more about philosophy than farming, or better put, the philosophy of natural farming. His short vignettes on various aspects of conventional and natural farming are very enlightening, especially in the face of the emerging Genetic Revolution and the New Biotechnology. Rather than trying to improve upon nature, Fukuoka gives the reader approaches which allow him or her to co-exist with nature. As such, his approach demands one to lead a more subdued, simple, and austere lifestyle. In the book, he tells the reader how he came to embrace his variety of natural farming, which he has termed a do-nothing approach to agriculture, and the worldview that he has developed from his lifelong pursuit of natural farming.I myself value this text because he correctly points out that your food is your medicine and that those of us who persist in unhealthy diets will as a result become unhealthy. To him, food and farming are opposite sides of the same coin. Some may regard him as being anti-science, but I myself regard him as being critical of relying solely on science and intellect. Granted, while science and intellect serve as good starting points, they also need to be balanced with philosophy/spirituality and the environment. Although this smacks of so-called 'New Age' thinking, many in academia and industry are slowly coming to realize that our single-minded quest for higher yields, minimal cost, maximum return, and larger scale is grossly at odds with a clean environment and sustainable development.Thus, his approach is not a blueprint for farming for profit so much as it is a guide to farming for well-being- both physical and mental. In sum, as Mr. Fukuoka asks his reader, &quot;Could there be anything better than living simply and taking it easy?&quot;"},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"I read this book years ago when it was first published and it has been a magor influence on me and my gardens for all these years.

My garden is the most beautiful in the neighborhood, and without any pesticides, fertilizers, tilling, or backstrain. Buy this book, Gaia's Garden, and Forest Gardening.

It will open your eyes and make you see the world differently. Suddenly it will become all one world, living and breathing and entirely whole. I bought this book from Mother Earth News years ago and had no idea that just seeing things from this man's point of view would change me so much. I loaned it out to people, and each time the reaction was the same. Everyone was enthralled. I lost my book to someone who never returned it, so someday I'll have to shell out the dough to replace it. It awakens you to a perspective so precious that you don't ever want to risk forgetting it. We're all part of this great being we live on. I wish the entire world could view themselves with the same eyes a person gets upon reading this book. We'd all be transformed."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"I've been meaning to read this book for a long time. Maybe if I'd read when I was first starting out in organic gardening or became interested in sustainable food production, I would have been as taken with it as the huge number of \\"absolutely fabulous\\" reviewers apparently are. The thing is that I came to this book after 25+ years of organic gardening and years of trying various methods of growing various plants sustainably, so pragmatism is coloring my review.The methods outlined in this book will not be helpful to most people trying to grow food sustainably in North America. I am not talking about the rejection of chemical ferts and pesticides. I am there with him on that totally. I'm not talking about his focus on growing small, either--he discusses growing food sufficient for a family on 1/4 acre, but he is limiting it to grains (he grows veggies in a large citrus orchard). I am talking about the use of nothing but hand tools, the use of straw as a mulch, the focus on growing three grain crops which depend on a frost-free winter, and the use of flooding for irrigation. I think anyone who has made even a stab at growing food in North America on a small scale can see the problems with this. So there's that.There's also the problem of Mr. Fukuoka's unpaid help. I think it is great for people to go and learn from someone like him, but they work for no pay and live in unheated huts without electricity or running water. In terms of practicality, how many of us are going to have help like that? People seem to not notice this.Finally, I found Mr. Fukuoka's philosophy of nothing means anything and nothing human beings do makes any difference in the grand scheme of things to be despressing in the extreme.The central idea--that you can grow sufficient food sustainably in a small plot--makes sense to me, although in my opinion we have not yet arrived at models that are truly flexible and workable. But outside of that idea, this book's value is mostly in the depiction of one guy's struggle to make people think differently about agriculture in Japan."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Fukuoka comes out of an experience of environmental endagerment (Post-WWII Japan). This work shows the basics of a workable lifestyle that is kind to both nature and people. It is one of the very best of the low-tech/low-work, back-to-the-land guides.

I love this book, and it was one of the first to make an indelible impression about changing one's philosophy of how to possibly go about organic farming (I was an organic farmer later on). Poses searching questions (and one man's answers) that every gardener and farmer should look for the answers to, regarding how much we need to interfere with natural processes to produce food. Also a thoughtful look at balancing nutritional needs with what is seasonally available. Vital reading for anyone interested in permaculture, sustainable agriculture, or just a soul-lifting antidote to modern, corporate food production."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Though I had heard a little bit about Fukuoka and his practice, I was not prepared in the least for the way that this book would touch me. It was like a ray of light piercing through the murky cloudiness that was my mind; all the more remarkable because I stumbled on it by chance at the public library while glancing through the gardening books. He does an excellent job of demonstrating how much extra work we have all created for ourselves, how our scientific solutions all require further solutions, and that it is an endless cycle as long as we are straying from nature and its example. This book managed to eloquently lay out a great many ideas that had been lying dormant in my head: the overemphasis on specialization vs. generalism in our society, the break between modern urbanized lives and natural agrarian lives, the definition of 'enough' and how desire leads us ever farther away from that baseline. Fukuoka discusses all these topics and more--and in a style that is far more effective than anything I can write to explain it. It is philosophy, agricultural method, and cultural criticism wrapped up into an effective unity. A shame that it appears to be out of print right now."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"I bought and read this book years ago, and it was a light in the darkness even then.

From the universe within to the universe without, we are all entwined in the dance of life. One can't move a little without affecting the other. I loaned this book out time and again, and everyone was deeply affected, one so much so that I never got my book back and have been waiting ever since to afford a hardcover copy before they are gone forever.

He gropes around with the cane of scientific knowledge, depending on yin and yang to set his course.\\" Now, the sentiment may very well be true-- but lighten up, Francis. That's the tone of the entire book, and it never lets up.If you're already an adherent of real food, permaculture, and no-till, you won't learn anything new here.

As a bonus it is very well written and translated. Everybody should read it."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"I mentioned inIn Search of Simplicity: A True Story that Changes Livesthe inspiration I had received from Japanese scientist and farmer, Masanobu Fukuoka. He found through trial and error a number of secrets that nature revealed to those prepared to work with her and to observe keenly. This knowledge didn't come easily to Fukuoka. He openly revealed in his writing that he almost killed the existing citrus trees when he first took over his father's farm. But his wisdom, presented in books such asThe One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming (New York Review Books Classics)is a palpable testimony to the unswerving dedication of one man.Fukuoka maintains that our society's motto seems to be that \`Bigger is Better.' People want to feel important through \`important' jobs. He saw that agriculture, in Japan and elsewhere in the modern world, has come to rely on chemicals and machines. In order to pay for the costs of these inputs farmers aim for higher yields and people get busier and busier.Fukuoka suggests we can look at how plants grow in Nature--effortlessly. If man could work with Nature to grow his food he could live without much work and exertion.After leaving his work as a trained microbiologist and research scientist, Fukuoka began to search for methods of growing that were more natural than the modern trends that surrounded him.He developed a method of growing rice that involves no digging, ploughing or machines. He walks through his field(s) of high standing rice just before the time of harvest, hand sowing seeds of winter grain--usually barley--and white clover. After harvesting the rice, the rice straw is left lying on the ground as mulch and to return organic material to the soil. Some chicken manure is added.In time the winter grain and clover seeds germinate and grow. Clover fixes nitrogen for the barley, reduces weed growth and its roots break up the soil.Rice is usually sown in the spring, when heavy rains help it to germinate and discourage the growth of the clover. Barley straw is left on the ground, again as mulch and to improve the soil. Fukuoka hasn't ploughed his fields in decades. In that time the soil has dramatically improved. Microbes, worms and other creatures broke down organic material and, together with the roots of plants, aerated the soil. He experienced little insect and pest damage, hypothesising that the plants grew stronger and more resistant in the undisturbed soil.He decided to plant a steep hillside with citrus trees, without resorting to the building of terraces. He started out by dynamiting holes in the rock-hard soil for mandarin and orange trees. In time, he found an easier and more natural way. Fast growing acacias were established to fix nitrogen. Within seven years each tree was the size of a telegraph pole and could be cut down for firewood. The citrus trees were under planted with comfrey, burdock and daikon (long white radish, a traditional Japanese vegetable). The soil is now richer and more manageable and it supports low care vegetables (even comfrey roots are eaten and are claimed to be delicious) and a nearly pest-free citrus crop. He plants a few acacias each year to ensure a constant supply of firewood for heating and cooking.Fukuoka states that chemically-grown vegetables may be considered as foodstuffs but not as medicine, whereas organic, naturally grown plants can be considered to be both medicine and food. This sounds like Hippocrates saying 2400 years earlier, \\"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\\"Fukuoka warns of the dangers of Europeans dedicating so much of their arable land to wine grapes and livestock. He says that an equivalent acreage, dedicated to the growing of grain and vegetables, could support many more people. He is concerned that the industrialization of society is wasteful and polluting. In Japan sulphur dioxide from factories changes into sulphuric acid in the atmosphere, and has resulted in the widespread death of native pine trees. He sees that the world is moving forward quickly and without regard for the consequences of rapid change. In the West, people are separated from nature and industrial agriculture is based on what he considers contempt for Nature. In Japanese philosophy God is in Nature, the wind and the rain and the plants, in everything. Since God is in rice, eating rice in a conscious way puts one on the same level as God. He urges everyone to turn back to Nature for solutions. He says anyone can use \`Natural Farming'. What he calls The Great Way has no gates.The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming (New York Review Books Classics)is Masanobu Fukuoka's manifesto about farming, eating, and life. In reading it I could see and feel that for Masanobu growing and eating food is indivisible from spirituality. What a contrast and challenge to the present global systems of food growing and procurement.

Mr. Fukuoka states that natural farming is not just a method of agricultural production but it is a way of life.In The One Straw Revolution Mr. Fukuoka explains that modern methods of agriculture work to control nature with the assumption that humans can understand nature and there by improve on it, but modern techniques using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are only temporary solutions that humans have discovered in order to correct the imbalance they have caused. \\"Human Beings with their tampering do something wrong, leave the damage unrepaired (SIC), and when the adverse results accumulate, work with all their might to correct them. When the corrective actions appear to be successful, they come to view these measures as splendid accomplishments.\\"Natural farming allows for nature's processes to take care of most of the work that farmers find necessary in conventional methods of agriculture. Mr. Fukuoka claims \\"there is no time in modern agriculture for a farmer to write a poem or compose a song.\\" When he first began, Mr. Fukuoka thought, \\"How about not doing this? How about not doing that?\\" By allowing for the natural processes of decomposition and growth to occur there is very little work to be done and the farmers have more time to enjoy life. This line of thought has been central to Mr. Fukuoka's natural farming philosophy. Eventually he came to the realization that \\"there are few agricultural practices that are really necessary.\\"Mr. Fukuoka's method of natural farming follows four basic principals; \\"No Cultivation\\", \\"No Chemical Fertilizer Or Prepared Compost\\", \\"No Weeding By Tillage Or Herbicides\\", and \\"No Dependence On Chemicals\\". Although many of the practices described in the book relate specifically to farming rice, wheat, roots, and oranges in southern Japan, it is these four principals that can be applied to farming anywhere in the world.To give a good example of natural farming, Mr. Fukuoka's method of cultivating rice and winter grain is as follows. In the fall Mr. Fukuoka sows the seeds of white clover, rice, and winter grain onto the same fields and covers them with a mulch of rice straw. The grains and the clover sprout up right away but the rice seeds will lie dormant until spring. When spring arrives the grains are harvested and the straw is scattered over the fields as mulch. The fields are flooded for a short period during the monsoon season giving the rice a chance to sprout through the cover. Once the fields are drained the clover recovers and spreads beneath the growing rice plants. As you can see, this is a far cry from the labor-intensive methods of paddy farming that is common throughout Southeast Asia.The One Straw Revolution is a great book, it is insightful, practical, easy to read, and the chapters are short and give the reader concise, to the point information. Mr. Fukuoka gives readers a viable alternative to the current consumer lifestyle. The strong beliefs and successes of natural farming found in this book make Mr. Fukuoka's arguments extremely convincing. However, I'm sure the sheer simplicity will create doubt among readers, as we are used to the complexities of fertilization and pesticide use. Even organic farmers who swear by compost and manure are doing unnecessary work according to Mr. Fukuoka.The farming techniques found in this book are extremely important as our use of fertilizers and pesticide use has skyrocketed over the past century creating many environmental problems, and life on earth is facing serious consequences as a result.Another important point made in the book is \\"Humanity must stop indulging the desire for material possessions and personal gain and move instead toward spiritual awareness.\\" This sentence outlines what I feel to be the reason for the problems of humanity today. Without a deep respect for nature and our place within her we have no limits on what we expect from her. We have increased our material wealth greatly and yet we have not become more contented, in fact we become more stressed. By creating a simpler life where our days are spent outside tending to the fields under natures guidance. We not only would curb the destruction that is related to consumption but we also are given a chance to breathe and become truly aware of our surroundings and ourselves.I feel that the words of Masanobu Fukuoka have only increased in importance since the time in which they were written. People's lives have become increasingly urbanized and we now have generations of people who have been cut off from Mother Nature's wisdom. Although Mr. Fukuoka's sentiment that \\"if 100% of the people were farming it would be ideal.\\" may seem extreme to some, it would be a plausible solution to many of the problems we face today.The environmental movement was just beginning when The One Straw Revolution was first printed we now have scientific studies reinforcing what people have been noticing for years and the lands and waters that were once healthy are now being poisoned. I would recommend reading The One Straw Revolution to anyone interested in spirituality, globalization, farming or the environment, but I would also recommend it to anyone with an interest in preserving the quality of life on earth."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Some have said that the Fukuokan philosophy is the tap root of what is now more broadly called Permaculture, only Masanobu Fukuoka was a Japanese farmer, working with rice and winter grain in a southern Japanese climate. Both are no-till methods that shun the use of chemicals. However, Fukuoka should be set apart from farming in general and Permaculture in particular, in that The One-Straw Revolution is essentially a profound work of literary philosophy. Indeed, in many cases it reads like a naturalist's bible. Although the book is dressed in the language and anecdotes of a farmer, the message looms much larger. We read of a man who came to terms with the problem of death, and then decided to form a profoundly new (or is it old?) relationship with nature. In essence, the nugget of his wisdom is that, instead of struggling to control and command nature, we must learn to work with and learn from nature. Allow me to share one quote:\\"To build a fortress is wrong from the start. Even though he gives the excuse that it is for the city's defense, the castle is the outcome of the ruling lord's personality, and exerts a coercive force on the surrounding area. Saying he is afraid of attack and that fortification is for the town's protection, the bully stocks up weapons and puts the key in the door.\\" Now I ask you, does the following paragraph sound like the words of a farmer or a philosopher? From the face of it, one might think Fukuoka is here criticizing the nuclear arms race, but he is actually talking about the warlike mindset of farmers who see leaf-munching pests as evil enemies that must be fortified against, sought out and destroyed. Whether we are talking about bull weevils or communities, though, his advice is sound. We must change our frame of reference and establish a different relationship with the world. Concise and yet elegant, Fukuoka's prose is pregnant with meaning. Altogether, this work provides poetic an intelligent critique of industrial agricultural practices and the linear notions of nature and progress that underlay those practices. In fact, Fukuoka goes as far as to declare that the scientific method itself limits our experience and knowledge of nature. An invaluable, timeless work that will move you, even if you have never picked up a hoe.j.w.k."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Frances Moore Lappe's introduction to the One Straw Revolution reads: \\"...Fukuoka's message is more deeply radical than simply encouraging farmers to forego tilling or spraying; it cuts to the core of our understanding of ourselves and our place on this earth.\\"The book does offer up some really interesting philosophies about the food we eat, the leisure time we've lost, commercialisation of our food supply and how we keep trying to find engineering and chemical solutions to problems...rather than just seeing the problem for what it really is.I liked the book/manifesto for its gentleness, wisdom and clarity, and for the reason that he didn't claim to have all the answers...but geez, he did pony up some ideas that made me think including his belief that trees should not be pruned and his special approach called \\"do nothing farming\\" that saw him year after year out-yield \\"conventional\\" ie: chemical farmers. \\"Do nothing farming\\" doesn't mean you get to be lazy - so if you're looking for a book of gardening and agriculutral shortcuts you won't find it here - but that you use what you have available to work with nature rather than against her.If you're a farmer like us at Honeycomb Valley Farm, a gardener or just care about the environment and the food you eat, this is a thoughtful book you'll definitely get something out of."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen, please get on board, the Fukuoka earth ship is departing for Earth.

If there were every a course on Homesteading, I would make my students read this. The first 4/5ths of the book talk about a lot of the goings-on on a small farm in Japan that does things the old fashion way (and I mean hand tool human old fashion) but goes into it not on the \\"How\\" but the philosophical \\"WHY'S\\" of it. Why does he grow the way he does and work the way he does.The book was done by the writer in English from the writings of the Japanese farmer who wrote it in Japanese. The one thing I would say against the book is the final section. (The book is separated into 5 sections.) Is VERY Eastern philosophical. What is the sound of one hand clapping? sort of thing. When you start dissecting how you know what \\"WHAT\\" means. You'll start to drive yourself a little nuts.If you're like me and you left the money greedy world behind and are trying to ignore the push for all the gadgets and the glamour and glitz of the world out there and you are looking for something to help you understand what you are trying to do a little more, or maybe to hear form someone who can so eloquently put it into words that you feel like you ARE making the right decisions to do things more simply and not rely on petroleum quite as much. Or worry who wore what to the opening of some hip new movie. Then this little book might just help you a little bit.It's a fast read and a good one to have for quite reading time. You know those EARLY mornings you get up when it's still dark out and there's no one else awake. You've JUST got the fire going for the morning and you've got a fresh cup of coffee with you as you sit down in your favorite overstuffed chair. Putting your feet up laying under your FAVORITE cozy blanket with the cat curled up on your lap. That moment RIGHT there... this is a good book to just read a little bit of and sit back and look out the window as morning is breaking and think about how lucky you are to be doing this away from the rest of the world.I'm glad the farmer was able to find a way to set back away from it all. Not compelled at all to interact with the outside world. I find it VERY difficult to do that in the Western United States. My family and I live on a VERY small budget. But even that small amount of income has to come from interacting with people that DON'T understand this kind of philosophy and \\"NEED\\" to have that toilet plunged for them.But we've just started on this journey and maybe in a few years more it will become less and less and we WILL succeed to reach this farmer's place. At least this book is here to tell me there IS such a place."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"This book will generally appeal to two types of people:1-those wishing to learn farming or gardening using the most sensible, natural methods known while also doing the least amount of work and being rewarded with bountiful harvests and 2-those seeking spiritual enlightenment through communion with nature. I am one of the first type mentioned. I pretty much skimmed over the Zen Buddhism/Taoism, slowing to study the parts where Mr. Fukuoka talks about his methods and experiences in farming the natural way.I tend to write in my books, highlighting and underlining the passages that speak to me, instead of taking seperate notes. My copy of this book now has alot of added ink--sometimes I have underlined entire pages. The amount of useful information in this book is astounding. It's full. I'm not seeking enlightenment, or I would say it is full to overflowing.While I don't have a farm, I do keep a backyard garden, and I have found the techniques Mr. Fukuoka teaches to be especially useful and time/energy saving for me. You don't have to have a green thumb for his methods to work either.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to begin farming or gardening the natural way, especially if you want to get in on the now popular \\"Go-Green\\" trend, as his methods call for No Tilling, No Fertilizer, No Pesticides, and No Weeding.Sounds like \\"No Work\\" right? Well, there is work involved, but it is minimal compared to the modern methods of farming and gardening.You will want to check into this one. I did, and I have not once been sorry for it.Five big, bright shiny stars from me to you, Mr. Fukuoka."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"This book is revolutionary. It really shows us how to get back to the natural way of farming and living. Like Thoreau once said Simplify, simplify, simplify. Fukuoka brings one back to the essence of life. Life was not meant ot be difficult, we must simplify to succeed, the more complex tends to be more difficult. Nature does not need the hand of man to thrive. She only needs to be. In mans pursuit to control and dominate we have succeeded in corrupting. Fukuoka's natural way would help humanity to redeem themselves and reach a state of peace."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"I bought and read this book years ago, and it was a light in the darkness even then. I can't even begin to tell the readers how deep an effect it had. It drove home the point so poignantly that we can't separate all the aspects of ourselves. From the universe within to the universe without, we are all entwined in the dance of life. One can't move a little without affecting the other. I loaned this book out time and again, and everyone was deeply affected, one so much so that I never got my book back. It's not that big a book, but it is, still, a book that is as influential as any I have ever read. It is as much about our relationship to our planet as it is about farming. Read it."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"One-Straw Revolution is a classic &quot;story&quot; told on the subject of low technology, hand crafted agriculture. This isn't a how-to text or even much of a social commentary as the title would lead one to believe. Fukuoku started out as a biologist and plant inspector for the Japanese government and had an early life's &quot;vision&quot; for natural agriculture and thus went into farming in the early part of his career. He is a big critic in Japan of chemical farming that was imported from the U.S. after WWII and his simple and straight forward writings make it clear that he believes his approach more effective and ultimately more sustainable. I don't completely agree with his perspective but this book was translated from Japanese and may be losing some of it's real content in the process of communicating it's ideas fully, ie losing something in the process of translation. Fukuoku is also a Buddhist and this philosophical world view is reflected in his proposals of no-till, no-chemical, no-weeding, no-fertilizing &quot;do-nothing&quot; agriculture which I'm sure makes it hard for many Westerners (and many Orientals) to grasp his thinking. If he or his translators could have stuck more to the basic how-tos of his techniques rather than the &quot;cosmic oneness&quot; of his philosophy the book may've had a bigger impact for a wider audience. Fukuoku is a real naturalist and without a doubt unique. His world view is one that should continue to influence thinking regarding farming, land use and ecology for a long time to come. Enjoyable reading, highly recommended for anyone interested in this topic."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Masanobu Fukuoka is simply a great farmer-philosopher. He reminds of Wendell Berry. This book makes it clear that industrialized farming is not the only way to farm. Through his practice (not just his words), he shows a way forward that involves farming as a part of nature, rather than in spite of it. This book is a great introduction to Fukuoka's Natural Farming method. It is more on the inspirational side than the technical side.The Kindle version works out nicely, too."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"It was the first book that moved me and changed my style of life.

It is an easy read, throughly enjoyable. The author challenges you to rethink your daily life and question where your food comes from now.For Booksellers: Because a book is hard too find and in demand, it shouldnt be expensive (greed on the part of used book sellers).

My copy arrived new, sealed in clear plastic wrap, but it has major quality issues. There are creases in the cover near the spine consistent with the book being placed under far too much weight at some point after binding. (This did not occur in shipping from Amazon - the outer shipping box arrived to me in perfect shape and the contents were properly packed and protected.) The pages of the book are not all cut to the same size, which makes for awkward page turning, and there is discoloration along the page outer edges.Also, be advised that despite the Amazon listing being \\"One-straw Revolution: Introduction to Natural Farming (English and Japanese Edition)\\" the text is English only. There is no Japanese text."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"As is apparent, not only from the abundance of rave 5-star reviews of his book, but also from the many organizations and websites stemming from his approach to agriculture, Masanobu Fukuoka (1913-2008) clearly has had a profound and lasting influence as founder of a grass roots \\"natural farming\\" movement and, more broadly, as a respected representative of the more interconnected way of viewing our place within the ecosystem.Published in 1978, following more than 30 years of Fukuoka's hands-on experience farming in the Shikoku region of Japan, \\"The One-Straw Revolution\\" is both an exposition of the Fukuoka method of farming--direct seeding through broadcasting of pellets; no plowing or tilling; no chemicals fertilizers, insecticides or herbicides; seasonal grain/rice succession; mulching with clover and rice straw--and an extended discussion critiquing scientific values and their negative impact on commercial agricultural practices, our food, nutrition and lifestyle, instead advocating a \\"one with nature,\\" Zen-influenced philosophy of life.However much we can agree in spirit with Fukuoka's natural approach to farming and living, we should not overlook the irony in how his own application of scientific inquiry undoubtedly aided his discovery and innovation of natural farming methods: \\"I have made a lot of mistakes while experimenting over the years and have experienced failures of all kinds. I probably know more about what can go wrong growing agricultural crops than anyone else in Japan.\\" Fukuoka's success can be attributed, at least in part, to his diligence and perseverance in following that very same, experiment-based, scientific method he learned in his formal training and prior research as a microbiologist, yet liberally criticizes in his book.There is further irony in Fukuoka's writing regarding humans and work: \\"I don't particularly like the word \`work.' Human beings are the only animals who have to work, and I think this is the most ridiculous thing in the world. . . . I think the way animals live in the tropics, stepping outside in the morning and evening to see if there's something to eat, and taking a long nap in the afternoon, must be a wonderful life. . . . To move things in this direction is my goal.\\" I understand Fukuoka's sentiment in wishing to place humans on par with animals, but I would also contend that this view is much too simplistic. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, when the human brain evolved to a larger size and humans lost their coat of hair and found they needed to harness fire and invent clothing for warmth and survival, our evolutionary path diverged in significant ways from that of other animals--so that returning to the idyllic animal-like existence Fukuoka seeks is a practical impossibility.Like it or not, we humans will never be content existing as animals do. Fukuoka's criticism of the detrimental impact that chemical-based commercial agriculture has had on humans and our environment is well taken; however, I cannot agree that humanity long-term will be better off if we stop attempting to reason, analyze and understand the world in which we live, for the inquiring mind (including Fukuoka's!) that evolution gave us when we acquired larger brains is inherent in our nature as human beings. Our only path ahead into the future is to accept being uniquely human and forge earnestly onward--in a \\"natural\\" spirit consistent with Fukuoka's teaching, but without subscribing to his overly simplistic goal of becoming one with animals."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"This book moved me in much the way Walden did. It is the story of a Japanese scientist who leaves the &quot;civilized world&quot; and returns to the country to live with the land. Fukoka is much more than a simple farmer, he's an eco-visionary, and his story is most worth hearing."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"There are thousands of Self-realized people , but only a handful of those have experienced that. This Japanese farmer/scientist is one among the rare who understood the truth that unless one put the \\"Truth\\" (Self-realization) into practise in daily life, one cannot experience it. He used farming to validate his realization and shares great truth to us through this book. The truth he shares about natrual food is amazing and is in tune with the truth given by other cultures. This book is highly recommended for someone who seeks Truth in every moment of life."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"This is probably one of the single best non fiction books I have enjoyed recently. Like many folks, I do believe that there is a bright future with organically grown and minimally processed foods. I won't bother to get into the statistics concerning rising cancer rates, reduced marine life, ground water pollution, and the like. We'll leave that for Al Gore and Michael Pollan.I've been interested in organic viticulture up here in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, and many growers have recommended a few books, this being one. What is contained in these pages is philosophy with farming being the 'subject'. Fukuoka-san had a bright future in working for the Japanese government in the Yokohama customs division plant research branch. One day he saw the sun rise after a rather long night up and decided that he wanted something different. So he turned in his resignation, and despite most of his colleagues assuming he had suffered a nervous breakdown, and left to return to his family farm. Part of this was fortuitous, because he was able to escape military service; but more than anything, this gave Fukuoka land and crops to devote his life to.In the pages, we read that Fukuoka takes a minimalist approach to farming. He has done very little in the way of cultivation, actually his seeding of various crops and the clover which he manually mows into green manure. He doesn't even dig furrows. He then scatters the leftover straw as ground cover in winter. But this is all the technical side of this book which would appeal to farmers only. The remaining aspect of the book appeals to farmers and everyone in the world, since we all eat to survive.Fukuoka questions the current model of agriculture, wondering if there is a future for commercial farming. He cites many cases where the land is so denuded by the use of chemicals, that for anything to grow the land MUST be saturated with more man made chemicals. His whole approach is to question these methods and to ponder if there is a better way.Many of the folks involved in agricultural research in Japan have visited his farm and are almost always amazed and awestruck that his model works and works with less labor and cost. Granted, Fukuoka-san admits that his method must be adapted to the climate, terrain, and soil, and that his exact model won't work for any farm. But even those in agriculture are stunned that Fukuoka-san's farms have just as high of or higher yields regularly than commercial inorganic farms. At one convention Fukuoka rose and spoke of a better way to farm and how the spread of pesticides ultimately destroyed marine life due to runoff. One of the chairmen at the convention asked Fukuoka-san to sit and be silent, that he was upsetting the convention with his superstition. I could imagine an earnest, bespectacled Fukuoka trying to reason with the government officials only to be shushed this way by the bureaucracy.The book is written very well, with easily digestible blocks of 2-6 pages per section. Each section has a topic and the following paragraphs discuss this topic. It has a flow as if a few dozen short research papers were bound together. Which is what this very well could be. But the flow is very nice. The editing and translation work very well. Japanese is often a simple language with broader meaning behind the simple words, and the translators seemed to have understood this. They don't lose meaning by simply breaking out a Thesaurus in order for the book to sound more academic. Instead this retains the heartfelt, zen-like style that Fukuoka seems to put to paper. It is enriching, rewarding, and I found myself eager to turn the page. There are many black and white photos of Fukuoka on his farm, often just standing amid the fields or looking out from a hillside. They are a nice inclusion.It is amazing that this collection was originally published in 1978, actually a year before I was born. It seems this book is even more relevant now with the desire of many people to move towards this style of farming. Fukuoka-san proves over decades that his system is profitable for the farmer. But the giant corporations with chokeholds over the agriculture industry don't want people to turn to this style of farming. As the world becomes more educated about what they eat, I feel that this book will gain even more admirers. It could come to stand as one of the great books on minimalist farming. I feel that Fukuoka-san might be mentioned as often as Rudolph Steiner among many organic agriculture advocates. I will end this review with one of my favorite quotes from the book.\\"The irony is that science has served only to show how small human knowledge is.\\""},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"Unless you live in Japan, you're probably not going to be able to take too many of the farming techniques mentioned in this book and apply them to your own agricultural endeavors. However, despite the name of the book, this is not a book on farming, gardening, or agriculture. It's a book of philosophy, in the context of farming.Though it strays through topics of science, economics, social reform, reductionism, and many others, the core philosophy presented in this book is that the farther we get from nature, the more harm we do to ourselves, to our society, to the planet. Each incremental scientific 'improvement' in farming came with great costs, either immediate or long-term.Thus, Mr. Fukuoka began his own farming experiment not with the idea of what more he could do to improve his farm, but what he could stop doing. Some of his advances are now somewhat common knowledge - tilling is now known to do more harm than good, but in his time, Mr Fukuoka was considered at best misguided, and at worst outright crazy, for suggesting such a thing.At times, Mr. Fukuoka tries to explain his 'do-nothing' farming technique with specific scientific explanations. For example, pesticides may kill the bugs eating your plants, but they also kill the natural predators, and prey species rebound and adapt much more quickly than predator species. As soon as you spray once, you've got to keep spraying. You're better off fostering an ecosystem full of predators than trying to kill off the pests.Other times, he goes to a much more holistic, philosophical level. The farmer should do less on his farm because that brings him closer to nature, which is an intrinsic good.Mr. Fukuoka's anti-reductionism stance can easily be read as an anti-science stance, so any reader who believes science to be the pinnacle of human endeavors may be turned off by this point of view. However, he does make an awfully compelling case that scientific study is inherently narrow in scope, and nature is inherently broad, so science may never be able to satisfactorily explain nature. The step to 'Then why bother?' will, and should, be the basis for debate and discussion.Would we be better off if we all gave up on technology, science, and academic pursuits and returned to the land? In some ways, definitely. In all ways? Mr. Fukuoka thinks so, and will do his best to convince you. (For example, he believes disease comes from being out of sync with nature. We wouldn't need all that fancy medical science if we'd all go back to eating natural foods and living natural lives, so the loss of medical research and doctors wouldn't be a problem.)Whether or not you believe in his deeper philosophies, the rather scathing take on modern (even back then) agriculture is worth the read. Most of his claims are known to be true now, but the industry just keeps doing the same thing it has always done. Unfortunately, most people who read this book probably already know about super-weeds and nutrient depletion, so Mr. Fukuoka's words and experience may not get to the people who could most benefit from hearing them."},{"Title":"The One-straw revolution: An introduction to natural farming","review":"After a lifetime of farming, Masanobu Fukuoka presents us with techniques which probably harken back to prehistory and hunter-gatherer societies. It is very timely, however, given our current crises in supplying food for growing populations. An easy read, One-Straw Revolution is full of buddhist insights, autobiography as well as Fukuoka-san's methods to achieve successful crop yields with a minimum of interference to nature and less work for the farmer.

If you expect a manual of designs and methods for direct application in your garden like Mollison's Permaculture Designers Manual you will be disappointed. I would recommand this book specifically as a gift for people who are either largely unaware of the necessity for a shift towards sustainable farming methods or aware of the problem, but not the solution.

This rules out a huge proportion of an already small potential readership.The author also makes some ill-advised forays into the world of EN language teaching in the Chapter \\"Figures of Speech\\", something he is apparently not qualified to do. Most of these exercises were banished from the language classroom 20 years ago and the 10 pages of Spanish, French and English idioms, without explanation or translation, cannot possibly help a student learn to interpret.There is more.

Some of the combinations (Scrambled Eggs and Apples) seem a bit unusual for today's tastes, but on the other hand that sounds intriguing enough that it might be worth a try.This is an unusual book in that it shows the origin of modern French cooking. Interesting reading to see the prominence that sauces were playing a prominent role in French cooking so long ago."},{"Title":"Early French Cookery: Sources, History, Original Recipes and Modern Adaptations","review":"This is a well organized cookbook. I like that it goes through talking about the customs, ingredient, preparation methods, and recipes. Recipes are workable, and many use common ingredients.

I suppose that a reason it has not been reviewed by anyone is that it might be considered dated, having last been published in 1964, edited, in its third edition, by pianist Rudolf Ganz, and arguably eclipsed by much more recent surveys of the piano literature. Yet it covers the piano literature so thoroughly, knowingly, and is such an interesting and illuminating read as to set a standard for instrumental literature surveys.Ernest Hutcheson, the author, who wrote The Literature of the Piano, was a pianist and pedagogue. His book is basically a chronological survey and evaluation of the keyboard literature ranging from early harpsichord literature to the piano literature of the 1950s/ 1960s. The book is aimed for students and amateurs, though Mr. Hutcheson's standards for \\"amateurs\\" seems broad. For example, Rudolf Ganz, the editor of the third edition, writes, in a footnote to Mr. Hutcheson's suggestion that Ravel's Le Gibet (from Gaspard de la Nuit) is suitable for amateurs, that \\"I would like to meet the amateur who can conquer Le Gibet without hanging himself.\\"Some chapters cover periods of music, or composers by nationality, while other chapters focus upon single composers, e.g. Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt etc. There are other chapters on The Instrument, Living Composers And The State of Music Since Hutcheson (including the magnetic tape and concrete electronic music), and two appendices by Ganz on Technique and Fingerings; fourteen chapters overall, 436 pp, with an extraordinarily detailed index listing pianists, composers, pieces cited (over 30 pages long).The chapters on major composers, for example Brahms, not only cover the entire spectrum of works (solo, chamber, concertos), but go into discussing individual pieces, short but very thoughtful characterizations of the compositions, important stylistic, performance nuances with musical quotations, and analyses of the strengths and weaknessses of various editions of the composer's music. Interspersed also are interesting, and sometimes witty, personal references such as Rachmaninov responding, when Ganz asked if Rachmaninov had written a Fifth Piano Concerto, \\"There is no Fifth Concerto. The Depression is everywhere!\\"This book was evidently quite popular in the United States and Great Britain, and Hutcheson a keen evaluator of music for the piano. As a non-pianist, I have been alerted numerous times to quality music and composers I either knew only partially, or not at all. The scope and evaluation of composers and music, however seemingly minor, is astonishingly comprehensive and thoughtfully considered, particularly for a one volume book.If there are shortcomings to The Literature of the Piano, they might be 1) that the book does not include recordings; 2) the references to pianists relatively unknown today; 3) the probability that at least some music editions referred to might not be procurable today; 4) the list and analyses of composers needs updating (Benjamin Britten's music isn't mentioned at all, and Prokofiev is given short shrift); 5) the bibliography, though thorough, probably could be updated also.Yet there is a timelessness to this book. It is written by men who know and obviously love the piano and its music, and who were undaunted by the challenge and problems of writing a detailed survey of its literature. (Earnest Hutcheson, as noted, was a pianist and teacher, Rudolf Ganz an internationally known and well regarded concert pianist.) A highly valued and frequently referred to book in my library."},{"Title":"Expert systems in construction seminars (Technical publication / [School of Building Construction, University of Florida])","review":"I found this book exhaustive, yet concise.

Very seldom do we hear of authenticated miracles, God's intervention in the &quot;normal&quot; course of things. Signs and Wonders in America Today encourages us towards greater faith in a caring, relational God. Numerous documented cases of inexplicable healings, re-growth of amputated digits, surprising knowledge of sensitive events in others' lives, and even resurrections from the dead, are presented that illustrate God's power over nature and His desire to use that power through prayer. The book is particularly delightful in showing the depth and range of God's love in hearing and answering the prayers of children, for things that adults might consider beneath God's concern, as well as moving the &quot;mountains&quot; encountered by adults.Jane Rumph has crafted an encouraging reference for Christians willing to pray for God's will to be done on earth and material for skeptics open-minded enough to consider documented evidence of the miraculous."},{"Title":"Signs and Wonders in America Today: Amazing Accounts of God's Power","review":"In our workaday world we do not realize that amazing things are happening that never appear on the TV news or in the newspapers. Jane Rumph has made a study of many of these events and has written them up in a very readable form. It is obvious that there is an unseen force at work in the world causing things to happen that many credit to chance or accident. However, when an event occurs that defies logic but cannot be dismissed because of the obvious evidence, one must conclude that this force is at work. Call it what you will...God, &quot;the Force&quot;, etc....one cannot deny that it exists after reading this exciting book.

I wanted to read this novel because it promised to be an unforgettable romance in an unforgettable setting, but I was sadly mistaken. Although Ms. Laker captured the atmosphere of the Second Empire, her characters and romantic interludes leave a lot to be desired. which one was written earlier, I read &quot;Circle of Pearls&quot; first. I liked &quot;Circle of Pearls&quot; but not enough to have the same characters in another scenario. For those who read the &quot;Circle of Pearls&quot;, Louise, the main heroine of &quot;Banners of Silk&quot;, is a lot like Julia. Will is like Michael, with a pinch of Adam's determination. Pierre is Adam. Marie is a mix of Mary and Faith. Catherine, the only truly original character in the novel, bears some resemblance to Katherine, with&quot;~ Anne's vulnerability. And, most annoyingly, Charles Worth, the only real-life character in the novel, bears striking resemblance to Christopher Wren, the only real-life character in &quot;Circle of Pearls&quot;. They even have the same initials! I didn't like Christopher that much in &quot;Circle of Pearls&quot; and that made it difficult for me to warm up to Worth. grisette, Catherine, dreams of becoming a seamstress and rise to the top of the ladder in the world of fashion. She burns with unrequited love for Worth but he finds happiness in a meek vendeuse, Marie. (Ring a bell?) Then she almost becomes intimate with Will but their encounter is interrupted, creating a longing that shall not be fulfilled right away. He gets married and forgets, for awhile, that she exists. (Basically, Michael and Mary all over again). Finally, she meets Pierre and their relationship is interesting, but it takes half the book to get here. By this time, I do not care that much for Louise and Pierre's love for her is questionable. Enter Stephanie, in a Suzanne from &quot;To Dance With Kings&quot; role, and you now have a recycled material from two books. The rest is quite atypical for a romance novel (Louise basically lives the lives of Marguerite, Jasmin, and Rose from &quot;To Dance With Kings&quot;, three for the price of one!) and the ending is extremely&quot;~ unsatisfying.&quot;~ Louise."},{"Title":"Banners of Silk","review":"Bookseller recommended as historical romance but there is no love in this, not even good sex scenes! Seamstress falls in love with a french army officer who wants her to be his mistress, and she marries a man who's a liar and a wifebeater. BORING and no real happy ending. Not a romantic book."},{"Title":"Banners of Silk","review":"Set in elegant post-Napoleon Paris, Banners of Silk tells the story of young and impoverished dress designer Louise Vernet. The story opens as the newly orphaned Louise meets a grisette, Catherine Allard, who takes her in and fosters her. Louise works hard, learning every thing she can about the art of dress designing, eventually establishing herself at one of the premier maison de couture. The romance in this novel is raw and complex, and more real than most romance novels. Louise falls innocently in love with one man but soon out-grows her feelings for him. Next, Louise falls in love with a dashing military man whose inherent short-comings cause her anguish. Finally, Louise finds love with a friend. Although the ending was a bit of a disappointment for the romantic at heart, Laker's sharp characterizations and attention to historical details make Banners of Silk a thoroughly enjoyable read. Frankly, I did not see huge comparisions between To Dance With Kings and Banners of Silk (as the above review implies) but, as a writer, I understand that a good writer does have a unique and distinct style. Ms. Laker's is the finest I have ever read in the genre of historical romance. Buy this book, you would never be disappointed with her efforts.

What most people don't realise about it is that Charles Fredrick Worth is an actual Person in our worlds history. When it talks about all of the clothing for different people, he actually did make those pieces. He was the man who was completely resposable for changing our ideals of fashion in todays society. If it weren't for him we may not have the fashions that we have today. In the edition that I have read there is a page that says that Charles Worth's grandson helped get the facts straight. I read this book at least 5 times a year. The way that Ms. Laker intertwined the other peoples lives together makes you feel like you are really there with them. Don't just read these reviews and make your decision based apon there words. Read the book for yourself and then decide. Just remember that some of these people really did exist and that they helped make our life what it is today."},{"Title":"Banners of Silk","review":"Banners of Silk is incredible.

It portrays not only the court life that immediately comes to mind when you think of France in that era, but also delves into the lives and emotions of the working class. All around, a fabulous book by an immensely talented author!"},{"Title":"Banners of Silk","review":"Rosalind Laker is an author I have trouble getting a handle on. The first book of hers I readTo Dance with Kings: A NovelI loved, even if it wasn't exactly super high quality literature. But the next,The Golden Tulip: A Novelwas only ok and by the time I readThe Venetian Mask: A Novelit was clear that Ms. Laker had a predictable pattern to her books. So in spite of the fact that I have a collection of all but a few of her novels, I resolved not to read her again.But I was in a mood where no book looked good enough (you know how it is) when I picked up \\"Banners of Silk.\\" I was pleasantly surprised by this novel of Lakers, which I think is one of her earlier ones.Like her other books this novel focuses on a craft and the woman or generations of women who practice it. In this case, dressmaking in the time of the second empire when fashion rose to knew height and the name Worth became synonymous with quality cutting edge fashion.Louise Vernet, our heroine (who unlike Laker's other heroines does not have red hair) was the orphaned daughter of a silk weaver when a kindly young Parisian grisettes (seamstress) named Catherine takes her in. As she grows Louise becomes determined that one day she will dress like a queen and have her own dress shop. This dream is enhanced when one Charles Worth briefly becomes a lodger of Louise and Catherine as he tries to make a start in Paris without knowing any French.Louise's life is influenced by Catherine, fashion and three very different men who all change her world for better or worse. But she never gives up her dream or the hard work and drive to be a success.For me reading this novel brought back the original feeling that \\"To Dance with Kings\\" gave me. The book if chopped full of historical info, romance and doesn't pull its punches on the brutality of the world or the politics of the age. I actually learned more about 19th century French history reading this in two days then I ever did in school. There's no stinting on the entertainment aspect either. I had a very hard time putting down this book and raced right through it.The absolute only issues I had with this book was that anything Worth did was viewed as godly by Louise, who as a dressmaker in her own right didn't even try to compete with her own innovations-only interpretations of his designs. In that way she shows no real creativity. And Worth himself is portrayed as so cocky that I'm quite sure I wouldn't like him in person. But maybe that's the way he really was. And while Louise may not be your standard Laker heroine, the men in her life are. There's the tragic lover, the terrible man who gains control of her life and the Nobel man to the rescue who she still doesn't love the way she did the tragic lover. But, like I said, this author likes patterns and this book has enough originality; historical facts and details to make up for it.Four solid stars.For other historical novels that feature fashion as a major theme check outThe Tailor's Daughter: A Novel (Reading Group Gold)(wondeful book),Slammerkin(a little about dress making) andThe Lacemaker(all about lace and a great book to boot!)"},{"Title":"Banners of Silk","review":"Don't hesitate to read &quot;Banners of Silk&quot; because others have dubbed it a romance.

He had passed thru and survived the acute lymphatic leukemia of his eight and one half year-old daughter, Laura Lue. Within six weeks he was caught-up in reading Gerhard von Rad's words on Genesis when Abraham offered his son, Isaac. He finally writes about this in \\"Mending the Heart\\" twenty years later. He wished to discover more about that darkness and obscurity surrounding the ancient belief of offering your first-born back to the gods! In listening to John in his first \\"Preaching Genesis\\" class at Mercer-McAfee, two years ago, it was difficult for me to sustain his remembered emotions. We had both gone thru the loss of child and grandchild when we had desperately prayed they would survive with God's Miracle.When I saw no review in the list of John several powerful books, I went back to re-read and look more closely for his growth of emotional strength! As we reminisced about our seminary >experiences he reminded me not to value the experience as much as to reflect upon the experience. We valued professors, Wayne E Oates, Eric Rust, Red Top Owens, Dale Moody and Wayne Ward. In his \\"Preaching Event\\" he alludes to seminary, being a \\"community of grades rather than a community of grace!\\" I felt differently because I barely survived with only a Masters of Sacred Music!Looking thru John's Lectures, I caught myself counting how many persons he used as resources: Fredrich Buechner, C S Lewis, Sam Miller, Abraham Lincoln, Henri Nouwen, Daniel Levinson, Carl Jung, Gail Sheehy, Karen Horney, John Powell, John Killenger, Carlyle Marney, Loyd Oglivie, Helmut Thielicke, plus a few contempories. My sense is that he is better read than most of his pastor friends with whom I have touched base!

In defense of the book, it is listed as being a companion to the series, and in my opinion this book is really most useful if you have the show on while using it. I made two projects from the book and while the instructions were decent it was almost under the assumption that I had a tape of the show on as I was working.I have many other woodworking project books and they are all at least as good as this and most are much more clearly written.

The author provides a glossary at the back of the book, but I think it's only somewhat helpful. I've had a lifelong interest in astrology and have been casting and interpreting charts for more than 30 years, so this is not a problem for me. But Benson Bobrick has shown me what a charlatan I am! I had no idea that astrology had undergone so many changes in its history and that most of the astrology practiced today is vastly different from that of Ptolemy and Copernicus. According to this book, the sun sign was not nearly so important prior to the popularization of sun-sign astrology by Alan Leo in the early 20th Century. The 20th Century also brought about \\"psychological astrology\\" and the rules became less strict. A lot of wishy-washiness has come into modern astrology as a result. (No wonder I'm so lousy at prediction!) In a rather stunning demonstration Bobrick has blind readings done of Hitler's chart. The reading from the modern psychological perspective depicted a peaceful lover of the arts. The one read according to Ptolemaic rules was dead on. Bobrick seems to be calling for a return to the rules of the ancients and I think he presents a good case.In THE FATED SKY Bobrick traces the history of astrology from its nebulous Mesopotamian beginnings to the present day. For me the most interesting episodes concerned the 16th Century Milanese astrologer Giralomo Cardano and the 20th Century American Evangeline Adams. I want to read more about both of them. I am puzzled at the exclusion, save for one brief mention, of the Rosicrucians. Before computer software I used the Rosicrucian Ephemerides and Table of Houses. I know they also provided astrology classes and published other astrological materials. He also neglects the two leading popular American astrology magazines and the work of astrologers like Doris Chase Doane who collected reliable data on time changes throughout the world and Lois Rodden, who \\"rated\\" the reliability of the birth time. I think their contributions have been significant.I wish the author had included for the general reader an appendix or preface outlining the basic principles of astrology with a chart showing the houses and their individual meanings, as well as capsule meanings of planets and signs. I found this an excellent book that has caused a shift in my perspective on astrology. Perhaps other astrologers may feel the same way. Four stars."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"Simply put, this is one of the best books on astrology I have ever read. As a professional astrologer, I've read many! Everyone who calls themselves a student of the craft should read it. For traditional astrologers, it is an absolute must. And for anyone interested in the role astrology has played in culture it is a darned good read. Why? Written by a historian (not an astrologer), The Fated Sky covers the entire course of Western astrology - from origins in Greece to developments in Arabic countries; back to Europe, and its height in the medieval centuries and Renaissance; its downfall in the so-called enlightenment, and its revival in the present day. Though there are other histories of Western astrology in print, this is the best. All along the way are tales of all the colorful characters who were masters of this sacred science. Even skeptics will be impressed by the long list of distinguished rulers who sought advice from astrologers - virtually every Roman Emperor, popes, cardinals, and the royalty of Europe such as Catherine de Medici, Queen Elizabeth, the Danish royal family ... the list goes on and on. The names of famous intellects and artists who knew of astrology is even more impressive: Plato (tutored by an astrologer in his old age), Ptolemy, St Thomas Aquinas, Copernicus, Kepler and Shakespeare all were not just aware but deeply versed in the science of the stars.Benson Brobrick is not an astrologer, yet he has presented a very thorough and fair account of astrology. His work is suitable for both advanced astrologers and curious skeptics alike. Realizing that many readers will fall into the latter category, his frame of reference is that like it or not astrology has played a tremendous role in the history of the West. For this reason alone it deserves attention and study. He documents astrology's influence with so many authentic examples of documented predictions, some quite stunning in detail, that anyone reading with an open mind will be tempted to investigate further.While modern astrologers may be a bit put off by the traditional emphasis, the stories of people who predicted death of themselves or others to the day or warned of calamity to kings years in advance make us aware of the true potential and historical role of astrology. For centuries the power of astrology was the ability of its practitioners to predict. Kings didn't see astrologers to get a description of their psychological complexes; they wanted to know what was going to happen.To his credit Brobrick talked to contemporary astrologers and quotes Robert Zoller and John Frawley, two of the foremost traditional astrologers alive today. My only criticism of the book is that Brobrick ignored or was not able to talk to two astrologers - both women - who advised rulers in the late 20th century. Joan Quigley advised the Reagans, and Elizabeth Tessier, who had fought for the right to get a PhD in astrology at the Sorbonne (a first), advised both Francois Mitterand and Juan Carlos the King of Spain. Both women are mentioned in passing, but it would have been fascinating to hear more from them on their role as royal astrologers of the present day.Since I am an avid astrologer, most gratifying was reading many stories of people who have been similarly captivated by this sacred science. One person was so enraptured by astrology that for two years he completely dedicated himself to learning, even taking his meals in study. For those who have experienced even just a spark of a similar yet perhaps less monastic passion, get thee immediately to The Fated Sky."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"Bobrick does what most other texts of this nature fail to do: take an even-handed approach to the subject. Too many books dealing with the history of astrology take a dismissive viewpoint, as if current thought and 'science' is all that we really need to know, and astrology is but an amusing antique. Far from it!This book sets the record straight, to some extent. It's aimed at the general reader, and aquits itself well on this count. Bobrick presents a clear and easy to follow history of the astrological tradition, clearly pointing out some of the notable high (and low) points.Bobrick is wise to remind readers that what passes for 'astrology' today is a pale imitation of what has gone before. Modern astrology, from about 1900 onwards, is a dumbed-down shadow of the art as was practised for thousands of years beforehand. This book is an excellent overview of those thousands of years, and reminds us of the rich heritage astrology has to offer.My only quibble is that some astrological knowledge is assumed - some terms are often not clearly explained. I've studied the subject for many years, so was not a problem."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"As its subtitle suggests, this is a book about astrology as it evolved and was practiced throughout human history - from very ancient times to the present. It is a history book and not a textbook on astrology. Although the material is presented somewhat unevenly in places, most of the mini-biographies of historical figures and descriptions of historical events are well-written. The prose is clear, although amply peppered with astrological jargon. For those, like me, who are unfamiliar with this jargon, this can be distracting. However, a glossary is provided at the end of the book to help unfamiliar readers who want to understand these passages and explore the subject more in depth. Because of the author's apparent conviction of the soundness and power of traditional astrology and his presentation of many amazingly successful predictions that supposedly occurred throughout history, some readers may become convinced that there's much more to astrology than science would have them believe. Although this book would be of interest to history buffs, I believe that it would be of particular interest to those who, in addition to history, have a passion for astrology and who are thus familiar with astrological terms and techniques."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"There are a number of reasons why The Fated Sky is an exciting and provocative book. First by clearly describing the origins, developments, and mathematical rigor of classical astrology (not to be confused with newspaper horoscopes), it demonstrates how thoroughly our language and culture have been--and still are--pervaded by its concepts. It also presents in concise and often dramatic detail a gallery of the brilliant, and frequently eccentric, personalities who embodied astrological practice for more than two thousand years. And not least important, Bobrickwrites with a clarity and verve that carry the reader along despite the inherent difficulties of the subject."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"In The Fated Sky, Benson Bobrick takes us on an informative and captivating voyage through the development and application of the science and art of astrology in the Western world. As someone who knows astrology only through the horoscope section of daily newspapers and the likes of Linda Goodman's sun-sign psychology, I was fascinated by Bobrick's descriptions of a different kind of astrology, its relationship to the development of Western intellectual traditions, and the role it played in major historical events. Even if you are a neophyte like me, you'll find much to enjoy and challenge your intellect in this riveting narrative."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"Even one as convinced as I of the validity of astrology can turn cynical in the light of the sad state of the art these days. Oh there are good astrologers, but then there are also the legions of bad ones who want to poison the craft with their new-age theory du jour, psychobable, etc. When I first moved to my present location, I made an appointment with an astrologer and upon arrival at the session discovered that she had cast the chart for the wrong time of birth. Did she apologize and reschedule the appointment? No! She explained that \\"everything happens for a reason\\" and proceeded with the interpretation. Ok, ok, such is a particularly egregious example.In \\"The Fated Sky\\" we are reminded that such poseurs have always blemished the astrological profession; however, in bolder relief is the fact that astrology has been practiced and/or advocated by many of the paramount intellectual figures in Western History: Plato, Ptolemy, Kepler, Goethe, Brahe, Ficino, etc. Even one of the father sof the Englightenment, John Locke, had some sympathies for the practice. In fact, to coin a term, as regards astrology, we \\"stand on the shoulders of giants\\".Present-day astrologers would do well to review the works of the \\"giant\\" astrologers of antiquity and the Renaissance. Certainly astrology needn't remain static. I am not recommending a \\"fundamentalist\\" version of astrology. However, this history makes obvious that the competency of most contemporary astrologers pales in comparison with those of their Medieval predecessors.We are also reminded of our debt to the Medieval Muslim/Arabic world (centered in Bagdad, Iraq) for preserving and progressing NOT ONLY astrology but also many other fruits of classical antiquity - such as Aristotle's works- that had been lost during the european Dark Ages.The author claims that this survey of Western Astrology does not attempt to prove or disprove, however, one gets the feeling from the reading of this book that the historian Bobrick, faced with the evidence offered up by so many intellectual luminaries, feels partial in favor of astrology. If you are knowledgeable of astrology, \\"The Fated Sky\\" will provide you with an exciting overview and raise the question of traditional vs modern astrology. The book may be interesting to those new to astrology, however, as others have pointed out, neophytes may get booged down by the sections that use specialized terminology."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Benson Bobrick's Virgilian guidance through the dauntingly dark woods of astrology. He safely brings his readers to the shore, if not with a full understanding of the subject (which would be asking too much), but assuredly with an fresh appreciation of this arcane field. \\"The Fated Sky\\" is full of information on how and why astrology has touched history, literature, and religion in the Western world. A startling catalogue of familiar as well as unfamiliar names appear within the covers. This is a read that will stimulate skeptics, representing the majority, to take another look at the their world-view. It is not that Bobrick convinces the reader that astrology is \\"right.\\" Rather, he is persuasive in contending that our past-cum-astrology is not really past. We are still teachable on this subject. It is hard to be hostile or dismissive of astrology after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"The history that unfolds between the covers of The Fated Sky is truly fascinating. I picked up this book because I was familiar with some of Bobrick's other works: Angel in the Whirlwind, Labyrinths of Iron, East of the Sun. And was completely surprised and delighted.Only a remarkable historian like Bobrick would dare tackle a subject as tricky and controversial as this. But with the care and circumspection that is the trademark of all his works. He not only shows respect for the history of science as well as the occult, but brings his subjects brilliantly alive. What a great read! This astonishing book deserves the Pulitzer Prize!"},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"There appear to be so many sins of omission in this book that it seems impossible to enumerate them all. The bias of the author toward the astrological tradition of the Latin West and his uncritical acceptance of predictive claims make this book a better literature survey than a historical study. It neither thoroughly examines nor critically engages the formalism of astrology but offers one apologetic after another. If astrology is indeed as rigorous a discipline as the author asserts, one ought not be afraid to question its underlying assumptions rather than extoll its unverified capabilities.Correct predictions cannot be empirically evaluated unless one also takes incorrect predictions into account. Bobrick writes that the astrologer Robert Zoller saw the attack of September 11 coming \\"almost as clear as day.\\" But this is far from the case: Zoller pointed to a possible attack on the U.S., perhaps the East Coast, within a six-month timeframe. He also predicted a Sino/Islamic alliance, increased tension in no less than 17 countries, and \\"big changes in the leadership\\" of Bush and his advisors in November 2003. Nor did he mention the exact nature of the attack, what would be attacked, how it would be attacked, or precisely when it would happen.Even William Lilly failed to foresee the death of the Swedish King (from whom he had once received a gold chain and medal) or the deposition of Richard Cromwell, for whom he had predicted the establishment of a strong government upon the death of his father Oliver. Almost all of the astrologers profiled in this book had their share of howlers.As an astrologer myself, I had hoped for less positioning and more engagement. Bobrick, who is a student of the astrologer John Frawley, could have been more cautious and less credulous."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"I appreciated that this book was written by a non-astrologer who was nevertheless willing to actually research his subject and present astrology in an objective light. Classical astrological techniques (Ptolemy, Ficino, et al.) come off looking especially good in this work, and left me eager to read more of the classical works. Historians will like this book as well, since many of the major classical astrologers knew or had a connection with royalty, politicians, artists, and writers of their day. I found Bobrick's presentation of astrologers as people who varied widely in their ethics a bit disturbing, as this may reinforce the ideas people sometimes already have of astrologers as quacks and fringe players out to abuse the public. Nonetheless, the book did not gloss over the realities of these astrologer's lives, pointing to the fact that skill in astrology is not necessarily a guarantee of ethical behavior unless the astrologer chooses that it shall be so. This also points to the value of codes of ethics that have been put in place in modern astrological organizations, such as the National Council for Geocosmic Research (NCGR)."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"I wrote and submitted a customer review of this book a few days ago. Although it was posted, it has mysteriously disappeared, along with a number of other negative reviews. In the interests of having sincere reviews posted without censor, I should like to try again. In my review I indicated that I had enjoyed Bobrick's book, \\"The Fated Sky.\\" I also said quite honestly that I had enjoyed even more an earlier book on the history of astrology published in 2003 by David Berlinski entitled \\"The Secrets of the Vaulted Sky.\\" It was my view that readers interested in the history of astrology might also be interested in Berlinski's book, especially since Bobrick's book is amazingly similar to Berlinski's earlier one. I recommend to readers interested in these topics the earlier published and well written text by Berlinski, a well known scientific writer."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"Whether or not astrology can help to predict events, this book gives many examples of how astrology has been used by people throughout a very long history. Although mention is made of a time when common folk, such as those attending the theater, understood astrological portents as a part of everyday life, the book emphasizes how famous and highly-intelligent people made use of astrology for worldwide matters, as well as for practical, personal application such as the time of death (even though some, given the knowledge, tried and failed to change the event). Choosing to elevate the traditional approach over the modern, psychological method is debatable, but the traditional progression in the book from Hitler to Bush is quite chilling. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"Anyone who's been annoyed -- or unconvinced -- by the simplistic sun-sign predictions and facile characterological generalities that dominate astrological interpretation in our time, should read Bobrick's history. With his usual eye & ear for the telling anecdote, he summons a wealth of fascinating detail, beginning with the science's earliest known history. And -- I don't use the word \\"science\\" lightly -- he makes an excellent case for astrology's scientific basis, showing how the accuracy of classical astrological prediction refutes the \\"astronomy school's\\" easy dismissal of its sister study of the stars as flummery. Astrology was found nearly everywhere in earlier centuries, including the halls of the Church. Among many interesting stories is his explanation of the three Wise Men of the New Testament, and the fabled star that led them to Bethlehem. While a knowledge of astrological terms is to some extent assumed, the glossary in the back is helpful. An iconoclastic look at an ancient study, which has become so diluted in recent centuries that Bobrick's book makes one long, at least in this arena, for the good old days."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"This amazingly thorough and beautifully written book about a highly controversial subject stands as a model of impartial and fairminded research. It carefully traces the whole history of Western astrology with great learning and wisdom, and is blissfully free of both New Age cant and the equally tiresome \\"neo-scientific\\" hysteria that usually infect the partisan debate. In a compelling narrative filled with remarkable characters, judiciously mingled with wise philosophical remarks, Bobrick places the whole story in coherent context. He is nothing if not fair-minded, and seems most interested not in making a case for or against astrology but in assessing the subject on its own terms. That makes him rare. He is careful to distinguish between classical and modern astrology, and I think succeeds admirably in reopening debate about the subject's merits on higher ground. But whether you happen to think astrology has \\"scientific\\" value or not--and, as Bobrick shows, it in fact never aspired to be a science in the modern sense--this is a first-rate history, and the wealth of the material it contains is of such value and interest, and presented with such skill, that no one with a taste for the story of human knowledge can afford to pass it up."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"The Fated Sky is an incredibly well-documented and fascinating read regarding a subject that intrigues me. Bobrick's tome regarding classical astrology vs. the modern is exciting to those of us who never realized that there was an evolution of astrology over the ages. His book is a must-read for anyone interested in delving deeply into this science! Five stars."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"A caveat: I am indifferent to the alleged effectiveness of astrology. I am neither hostile to its practice, nor do I dismiss it outright. It's as least a good faith, or religion if you will, than any of the others out there. As a backyard astronomer and historian, I found the book's topic interesting. It's also an attractively published book. So... I picked it up.\\"The Fated Sky\\" is a popular history of astrology's impact on historical events. The author follows the basic outline of western history and shows (not always convincingly) how astrology has influenced major events and personalities from the ancient Near East to today. He begins with the Sumerian civilizations (Babylon, Chaldean, etc) and continues through Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, and into the modern period, with a focus on America and Great Britain.While the outline and conventional organization of events is good, Bobrick, however, gives astrology way too much credit in its alleged influence in impacting historical events and personalities. He often overstates his case and as a result weakens his argument.For example, Bobrick claims that the Roman emperor Domitian's sadistic reign was entirely the result of his knowledge of his horoscope. He writes that \\"from his youth he had known from his own horoscope\\" the time of his death. As a result, Domitian was \\"haunted\\" and \\"fearful.\\" The author then makes the outrageous claim that \\"everything that happened to Domitian [on the day of his murder] was confirmed in the sky.\\" (p. 42-43). Well. Could mental illness have played a role? I guess not.Other problems with this book include its lack of a table of contents and an introduction/preface. Their absence is annoying. As a result the reader is not given a clear outline or structure of the book, nor a clear purpose for why the book was written. In addition, the chapters are not given a title, but are simply titled \\"Chapter 1\\", etc. A detailed bibliography and endnotes are included, but there are no notes in the text that actually refer you to the endnotes! The editors should have corrected such bizarre omissions.Bobrick writes well and his style is tight, but he plays fast and loose with too many facts. I suppose someone who pumps out big books about every three years on such diverse topics as astrology, stuttering, and the American Civil War tends to skirt over the details in favor of the big picture.The Fated Sky is a good book, but there are better histories of astrology out there. Indeed, this book is for popular audiences already sympathetic to astrology's alleged powers."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"A really detailed account from classical times to the early 20th century. A recommended read to put in perspective modern astrological knowledge and state."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"In this book Mr. Bobrick again combines exhaustive & meticulous research and creates a very 'readable' history book, especially for those of us who do not regularly choose history books for our bedside reading table.I also heard the author on NPR and am surprised by the comments of a previous reviewer (who had not read the book). What I heard Mr. Bobrick say was that Carl Sagan did not sign a document, along with other scientists (though given the opportunity to do so), that totally discredited astrology. Mr. Bobrick merely wondered why and suggested that 'perhaps' Sagan had become more sympathetic to it.While we can thank the writer of the review for taking the time to contact Mr. Sagan's widow to clarify what she believed her husband thought of the matter, it was not my understanding that Mr. Bobrick was claiming to know Sagan's motivations or convictions. Since the reviewer is not planning on buying the book he might at least consider a copy from his local library.Perhaps the author says it best; \\"Astrology may be a suspect subject, at least to some; the history of astrology can scarcely be to anyone who cares about the history of ideas.\\""},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"Benson Bobrick addresses in this book both the history and development of the different techniques in astrology but also, and more important, the social history of astrology - its impact on society, politics, religion, medicine, and so on, and how this impact evolved and changed from century to century.Something that came as a surprise for me was the change from traditional astrology to modern sign astrology. I always thought that the majority of the current astrological books are garbage - and now I know why.On the negative side I think the author, from a certain point on of history, concentrated only on British and then American astrology - nothing (or very little) is mentioned about continental European astrology, for example.Otherwise, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"The author has definitely done a very thorough job of interviewing those partisan to ancient Western astrology, and no one else. It is amazing that this \\"history of astrology\\" is written as if India made virtually no contribution to astrology and as if modern astrologers have lost their way. These biases undermine what is otherwise a very comprehensive book filled (or even over-filled) with facts and dates. If you can get by these issues, you'll have a very detailed book, a \\"thick read\\", with some excellent sections and some boring ones."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"An interesting book that was found in a local book bin. Initially something that would be of interest in my sceptical studies, but by Chapter 6, I realised that this book was an excellent history book that shows history from the point of view of astrology. It does not show how history was changed via astrology or demonstrates aspects of pseudo-science that was proven by astrologers: the book is a history book that has the theme of astrology through it. Very much a different take but an unbiased view of astrology's influence on the participants of history, as opposed to the prediction of history. The book makes no claim as to the effectiveness of astrology in people's lives, only the influence of the process. This is refreshing.Astrology, as us sceptics know, is a collection of belief systems that imply that celestial bodies have influence on human personality, human affairs and events in life (1). It presupposes us to a confirmed \\"road map\\" for all people as a result of the birth date and the position of various celestial bodies such as stars, planets and the sun. The reviewer is heartened by the fact that in 2006, the National Science Board of the United States classified astrology as a pseudo-science. Additionally, astrologers of today believe that their craft cannot be tested via the scientific method (2).Bobrick is a very effective writer in terms of his research and bringing together the context of certain periods of history. His initial chapters describe how astronomy merged from the belief of astrology. Bobrick effectively ties in the science of astronomy and astrology and the influence of astrology for major figures in history. Starting with discussion on the astral links in the Bible, Bobrick commences his full-blown history with early Mesopotamia, the \\"apparent birthplace \\" of astrology (p 15) and discusses the impact of astrologers at various courts, where many decisions were made as a result of birth dates and information from the astrologers. Having said that, many astrologers also met there death for making bad predictions, or \\"incorrect\\" decisions, especially at the courts of Asian Emperors.The book is very academic until about Chapter 7 when discussion commences on aspects of how the great scientist of the Middle Ages all drew their inspiration from astrology and all continued to cast horoscopes after they become great thinkers. Interestingly, Kepler, who developed the Laws of Planetary motion, was a master of the astrological arts and his teacher Tycho Brahe, considered one of the greatest observational astronomers, was a court astrologer to Fredrick ll of Denmark. Shakespeare works are referenced with over 200 astrology related statements. The analysis of the statements made by Shakespeare are all considered in tune with the thinking of the time and this indicates that Shakespeare himself was a keen astrologer. It is these little \\"snippets\\" that pull the book together that make it interesting to those, like myself, that have an interest in not only science, but the history and philosophy of science. I also have an interest in science and sceptic trivia, this book will assist those sceptics that have a need to read about astrology objectively.Some interesting facts from the book include Carl Jung, noted psychologist, sometimes cast horoscopes of his patients to assist in his analytical work. It is reported that his friend Freud eventually saw Jung's involvement in astrology was similar to \\"fortune telling\\" (P 279). Additionally, during World War 2, the British Political Warfare Department employed an \\"unofficial astrologer\\" who wrote, as part of a disinformation campaign, a German Astrological magazine. Goebbels, Hitler's faithful assistant, used charts to show the strength of Germany in battle. Also, William Gann, the most influential trader on Wall Street used astrological calculations to predict commodity prices.Some questions did arise from my reading of the book. Bobrick did indicate that a large number of possible predictions came true, especially when history before 1800 was re-interpreted, but the predictions of astrology recently have not been all that effective. The book states that Carl Sagan in 1975 refused to sign with 192 other scientist a manifesto against the use of astrology, but responded with a letter, reproduced on Page 303 that two issues arose with astrology, one being the validity and two the motivation of the astrologer itself. Interestingly, he compares continental drift to astrology, initially no-one believed in the \\"drift\\" theory, but today it is fact. In 1969, NASA apparently had ten astrologers involved in the first moon landing to predict outcomes (Page 306 - 307). As a \\"space junkie\\", I cannot recall this in any other book that I have read on the subject, so, I cannot trust the validity of the statement.One aspect of the book that is both effective, yet disappointing is Bobrick's approach to history texts. The effectiveness comes in where the author knows his subject, demonstrates excellent research and creates a context for the subject by including aspects of the contempory political environment and related information. But, as the theme is astrology, the author tends, on some subjects tends to pull away from the theme and starts to move off in a tangent away from astrology and discuss unrelated issues, Examples of the effectiveness is the section relating to all the astrology related themes in Shakespeare's writings. This section shows the author complete dedication to the art of astrology and how William Shakespeare bought out the art in his writing. But then, the author moves off on the tangent when discussing other authors. This is only seen in a small number of sections of the book, but it was very distracting to the reviewer. But, should a person be interested in the history of astrology, the author does make amends by staying on course for most of the book.The book has an excellent centre section of black & white images with detailed information and references. A glossary at the rear of the book explains many astrology related terms used in the book.Would this book be a suitable addition to the sceptic's library ? If the sceptic is interested in the history of astrology and needs an unbiased book on the impact of astrology in history and science, this book would make a nice addition. The book would be complimented by other texts no doubt. The book does allow the reader to think about the impact of the occult on science and how astrology leads to many discoveries and concepts in science, including the concept of longitude and laws of planetary motion. But, if the reader wants a book on how the astrologer undertakes his art, the book is lacking in processes, but I do not think that was Bobrick's intention. But should a sceptic wish to understand the processes of astrology, I suspect that many other books would provide a most suitable explanation.So, the impact of astrology cannot be forgotten on the development of science, medicine, astronomy, impact on the major figures of history or even Shakespeare's plays. If this was Bobrick's aim, he achieved it.(1) [...](2) [...]"},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"The Fated Sky is an outstanding history book about the neglected subject of the history of astrology. According to Bobrick, \\"astrology is the oldest of the occult sciences,\\" and he also points out that it \\"is the origin of science itself.\\" The modern science of astronomy has its origins in astrology and Bobrick makes a spirited case that other sciences, such as botany, have their origins in astrology as well.Bobrick's definition of astrology is \\"an applied science, insofar as it is based on stronomy; an exact science, insofar as its judgments are based on mathematical calculations; and an empirical science insofar as its deductions are based on data gathered over the course of time.\\"According to Bobrick, astrology is about the influence of heavenly bodies sich as stars and planets upon human behavior. Rulers ranging from popes to kings to emperors to caliphs had their own court astrologers and European universities had their own professors of astrology.Bpbrick's work covers the history of astrology from the Chaldeans, the Greeks and the Egyptians through the Middle Ages and into our own presnt time. Bobrick also confronts critics of astrology ranging from the Roman orator Cicero to Saint Augustine. Astrologers were able to successfully defend their craft against these critics so much so that the likes of Saint Thomas Aquinas were able to integrate astrology into Christian thought.The Fated Sky is an excellent work about the history of astrology and as such is greatly recommended."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"This is one of the most wonderful books that I have read in the last 20 years (the amount of time that I have been a professional astrologer). Even though it is largely the history of astrology (Western astrology, at that) in the West-- primarily Europe and North America--it is filled with astrological goodies and analyses that any student of the Divine Science (Vedic Astrology) will find useful, amusing and often extremely insightful.The book reads like a novel and, yet, is all true. Western astrology prior to around 1750 was accepted by virtually all learned people and held an honored place in almost every major European university. Did you know that Galileo, Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler and Geoffrey Chaucer were all famous astrologers?Plus, this book is wonderfully instructive as to what combinations indicate fame, type and timing of death, money, marriage, children and other important considerations. Of course, a lot of type print is devoted to that lighthouse of Western astrology, John Lilly. John Dee and Marsilio Ficino are also dealt with in some detail. Astrology is also ably illustrated during the periods of the Romans, Greeks, and in the Middle Ages in the Arab lands.Buy this book! Own it! Read it, but, for Heaven's sake, relate to it in some meaningful way NOW! Maybe you can tell that I am a man of frequent and sudden enthusiasms, but I really, really, really loved this book. It will be less useful to those who do not have a working knowledge of some brand of the Science of Light (Vedic Astrology)."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"A decent overview on the subject. Not the most engaging intellectual history I've read (it was occasionally quite dry) and his scholarly rigor might be questioned (he quoted excessively and without footnote) but despite this, I had no trouble getting through it.Bobrick, I found, had a tendency to veer into frequent astrological jargon, without explanation -- and this, coupled with his subtle (indeed, almost implied) argument that astrology was a science on par with any other, led me to read with a little more active criticism than usual.I also found it strange that such a prolific writer was so focused on the United states (he regularly referred to \\"our forefathers\\" and \\"our history\\") as well as Western astrological history in general. This volume contains virtually nothing on the Asian traditions.Still, not bad. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the subject -- though I must admit, I'm expecting a lot more from Tarnas' \\"Cosmos and Psyche\\"."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"The author's bias in this book can serve as a useful teaching tool, since it illustrates how Pluto's transit through Sagittarius has brought an ugly fundamentalism to the forefront in virtually every aspect of human activity - including astrology. The fantasy that retreating into the work of ancient astrologers - who may have have calculated fewer charts in a lifetime than a modern astrologer using a computer looks at in a year, and who never tell us about the times when their techniques failed - will magically restore the respectability of our profession is truly pathetic, but all the rage since 1995. But if you're one of those people who think that older is always better, you'll love this book. And to correct one of the author's many slanders against contemporary astrology, no credible modern astrologer reading Hitler's chart would have missed his cruel, sadistic, egotistical, recklessly overconfident nature. But they likely would have attempted to dissuade him from invading Poland or planning the Holocaust - instead of attributing responsibility for his crimes to his horoscope or \\"fate\\". For a much better introduction to a defensible contemporary astrology, I enthusiastically recommend either Dennis Elwell's Cosmic Loom or Richard Tarnas' Cosmos and Psyche."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"Tracing the Stars In A Different Way., March 5, 2006Reviewer: Betty Burks (Knoxville, TN) - See all my reviewsBefore astronomy, we had astrology as the theory of our universe and how the stars affected important historical events. Our ancestors looked to the alignment of the stars for guidance using places like Stonehenge and other unusual rock formations.During the Reagan administration, Nancy depended on the advice of her 'friend,' Joan Quigley, a San Francisco astrologer and influenced the president thusly. Donald T. Regan, chief of staff, exposed the 'secret' in his memoir, FOR THE RECORD. In his 1965 autobiography, WHERE'S THE REST OF ME, President Reagan described his and Nancy's attention to (actually dependence on) syndicated horoscopes. A strange thing to take place was his inauguration as governor of California took place in the middle of the night for strictly astrological reasons. Now, that's taking a thing a little too far. According to Donald Regan, \\"virtually every major move and decision Reagan made\\" was cleared in advance with astrologers. His supposed reliance on astrology has given rise to some dispute, in part because the first lady downplayed its role. She had dabbled in astrology as far back as 1967 and was not the first to seek guidance from the extra-scientific sources at the White House. Mary Todd Lincoln attended seances trying to contact her dead son, Willie; Edith Wilson and Florence Harding consulted the same clairvoyant, according to a 1988 'Time' magazine article.It seems astrology is the oldest of the occult sciences. It is described by this author as the origin of science itself. \\"From astrology are derived astronomy, calculation of time, mathematics, medicine, botony, mineralogy and (by way of alchemy) modern chemistry.\\" Astronomy studies the heavenly bodies in order to formulate the natural laws which govern them and to understand how the physical structure of the universe evolved. Astrology describes the influence of those bodies upon human character and life.Ralph Waldo Emerson is quoted, \\"Astrology is astronomy brought down to earth and applied to the affairs of men.\\" It's an applied science, an exact science, based on mathematical calculations. \\"The idea at the heart of astrology is that the pattern of a person's life corresponds to the planetary pattern at the moment of his birth. Such an idea is as old as the world is old -- that all things bear the imprint of the moment they are born.\\"Astrology possesses its own kind of knowledge, which has nothing to do with what modern science reveres. It is a doctrine which has survived for thousands of years. \\"Astrology swept across the Greco-Roman world, reaching all races, nations, and types and classes of men: rulers, scholars, the poor and the wealthy; invaded the sciences of medicine, botany, chemistry, and mineralogy.\\" The fundamental work on astrology in classical antiquity was written by Ptolomy in the 2nd century A.D. when he was a research professor at the Alexandria library, the most famous institute of learning in classical times. \\"For Ptolemy, astronomy and astrology were two sides of the same coin. In astronomy, he writes, \\"we apprehend the movements of the sun, moon and stars in relation to each other and to the earth; in astrology, the changes that the heavens bring about is that which they surround.\\"Indira Gandhi subscribed to astrology and apparently knew of the danger of her assassination by one of her personal bodygruards in advance. Theodore Roosevelt regularly consulted his horoscope. In 1944, Charles de Gaulle had a regular astrologer by the name of Maurice Vasset and consulted him until the end of his career. Aldous Huxley was once asked what modern scientists say if a prominent member of their group announced he believed in astrology. His reply: \\"They would say, 'Here is a great scientist with a foible.\\" The popular astronomer Carl Sagan had little use for astrology. Evangeline Adams wrote that \\"the horoscope does not pronounce sentence ...It gives warning.\\"I tell people that I read my horoscope everyday so I'll know what not to do. \\"Astrology columns are carried by most of the nation's daily newspapers and hundreds of magazines, and can be found on numerous Internet sites.\\" Benson Bobrick's themes are varied and one of his diverse history books, TESTAMENT, about a young Confederate soldier as his troop traversed the state of Tennessee, I reviewed earlier. 'New York Times' calls him the most interesting historian writing today. Actually, his PhD is for English & Comparative Literature, but that's close enough; lit is based on historical facts and myths."},{"Title":"The Fated Sky: Astrology in History","review":"I heard this author for an hour on a local radio call-in show during his book tour for this. While he was careful with his words of praise, many of his statements seemed to indicate that he is not merely an objective historian of astrology but also believes in this pseudo-science to some extent.In response to a caller who lambasted astrology and pointed listeners to Carl Sagan's book on modern superstitions (\\"The Demon Haunted World\\"), Bobrick had the gall to state that Sagan became more sympathetic to astrology toward the end of his life.I contacted Sagan's collaborator and widow Anne Druyan to check on this outrageous statement. She passionately denied Bobrick's assertion. Given that debunking the superstitions that continue to prey on the human mind into the 21st century was one of Sagan's passions, I was not surprised. Whether this was a mistake or an intentional distortion of the truth on Bobrick's part remains to be seen.Based on this experience I will not buy this book, and I would advise readers to view its contents skeptically."},{"Title":"Astro Essentials: Planets in Signs, Houses and Aspects","review":"Astro Essentials can serve as an excellent introduction to the fascinating world of astrology.

Probably his most groundbreaking work - partially contained in this volume - concerns the importance of language as expressing our desire, our need for love - a desire, by the way, that can never be fulfilled and results in pain and frustration.Anthony Wilden provides a decent translation, but all translations of Lacan's work - like the writings of Derrida - face a very difficult task.

Nesbitt's attempt to explain why &quot;Jeb&quot; Stuart should not be blamed for any part of the Confederate failure in the 1863 Pennsylvania campaign could not pass History 101, let alone be considered as serious military prose. The author's incredibly narrow criteria that employs only selective use of some portions of certain documents, while ignoring vital evidence such as the historical context in which ALL of the orders were written, Lee's important restraining orders, Stuart's own actions at Haymarket, Dover and elsewhere throughout the ill-fated eight day &quot;raid&quot; that show he was following an agenda all his own, and much much more, reduce this work to a poorly organized, intellectually shabby exercise. With such a spotty and incomplete use of all the available evidence, Nesbitt's work should be viewed with greatest amount of caution and skepticism possible."},{"Title":"Saber & Scapegoat","review":"Having read and studied the author's book carefully, the most accurate way I know how to describe it is simply as &quot;factually challenged history.&quot; That there are many omitted facts from Nesbitt's book one wonders why the attempt was made in the first place. If someone is looking for a well reasoned treatise on the Lee-Stuart issues at play in the Gettysburg campaign, they need look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Saber & Scapegoat","review":"Author Nesbitt appears to have taken up the cause so energetically fought by Stuart friend and appologist, Col. John Mosby in the last decades of the partisan's life. Like Mosby's defense (Stuart's Cavalry in the Gettysburg Campaign), this study suffers from poor organization which leads to a sense of confusion. Perhaps the author felt he had such a plethera of points of contention that he had difficulty in maintaining his direction.The author's main points center on the ambiguity of the evidence supporting the charges brought against Stuart by men such as Lee's aids, Marshal, Long, and Taylor. He correctly points out the inconsistencies of some points and challenges the logic of others. The bulk of his defense is based on supposition, a point he makes in regard to the charges of Stuart's failure to follow orders, but forgets when shifting the blame to others.The one redeeming value of this study, as alluded to above, is that the attacks on Stuart's conduct during his ride to Gettysburg are difficult to defend and are generally brought by persons with an agenda of their own. The great weakness, also alluded to above, is that the defense of Stuart is also based on similarly difficult to defend arguments by men, read Mosby, that likewise had an agenda.Given Lee's loosely constructed orders and Stuart's penchant for glory hunting, especially after the generally defensive role played by the cavalry through the battles in the Aldie-Middleburg-Upperville area, it is impossible to conclusively determine where the bulk of the guilt lies in the mismanagement of the Confederate cavalry at Gettysburg. As the author has demonstrated, as it has been before, the lack of clarity of evidence on both sides of the debate makes it possible to read into the argument whatever one likes. For bringing the issue to the forefront once again, the author should be commended. Likewise, he should be applauded for taking a stand on one of the greates controversies to come out of the American Civil War-a move that ensures that one side or the other will not concur with his conclusions."},{"Title":"When Romeo Wrote Juliet: Your Inspirational Guide to the Art of Writing Love Letters","review":"This book is a sweet reminder of how simple and sincere communication can spark new love and keep current love alive.

A beautiful virgin working and living in a brothel run by an amoral madam. The girl is totally at the madam's mercy yet we are suppose to believe she has been there five years without being forced into sexual slavery? Give me a break! The sea captain (love interest) is one of the brothel's best customers (big yuck!).

I would give it 2 stars.Journey of the Heart - by Anita MillsI had almost given up on this book when I got to this story. I'm so glad I kept going. This story is wonderful. Ms. Mills manages to wrench an amazing amount of emotion out of this short story. Wonderful characters and plot and the ending will bring tears to your eyes.

Some stories hit and some miss. Yet, I always enjoy anthologies, because you USUALLY come across an unfamiliar author . . . someone new and satisfying.THE TOPAZ MAN PRESENTS: A DREAM COME TRUE was an anthology released in March of 1994, five stories by some of romance's \\"bigger stars\\" . . .1). Jennifer Blake: \\"DREAM LOVER.\\" - Rating: 9 (5 Stars).Modern day real-estate agent, Erina Littlefield, lives a fantasy. Her mind fabricates the perfect hero, the perfect man, the perfect lover - she calls him Sinclair. Now she stands staring, in disbelief, at an old oil painting. Her desire had really lived . . . once . . . but in another age, in another time. Shockingly, her dream lover is St. Clair Nicholas Antoine Rouquette. Date of birth: August 3, 1815.Jennifer Blake creates a beautiful love story in DREAM LOVER. This truly is a polished short story with just enough tender essence to bring the reader to a most satisfying conclusion.2).

They are poor and make their way by working in the kitchen of a brothel. The madam decides Samantha Goode should learn the house trade and offers her to Captain Kit Warfield and the frolic begins!What can I say, Shirl Henke's story was just really dumb, yet it was fun. Yes, LOVE FOR SAIL is entertaining, but don't expect a lot, even the ending is noticeably corny. Yet I turned the pages, I read the words, I found I JUST had to finish this surprisingly enjoyable short story!3). Becky Lee Weyrich: \\"OLD LOVE AND LILAC LACE.\\" - Rating: 6 (3 Stars).In rough, coastal water surrounding Georgia's Jekyll Island, Paxton Carmichael died pursuing his love, Lydia Bennington Aynsley. Generations later Lydia Winslow (the great-granddaughter) receives an invitation inviting her to the coastal isle - the Jekyll Island Club Hotel is celebrating a special anniversary. Upon arrival, Lydia struggles with feelings of deja vu. At first she resists the strange feelings but then indulges the haunting memories.Becky Lee Weyrich wrote a touching tale in OLD LOVE AND LILAC LACE, but at every angle, at every turn, this reader wondered why they used the great-granddaughter! Why couldn't it be Paxton's genuine love - the real Lydia Bee? The author explains the great-grandmother was too weary and too old to return. Upon death, why couldn't Lydia Bee grow young again. Imaging Paxton loving another woman dampened the romance. Yes, the new Lydia was a descendant, but so what? In romance . . . true love MUST BE TRUE.4). Anita Mills: \\"JOURNEY OF THE HEART.\\" - Rating: 6 (3 Stars).Anita Mills begins this regency tale in her usual poignant fashion. Georgina Esmond is the daughter of a duke, a man who despises her and wishes her out of his life. Max Durant is the boy who loves Georgina as a child, the man who loves Georgina as a woman, and the husband who helps Georgina find love and happiness. Although JOURNEY OF THE HEART starts with a bang, it falters. A pleasant story but it seemed to run out of room . . . it seemed too crammed for its short story outline.5). Georgina Gentry: \\"CHEYENNE DREAM CATCHER.\\" - Rating: 9 (5 Stars).Now this was fun - a bit of a stretch, but fun. New Jersey native, Sharyl Nuemann, is enjoying the sights and sounds of Oklahoma, hoping to capture a little of the fantasy blazing from her favorite romance books. Not only does she capture the fantasy, but she actually lives the enchanting dream, finding love and romance with her very own elite Cheyenne warrior.

I don't really care for the wording of the sentences, the sentence structures, or the story line. But my biggest gripe (sorry if this is picky) is the fact that the drawings look like dull, unfinished drafts that will not intrigue a small child's interest. There is ONE drawing that is good and colorful of a dog named Moonshine, it is conspicuously better than the other drawings and seems out of place. The others are done with regular pencil and some colored pencils. Two of them have the person depicted with their hand drawn basically backwards. I'm NOT trying to slam the artist here, and I don't have an artistic bone in my body, but good grief. As I try to help my grandson read the words I am distracted by how bad the drawings are and that they look unfinished. I don't see anything particularly helpful in this book word-wise that would benefit an early reader. While I feel reticent to write such a negative review and I hope the author/artist never see this, my intent here is to spare some parent/grandparent wasting $16 on this."},{"Title":"Enough, Inigo, Enough: The Life & Times of Inigo McKenzie","review":"this is an amazing approach to young children's literature. emphasis is placed on the text, and sentences and pictures alternate every other page. the drawings are kind of strange, but certainly artistic. the story is charming and inigo is not a typical narrating toddler, he is aware of himself and his world. his is also interesting and confident. this book is a lot of fun and a very appropriate text for an early reader, or even an emerging reader of preschool age."},{"Title":"The Ordways","review":"William Humphrey's second novel The Ordways (1964) is not as well known as his more celebrated first novel Home From the Hill (1958). The novel's early reception suffered from its fragmented structure, as it is separated into 4 distinct sections: In a Country Churchyard, The Stepchild, Sam Ordway's Revenge, and Family Reunion. Like Home From the Hill, the plot is intricate and convoluted. It various digressions, references to unrevealed elements and events, and frequent narrative jumps between past and present slowly reveals the story in bits and pieces.Humphrey's writing was often compared to Faulkner, an influence Humphrey vigorously denied. Insightful comments from two reviewers are revealing: &quot;[Humphrey's] cosmos is less awry than Faulkner's, and his syntax is far more agreeable,&quot; and &quot;Humphrey gives us...a piece of Faulkner in which the obscurities have been clarified and the crooked made straight.&quot;Nearly 40 years after its publication, the loose structure and the Faulknerian inheritance of The Ordways are no longer hindrances to its value. It was unjust to Humphrey that the book was viewed as a shortfall compared to his first.The story contains two main elements. First is the retold saga of the migration of the Ordway family ancestors from Tennessee to Texas, which is recounted in the section entitled In a Country Churchyard. The saga relates the travails of Civil War soldier Thomas Ordway, his incapacitating injury, his wife Ella's determination to keep the family together, their eventful migration to Texas, and the remainder of their lives in Texas. This remembrance is told during Remembrance Day, a yearly event where families clean cemetery housing the graves of their ancestors. In a Country Churchyard is brilliant writing and story-telling, both emotional and hilarious. Much of the Ordway history is extravagant and over-the-top, yet deeply moving at the same time. Bert Almon, Humphrey's primary literary critic, points out that Humphrey's desire was to satirize a number of southern and western cultural myths: the glorification of the lost southern cause of the Civil War, excessive southern piety to family, glamorization of the Wild West and cowboys, and an obsession with the past. Despite his extra-textual satirical goal, Humphrey does not come off as nasty or sarcastic. In fact, his love and affection are clearly on display. In a Country Churchyard is fiction, writing, and story-telling at its finest.The second main element is an account spanning nearly 30 years of the kidnapping of Sam Ordway's son Ned by a neighbor, Sam's futile attempt to track down his son and the perpetrator, and at last the reunion of father and son about 30 years after the fact. The Stepchild describes the loss of the child and the step-by-step realization that he has been kidnapped. Slow, yet dramatic, The Stepchild is more straightforward story-telling compared to In a Country Churchyard. However, the events in The Stepchild, frequently and tantalizingly foreshadowed in In a Country Churchyard, make the prologue even more masterful and gives The Stepchild an extra poignancy. Sam Ordway's Revenge is a humorous recital of Sam Ordway's ridiculous search for his son. Ludicrous events happen time and again; this section perhaps reveals Humphrey's satirical intent the most. It does not continue the same sense of drama and devotion of the previous two sections and thus I found it somewhat weaker. Family Reunion is also weak compared to the book's first two sections. It is similarly humorous, capturing the celebrations across Texas for the reunion of Sam and his son Ned. The reunion of father and son provides some relief to the reader after the central tragedy of the kidnapping, but one wonders if the book may have been more powerful had the reunion never occurred.Mr. Humphrey's lack of literary success was a source of great disappointment to him. I am similarly at a loss why his career did not take off as did those of his less-talented contemporaries. William Humphrey died in August 1997. I hope that his extremely worthy works The Ordways, Home from the Hill, and Farther Off from Heaven will not be forgotten. Everything you could ever want of a writer is there.Thanks to LSU Press, two of these fine books are still available. A word to the fiction connoisseur - buy them while you can."},{"Title":"The Ordways","review":"This is an important book for every Texan to read because it is a family history so many of us share.

He describes how customers haved won from bureaucracies who have tried to specialise so that they would not have to face the customer or cooperate with other departments. Changing organisations requires careful listening to the players in the organisation; finding what is their problem to solve and what are strategies they adopt to reach that goal. Dupuy uses a sociological tool that can be applied directly in business. He writes in a humoristic way and does not suffer from the syndrom of needing way too many pages to get across the message. An easy read, funny, and surely a surprise even to those people who have read many business books."},{"Title":"Putt-Putt: The Great Pet Chase","review":"My 19 month old daughter fell in love with this book the moment she saw the cover. Then I started reading it and she joined in exclaiming &quot;Putt-Putt&quot;. The story is about Putt-Putt, a purple car, and his dog. The adventure starts when they baby sit the fire truck's dog.

She actually did an infamous 720o turn in front of the entire German High Seas Fleet and survived.In the Second World War Warspite was bomb damaged in 1942 and repaired in the USA,severely damaged by guided bombs in 1943, repaired and reputed to have opened the naval bombardment on D Day, damaged by a mine later in 1944, repaired again and saw more action bombarding Brest. In a final show of defiance she broke her tow en route to scrapping, ran aground 23 April 1947 and was finally cut up where she lay.Sadly in Britain we did not preserve any 20th century battleships, this book is a fitting tribute."},{"Title":"Battleship Warspite (Anatomy of the Ship)","review":"The Battleship \\"Warspite\\" was one of 5 ships of the Queen Elizabeth class and went on to serve with great distinction in World War 1 (including the Battle of Jutland) and World War 2 before finally being scrapped in 1947.

Tiger, the cat, is a typical kitten and a terror to the whole house with his playful, and curious kitten ways. Tiger isn't the only change in Chris' life. Starting the third grade, and having his best friend move aren't easy tasks. All of this is weaved into a lasting tale that will keep the young reader entertained."},{"Title":"Just Plain Cat (R)","review":"Although this book is, on the surface, a pleasant glimpse into the life of a third grade boy, Chris, and his recently acquired kitten Tiger, it is filled with shockingly dark undertones. Gripping poverty is the subject of most of the book's chapters. For instance, in the first chapter, Chris's mother tells him that they do not have enough money to buy a new pencil for the start of school. Chris is initially not allowed to get Tiger because the family cannot afford their rent or grocery bills. In the latter chapters, the family's financial prospects brighten in anticipation of an upcoming photo shoot that is to take place in their house. For one brief moment, it appears as though everything will work out for the better, until SURPRISE, the cat ruins the photo shoot by eating the negatives and the family is poor again. That is how the book ends. Sorry for ruining it."},{"Title":"ATLAS OF DESCRIPTIVE HISTOLOGY","review":"Remember this is an atlas not a typical textbook with thorough defenitions.

The illustrations are beautiful watercolors with lots of detail that will appeal to young inquisitive eyes. (I know because I tested it on my favorite three year old.) The story is a simple one of a trip to market and a more interesting trip back to the village. A story of wanting, of responsibility, and of reward. I think books that share even a glimpse of another culture to our American children are very valuable. This book could raise many important questions in children who have no concept of being so poor you must walk everywhere you go. It offers that glimpse without being harsh in anyway. As I said, its sweet and yet one notices our main characters have no shoes for their feet. The writing is beautiful and reads well out loud.

She's reached almost mythical status for building the membership of Rails-to-Trails Conservancy from 400 to 60,000 in three years. Now she shares her secrets in this easy-to-use guide. Whether you're a new community non-profit or an established national organization, The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit will give you a wealth of information to boost your ranks--especially important in this time of diminishing foundation grants. Ellis doesn't just give you the techniques. She also underscores the importance of developing your organization so that new members will want to renew their support. Her methods are well-rooted in community organizing, with emphasis on one-on-one recruitment, board involvement, and member participation. However, what really sets this book apart from other fundraising books is its use of materials from non-profit groups. Ellis has collected fundraising letters, brochures, surveys, membership plans, etc. from organizations in every corner of the country and presents the cream of the crop as models for your own use. The book is laid out well, with each chapter focusing on one aspect of membership development. As a professional fundraiser, I turn to The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit frequently to answer questions, inspire me to write yet another fundraising letter, or give me new ideas to try. I recommend The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit wholeheartedly to anyone involved with a non-profit organization."},{"Title":"The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit","review":"This book gets my highest praise for putting a lot of valuable information into one easy to navigate source.

I highly recommend to all development/fundraising professionals and volunteers."},{"Title":"The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit","review":"This book offers one-stop shopping for the nonprofit organization in need of money, political influence, credibility, free labor and all of the other benefits that members can bring. Not only does the book provide abundant information on recruiting members, it also offers, free and online, copies of forms and worksheets you can use to help advance your organization's membership campaign. It begins at the beginning, explaining what membership is. This may sound self-evident, but the very definition of membership has some surprising twists. This book will save you from making some very obvious mistakes - such as failing to convert people who contact you into members. It's a straightforward, no-nonsense workbook with excellent samples and examples. If you are an executive, board member, staffer or volunteer at a nonprofit, we offer its congratulations: at last, here's the right book for you."},{"Title":"The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit","review":"In today's tough economic times, just about every non-profit needs help raising money.

Lots of examples, worksheets, and - my favorite - practical tips and samples of results-producing membership letters. You can literally give this book to the person in charge of membership and they will know exactly what to do. Just about every non-profit has lots of room for improvment in the membership area.

Her books are mostly in English (in collarboratin with her husband, himself also a renowned thinker, Chris Baker). Now they take on a subject of Thaksin Shinawatra, arguably the most famous prime minister cum businessman in Thailand.Most of Thaksin's biographies in Thai are, I dare say, bias. They always portray him as a white knight, a self-made billionaire, and a man with a perfect happy family, intentionally overlooking his early failure as businessman and his well-connected background. While this book has admitted that it has not been written with 100% objectivity, it turns out to be the most objective book about the subject. It sheds the up and down of his business and political life, as well as the good and bad of his policy.One of the most revealing aspect in this book is the discussion of \\"Thaksinomics\\" and \\"dual track\\" policies, both of which make him a rising star in internatioal politics. Anyone who is interested in such subject should not miss this book at all.However, there are flaws in this book. Foremost is that most of the inputs come from newspaper, and writers add few inputs from their thoughts. Secondly, this book wrote about in 2004, and it would miss the most landslide victory in Thai history by his party. Also, it did miss his fall because of waves of corruption scandal.I hope that they would write a revised version, once everything is settled."},{"Title":"Thaksin: The Business Of Politics In Thailand","review":"Pasuk and Baker, the famous husband and wife team, have produced a very useful book about former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin.

Not that I haven't felt a personal emotion on subjects I feel strongly about ( while others may wish to ignore ) but I try to base them on what is in front of me. One review praises the Greek, lets just say way of thought, as the higher level ( please, history is there for all to see, right and wrong ) and then ends with a few words on faith. What is faith friend? It's not just what's convenient for you. Another just makes his a personal attack on someone's faith rather then what is presented and already known to many ( again, history is edvidence if you know where, and are not afraid to look ) whether of the same faith or not. Religion of course is not for everyone, but it seems truth isn't as well. This book is well researched, and not for the unaware or unperceptive mind. Especially for those who feel they would lose something ( or things ) rather then gain or add on to. I've known people from many religions, and they all say they're the one, and they have something the other hasn't. One fact for sure is that the truth is out there, and yes surrounded by untruth, but if your searching for answers that will help you find even more, then this is a eye opener. Truth always leads to the truth. But first open up your mind and your heart. Too many people think with something else. That's what controls them."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"This book was recommended by a friend. It was interesting, but not to my liking. I would say it is one person's opinion ( as is all history ).I would not recommend it to any of my friends, simply because I did not feel it was a compelling case."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"The author has written this book to explain that what we think of as orthodox Christianity changed and evolved after the time of the apostles (roughly 100 AD) to reach its present state by approximately 300-350 AD. He notes the literal/symbolic approach to religion taken by Old Testament writers and the metaphysical approach taken when explaining the New Testment writings.He ascribes the change to the increasing influence over the years of Greek philosophy in the church. He explains the development of Greek philosophy and argues that the philosophic defense of Christianity was taken by many of the Apologists and Church Fathers to reduce the persecution of the church by the Roman empire. He explains in detail the reasons why the Roman emperors had trouble with the new religion, Christianity, which did not fit well with either the old pagan system, nor Plato's Monist view that the world we see is illusory, and not real in the same sense God is real, nor yet Aristotle's dualistic system. The net effect of the changes wrought by the well-intentioned Apologists was to lead the interpretation of the scriptures away from a literal/symbolic interpretation of the scriptures to a metaphysical interpretation never intended by the Hebrew writers of the Old and New Testaments. He attempts to show the meaning the Hebrew writers would have given to passages commonly interpreted in a metaphysical way.The author includes many citations to early and later Apologists, or defenders of the faith, which tends to make the book rather like a college textbook. The author has incorporated a second theme: using the foregoing discussion as a defense of the LDS faith (Mormon), contending that the LDS faith has followed the original intent of the original writers, unlike modern Christianity.While some readers may not agree with the later chapters regarding the LDS church, the earlier chapters are well worth the effort, providing extensive background in the early Christian church and Greek philosophic history."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"This is an excellent summary of exactly what the title suggests. Richard Hopkins exposes with detailed documentation how \\"orthodox\\" Christian thinking of God today actually is extremely Hellenistic and came into existence much after the time of Christ. He skillfully uses quotes and ideas from Greek and modern philosophers, the early Christian Apologists, and scripture to effectively convey his ideas. Though Biblical and Hebrew thinking of God are actually simplistic, he shows that it was made to be metaphysical, or incomprehensible to satisfy the non-Hebrew mind. While the early Christian apologists are to be commended for helping to keep Christianity alive, these well-meaning philosophers made some grave errors in the attempt to make Hebrew Christianity acceptable to the Greek as the mantle passed to them. Some difficult ideas that have plagued mankind for millennia, such as the problem of evil, are solved as well. This book convincingly shows that many essential Biblical truths about the nature of God, as believed by \\"orthodox\\" Christianity today, are not at all what the earliest Christians believed. The fact that many read the Bible with \\"a priori\\" or pre-conceived ideas is thoroughly exposed, as the genesis of these ideas come to light. This is a must-read for any truth-seeking Christian that could never make sense of the doctrine of the Trinity."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"While I would not expect this book to convince traditional Christians of the truthfulness of Mormonism, I am at least forced to concede that many of the arguments used to try to exclude Mormonism from Christianity (namely their different understanding of the nature of God and the Trinity) are clearly non-Biblical, based more on the philosophies of the Hellenized world than on the revelations to the prophets or even on the teachings of Christ Himself. I would not recommend this book to those who fear experiencing some cognitive dissonance, as Hokins skillfully shows that many of the beliefs we Christians take for granted may very well be metaphysical rather than biblical. The 3rd and 4th sections of this book are less convincing, but the did help me to better understand the beliefs of my Mormon friends - not at all the naive belief system Evangelical Christians (or even smug secularists) would have us believe it to be."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"I was pleased to find this book offered on Amazon. It is the best resource I have ever encountered which provides an overview of the influences during the 1st through 4th centuries A.D which changed the principles of theology from those understood by the apostles of Christ to those incorporated into the various creeds adopted after 325 AD."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"I would like to see a revised edition with a better subject index and a glossary of Bible, theology, and philosophy words used in this book. It is NOT an easy read for those with a light background in these subject areas. I think a more succinct version for those who don't care to indulge in 450 pages of \\"heavy\\" theological and Greek metaphysical history would also be appreciated by a wider audience. This is all that keeps it from being a five-star book. For those with the background and the dedicated interest, it is a very wonderful book.The author clearly demonstrates why the so-called \\"orthodox\\" churches of today,who think they believe in the Bible, and only the Bible, do not. Within less than two hundred years after the death of Christ the apostasy began. The teachings of Christ became an admixture of Judaism, Greek and Oriental philosophy, and other philosophical beliefs that eventually became evident in the fourth century with the Arian controversy and the doctrine of the Trinity.As the author, Richard Hopkins, says, \\"To understand the Bible it is necessary to think like an ancient Hebrew, not like an ancient Greek\\",......the natural tendency of the Greeks was to view the figurative language of the Jews in a metaphysical light. \\"It is the transition from a figurative interpretation of literal facts to a metaphysical interpretation of those facts that most clearly marks the theological apostasy...\\"Taking the doctrine of the Trinity as an example, in the Bible Jesus says, \\"...the Father and I are one.\\" This was the Jews figurative language. They meant they are one in purpose, etc. But, for the Greeks, who interpreted everything metaphysically, what Jesus said took on a whole other meaning. The Greeks interpreted all passages in the Bible allegorically to suit their pet theories, and they had a bunch. \\"....reserving the purity of Gospel truths from the metaphysical assumptions of Hellenistic thought was essentially impossible.\\" The Jews could not have thought up the Trinity \\"....because that notion is metaphysical and the Jews had no concept of metaphysics.\\"Contrary to Elaine Pagels, and others, the Gnostic \\"gospels\\" are not new, not lost, not Chrisitian, and not deserving of being canonized. Most Gnostic teaching were heretical, and some were downright foolish. This book explains that thoroughly.As I said, it is a wonderful read, but have your collegiate, philosophy, and Bible and theology dictionaries handy if you do not have a good biblical and philosophy background. Although everything is explained--sooner or later--the dictionaries will speed up your reading.It should have been five stars. The content was, but the rest wasn't. Do read this book, especially if you wonder where so much of today's \\"orthodox\\" teachings come from."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"Goodness, but this is an awful book. It claims to show how Christianity was corrupted by the contaminating influence of Greek Philosophy. This could be an interesting topic, but Hopkins' book misses the mark widely. The reasons are really endless, but let's see if I can point to the worst ones...1. The author's understanding of Greek Philosophy is ankle-deep...mostly drawn from the Encyclopedia Britannica (I mean, c'mon, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is available online).2. The author's understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity is either deliberately confused or simply careless. It's admittedly a complex doctrine, but it's the centerpiece of the book. The first step to critiquing an idea is to understand it.3. The author's biblical exegesis is absurd. He argues, among other things, that the Bible doesn't teach that God created the universe and that the Bible doesn't support monotheism. Evidently he doesn't know the Shema from a frosted Pop-Tart. Oh, and \\"Angels are always in human form when they appear to men...\\" in the Bible (p. 376). Really? Ever read Ezekiel?4. Hopkins distorts history and the Bible to argue that the early Christians accepted current LDS (Mormon) theology. The simple fact is that not eventhe Book of Mormon teaches current LDS theology (in fact, the book is explicitly Trinitarian...see 2 Nephi 31:21). The LDS church has changed its views many times over its history. The respect that Hopkins tries to accord the Bible doesn't match a century and a half of LDS teaching, which has always held that the Bible was mutilated by corrupt \\"Christians\\" after the first century as a part of the Great Apostasy.5. Stunningly, the author claims that the LDS Church has solved the Problem of Evil by introducing (or, in his mind, recovering) the belief in the preexistence of souls. If you are born into horrible circumstances, that is because of what you did in the pre-existence. Simple reflection shows that this creates more problems than it solves. Historically, LDS leadership taught that blacks could not hold the priesthood because they were not sufficiently valiant in their pre-mortal existences. This is an embarrassing teaching that can be traced from Brigham Young to LDS authorities in the 1960's (see Mormon Doctrine by McConkie). Hopkins rejects this teaching (p. 62) without allowing that the LDS Church ever taught it. (Current LDS teaching is agnostic concerning its own policy. Nice.)The relationship between Christianity in its first centuries and Greek Philosophy has been addressed by serious scholarly works, and Christians today may well wonder why the Church expresses theology in the alien language of Greek Philosophy (substance and persons and so forth). Hopkins offers no useful insight into these serious questions."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"A very exhaustive documentation of the writings of the early church fathers. A brief but illuminating glimpse into some of the veiws held by the earliest Christians. Provides sound explanations for most of the doctrinal deviations from the Bible committed by well meaning church fathers. In the second half of the book, Hopkins refutes classical theist greek philosophy by indicating that most of it has no biblical basis. He also points out many philosophical and scientific problems with the classical Christian greek philosophy. Hopkins admits early in the book that the survival of Christianity to this day is largly due to these apostalic fathers."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"This is one of the most baldly biased and poorly written books I have ever read. From page 1: \\"Neither Protestants nor Catholics actually base their beliefs on the Bible. Though this may surprise some Christians, to believe otherwise is more than naive--it is a failure to apprehend the very essence of what is known as \\"Christian orthodoxy.\\" Whether one believes this to be the case or not, it is not pleasant to be hit over the head with opinion statements as clumsily and frequently as Hopkins unabashedly offers them. He doesn't make arguments so much as repeatedly state his opinions using different words.I found myself wondering, throughout the course of the book, whether Horizon Publishers requires that their works be edited. Hopkins capitalizes all manner of improper nouns (one gets the sense that he was German in a past life), drowns his sentences in prepositions, and seems averse to using periods more than a couple of times per page.This book could be about 1/8 as long as it is and contain all of the same information. If you're looking for a good argument supporting the corruption of early Christianity, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"Refuting this book is not worth my time; however I would like to warn others - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY: This book is Mormon Propaganda."},{"Title":"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God","review":"\\"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted The Christian Concept of God\\" is nothing more than the regurgitation of Mormon doctrinal beliefs under the guise of historical investigation, much in the same sense that The 7-Habits of Highly Effective People (written by Mormon, Stephen Covey) was nothing more than Mormon doctrine written under the guise of how to develop effective leadership. Hopkins is a former trial attorney, missionary for the Latter-day Saint (LDS) Church, and has held many prominent offices in the Mormon Church. What starts out as a book intended to show the effects of Hellenism upon traditional Christian theology, turns into a pitch for Mormonism as being the answer to undo what Hellenism supposedly did.This book is not well-written, theologically speaking, as it merely repeats many of the same arguments that LDS leadership have been asserting the past 150+ years to try and convince those willing to listen, that there just might be something in Mormonism that might be true. A \\"classic\\" example of this is found on pages 357-8 of Hopkins' book, where he attempts to convince the reader that there might have been a time when God was not. Hopkins writes,Classical theists have had great difficulty explaining the incarnation of Christ and the passage in Philippians noted above [2:5-7]. But that is only the icy tip of their dilemma. The Bible does not support the notion that Christ has always been a member of the Godhead. That notion is as unbiblical as the Greek notions mentioned above. It is contradicted in both the Old and New Testaments. While many passages teach that God \\"has always existed...throughout all eternity,\\" no passage teaches what Dr. [Francis] Beckwith claims-that God (and specifically God the Son), \\"has always existed as God throughout all eternity.\\" What then does the Bible say about the length of time during which God the Son has been \\"God,\\" i.e. a member of the Godhead?\\"It is comments like the above which permeate Hopkins' attempt at supposedly providing an objective look at the historical development of Christian doctrine. Unfortunately, his Mormon view is so tainted with the very Hellenism he hopes to expose, that he fails, miserably, in providing either an historically accurate, or theologically sound, representation of just what Christians believe. After all, Hopkins is hoping, himself, to become a god one day, which is perhaps the epitome of Hellenistic thought; man becoming a god.If one truly desired to get a taste of the effects of Greek thought upon Christian doctrine, he would do himself a favor by looking into either Ron Nash's \\"Christianity & the Hellenistic World,\\" or Everett Ferguson's \\"Background of Early Christianity.\\" Both supply ample evidence and documentation that just because Christianity grew up amid Hellenistic thought and culture does not necessarily mean that it merely mimicked its environment. Dr. Edwin Yamauchi, History Professor at Miami (Ohio) University writes of Nash's book, \\"Professor Nash has written a lucid and superb book, which will prove especially useful to students in colleges and universities who still hear some ill-founded comparisons between the pagan mystery religions and Christianity from their professors.\\" The Biblical Archeologist writes of Ferguson's book, \\"An impressive achievement in both scope and execution....Its strengths are its comprehensiveness and its very valuable bibliographical resources.\\"In conclusion, it is no overstatement to assert that Richard Hopkins' book is a book about the propagation of Mormonism. Although it contains allusions and statements from Christian leaders down through the centuries, those same allusions and statements are given in a context designed to get the reader to consider Mormonism as true; that it is the restoration of what Hellenism supposedly took away. Fortunately, though, Mormonism is not true, and neither is the premise of Hopkins' book, that Hellenism essentially corrupted everything that Christianity represents."},{"Title":"In Our Own Image: Treasured African-American Traditions, Journeys & Icons","review":"This is an inspiring and beautiful collection of stunning photographs of the celebration of African American families, communities and their dignity and determination to prevail over historic changes.

During the depression years they made candy and sold it at dept. stores. and survived without any kind of welfare. Never had a phone in their house. \\"if people wanted to talk with us they could come see us\\" was their motto..The time they moved the refrigerator downstairs from an upper floor because the man they had hired kept putting them off day after day....and they were near 100 yrs old! Forget the exact age but they never let anything stop them if they needed to do it.They did their yoga exercises and shows pictures of them. Also some simple recipes they used over the years.

Simple yet poignant; these words of wisdom cover various aspects of life such as love, loss, aging, and dying - from the perspective of two people who've experienced and witnessed much of each. It was good to hear that yoga was central to the sisters' longevity; as a recent yoga practitioner it's encouraging to know that all that twisting, breathing, and balancing pays off! As if superb advice weren't enough, the sisters share a few recipes that also contributed to their overall wellbeing.

I had dropped out of college at 20, and lived to regret that decision. By the time I was 30, I was broke, exhausted from the demands of working two jobs and sttending classes full time and really wondering where all the time had gone. One day during a break between classes I went to the free rack at the campus library and saw the Delany sisters' book \\"Having Our Say\\". The book had originally been released during my first stint in college when I was about 19. I remembered seeing it in all the bookstores but I couldn't imagine at the time what a couple of 100+ year olds would have to say to me in all my youth and splendor. I never bought the book, but 11 years later I pulled it off the free shelf and ended up reading it in one sitting.Eventually, I also got this book (this time I paid for it). The Delany Sisters' outlook on life is amazing. I have read and re-read both this book and \\"Having Our Say\\" many times over. This book talks about everything from the appropriate way a woman should dress, the difference between self indulgence and self-respect, and how to take care of yourself mentally, physically, economically and spiritually.I wish I had gotten a dose of this as a younger woman...it would have saved me some hard times. I am now 36, and I think the Delaney sisters would agree that no age is too late to adopt some of the philosophy expressed in this book."},{"Title":"Slim Naturally: Advanced Weight Loss System","review":"This CD really worked for me.

The most interesting development involves Mrs. Hunter and her insatiable desire to be accepted into upper crust Philadelphia society. She befriends the young and nave Kitty Morrow as a possible wedge in, and is willing to do just about anything it takes to make the grade - even becoming interested in antiquarian concerns, though she despises them, to impress the blue-blooded Mr. Fairthorne (she even goes so far as to try to poison him, but she fails at this). She is really a horribly ingratiating woman, who is finally put in her place by the wise Dr. Archer. At the end, after being shunned by the society she so craved to become a part of, she leaves for Europe. This represents only part of the novel; there are many other characters and incidents as well, including the alcoholic Roger Grace, the lonely Luke Pilgrim (Mrs. Hunter's ex-husband), the sexually repressed Father Knellwood, and the ambitious medical student Roger Blount. But their stories are not as interesting as Mrs. Hunter's and add little to the novel's worth. The main problem is that the book just goes on too long and lacks focus.

The chapter about what to do when things go wrong is one of the most concise and informative advocacy guides I have ever read.I wish that all travel agents and professionals would read this book too. It's a must for people who travel, but the professionals who plan our vacations also need to know this information!"},{"Title":"Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for Wheelers and Slow Walkers, Second Edition","review":"My wife had a stroke four years ago and now has to use a wheelchair. We both wanted to travel bur I didn't know the first place to look to find out the things we needed to know. The physical therapist said lots of people who have had strokes travel, so we wanted to give it a try. But it was hard to find information. That's where this book helped. It contains a lot of information you need. It should be titled \\"owners manual\\" as nobody tells you this stuff when you end up in a wheelchair.The cruise chapter was very helpful to me. I just figured I could call up a travel agent and book a cruise with a handicapped cabin. I'm glad I read the book before I made that mistake. There is also a very helpful chapter about choosing a travel agent and how to travel on an airplane with a wheelchair.We just got back from our first cruise and it was great. I wouldn't have been able to do it without this book. If you are even only thinking about travel, I urge you to read this book. We are already planning our next trip."},{"Title":"Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for Wheelers and Slow Walkers, Second Edition","review":"I highly recommend this book to anybody considering traveling with a wheelchair. I bought this book before my vacation back east and it helped me understand my rights as a consumer. It also gave me helpful tips on how to get the services I need.For example, did you know that hotels that provide free airpot shuttle service (in the US) also have to provide an accessible option, at no charge to the customer? Well, I didn't -- until I read this book.A hotel in Boston tried to charge me for this service, but because I read this book, I knew the law and was able to deal with the situation. The result was that I saved (money), and the hotel had to provide me with free accessible airport shuttle service.That's just one of the helpful tips that I found in Barrier-Free Travel.This book also contains useful information about how to find and book an accessible room, how to work with (and find) a travel agent, cruises, ground transportation, overseas travel, advocacy, disability law and rights, air travel, protecting your wheelchair when you travel, and resources around the world.It's a book that I will keep and continue to refer to, as I continue to travel. It makes a great resource book -- I wish more CIL's would add this to their resource library."},{"Title":"Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for Wheelers and Slow Walkers, Second Edition","review":"I got this book as a primer on traveling with a disability. I have Multiple Sclerosis and am both a \\"Wheeler\\" and a \\"Slow Walker\\" depending on the day. I found the information in Candy Harrington's book quite helpful as a place to start learning about accessible travel, but was sad to learn that many of her references are now outdated.Fortunately, there is a new edition of this book, published earlier in the year. I haven't purchased it yet, but intend to. With current information, if the new edition is as comprehensive as this one, it would warrant 5 stars. This is a book for anyone, young or old, who happens to live with a disability -- even a temporary one -- but doesn't intend to be defined by it.

I have to say that I feel I got my moneys worth. The second edition not only contains updated information and resources, but it also contains a lot of new stuff too.The cruise chapter is really enlarged and there seems to be new information in the other chapters too. There is also a new chapter about traveling with children, and it seems good, but it really didn&#8217;t apply to me.I would definitely recommend the second edition of the book...even if you bought the first one.

I look forward to the next edition!"},{"Title":"Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for Wheelers and Slow Walkers, Second Edition","review":"I think it's a fairly good book, but has more focus to those limited to those in wheelchair and less for slow walkers. A couple of tips for slow walkers the author didn't mention was that several hot destination areas rent or loan for free wheelchairs or scooters. Such as all DC museums which loans out wheelchairs free of charge. (A piece of information I learned by chance.) Any travel desinations or activities for slow walkers? I'm still trying to figure that out as I try to plan vacations for my father who's a slow walker and rather a large person, too. Did you know that most Las Vegas hotels rent scooters to those slow walkers - and they let you store them in your room and take them out in the town. Though, the title does suggest that it's a guide for wheelers and slow walkers, it's probably more suited for \\"...A Nuts and Bolt Guide for Wheelers\\" and leave out the slow walkers as it doesn't offer too much on this subject."},{"Title":"Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for Wheelers and Slow Walkers, Second Edition","review":"I could, have, and you can get the same information from chat rooms or message boards.

That makes this a resource book that draws the reader through the entire contents rather than one you just want to view for relevant sections pertaining to an upcoming trip. Her style even makes reading about the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) palpable so that readers will have the best possible flying experience due to what they learn. Chapters are further broken down by small sections which makes it an easy read for a resource book and also easy to return to when looking up some particular subject.The author has dug deep to obtain the volume of details you'll find rather than the simple generalities that do little good. Seasoned travelers who have disabilities will appreciate the work she has done which will further benefit them. And there are added benefits for those who are later disabled and just starting to travel. They will gain confidence in realizing how available travel still is to them while also appreciating the details which must be handled rather than making the mistakes of assuming that access is always in place and that everyone's needs are the same.As a travel consultant specializing in accessible vacations, I find that this book aligns with my feeling that knowledge is power and that the more travelers understand their rights and what's available, the more they are empowered to be a partner in ensuring a wonderful trip. This third edition gives updated information, regulations and resources making it invaluable to travelers. Don't plan on sharing your copy as you'll probably be using a highlighter on it for future reference! For travel agents wanting to learn more about accessible travel, I would suggest this as a reliable and necessary resource to keep within reach."},{"Title":"Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for Wheelers and Slow Walkers, Second Edition","review":"this book delivers what its title advertises. don't leave home without using this book to plan any of your trips."},{"Title":"Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for Wheelers and Slow Walkers, Second Edition","review":"This is a compilation of overcoming challenges for wheelers and slow walkers (as she describes us!).

I was really looking for more information on how each country outside the USA addresses ADA-like issues. What's it like to use a wheelchair in, say, Madrid or Rio?

I was happy to see characters I'd just met again.Different stories run side by side in time and are connected, if only by a thread. It's a complex book.With distressing verisimilitude, the anguish, pain, ugliness, and gore are written onto the pages. The author describes horrors that depict the events of the time; these horrors are so unlike my shining, sparkling image of an army walking home with freedom held high, a vision I developed in an apparent haze of patriotism, that I find myself a bit disappointed in history.The novel has succussfully conveyed that the world was as dirty and complex then as it is now. Nothing is simple. Seeing Washington behave as a politician rather than a hero takes some of the shine away from his sterling image.I can blame my shift in perception on character development. Having read his previous book, I know the author can create characters who have enough depth to make me actively hate them and love them, all at once. This book's characters, happily, do not escape that talent. The players were intriguing enough to make me want to know them better, to spend time with all of them so I could watch as they tell each other what fools they each are or clap each other on the back with congratulations.They may also want to congratulate their author for making them real enough to convey the interconnectedness of events, people, and the larger implications of both."},{"Title":"Between Two Fires (The John Paul Jones Novels)","review":"The worst thing about reading great trilogies is the wait. I re-read the first book, &quot;The Eighteenth Captain&quot;, just prior to the release of &quot;Between Two Fires&quot;; as I often do with a much anticipated release. If you haven't read the first book...do yourself a favor and grab a copy.&quot;Between Two Fires&quot; provided some of the best historical fiction writing I've had the pleasure to page-turn. You don't need to be a history, war or nautical buff to truly enjoy the well-developed, fascinating characters in Nicastro's follow-up book. He has a way of writing dialogue that makes you feel a part of the conversation...as if you might be standing next to the characters.

I'm waiting to devour your next book, Mr. Nicastro."},{"Title":"Between Two Fires (The John Paul Jones Novels)","review":"Between Two Fires is the second book in a trilogy that follows the career of John Paul Jones. I haven't read the first book, The Eighteenth Captain, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this one. The story caught me from the beginning and held me throughout. It may have been otherwise - despite the writing talent of the author - if it had only been about Jones, who isn't all that interesting or admirable. There are actually three parallel stories in this book, loosely interconnected. Jones is in Paris and then at sea, off the coast of England, where we get an exciting description of his famous capture of the Serapis in Bon Homme Richard and learn of the faithlessness of his French allies. The second story, and a more compelling one, concerns Joseph Two Fires, a Cayuga Indian, who ends up on Jones' crew. The third story takes the form of letters from Captain John Severence to his apparent girlfriend Rebeccah Shays as he marches with a colonial army on a campaign against the Iroquois or Six Nations. Whereas Jones is all ambition, Two Fires is a portrait in honor, and Severance a study in conscience. Anyone who enjoys American history, sea stories, or war stories will find this book believable and to their liking."},{"Title":"Between Two Fires (The John Paul Jones Novels)","review":"The second novel of the John Paul Jones Trilogy by Nicholas Nicastro, Between Two Fires continues the saga of America's first naval hero.

Also very highly recommended is the first novel of this outstanding trilogy, The Eighteenth Captain..."},{"Title":"Between Two Fires (The John Paul Jones Novels)","review":"There are no easy blacks and whites in Nicholas Nicastro's wonderfully written tales of the American Revolution. Forget about the flag-waving pabulum that your ninth grade textbook passed off as American History. Nicastro portrays John Paul Jones as a Napoleonic .... who alternates his barks with his bites as the never-say-die commander of the Bonhomme Richard. The monomaniac runs many of his men and his ship into extinction while defeating the British Serapis.The even more engrossing parallel tale in \\"Between Two Fires\\" revolves around conscience-stricken Captain Severance, who watches his Colonial comrades barbarically commit genocide against the Iroquois Nation. Nicastro takes Lechterian delight in describing the atrocities perpetrated under General Sullivan's command--officers parade around in flesh cut from the hides of Native Americans while burning and desecrating village after village. Yes the Indians do commit their share of torture, but theirs, as described by Nicastro, is a far more noble form of sadism.Should David Lynch ever decide to direct an 18th Century war picture, this book is filled with a wonderful cache of quirky historical curiosities. A female character aboard Jones's ship dedicates her life to capturing the ideal physical traits of people she meets in her sketchbook. Her goal is to create a composite which would match the image of Jesus Christ. I won't betray the macabre manner in which she locates the preeminent nose. Joseph, the noble Native American hero aboard the Richard, has his teeth knocked out halfway through the saga and speaks the remainder in a humorous lisp. George Washington is a self-conscious poser, pretending to act as a great commander should act-- the Ronald Reagan of his day.The book does have a few narrative flaws. Would an eighteenth century officer really write letters describing all the grotesqueries of war, not missing a morbid detail, to his bride-to-be? Would he also write extensively about his obvious attraction for a headstrong Native American woman?But minor exceptions aside, this is a novel not to be ignored--certainly for fans of seafaring novels but more broadly for anyone hungering for sharply written historical ficition, fiction with a harsher, less propagandistic view of the era."},{"Title":"Soup","review":"The book of the chain is attractively illustrated, amusingly written and most importantly, if you follow the recipes you do end up with delicious soup.

These wheels are for doing work like moving a wagon load of whatever you need to move.The book is well thought out and put together. When you open this book it will lay flat. They have even included blank facing pages so you can write notes as you go along. Follow the step by step instructions, use the jigs and table, and you can build any size wheels you want.The table on page 6 is very handy. It will tell you exactly what you need for any size wheel from 30 inches to 57 inches. Once you understand how the table is laid out, you will be able to know what you need for any size wheel that your heart desires.I recommend this book for anyone that wants a serious wagon wheel. However, the wheels will only be as good as your wood working skills. This project is for the experienced wood worker. You don't have to be a pro, but experience with tools and jigs is a big help. Take your time and you will have a project to be proud of.Ron Ainsworth rona@cybrtyme.com"},{"Title":"Working Wagon Wheels (Old West Collection of WoodWorking Pattern Books)","review":"The author spent a lot of time in designing this wood wagon wheel that almost resembles an old farm wagon wheel.

The writing gets a bit litigous at times, but anyone with the equivalent of a high school diploma can follow the cases.This book is important in that it shows us how thankful we should be to those in the past who sacrificed themselves in courts of law so that future generations could enjoy freedoms of expression in a free democratic society. While reading the case of libel against Thomas Cooper I was made aware of the Amercian Sedition Act of 1798 and the alien laws of that period.Mr. Cooper, newspaper editor, politician and scientist, took a stand against charges of libel for printing articles thought damaging to then president of the United States, John Adams. Mr. Cooper's decision to fight the charges of libel was not because he wasn't guilty under the law, but that he felt any law making it criminal to question the capacity of a President to carry out his functions as commander in chief, was a tyrannical law in a democracy.Did you know that in 1800 you could be fined and jailed for saying or printing anything that put the President of the U.S. in a bad light? Mr. Cooper knew this and yet and still he challenged the law that forbid his right to say and print what he felt was the public's right to know.This book reminds me of a famous quote I once heard somewhere: \\"I may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\\"Know Your First Amendment Rights and Those Who Defended it.First Collier Books Edition 1962 (paperback)"},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"Connie Fletcher picked the right approach in tackling this subject; like Nicholas Pileggi's Wise Guy: Life in a Mafia Family, What Cops Know is told almost entirely in the subjects' own words, giving it an immediacy and buoyancy that can be mesmerizing. As one police officer stated, they have to develop a sense of humour about what they do. So their toughness, their panache for strange parlance and anecdotes, and their occasional bursts of machismo are delivered first-generation, Fletcher having the good sense to hold back on her editorial comments (something a writer like Colin Wilson overindulges in, making his books extremely moralistic) and just let her subjects tell their stories.The book started off slowly (the foreword explaining the approach, though useful, was cut-and-dry stuff, though certainly useful), but after getting through the first section, I plowed through 200 pages in one sitting. Some of the stories are plain hilarious; some disturbing and sombre; some made me downright sick to my stomach. The child-molestation section was harrowing; I'm usually very objective in my approach to reading, but the story of the mother &quot;selling&quot; her six-year-old child to strangers gut-punched me.Reading through this book, you begin to understand that the police have one of the most strenuous, underappreciated, and potentially corrupting jobs in Western society."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"I read this book before I became a Chicago cop. I felt like an outsider looking in and was curious as to how true the book was. I can tell you that this author knows what she is talking about. Working the streets of the southside, seeing murder, child abuse, prostitution, drugs, addicts etc... I can say without a doubt there is truth to the words in this book. There is truth to the after-effects cops can have from becoming part of this world, the drinking, the crying, the sleepless nights and the eventual hardening of the heart and beoming apathetic. This is a must read for anyone getting on the job. Read it and make sure you know what you are getting into. This is the best job in the world, but being prepared on how to deal with the pitfalls of it is essential."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"This compilation of interviews in the words of genuine Chicago cops was put together by the sister of one, which gave her an entree into the \\"closed society\\" of law enforcement. Most of the officers she spoke with \\"work or have worked\\" in the city's Area Six, which encompasses everything from the notorious Cabrini-Green housing projects to the glittering upscale Gold Coast along the lakeshore. Yet crime is a constant, as it has been ever since human beings began to develop a society more complex than that of the cave-based clan. These officers have seen it all, and their cynicism is evident, yet the knowledge they've gained is broad and fascinating. Have you ever wondered how the Mafia (called in Chicago \\"the Outfit\\") is organized? Whether there are still any old-fashioned professional burglars? How a sex criminal or a serial killer thinks? These cops know, and they tell all. They are, of course, cynics, and the closing prediction of one Mob \\"expert\\" on where organized crime is probably heading seems to have been proved wrong; but altogether the book is an invaluable resource for mystery writers, social scientists, and police groupies. (Also read the author's \\"Pure Cop.\\")"},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"This book is the result of 125 Chicago policemen sitting down with Prof. Connie Fletcher of Loyola University at Chicago. In order to give them the freedom to speak without fear of being transferred for political reasons, the names of the policemen interviewed are at the end of chapter, without identifying which policeman was responsible for each excerpt. This is NOT a book for the faint-hearted. It should transform the most hopeless pacifist into a gun owner, if there is any possibility at all. The chapter on home invasions, in particular, is terrifying in its descriptions of the sorts of sadistic brutality done to people inside their homes.This is a book worth reading more for what it says about how Chicago police officers see the world, then for any sort of statistical evidence about crime. At times, in our anger at police as soldiers of an oppressive system, we tend to forget that the police get a very jaundiced view of humanity, because what they spend most of their time doing is cleaning up the pathological part of our society. This is a book for reminding us HOW they see the world, and hopefully, it can make us a little more understanding as to why certain attitudes are so common among big city police officers.The least gruesome chapter was the one on organized crime, and contains some very worrisome statements that makes me suspect that there is more than a totalitarian political ideology or simple-minded idealism pushing gun control:&quot;With an Outfit murder, the car can be seen; it doesn't make any difference. If they felt like it, they could throw the firearm down next to the body and walk away. They have a source for weapons, an illegal source that provides them with weapons that can't be traced.&quot;[p. 316]&quot;The Chicago Outfit controls the unions. Because of that, they're into everything. Chicago controls a big chunk of Hollywood. They don't control the corporations, they don't control the directors and the producers per se, they don't control the actors and actresses. But all the support -- all the catering, the lighting, fixtures -- the outfit that supplies stuff for the movies is not going to be an accidental supply house. The lighting and fixtures -- and everything that moves and walks and talks to cause that movie to be produced -- is probably going to be owned outright or by a fictiously formed blind trust by members of the Outfit.&quot;[p. 310]Especially in light of the successful prosecutions of judges in Chicago several years ago, the following passage seems to be quite plausible:&quot;Everybody can understand and get along quite well, it seems, knowing that our circuit court judges on the state and local levels can be bought. It doesn't seem to excite anybody. People in law enforcement could give you a list -- if you went and just talked to all the people, especially the people that deal with these guys, like the people in the Detective Division -- you could amass yourself a long list of the attorneys that pay off judges and long list of the dirty judges too....&quot;However, that's just peanuts, and people don't seem to be too excited about it. If they were, they'd demand that something be done about it, and they don't. But if you expand that, then, and show that our government is loaded with senators and congressmen and U.S. judges that are just as nefarious, just as crooked -- especially congressmen that owe their allegiances to neighborhoods in big cities -- you know, that would do some serious damage to the national psyche, I think. If we get away from the Chicago-New York-Philadelphia mentality, put yourself in Iowa or Nebraska, it would, I think, bother people of goodwill if the seriousness of it were known.&quot;[pp. 327-328]"},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"What Cops Know is a book with hundreds of true short stories straight from the mouths of real life cops. To the streets to undercover sting operations, these cops dish out the dirt about criminals. One reason I liked this book is that it told tales of murder, conspiracies, and drug rings, leaving out no information. Through this book I discovered how criminals, and drug lords work, and why they do the things they do. The reason I chose to read this book is so I could have some more light shed on the job of a cop. The only thing I knew about cops is from movies, and T.V. With this book I heard it straight from the source. These officers' stories put me right in the squad car with them during their high-speed chases and undercover jobs. These stories showed the grim reality of this world, and cruel nature that is people. I now know how these criminals, rapists, and thieves operate. Cops tell stories of interrogation of eyewitnesses and prime suspects. Another aspect of this book that most would like to read is the stories about crooked cops. Crooked cops are what should be feared, they have the power of the law on their side and they have the choice to abuse it if they want.

This book should be required reading in ALL police academies including LAPD."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"\\"What Cops Know\\" is a wonderful book. I really got a kick out of it. The narratives are engaging and the police involve seem to be telling the truth about their escapades (I was convinced.) The sections on child abuse and serial rape/murders were particularly interesting."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"I really think this book hits the reality of police work. I recommend this book for any cop or anyone interested in this line of work. If you work in a small town or a large city like Chicago, get this book. Great real life stories that you can relate with."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"This is such a memorable book I can still quote it years after reading it. For example, a cop puts someone in a holding cell. He comes back later and can tell instantly if the person is guilty or not. How does he know? Read the book! Or how does a cop look at the home of an 80-year-old man and know he's a child molester? Then there's the story of the mobster who actually says, \\"It's so hard to find good help.\\" One cop tells what child molesters say when they're captured, how they sickly view the relationship with the child. There's the capture of a child molester after a kid describes lots of yellow doors and seeing a plane through the ceiling -- this book just captures the attention with lots of quick, compelling stories. Very well done, worth reading!"},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"Not a bad look at what cops think, although it's pretty well along the T.V. Show Cops line. A great book about what cops think is &quot;BOOT: An LAPD Officers Rookie Year,&quot; by Dunn. That is the best book I have ever read about cops."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"In my opinion, this book is next to useless. The book is suppodded to tell \\"what's it really like to be a cop\\", but it doesn't deliver. There are lots of stories told by Chicago cops, but these stories are really just anecdotes; the shortest are just one or two sentences long. You just can't tell much in two sentences.Another problem is, the book is arranged in topics. In practice this means that a cop after cop is telling you that \\"you don't forget your first corpse\\", and this goes on page after page, until the author moves on to another topic. It would be much more interesting, if there were about two or thee dozen stories in the book, each 5-10 pages long that you could read like a short story. But the way this book is written, it simply is not interesting to read, and you don't get much from reading it."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"It's wonderful that this broad decided to work as a cop to lend her books authenticity, but I don't buy it."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"As a family member of many cops, these are the stories they don't tell you when they come home. Many very sad, some rather mundane, but amazing the stuff that these folks have to process on a daily basis.I found myself walking the streets looking at people in a whole different way."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"Writer Connie Fletcher takes you inside the sights, sounds and smells of things Chicago cops and detectives have to endure every day. After reading this book, I have appreciated what they do like never before.As one cop says, \\"There is no bottom. There is no low.\\" Just when you think you've read the most inhuman, disgusting thing possible, another anecdote tops it in its depravity. I doubt there is any use in comparing the worst things one can witness in war or as a cop. Both would test any human's faith and cause one to question the nature of man (and woman)kind.Fletcher divides her book into six sections: The Street, Violent Crimes, Sex Crimes, Narcotics, Property Crimes and Organized Crime. There are mind-blowing stories in each, told in short, vivid real cop language.It's compulsively readable and should shock the less stout of heart, not to mention cause you to never look at people the same again.There are plenty of books that take you into the mind of killers, but not enough like this, which take you into the mind of the criminal's arch-enemy: the cop. The book blows away the myths portrayed by Hollywood and TV as well as novels whose authors haven't taken the time to pick the brains of the police. For those who accuse the man of law of being too jaded, cynical and guilty of unseemly gallows humor, this book will show you why.You should be left wondering how someone could go through a career, see these sights and take them home with them every night and keep their sanity. Fortunately, there is just enough twisted levity to keep you from going into a deep funk.This is an incredible book, which shatters the myth of the malevolent, persecuting ticket-writing cop. It puts a human face on them. It's a must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"A bit outdated and centered in one area in the Midwest (Chicago), but honest and definitely interesting police experiences explained in a lot of detail, leaving nothing out. Still valid today."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"A lot - and a lot of it is unflattering to \`civilians'. Stories and experiences from those out on the beat, alone in the squad car or working to fight sex offenders, organized crime and property crime. Cops form a tight knit community for a reason, no one else can understand what they do and see and they need each other for support.This is a very good sneak peek into the cop's life. True stories told by those who lived them. Some are older, there is mention of a phone booth, whatever that is....but regardless of the seventies, eighties, crime is crime, crooks don't change and the war against crime doesn't stop. The cops also tell you about the criminals - not the sophisticated, white collar but the run of the mill gang banger, robber, rapists, murders - most of which are crimes of passion and against people they know.This is a quick, easy read in one respect - but it's also tough because you really see the rotten side of human nature. It can be depressing hearing story after story about the scum of the earth. There is some humor, gallows humor. Cops have to develop a thick skin, or the emotional toll will destroy them. If you love cop stories, crime stories or just want a glimpse under the rug, this is a good read."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"After reading these first-hand accounts of what life is like on cruel streets, you just have to take your hat off to these brave men and women in blue! It's a dirty and dangerous job, much less one that's fully understood or appreciated by the general public, but nonetheless a job that has to be done.Unless you have a fetish for the uniform and a batch, no one likes cops very much. You really have to pity and/or admire American cops after reading this book. They work in hostile and inhospitable environments that have broken down so much that law and order are not in order.If you're a cop, I have one question for you: why does America's USCIS (formerly called INS) chase away hard-working immigrants and instead welcome criminals the world over? And you wonder why your crime rates are skyrocketing? Do you see the big picture?American cops tell what life is like in tackling various crimes, from violent crimes and drug cases, to sex crimes and property crimes, etc.Exciting narratives provide snapshots of dozens of crimes in various categories. You will read of disturbing and distressing cases, and many others that are yet unsolved and unsolvable. It's an extremely sad reflection of a society that's broken down, where bad guys outnumber the good guys in a system that cannot and simply won't keep up with the good.I'd recommend this exciting book to anyone who wants an inside look on police street work. A must-read for the new recruit at the police academy.Care to sign up for a job that's recession-proof?Talk to your police recruitment office today!Be good and stay in the Light!"},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"A few years ago I saw a theater version of this book at the Live Bait Theater in Chicago. I didn't know about the book and thought that the playwright had such a wonderful, creative ear to make the police scene come alive. Connie Fletcher has the gift of capturing the words of actual cops in a way that creates a consisent story and strong drama."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"I read Mark Baker's \\"Cops\\" before I read Fletcher's book, which seemed, frankly, like an attempt to capitalize on Baker's idea. Nevertheless, it's a good book--primarily because the cops have good stories to tell. Baker's book covers more departments, while Fletcher's deals only with Chicago cops.To be fair, Fletcher's \\"Breaking and Entering\\" is a much more comprehensive and balanced book than this one. Still, it's a good read and if you're into law enforcement, it's a must-read."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"The stories in this book are the REAL DEAL! Cops speak about their lives and their work with clarity and sincerity. The author has achieved a work of art and shown us lay men what life is like behind the badge."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"Excellent book. Lets people who read it know what law enforcement officers see on a daily basis."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"Virtually all of the books that I read are books that are referred to me. The books, \\"What Cops Know\\" was referred to me as a marketing book to give insight into human nature. The problem with it of course is that much of the human nature that cops deal with tends to be very negative human nature so I am sure how much of it applies to marketing and behavior.Perhaps I don't watch enough TV; however, I found much of it to be very violent although morbidly interesting.What I did learn from the book is that most cops tend to become fairly jaded and synical because they deal with criminals most of the time. What I learned from this is that I should make sure that I spend time with positive people so that I can appropriately inspire."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"If you are looking for a terrific, can't-put-it-down summer read, I would highly recommend \\"What Cops Know.\\" I've read it several times and it never fails to fascinate. The author's in-depth interviews with Chicago police officers and detectives cover everything from the beat cops' encounters on the street, to the sex crime officers' investigations into rape and crimes against children, to the undercover narcotics investigations, and more. There's a great wealth of stories here from cops who have seen it all. Perhaps it was even more interesting to me because I lived for 12 years in the Chicago area profiled in the book--the city's Area Six. The voices of the police officers come through clearly in this book, much as the workers' accounts in Studs Terkel's classic \\"Working\\" did. A must read for any true crime fan! Written in 1992--and if Ms. Fletcher hasn't written an updated \\"What Cops Know--Part II\\", she should!"},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"Years ago, I had the opportunity to tag along with some police officers during their patrols. While nothing much occurred, I learned some fascinating facts and heard some amusing stories. On one occasion, while in City Hall, a former politician from an inner city neighborhood warmly greeted the policeman that I was with like a long lost friend or family member. Afterwards, the copper explained that he routinely arrested the politico when he was a street punk. Years later, the man sued the police department for brutality and was elected to serve a term on the City Council. He ended his career in elected office by being sent to prison for corruption. The truth is stranger than fiction. One of his successors required a gubernatorial pardon to serve as a councilman!The cops see and hear things that many of us unobservant taxpayers never see or constantly overlook. With that statement as a preface, I have to give high marks to this anecdotal account of \\"What Cops Know.\\"This is a highly readable and entertaining book that you will find difficult to put down. The police are sometimes cynical, humorous and jaded by turns, but their stories are never without interest. You will find tales of criminal stupidity and heartwrenching tragedies described in these pages. It is a wild ride.The truth is out there. St. Jude is not the patron and benefactor of police officers for nothing!"},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"This is a readable and interesting narrative about police work and much that goes with it. Author Connie Chandler interviewed 125 Chicago police officers in the late 1980's to put this book together. The officers speak plainly and openly about their jobs, and let us see what it's like to wear a badge. Readers learn about working the streets, and crimes that range from property crimes to violent offense and the mob. Some of the stories are interesting, some humorous, and some downright depressing. But nearly all are interesting in the capable hands of the author. Good writing is engaging and informative, and this book easily passes the test."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"This wonderful book does not try to dramatize anything. It's a simple, straightforward set of interviews with police officers.There is no \\"case\\" to make, or any ax to grind.Fifty years ago, Jack Webb tried for the same objective in creating \\"Dragnet.\\" However, as it translated to the TV screen, it instantly became a cliche and the butt of jokes.It's much harder to joke about what's in this book, though. The main consequence is that the reader is simply grateful for the presence of our police, and finds a new appreciation for their daily contributions. Its sheer simplicity is what lends this a lot of narrative power.It was given to me by by nephew Tim, a tactical officer with the Chicago Police Department, and I thank him for the book and for everything he does. I admire his attitude; instead of becoming jaded and cynical, he takes his street experiences and translates them into gratitude for his wife and his two children."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"Using their own words, Connie Fletcher lets a group of Chicago police officers tell anecdotes and stories about the things they face every day when they go to work. Some are hilarious, as you'd expect. But most are tales of frustration, anger, and sorrow, with the occasional triumph when the good guy wins and the bad guy gets put away 'til he's gray. To hear them tell it that doesn't happen enough, but they keep going until they burn out, transfer off the street, or quit altogether. Too often they die in the line of duty, and when that happens, their fellow officers sincerely mourn the loss.It surprised me to discover how compassionate these men and women are...not only toward the victims they comfort, but criminals they arrest and help convict. What Cops Know will give you a true picture of what cops think, too."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"No one knows the mean streets as well as the cops who patrol them every day. They are the ones who must face the dragon so that others can go about their lives with some sense of peace.In this wonderful book, the author has allowed the cops to tell it like it is. If you are offended, outraged and disgusted by what you read, it might be because the reality that cop's work in is far removed from your safe world.Cops face humanity beneath the veneer of societal graces, a place that is often horrific. This book tells it like it is."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"In my opinion, everyone should read this book. You will learn more about how to keep yourself safe and how to avoid danger from reading this book than from taking martial arts classes for 20 years. Want to know why you should always fight back against a rapist? The cops Mrs. Fletcher interviewed will tell you. They'll tell you how to significantly lower the odds of having your house broken into (good lighting and make them think you have a large dog even if you don't). They'll also explain why you should never joke around and flash gang signs and if you ever see someone flash a gang sign at you, why you should NEVER return it. A lot of people already know you should never get involved in a domestic dispute but the police officers in this book have to get involved with those types of situations and you learn about how volatile the people involved can be.But I'll warn you: This book will also ruin most cop shows and movies for you (especially if you read her other books). Once you know how cops really operate you start to see how unrealistic and inaccurate most shows and movies are. I was watching the Spike Lee movie \\"Inside Man\\" at a friends house and by halfway through the movie I was actually pacing back and forth and shouting things like 'Are you freaking kidding me?' at the television because it was so completely opposite from how cops actually handle police negotiations. On the other hand you'll appreciate how a movie like 'The Negotiator' gets a lot of it right. The book also made me protective of my children to the point of being paranoid. I will never let a guy babysit my kids, not even my brother-in-laws, and I'm careful about the girls I let do it too, especially if they've got a boyfriend. After you read this book and read about how many kids get molested by their uncle or the babysitter's boyfriend, you'll probably be a little paranoid too. But you'll also be aware of some of the dangers in the world and in my opinion that is definately worth it.Because, while it might have made me a little paranoid, I'm glad to know what I do and I learned a lot of it from reading this book. I've probably read it 7 or 8 times and whenever I go to a used bookstore I look for any copies of it so I can loan them to friends. I also really like the episodic nature of the book. It's a great one to read while you're 'occupied' in the bathroom because the stories are broken up into moderate chunks. I also salute Mrs. Fletcher for her choice in how the stories are arranged. You'll read a funny story about them fooling a drug dealer and busting him, and then the next story is about a druggie who put his baby in the microwave and turned it on because it wouldn't stop crying. That's how life is for police officers. And once you read this book, you'll have a small idea of what cops know."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"This book is quite entertaining, instructive and gripping for all of the first chapter, and then the information and excitement declines ever increasingly for five more chapters. The last chapter on \\"Organized Crime\\" could have been written by anyone who's watched television for the last 15 years when the programs aired are about the Mob and Mob bosses. \\"Those guys have big trunks on their Buicks, ain't that a kick?\\"The first chapter \\"The Street\\" pretty much tells the reader everything she or he wants to know or needs to know about crime and criminals. It is definitely the most useful and the most fascinating chapter in the whole book -- and required reading for those who don't know. I felt a more alert and better prepared citizen as a result of reading this chapter.But still, the information even here is limited by its time and the Chicago culture. The book was published in 1990 and a hell of a lot of new techniques in crime have been developed since then, so this book can't discuss them. Because all the cops' tales about crime are set in Chicago, it's not going to address street crimes by Mexicans, by the Chinese Mafia; there's going to be very little information about other races, except black or white street crimes -- or any other kind of crimes in the other chapters. In the chapter on \\"Sex Crimes,\\" for example, there is no information about Chinese prostitution nor any details about the sex slave trade internationally. All the information is strictly limited to Chicago and the late 1980s.When the cops start talking about stolen VCRs making a lot of money for the criminal in the second chapter, \\"Violent Crimes,\\" and then continue referring to how much money can be made through stolen VCRs throughout the remaining chapters, the reader quickly gets the feeling she or he is holding a cloth book reminiscent of grandma's not-so-fresh hand-me-downs. You just know you've got to drop it and find fresher and more useful, more current, information.Connie Fletcher's method of putting the Chicago cops' knowledge into parable-like vignettes or stories made the book easily accessible. It just needs a severe update now."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"This book is a real tour de force. Teaches you the politically incorrect reality of what goes on behind the scenes.

A good change from the boring theory and scholarly books I read during undergraduate studies. A real page turner and a book that can be picked up when you only have a couple minutes to read. It is written in short paragraph like format, jumping from one account to the next in only a few lines. It takes a couple pages to get used to this still of reading,but none the less it is good book. It further fueled my desire to work in law enforcement."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"This book gives you a good look into what the people on our police forces go through every day of their lives.

I like this book because it gives a large cross section of a large and rough city's Police department. While there a million yarns about the NYPD, I do believe that for a long period of time Chicago was A LOT rougher than NYC. I believe it has something to do with grinding urban poverty coupled with the influx of all the rural, tiny and poort elements of the American heartland (Tennessee and Kentucky, etc.) coming together. This has always been true of Chicago's history, even from its gangland days, I believe. The stories in the book run the gamut, from dead children, wild shootouts, and bizzare and sadistic murders. This book would send any surbanite fleeing back out of a City. Now in this supposedly 'reduced urban crime epoch' the young should read this book when they head to a hip urban campus and always keep in mind what most U.S. metro areas degenerate to, RATHER QUICKLY."},{"Title":"What Cops Know","review":"A little behind times. An easy read. Brought a smile to my face. But fun reading.I will pass it on for others to enjoy."},{"Title":"Language and Art in the Navajo Universe","review":"Witherspoon, a professor at the Univ. of Michigan, uses language as an entry way into a world-view and a way of Being that is totally alien to many if not most, Anglos. The Navajo universe was created and organized through language as the thought, conceived by Holy Beings, was projected onto the primordial unordered substance through the compulsive power of speech and song. Language then, is an energetic medium that affects the very entrails of reality. Thought then, for a Navajo, is a creative tool for ordering reality. That's why the ability to speak eloquently, and think beautiful & creative thoughts, is highly praised. A child acquires human status only after it has started to speak.In this book i've found excellent descriptions of the Blessingway ceremony and various other curing rites (designed to recreate the world through myth, song, prayer and language). This includes the best (by far) explanation of the famous Navajo phrase \\"sa'ah naaghaii bik'eh hozho\\" that Navajos use to refer to a \\"beautiful, pleasant and healthy environment\\". The phrase which represent a maelstrom of meanings is firmly rooted into Navajo mythology and thus often considered untranslatable. Moreover, Clyde Kluckhohn (the 'grandfather of Navajo anthropology) often says that English lacks terms that have simultaneously moral and aesthetic meanings and hence cannot be used to comprehend Navajos.Witherspoon tells us that the principal verb in the Navajo language is not \\"to be\\" like in many other languages (including ours); \\"to be\\" is of minor importance in Navajo. Instead, the Navajo language contains some 356,200 distinct conjugations of the verb \\"to go\\", reflecting emphasis on movement and change. Movement, song, speech and life are, for a Navajo, inseparably linked. What does such ordering of the world - in terms of change and movement, instead of the emphasis on the \\"self\\" - mean for the Navajo sense of being in the world? W. explains it all in this fascinating, hard-to-put-down book.The book includes much analysis of genealogical terms and their relationships based on sex, generation, relative age and relative distance. Being born into a clan fixes the social context of the person clearly, precisely and unalterably while the language terms used to negotiate the social and spiritual interactions change depending on the context (the brilliant discussion of k'e terms in Chapter 3). In other words, the Navajo language is analyzed and investigated by W. as an organic aspect of a culture, its evolution and its mythos. This is cultural anthropology & linguistics at its best. A few quotes to get the sense of the book (P.151):\\"For the Navajo, beauty is not so much in the eye of the beholder as it is in the mind of its creator and in creator's relationship to the created. The Navajo does not look for beauty; he generates it within himself and projects it onto the universe. Beauty is a creation of thought....[...]..the Navajo experience beauty primarily through expression and creation, not through perception and preservation. In the Western world beauty as a quality of things to be perceived is, in essence, static; to the Navajo, however, beauty is an essential condition of man's life and is dynamic. It is not in things so much as it is in the dynamic relationships among things and between man and things. Man experiences beauty by creating it.With regard to the two different views of art it is not surprising that Navajo society is one of artists (art creators) while Anglo society consists primarily of nonartists who view art (art consumers). The Navajo find it incomprehensible that we have more art critics than we have artists, and more art collectors than we have art creators (sic!). Nearly all Navajo's are artists and spend a large part of their time in artistic creation. All Navajos are singers and most Navajos have composed many songs.\\"A healthy resepct for language, its relationship to thought and natural environment also allows for intimacy between man and Earth. Witherspoon writes: \\"Four times I observed the rain ceremony performed on days with clear skies, and each time it rained within 12 hours of the conclusion of the rite, which lasted only a few hours. Only once, however, was the rain significant enough to be of some help\\"and so on. very cool. very informative. The book is prefaced by no other than Clifford Geertz! One conclusion reached by GW is that Navajo art and thought have much to offer contemporary philosophy, art and spirituality and to our understanding of connections between mental and physical phenomena. by looking into the symbolic dimensions of language we dive directly into the primordial origin of thought and its relationship to reality, to what is real. Witherspoon knows this & presents it beautifully. highly recommended."},{"Title":"Language and Art in the Navajo Universe","review":"Witherspoon approaches his study of Navajo culture with the assumption that there exists some basic tenet of the Navajo cultural system that is all-enduring, but that it is the surface dynamism of this culture that characterizes the adaptability of the Navajo people. Witherspoon spent fifteen years living with the Navajo, and his experience in their language comes more from his work as a teacher and in other personal roles than from anthropological research. He sustains that there is a cultural chasm that separates Navajo culture and Western culture. Different languages contribute to this chasm, as does ritual, a large part of the behavior that non-Navajos do not seem to understand. The question of why rituals are carried out in the way that they are garners typical responses of non-Navajos. Most often, non-Navajos claim that ritual continues because of religious prescription. The curing of ailments by ritual is dismissed as coincidence and psychosomatic effect. Witherspoon argues that these conclusions are not valid because they are made in the viewer's frame of analysis rather than that of the Navajo. &quot;Navajo acts arise out of their world and make sense within it&quot; (15). Language and Art in the Navajo Universe aims to bridge the gap between Western and Navajo cultures."},{"Title":"Who Can You Trust?","review":"If you luv the Purple Moon website and their CD roms, you'llluv the books too!

Adapted from a story by Rudyard Kipling and now reprinted for a juvenile crowd by Starscape Books, \\"Billion-Dollar Boy\\" is solid if unamazing SF journey.It's the future, when Earth is impoverished except for a tiny number of corporate big-shots. And Cheever heir Shelby has everything a boy could want and more: insane amounts of money, a staff to wait hand and foot on him, and a dimbulb mother who lacks the brains to tell him \\"no\\" sometimes. In short, he's spoiled rotten. And when he wants to take a space cruise, his mum says yes. Unfortunately, Shelby gets drunk on the voyage, and decides to take a small jaunt OUTSIDE the spaceship -- where he gets literally lost in space.Fortunately, he's picked up by a mining vessel. Unfortunately (depending on your viewpoint) the family on board has never heard of the Cheevers, and they certainly don't believe that he's wealthier than all the miners put together. So for the first time, Shelby is forced to use his brain and his body, and pitch in on actual work. That would be fine -- until someone recognizes him, and plans a ransom demand to his father.Like \\"Putting Up Roots,\\" this book is not an amazing, groundbreaking piece of SF, but it's readable for both adults and kids. It has a pretty simple, straightforward plot: Go from A to B, where C will happen. And Sheffield does a good job of shifting Shelby from a bratty, overweight, obnoxious teenage boy to someone resourceful, skilled, and if not smart, then at least trying to be. The writing is fairly ordinary, with some good descriptions of life on a gritty mining ship.This novel is far from flawless, though. One of the biggest problems is the technobabble that the characters launch into, or the idea that Shelby's smart \\"salt of the earth\\" dad would marry an idiot socialite and let his son run wild. Or, for that matter, how there could be a mere few hundred rich elite on Earth; why this is so is never explained, since that sort of scenario wouldn't last long.Shelby is a pleasant oasis in a sea of kid characters who either know it all, or are just plain annoying. He's meant to be annoying, and the means by which he STOPS being annoying is what makes him interesting. Grace is a pretty good character, although I had trouble figuring out if she was a love interest or not. Most of the supporting characters are okay, not stellar, except for the dryly amusing Logan (a robot).Despite the odd implausible points, \\"Billion-Dollar Boy\\" is a solid enough read, with a very flawed lead and a solid, action-filled story. Nice job."},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Boy","review":"One of the reasons I loved reading science fiction as a kid was the spirit of adventure and exploration that sci-fi offered. This book, with its fast-moving and clean plot (G rated, but more enjoyable because of this, not in spite of this), reminded me of the thrill of my youth when I discovered a new Asimov novel in the library.

The first Jupiter Novel, HIGHER EDUCATION by Charles Sheffield and Jerry Pournelle, was a predictable and not very engaging novel for young readers (ie: no sex) that fell short of the series' goals. It read more like a piece of propaganda arts from the far right wing (ie: social welfare undermines personal initiative), and if the story is allegedly a satire on the Education process, I found no humor and the message was lost. Frankly, it left me cold.Sheffield has much improved in sticking to the classic science fiction &quot;feel&quot; in THE BILLION DOLLAR BOY--which is a bit like a cross between Catcher in the Rye and an episode of the 60's TV classic &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. Shelby Cheever V is one of the richest young men of the 22nd century when a careless mistake finds himself on a mining ship 27 light years from Earth. [Hoo boy, what a premise to start with] Cheever finds himself having to rely on his own wits, working his passage off while learning a lot about what it is to be human. His trials and tribulations are filled with action and emotion; knowledge is gained in both his character and mind. He even slims down from the fat, spoiled, rich kid to a muscled, brainy and appreciative young adult. [reserving a rude comment here--I'll let my own sarcasm remain silent]The plot is entertaining despite its predictability--and lack of characters of true depth. The hard science is delivered in a no nonsense manner--no bug eyed monsters, &quot;rubber science&quot; or anything without plausible basis in today's known sciences. However, there are a few social leaps that one must buy into (like Earth being overrun by starving hordes of the poor, and ruled by an extremely minute group of rich elite) that may be a bit hard to stomach. And don't get me wrong, I'd definitely rather have my kid reading this than some of the real trash out there. But I truly wonder whether there are any &quot;young readers&quot; out there that would fit the bill as to the intended audience--more likely it is oldsters like myself looking to recapture a bit of the &quot;innocence&quot; of our youth"},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Boy","review":"for the price of the book and the quality its a good buy. haven't read it yet but i have read the cyborg from earth by the same author and absolutely love it. the only reason i cant give it a perfect rating is because i haven't read it all the way yet."},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Boy","review":"There was a note missing from the copyright page: \\"This book was previously published in slightly different form under the title _Captins Couragous_ by R Kipling\\" This is a retelling of the Kipling book with the most minor of changes to set it in space, even to the point of calling the smaller spaceships 'Dorys' and retaining many other terms and elements which made sense in their original setting and don't here.

Now, more than a hundred years later, mining has expanded - with a little help of the instantaneous transportation network known as the node - to the Kuiper Belt and to the Messina Dust Cloud more than 27 light years from our solar system.Shelby Cheever, an overweight, spoiled, rich brat and teenage son of one of the wealthiest men on the planet, is bored. He is waited on hand and foot by a core of servants that hate him, but are grateful for the steady work outside of the pool. His mother dotes on him and he has everything he wants. But, he is still bored. So, he convinces his mother to take him on a space cruise to the Asteroid Belt.Drunk on alcohol and his own sense of self-importance, Shelby impatiently forgoes the services of a trained guide and ventures into the node network alone expecting to be delivered to the Kuiper Belt for a proper tour of this far off sector of the solar system. Instead, after a gut-wrenching transition through non-normal space, the node network drops him into open space in the Messina Dust Cloud. Fortunately for Shelby, the Harvest Moon, a mining ship extracting rare, stable transuranic elements from the cloud, is nearby and he is rescued before he could drift off into the cloud.Shelby of course demands to be returned to his cruise and his mother at once, but the crew of the Harvest Moon - an extended family of adults and teenagers - has no time to go back to the node as they are working the currents of the dust cloud and won't return until the hold is full. Left with no options, Shelby grudgingly tries to make himself useful as he is expected to do by the captain (and mother of the clan); thus begins Shelby's transformation into manhood.In the spirit of the now classic coming of age adventure science fiction tales of Heinlein and his generation, *The Billion Dollar Boy* continues to explore the themes related to what is becoming of the human species in these loosely related stories of our coming future.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Boy","review":"I liked &quot;Higher Education&quot;, and I liked this one more. The plot of the story is rock solid, the science is impeccable, as usual for Mr. Sheffield, but what really makes the trip worthwhile is the characters. Fresh, intelligent, and unique, Sheffield rarely wastes a word creating characters so rich and vibrant that they stand from the page like a lion's roar. There's no falseness to what they do, no contrivances to what happens, (and what *has* happened)to them, and there's no fakery to how they react to it when it does. Even though they're 27 light years from Earth, the characters of this book are admirable, interesting, and utterly believable."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Magic & Witchcraft","review":"The \\"Eycyclopedia of Magic and Witchcraft\\" is an excellent illustrated introductory history of magic, witchcraft, and the occult. It is by far one of the best I've seen. It is intended for those who presumably have little background in these subjects, but is just as enjoyable for anyone already aquainted with magic and the occult. It traces the history of magic and spiritual beliefs from prehistory to modern times, highlighting a number of important topics along the way.The book begins with an introduction to shamanism and other early magical beliefs from which all others would evolve over thousands of years. It highlights magic in the anicent and classical worlds, particularly Egyptian, Greco-Roman, Celtic, and Northern European beliefs. It investigates the role of magic and witchraft in the rise of ancient and modern religions such as Christianity, Islam, Buddism, Hinduism, and Shintoism, as well as the role of witch doctors and magic healers throughout history, well into modern times. It also addresses the influence of magic on science and how magic, science, and religion are more closely related then many might think. It devotes an entire chapter to the history of the European witch hunts from 1450-1750 and the various impact magical beliefs played in accusations of witchery. It also devotes several sections to the idea of high magic and alchemy and its links with NeoPlatonist philosophy. The last few chapters of the book deal with modern magic and witchcraft history and beliefs, particularly Neo-Paganism and Wicca, but also address other issues as Satanism, Druidry, and modern shamanism.The book is objective in its history and does not succumb to the polemic pitfalls of many other histories of this kind.

Our parental instinct also (wisely) makes us wary of some of the more dangerous activities promoted by the author.The book does, however, give readers some interesting tools for evaluating their babies' reflexes and developmental responses at a depth well beyond what pediatricians assess in routine visits. And it offers a variety of activities (again, employ your parental discretion) designed to demonstrate and build upon babies' natural abilities, as well as their desire to bond with their parents.If you pick and choose, this book offers some valuable information and interesting activities.

I don't think the programs described in the book are very intense and not easily completable as critisized by the main-stream. Actually each program only requires a few seconds to a few minutes, but on a high-frequency basis. So the key is to be patient, and be persistent. I am a full-time working mom, but I could find at least 5 times to do the programs a day, early morning 7-8, noon 12-1, and evening 5-9. At other times my mom helped me do the rest. I have been doing this for 6 weeks since my daugher is 5.5 months old. And I can see the differences now! She is very happy when I am doing the programs with her - particularly the balancing programs and the bit of intelligence cards. Although at the beginning she didn't like the creeping part (lol). If your baby shows signs of not liking one of the programs, be patient and don't push too hard. I tried several weeks, and she began to like that part, now she can creep with a little help. The book comes with instructions of making all materials. I made all the cards and neck collar myself."},{"Title":"How Smart Is Your Baby?: Develop and Nurture Your Newborn's Full Potential (Gentle Revolution)","review":"Your baby's first year is the most critical. Glenn Doman began working with brain-injured children after surviving World War II and the Battle of the Bulge (received the Silver Star). Being a war hero (which he does not emphasize) and a physical therapist, he had a nice job treating brain-injured children. He was well paid but after some time he found that his patients did not improve. In fact, some children whose parents could not afford his clinic did better than those he was treating.So what does the treating of brain-injured children have to do with your baby's first year of life? Though Doman does not state this in his book, other references indicate that the methods used in this book are reflective of how he treats brain-injured children. The same methods that are used to enhance the development of brain-injured children also enhance the development of normal children.Having followed the subject of early learning for the last 25 years, I have to admit that my first impression of the methods used for early development of babies was a bit startling and overwhelming. Enhancing a baby's development of hearing, seeing, and touching (tactile) was a little different than what I was expecting. However, with all of Doman's critic's, the success of his program and amazing results, should convince objective and rational critics that this really does significantly enhance a child's eventual mental and physical development.This book gives the reader a good picture of how a brain-injured child program might look like that is developed at Doman's institute for treating brain-injured children. For normal baby's, parent's who can practice even parts of this program will measure and observe their baby's enhanced development. It has thorough and complete measurement system to determine how a baby is developing. The visual development (eyes and seeing) of the baby's program eventually turns into a baby reading program. Early reading is not new. 2 Tim 3:15 says that Timothy saw the scriptures from birth. Some historians have wondered how ancient cultures learned to read, but there really is not any mystery; they taught their children from birth as Timothy was taught."},{"Title":"How Smart Is Your Baby?: Develop and Nurture Your Newborn's Full Potential (Gentle Revolution)","review":"I have been waiting for this book to come out and I just have skimmed it.Looks like something good for those serious about their newborn's development.

So, when I first read \\"How to Teach Your Baby Math\\" and \\"How to Teach Your Baby to Read\\", I was a bit skeptical. I wanted to see results for myself. After just a few months of working with our daughters, the methods' positive effects were obvious. We stopped wondering if the programs worked, and started wishing we had started from birth.\\"How Smart is Your Baby\\" was released the following year, the same month our son Vaughn was born. We applied the book's suggestions from the moment we brought him home from the hospital.Vaughn is our 3rd child, and he has far exceeded the developmental rate of his siblings. Childcare professionals have commented on how strong, alert, and developed he seems. Even our pediatrician was taken aback. At his 4 month check-up, I received the usual string of questions: \\"can he do this yet... is he doing that yet...\\". After repeatedly answering, \\"he's been doing that for over a month now\\", I ran down his list of milestones... crawled 10-football fields by 2 months, baby-talk and laughing by 2, rolling over by 3, holding breath underwater, etc. For the first time in 3 babies, our doctor looked up from her clipboard and said \\"wow, whatever you guys are doing at home, keep it up... he's doing great!\\"\\"What we're doing at home\\" is covered quite explicitly in \\"How Smart is Your Baby?\\" This book is very reader-friendly and the suggestions are incredibly effective. It has become unquestionably clear to me that a child's abilities are dependent on his opportunities to develop those abilities. This book gives every parent the tools to play an active role in that development.Thank you, IAHP!"},{"Title":"How Smart Is Your Baby?: Develop and Nurture Your Newborn's Full Potential (Gentle Revolution)","review":"When I became pregnant with my first child six years ago, one of the first things that I did was go to a bookstore to begin my reference library for babies. Along with the classics \\"What to Expect When Your Expecting\\" and the like, there are a sea of infant stimulation books. I think that I read the good majority of them, if not all. At that time, \\"How Smart is Your Baby\\" had not been published, but the book that did stay with me was \\"How To Teach Your Baby to Read\\". It was the only book that actually teaches you how to joyously and systematically stimulate your child. I have since read \\"How Smart is Your Baby\\" and it combines the principles of infant stimulation contained in all the other books written by Janet, Douglas and Glenn Doman.Many years and three children later, I live the principles of this book every day. The joie de vivre that infuses our lives cannot be measured.This is an easy to read book. Even if you decide not to apply the principles, you owe it to your child to read this book. You'll never see child development in the same way again and your understanding of your own child will be the reward."},{"Title":"How Smart Is Your Baby?: Develop and Nurture Your Newborn's Full Potential (Gentle Revolution)","review":"I'm not going to say what the book is about as I think some of the other reviews cover this fairly well. I'll recommend the book for the following reasons:1) This is a nice companion to the book \\"What To Do About Your Brain-injured Child...\\" It is an organized guide that takes you step by step through the first four levels of the IAHP Developmental Profile showing you specifically what to look for during evaluations and giving you clear guidelines for how to address areas that need further improvement. Now a book is needed to address the next three levels.2) Though I was seriously considering home schooling my child on the condition that he still be allowed to participate in school sports/activities to socialize, I probably wouldn't have bothered with a book like this prior to my son being born, figuring kids should be allowed to enjoy their childhood, but Doman makes alot of sense to me and I think you can still apply alot of their techniques and simultaneously let kids enjoy being children.3) Had I used this book with my son from the start, I might have discovered some of the brain injuries much sooner and certainly addressed them via their techniques much sooner. So even if you don't want to make a super kid, I recommend you at least use the book as a diagnostic because it will help you catch things that your child's doctor might miss as he/she rushes through a so-called \\"well checkup\\" or more importantly it might help you catch subtle changes that occur in your child if he gets injured after he or she is born."},{"Title":"How Smart Is Your Baby?: Develop and Nurture Your Newborn's Full Potential (Gentle Revolution)","review":"I feel so fortunate and thankful to have this valuable resource as a parent-to-be. How Smart is Your Baby? is a rather unique parenting guide that provides us with the knowledge and the tools necessary to help our children achieve their ultimate potential in life. For instance, Chapter 7 presents The Institutes Developmental Profile stating the significant stages of development from birth to six years of age. The Profile allows parents to evaluate their own children at home, thus finding the baby's strengths and weaknesses way before they would typically become apparent. This in turn enables parents to determine which areas, if any, need more attention, and to focus on them. Several Chapters explain when and how to evaluate the baby. While the book conveys rather complex medical concepts, it is written in an easy to understand, engaging format. The book provides specific programs to do with your child starting at birth. Examples include: visual and auditory stimulation, tactile program, mobility, balance, language development, and the manual competence programs. Daily checklists of program requirements are included for easy record keeping. The book also provides detailed instructions on how to build various equipment at home to enhance our programs, such as the crawling track, a visual stimulation board, a neck collar, the dowel traversing a doorway, and a brachiation ladder.Thanks to How Smart is Your Baby? I've gained the understanding that so many developmental problems children face in our society today (i.e. learning disabilities) can be prevented when parents know how to help their children develop properly as opposed to by accident in the most critical first year of life. The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential offer many other resources for parents of both well and brain injured children that can be used upon completion of your newborn program."},{"Title":"How Smart Is Your Baby?: Develop and Nurture Your Newborn's Full Potential (Gentle Revolution)","review":"There is no longer any debate - a child's learning potential and cognitive capacity of all kinds - including learning ability, emotional attachment, musical prowess, and athletic skills, can be enhanced through the right environmental stimuli.

But then I noticed a few calling it \\"impractical\\" or \\"cheesy,\\" and advising readers to \\"take it with a grain of salt.\\" That got my dander up, so here goes:I am well acquainted with the Doman program for neurological stimulation, since I took my brain-injured son (then 18 months old) to their Institutes in 1986 and kept him on their Intensive Program for the next four years. During that time, he went from complete immobility to walking with perfect coordination, among other astonishing improvements. (No one who knew him then would say that this \\"would have happened anyway.\\") The same techniques discussed in this book were part of his daily regimen back then.Late in life, I became a parent again, and this time my son was born 7 weeks early. On discharge from the hospital, we found ourselves referred to numerous public agencies that proposed to follow our baby's development, since preemies often experience delays. I recoiled from those resources, because in my earlier experience they'd proved worse than useless. My first son wasted a precious year and a half of his early life while we waited for someone to tell us what could be done. Anyway, if this new baby might need extra help, I already knew to start providing it without waiting for him to start missing milestones.An old friend who once worked at the Institutes mentioned that this book had recentely been published. I ordered it, built the crawling track per its specs, and am now beginning to admire the results. This baby is going to surprise some people when his next assessment comes up!The point I hope to make with all this is that a baby emphatically does not have to be disabled or at risk to benefit from the kind of stimulation recommended by the Domans. Children -- and families -- can thrive on a joyously implemented home program. Such a program will always be misunderstood by folks who have some philosophical objection to the pursuit of excellence, and I have no patience for debating with them. But if you're intrigued, do consider it. While I think most stuff marketed to eager young parents is unnecessary at best, the information in this book is vitally important. If you're expecting a baby, please read it. If you know someone who's expecting, what a gift this would be!"},{"Title":"How Smart Is Your Baby?: Develop and Nurture Your Newborn's Full Potential (Gentle Revolution)","review":"I am a teacher who is very passionate about his work. I was raised by physical therapists, and I have a naturally strong grasp on physiological development. Also, I work in a field that is highly focused on applied psychology/sociology. The point is, I know b.s. when I see it, and truth is refreshing. This book is, very clearly, results-oriented with applied methodology that has concrete proof of achievement. If you don't read this book you are doing a great disservice to your child. I see things in a new light with the years of insight laid out in this book...truly a must read!"},{"Title":"How Smart Is Your Baby?: Develop and Nurture Your Newborn's Full Potential (Gentle Revolution)","review":"I just finished reading this book and it's one of the most ridiculous books I have read. First, the book is completely rambling and makes all kinds of statements that are either sweeping generalizations or such common knowledge that it's just trite to mention. As a neurologist, I'm also appalled by the lack of scientific basis for some of these activities prescribed, some of which are downright dangerous. They make a point about strengthening various reflexes, like the light reflex, or startle, or grasp, or Babinski. First, there is no scientific basis for whether these reflexes CAN be strengthened or why, if it were possible to strengthen them, that it would be a good thing. The latter 3 reflexes are considered primitive reflexes that disappear in a normal infant by age 6 months. These reflexes exist because the baby has incomplete myelination of the frontal lobes. It is NOT normal to have persistent primitive reflexes. Some of their claims about babies crawling from birth is just ridiculous. I see no proof for this, and the baby in their pictures is clearly one that is at least 4 months old given the excellent head control. I am highly suspicious of their claims which have no basis in any kind of peer reviewed publication. The book is in dire need of an editor to cut out about 2/3 of the redundant aspects. Finally, some of these motor exercises are just really dangerous. A baby should be not lifted by their wrists or be suspended by their arms. This can injure their wrists. The strain on the lower part of the brachial plexus (the bundle of nerves that goes to the arm and hand) will cause a stretch injury and possible permanent hand weakness. I don't know of any pediatrician who would allow a baby to be swung around by an arm and a leg. The basic idea of giving your child a stimulating environment is a good idea, but you don't need to read a 1 inch thick book to know this and no parent should be given ideas on how to do dangerous activities like these with their very young child when there are far safer activities that would give even more stimulation."},{"Title":"The Cantata of Love: A Verse by Verse Reading of the Song of Songs","review":"It's a shame that this amazing book from Ignatius Press is not more widely known, though perhaps the 2nd printing in 2005 will ameliorate that somewhat. This is a masterful verse-by-verse exegesis of the Song of Songs, arguably the most commentated book in Scripture. Father Arminjon argues the traditional interpretation of the book as a hymn to Man's mystical union with God. Accordingly, he quotes Catholic mystics throughout the ages (for many of whom it was their favorite book in the Bible!) and gives special attention to the deep interpretations of the Early Church Fathers. This book is the key to unlock the Song of Songs."},{"Title":"The Cantata of Love: A Verse by Verse Reading of the Song of Songs","review":"There are many scriptural commentaries on the Song of Songs, but very few are able to synthesize an orthodox presentation of both academic and supernatural graces contained in a living encounter with the Word of God.

The book is particularly useful regarding this last one where the author works out interpretation of sampling plans based on AQL and related terms through the analysis of its mathematical modelling and practical use.The other topics familiar to many other titles are also well worked but for sampling plans it is necessarily that sort of book anyone who is interested in to build up one's own private library on the subject must have in hands (or in the bookshelf).Luis Gustavo PachecoQuality Chemical Engineerfor Special Processes fromAerospace Industry"},{"Title":"English Workshop: Third Course","review":"The service in getting the book was great.

It's all very easy to understand when you see the large historical picture and understand Professor Webb's \\"boom hypothesis of modern history.\\" That's what this book is all about.\\"The Great Frontier\\" is not the American West, with cowboys and Indians and all of that. Webb's Great Frontier is all of America, along with other great lands that were discovered around the same time as America. These lands were full of untapped riches in the form of undeveloped farmland, forests and other natural resources. The discovery and settlement of this Great Frontier lifted Europe out of static poverty and led to 400 years of worldwide economic boom.But the boom is over. The lands are all discovered, and settled, and mostly exploited. The natural resources are no longer easily obtained like in the early stages of the boom age.Professor Webb saw the future by understanding the boom pattern of the past. This book explains his boom hypothesis in a very readable way. It only touches on the future consequences, but when you understand where the world was prior to the boom, and you understand the simple but profound effects of the boom, it's pretty easy to see the future ramifications.\\"The Great Frontier\\" is a historical slap up side the head of all those people who think prosperity like we knew in the past will continue forever. It can't possibly happen. It is totally unsustainable from a natural resources point of view. Webb saw and taught all this 60+ years ago. I don't think you will find a more insightful, useful, and readable history book than this one.By the way, Webb was a down-to-earth native Texan and a respected professor in his day. It amazes me that more people are not familiar with his writings. The man was brilliant."},{"Title":"The Great Frontier","review":"This is truly a scholarly treatise of the history of our southwest.

So she bought a copy for my 3-year-old neice, Daphne, and she LOVES it just as much! She wants it to be read over and over again, in part because of how dramatic we are when we read it to her (and yes, we hug her at the end). The dramatic, colorful illustrations are captivating. She does ask why his teeth look like that, we dont want to say becuase he's a little terror, we just say that it's okay for everyone's teeth to look different. One day, though, when my brother, her father, was eating with his mouth open she said, \\"Daddy, don't be like David!\\" It was so funny, to see her mind working and remembering that. It's a funny book that should be a part of every child's collection. Heck, I want if for myself even though I haven't any kids yet!"},{"Title":"No, David!

A first grade teacher in California is responsible!At the end of the day-- all day-- do you wonder, really, whose children are in your house? Those can't be MY children! MY children would be much quieter, less rambunctious, and certainly models of good behavior.What child has sharp, pointed teeth--the better to resemble something monstrous? What child has beady monster eyes--the better to see his way into more mischief? And what child would put on his baseball uniform and hit pop flies in the living room even though you just told him to go outside?Not David! Poor David, just trying to have fun: writing on walls, standing precariously on chairs to get the cookie jar, tracking in mud, creating a Niagra Falls water flow over the side of the bathtub, running down the street naked, banging a pot with a metal spoon, playing with his food, chewing with his mouth open and on and on.Wait, he does have feelings. He is put in the corner, but sitting there breaks his heart. Does Mommy still love me?, he cries. She calls him to her, holds him affectionately with the teeniest show of exasperation and says, \\"Yes, David..I love you!\\"His relieved and softened face leaves me in tears. David is just a little boy. We must wait a bit for him to mature before we expect too much.Here's the story behind the story. David Shannon is the illustrator/writer. \\"A few years ago, my mother sent me a book I made when I was a little boy. It was called 'No, David,' and it was illustrated with drawings of David doing all sorts of things he wasn't supposed to do.\\" So Mr. Shannon did a remake.It may be called hyperbole in literature, maybe in art as well, or artistic license. So when David tracks mud in, you have to accept that toadstools and little plants are growing from David's scalp and feet. Would David really have sharp, pointed teeth, or does his noise factor make him seem like a little monster? Can he really stick his finger up his nose all the way to the first knuckle toward the hand part? Or, is Shannon exaggerating for effect?\\"No, David\\" is a self-study of a rambunctious childhood, playfully rendered and wildly caricatured to make sure the child reader understands that little David in NOT a monster and that actions have consequences.This is a book that children love and delight to \\"read.\\""},{"Title":"No, David!

I can't think of one mother who wouldn't want to scream, \\"No!\\" if her children came tromping through her freshly mopped floor caked in mud. One of the things I like to do is ask my children, oh no, what do you think David is doing wrong? Or Why do you think Mom is saying, \\"No David!\\" I also ask, \\"Why should David not do.....\\" What do you think will happen? It gives children the chance to think in a fun way.

After becoming a Trappist monk at Gethsemani Abbey in Kentucky, he searched for solace in a monk's life of solitude. But the more Merton expressed himself through his writing, and became better known in the outside world, the solitude that he sought was harder and harder for him to find. Johnathan Montaldo has done a wonderful job of editing this collection of Merton's prayers and private thoughts and pairing them with sketches from Merton's own hand. Together both represent the soul of a man who offers inspiration and insight to this very day.\\"Dialogues with Silence\\" is a collection that is best read in small batches; while it is possible to read it through as one might a novel, the point of meditation and contemplation (especially on the prayers) would be lost. Some of the pictures and words go hand in hand and offer a look into Father Merton that many have never experienced before this book. The prayers are a candid glimpse into a struggling soul, and are juxtaposed with thoughts on nature and poems that are starkly beautiful. Every page is a testament to the magnificent talent that Merton had in transferring his thoughts into words.There are many prayers I could single out to include as an example of the power of Merton's writing, but this prayer to Etienne Gilson struck me as most appropriate to one of the struggles that Merton underwent: \\"Please pray for me to Our Lord that, instead of merely writing something, I may 'be' something, and indeed that I may so fully be what I ought to be that there may be no further necessity for me to write, since the mere fact of being what I ought to be would be more eloquent than many books.\\" It is extremely fortunate for us that Merton did feel the need to write so that his love of God might be an inspiration to all who read his works."},{"Title":"Dialogues with Silence: Prayers and Drawings","review":"I have read many of his books since reading SEVEN STORY MOUNTAIN, A GREAT FAITH-SHARING READ,, A FRIEND HAD THIS AND I SENT FOR IT..I AM GRATEFUL FOR AMAZON.....I HAVE HAD SACRAMRANTS OF MOMENTS, THROUGH EACH PAGE OF PRAYER,,EACH DRAWING..IN THE QUIET OF THE SILENCE..

What struck me as the most touching portion of the book was the simplistic sketches that accompany each passage. Although the sketches may not have had a particular purpose when Merton drew them, they add a new perspective to the writings in this book since most of the writings were previously published in various books.This book would make an excellent coffee-table book, and serves as a great conversation piece. I came upon this book by chance, and have not seen it available in stores since that time. The sketches that accompany the prayers and writings alone make this book worth purchasing."},{"Title":"Dialogues with Silence: Prayers and Drawings","review":"First of all let us note in passing this review is of the paperback with white cover with the ink sketch of a monk done by Father Thomas Merton, pacifist priest (a redundancy, of course, forgive me). This edition is exquisitely published on the kind of good thick and uncut paper we expect to find from French high quality paperbacks of an earlier era. Again, the edges are uncut, and the paper thick and a joy to caress and to study. This is the quality of publishing we learned to expect from James Laughlin's New Directions publications of Father Thomas Merton's poetry and other works (please consult their correspondence inThomas Merton and James Laughlin: Selected Letters).We get the feeling in reading this volume that much here he would not have presented for public consumption, including the drawings. Many of the writings reveal most personal and private prayers, imperfect, incomplete; some represent stylistic experiments by this excellent writing monk. Some we read as if hearing the rejected practice tapes of a deceased musician, re-issued for post-humous profit, never intended for public hearing.The drawings most often seem the doodles of the searching, made in the process of meditation, not for the rough finished product but as an aid to contemplation, never intended to share.And yet much here there is which is exquisite, and which represents Father Merton's continual preoccupation for peace.We may find this more fully developed in such works asThe Nonviolent AlternativeandCold War Lettersas well asSeeds of Destruction, etc., but here we find prodigious pearls of prayers for peace. See as well in this infinite vein of Father Merton's urgent writings for PeacePassion for Peace, New and Revised: The Struggle for Non-Violence,Peace In The Post-christian Era,Thomas Merton on peaceand over two hundred twenty five other volumes available readily here upon the amazon of Father Merton's writings for peace and pacifism.\\"O peace, bless this mad place; Silence, love this growth (p. 183)\\"We find here the famous Prayer for Peace offered for the US House opf Representatives in Wednesday of Holy Week 1962, \\"Bless our earnest will to help all races and people to travel in friendship along the road to justice, liberty and lsting peace. Grant us above all to see that our ways are not necessarily your ways ( . . .)

Certainly it indicates the call of the hermit and the contemplative to prayer, to silent contemplation in the utmost peace attentive to the presence of God in Love. May we each enter this sacred dialogue with silence, as the ancient prophet who discerned God's merciful, charitable and true presence not in the hurricane but in the soft breeze of Peace.

The anecdotes about his particular experiences with individual firefighters enliven each page, as do the abundant and high-quality photographs of a great many of the &quot;houses&quot;. He provides a most welcome feature for the interested person--the prospective &quot;buff&quot;--who wants to visit some of the houses: a sense of the context of each within the city, e.g. travel directions, listing of other firehouses nearby that could easily be grouped for a short tour, even mention of where to get snacks in the vicinity.And the Quiz for readers is one of the funniest things in print.My advice: run don't walk to buy this book for yourself.

It's a travesty that this book was even allowed to be published.

If it had not been for a skeet shooting accident when I was four years old, I would be a fourth generation firefighter in the FDNY and I have to say that this reflects poorly on the contributions of my ancestors.

This happens at times accidentally, as if almost by fate, where one sits in awe of the unknown masterpiece upon which they have stumbled. This is NOT one of those instances. From the get go this book is a complete disaster. It's written in such a way that I find it hard to believe it took more than a few days to write. The only reason I give it credit for taking more than a day to compile is that it is so filled with rambling and incoherence that the sheer word count could not possibly be amassed by someone this unintelligent in less than 24 hours. After seeing the artist's picture, it became apparent that the guide would not involve a lot of walking (take my word for it). To my dismay it was even less in depth and useful than my already low expectations. This books leaves me with one big question: did Joeseph Natale Schneiderman actually write this book, or is he merely a man that has a hundred monkeys working on one hundred type writers in a warehouse somewhere, because if that's how this train wreck was compiled things would make a lot more sense (I applaud the monkey's efforts) If you feel the urge to buy this book I would recommend a few things first, try hitting yourself in the face with a blunt object. If that doesn't get it out of your system I'd take the money you were planning on using to buy this book and light it on fire, at least it will amusingly be ironic."},{"Title":"The Firefighting Buff's Guide To New York City: The Five Borough, Five Alarm Reference To The Second Homes of New York's Bravest","review":"I can't recommend this book to even the biggest New York or firefighting fans.

Look past this title, there are several much better alternatives such as F.D.N.Y: The fire buff's handbook of the New York Fire Department, of which this seems to be a cheap and extremely inferior rip off of.

He introduces us to a world of complexity and detail that those of us who are not buffs had no idea existed. And he does this with an unassuming and friendly manner.

I did not like what I saw, which in turn has inspired me to a) write this review b) not buy the book and c) not read any more of it than I already have. Given that it was written by a fifteen year old, I have to give the person credit for their research and effort. However, these writings are more the type of a series of high school newsletters or a research report on NYC firehouses. He includes sections, such as what to eat while checking out firehouses, which are completely unnecessary, since people have the innate ability to figure out what they want to eat, as well as when and how much to eat. Also, he includes information unrelated to firehouses, such as how his uncle grew fig trees. Although figs are delicious and healthy, I honestly don't care. I don't care that there's a rib place near some firehouse. Really, I don't. Also, he instructs buffs not to bring heavy camera/photography equipment with them on their trips. That's just plain common sense, and people shouldn't pay $11.95 to read something they already know.From what I could stand to read, this work should not have been made in book format, but if I had to like or postively acknowledge anything within the book, I would say that he did some research into the history of several firehouses. However, I could do that myself on Google for free. I would not pay, or for that matter, continue to read this work.It's a mix of a research paper and a journal, with histories of firehouses combined with his experiences in them, but all that should be best left to high school newsletters as I mentioned before. Or maybe a blog, but that's as far as it should have went. I greatly do not appreciate people printing mundane and lackluster books when there are alternate means of self-expression that do not include paper products. It's bad for my mind as well as bad for the environment. Someone got a little overzealous and gave the kid a book deal. Joseph Natale Schneiderman, the next time you feel that you're in the mood to write another book, save all of humanity as well as the earth a favor. Just make a blog and leave it at that."},{"Title":"The Firefighting Buff's Guide To New York City: The Five Borough, Five Alarm Reference To The Second Homes of New York's Bravest","review":"I was idly thumbing through a friend's book collection when I came across this to hear some people say it \\"masterpiece\\" of modern American literature, I didn't find it to be that exactly. As I began to read through this book I started to feel a wave of embarrassment crash through my entire body, the feeling one might get when reading a smutty magazine in front of your mother, or in a crowded public place, possibly one filled with several priests and other religious officials, but with no one around I read on. As I rounded the third page I found myself laughing, not at jokes contained within the text but at the text itself. It was as if this guide was one of the shoddy pictures drawn by a child one would see tacked onto the side of a cubicle at an office. In that case the age of the child and sensitivity of the parent or loved one must be taken into account and laughter is largely inappropriate but as I sat there staring at this train wreck I realized that this was not a picture drawn by a child, but a incoherent jumble of text masquerading as a credible book that I could openly criticize without fear of being chastised for a lack of social manner or sensitivity. I recommend this book to no one, not even those looking for a cheap laugh as the enjoyment one gets from laughing at this book is replaced mainly with anguish and disgust by about page 10. Now I felt it necessary to read further on despite irksome feeling one gets when reading such a title, but it is unfair to review a book unless you have read at least a substantial part of it. I'm proud to say I didn't finish the book and for the most part the memory of this experience has largely faded from me as if my brain instinctually attempted to erase the event from itself in some sort of subconscious response to detestation. This book is not guide but more a report, a collection of journal entries as it seems from someone id say has an unhealthy, restraining order inducing obsession with New York Firefighting. Although I'm no expert on the subject I know and was told first hand by the friend that mistakenly bought this atrocity that there are plenty of other books that would give you a much more insightful and professional look at the exact same topic, some even offered at a lower price. Despite the contents the author maintains an autocratic tone throughout the book that makes it largely more disgusting. This is a puerile attempt at literature by an amateur who is not worthy of your hard earned money despite the gratuitous praise that he may have received earlier. Reading upwards of 50% of this book was the most upsetting experience I have ever had with literature and I learned little to nothing as I subjected myself to this punishment. I can only breathe a sigh of relief as I was not the one to shell out the cash for this glorified roll of toilet paper. This book should be banned in all public schools across America, and private schools should put serious thought into the matter before purchasing this cover bound collection of rambling incoherence. I known that may sound like a lot of fuss over such a small purchase but trust me when I say this, it's that bad. Without having ever visited a fire house in New York or even New York itself, anyone with a middle school education and internet access could easily piece together a more credible piece of literature. Hopefully the remnants of reading this waste of paper will dissipate from my memory as if I hadn't already forgot as much about it as I already have (I finished reading it 5 days ago) I would seriously have considered shock therapy or a strict regimen of binge drinking and sensory deprivation to rid my mind of this anamnesis. If I was involved in or headed up any type of environmental activist group I would hold protests outside of Joseph Natale Schneiderman's house (if he even has one) frequently as these books will surely, like that of nuclear waste sit in a warehouse untouched for centuries with no foreseeable way to manage the problem. I am still unable to comprehend why Amazon or any institution that sells literature would carry this title and those that do should be ashamed, but that's not for me to analyze. There is no reason to have this book in or anywhere around your home or your family. Despite papers tendency to burn when we threw this book onto a roaring fire following our Sunday dinner, the flames seemed to dance around it as if even the elements themselves want nothing to do with this pariah of physical existence. To wrap it all up there is no reason to have this book, as in a pinch it won't even burn well."},{"Title":"The Firefighting Buff's Guide To New York City: The Five Borough, Five Alarm Reference To The Second Homes of New York's Bravest","review":"While touring the fire houses in NYC with my five year old son, I took along the \\"Buff's\\" guide to New York City.

The arbitrary and racist acts of the participants at this \\"Racism\\" conference are simply amazing.As the authors explain, the NGO Forum at Durban adopted an \\"action program\\" which called for:1) dismantling \\"Israeli colonies\\"2) a \\"right of return\\" of Arabs to Israel3) reinstitution of the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism4) the repeal of Israel's Law of Return for Jews to Israel5) preparation of \\"educational packets\\" by the UN describing \\"the Israeli racist apartheid system\\"6) establishment of a special UN Special Committee on Israeli apartheid7) development of UN programs to counter \\"propaganda\\" that portrays Levantine Arabs as violent terrorists8) launching by the UN of an international anti-Israel apartheid movement9) convening of a War Crimes tribunal to prosecute Israel's leaders10) demanding that the international community completely isolate Israel11) condemning all states supporting, aiding, and abetting IsraelDecent people tended to notice that the tenor of all this was strikingly similar to some of the worst antisemitic literature of the twentieth century.In my opinion, the Durban Conference is, so far, the greatest diplomatic disaster of this century. It basically advocated a total overthrow of human rights. It mocked truth and justice. Let's hope that, at the very least, it will remain the worst diplomatic disaster of this century through 2100.I was shocked by what happened at Durban.

Topics covered include plant evolution, types and distribution of the world's forests, tree engineering, animal life in the forest, soils, forest succession, seasons in the forest, and forest ecology and management. The many illustrations supplement the narrative and enable the reader to better understand the topics described.

These two factors, combined with a lack of other source material led to Edward Longacre's initial reluctance to begin researching this biography. His reverence for the book The Killer Angels, and his service as a technical advisor to Sam Elliott (who played Buford in the movie Gettysburg), combined to help him overcome his fears. The result is this 248-page biography.The book has many strong points. Longacre clearly describes Buford's dealings with the politics of the Army of the Potomac - especially his rise to command after being closely affiliated with three disgraced generals: Pope, Burnside, and Hooker. He does well in conveying a sense of Buford's growing disillusionment as the Army of the Potomac missed many opportunities to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia after Gettysburg. The chapter on Gettysburg is probably the best in the book as it gives the reader a good insight into the problems faced by a Civil War general on the field who had to assess terrain and eploy his troopers to take advantage of the ground while trying to anticipate the probable actions of the enemy.The book is well-produced, has an extensive bibliography, and good maps - even though the typography is sometimes jarring. People looking for an exhaustive &quot;tell-all&quot; biography will not find it here because of the lack of primary source material to work with. Within these limits, though, Edward Longacre has written a worthwhile book about a long-neglected commander."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"As Longacre stated in his forward to this book, after the acclaim of the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot; there was a great demand for books on the participants, including Buford (about whom no good biography had been written). Longacre decided to attempt to fill that gap, but I think he was only partially successful. Longacre cited the scarcity of material about Buford, which I am sure is true to a certain degree. But I wonder how much more material he could have found had he taken the time and effort. After all, Buford was not just some civilian who jumped out of the woodwork. He came from a well-known family and he attended the USMA (West Point), then stayed in the Army - both known for keeping detailed records about their personnel...........I learned much about Buford from this book. But I had expected more - much more. Robertson's recent biography about Stonewall Jackson is a good example of how in-depth research can produce an historical masterpiece. Perhaps Longacre was being rushed by his publisher. Whatever the case, I feel that this book lacked the in-depth research I had expected; that it was &quot;half-baked&quot;."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"This is an real find. My sons' mother is a Buford, and may be related.

Buford died during the war, had no surviving children, didn't write any kind of memoirs etc... Longacre did a solid job of discussing the union cavalry command but many aspects of the book like sections on Gettysburg and West Point seemed rushed. Certainly many other commanders had nice things to say about Buford unfortunately Longacre only found 1 or 2 of them."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"This book explained everything about Gen. Buford, not just what I knew him for, which was his role at Gettysburg."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"A good but not exceptional biography of this long neglected cavalry commander, but there is a lack of any real new insight and personal detail about this man.

It is written in straight forward language and is therefore an easy read. Anyone who has a strong interest in the American Civil War probably is familiar with Gen. Buford through such works as the book \\"Killer Angels\\" and the movie \\"Gettysburg\\". Longacre's book provides much desired pre-civil war and civil war background information. He does interpolate a certain amount of descriptive coloring, but as an attempt to get a feel for the subjective qualities of the man this is not necessarily a bad thing. One could always hope for more detail and information, but Longacre does an admirable job with the available resources."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"I really like this book it was very well written and had a lot of information about General Bufords early years that you never hear about. I always wondered what happened to Buford at Gettysburg after the 1st day now I know. Its a shame he never got the recognition he deservied till it was to late General Buford was one of the best that the north had.the book also gives some insight into how bad the army of the north was actually run in the civil war by wasting good commanders and soldiers. I highly reccomend this book to anyone intrested in the history of the civil war and its commanders their victorys and blunders &#34;and there was many blunders just putting politicians as commanders over real soldiers was the biggest in my opinion and this book shows me to be right&#34;. Well done Mr.Longaccre I will be checking out more of your works."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"a great man. i wish there was more written on him. a shame that he passed at so young an age."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"I love the movie Gettysburg and Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels. It is their thesis that Buford's early arrival on the field, his quick assessment of the topography and his ability to engage and slow the Confederate arrival, set the stage for the Federal victory. So I was very curious to learn more about Buford and this well researched biography does him justice. It also answers the question &#34;why did Lee get away?&#34; Buford was at the van of that pursuit and it wasn't for lack of trying either. Buford died of pneumonia 6 months after Gettysburg. This book reveals just how exhausting this Western Cavalryman's last 4 years had been as he lived in the saddle and slept on open ground every night only to wake up, ride hard, fight deadly engagements and repeat it all for weeks, months and years. Buford was exhausted."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"Great reading - enjoyed very much. Sad life of a great northern hero. Book seems to end rather abruptly tho."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"In General John Buford, Edward Longacre tries to fill out the life of a Civil War general who most people only heard of through Sam Elliot's performance in the film Gettysburg, based on the book The Killer Angels.While an enjoyable film and book, the \\"Gettysburg\\" impression of Buford as an experienced veteran Indian fighter coming into the east had many errors. In Real life Buford was only a captain in the army when the war started. He was a career soldier who had only been in one stand up fight with Indians and spent much time patrolling against militant Mormons, Free Staters and Pro slavers and had long experience as a staff officer, earning great praise for his ability to plan and co-ordinate supplies and troop movements.When the war started these skills were put to great use by the war department who made him an inspector general, in charge of overseeing the training of newly formed units for the war. A position he held for the first 18 months of the war before finally getting any sort of a field command. Once in the field he was a sobering element to his men, a calm regular who saw to his men and horses and complained bitterly of their misuse by infantry officers.The problem is that the real life General did not court the media and died so young, before age 40, that there was very little to work with. In effect forcing Longacre to make bricks without straw.There are some letters to or from Buford and his military reports, Longacre is able to fill out the life of the General through his extensive knowledge of the US cavalry before and during the war. For example knowing what campaigns Buford was involved with, he is able to extrapolate what role Buford would have played in them. As the book moves into the war years the details get thicker and most of the book closely details the last year of the general's life.There seems to be a small amount of hero worship by Longacre in the form of a refusal to admit what seem to be tactical mistakes by Buford on occasion. But not enough to distract the reader. One thing I would like to have seen better explored is Longacre's claim that Buford developed tactics that would endure for mobile troops into the mechanized world. Unlike many cavalry officers who felt their men should be used only in shock tactics, Buford saw his men as being used as mobile infantry as well as shock troops. These are tactics the British Cavalry were using in 1918 but since contemporaries of Buford, like Custer, were also using mixes of shock and fire in their actions, there's little offered as proof that Buford was the originator of them, and not just one of many contemporaries who recognized their use at the same time.The effect is a book detailing the life of a professional soldier who survived the tedium of the pre-war border security work and then rose rapidly to command thousands of men successfully as the war progressed. We really don't get a view of what he thought or felt or hoped, but we are disabused of a lot of the false facts that came out of the film Gettysburg. The lack of primary sources on Buford is almost crippling in its affect on research, but gleaning what he can, Longacre makes bricks without straw and fashions them into a fitting monument to a professional soldier who gave his life for his nation."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"This is a nice, solid military biography. It was very readable, and I was happy to see it had a strong thesis (Buford was \\"a true dragoon). I came away from the book admiring Buford a great deal. True, there could have been more information in here, but isn't further information one of the purposes of an appendix?I highly recommend this book to U.S. Civil War buffs and anyone interested in learning about someone who achieve success without playing many political games."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"John Buford is perhaps best known for his aggressive actions on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg. However, he merits more consideration than for one day's worth of sound generalship. This book does a good, solid job of introducing readers to General Buford.Although born in Kentucky, he later moved to what was to become Rock Island, Illinois. In the late 1840s, he entered West Point and graduated in good standing. Some of those whom he came into contact with at \\"The Point\\" included Ambrose Burnside, George Stoneman, George Steuart, William Jones, John Tidball, and Hugh Ewing (William Tecumseh Sherman's foster brother). In the \\"old Army,\\" he was a trooper, including serving in \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" and into the Valley of the Saints, as the United States aimed to chastise the Mormons.As the Civil War began, Buford was assigned to administration, although he wanted to be \\"in the saddle\\" as an active cavalry officer. After considerable frustration, he earned an active command. He did good service before Second Manassas/Bull Run, trying to alert General Pope of Longstreet's advance through Thoroughfare Pass, threatening Pope's flank. Alas! The significant intelligence never found its way to the right people. Indeed, this illustrates one of Buford's strength--gathering and passing on crisp intelligence (one function of the cavalry was to serve as \\"the eyes\\" of the army). However, later, he was consigned once more to administrative work.When Joe Hooker became commander of the Army of the Potomac, Buford's luck changed again, as he was given an active command. After the debacle at Chancellorsville, General Robert E. Lee began his raid northward. Here, Buford played a key role. First, in gathering intelligence. Second, for his role at Brandy Station, when his cavalry put great pressure on one wing of JEB Stuart's cavalry, beginning to tarnish the reputation of the irrepressible Stuart's command.Then, on to Gettysburg, where he arrived on June 30, assessed the land and the military features around the village, and decided to make a fight of it, fully realizing that his two cavalry brigades were facing Early's corps moving south toward Gettysburg from Carlisle and York and Hill's corps moving east along the Chambersburg Pike. As everyone knows, he held long enough for John Reynolds Union First and O. O. Howard's 11th Corps to arrive and join the battle.After, Buford continued his good work, although he would face reverses as he pursued Lee's retreating army. Once the Army of the Potomac re-entered Virginia, he continued to play a role. However, illness cut short his career.All in all, a useful biography of a figure who deserves to be better known. Indeed, the author originally refused the offer to write this book, because he did not think that there was enough information to do a competent biography. Readers ought to be appreciative that Longacre's assessment was wrong."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"Longacre's book is a wonderful look at the life of Buford, his experiences, challenges and love. The pictures helped me to visualize the steely-eyed man who held the ground at Gettysburg. A truly wonderful edition to any Civil War collector's bookshelf."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"In a period with so many personalities around whom legends have grown, it's refreshing to see a lesser-known but hardly unimportant character from the Civil War given respectable attention. Buford found some prominence as a personality at Gettysburg, but his career has been given scant attention over the years. Longacre's account is relatively short and to the point, with most detail being rightfully reserved for the events at Gettysburg. Buford's ability was certainly validated years after his death, as his methods of combat became a model for future leaders. The book succeeded in giving me--a good ole southern boy--a whole new respect for one of the Union's most effective fighters."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"As mentioned in the other reviews the author was limited in the amount of primary resource material available to him whilst writing this biography. Taking that into consideration he has produced an excellent account of General John Buford. I found the narrative was fluid and easy to read and the chapters concerning Gettysburg and after very interesting. The book is 312 pages in length, contained in 12 chapters with 6 maps and 16 photos. Overall this is a well presented and researched book but does not offer an extensive account of this man's life due to the lack of material. I would think that any person who enjoys Civil War history should find this an enjoyable account of a professional Union cavalry officer."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"Longacre succeeds in bringing to life the exploits of a &quot;common&quot; soldier. Buford did not have the press of Jackson, Longstreet or Hancock, but the book makes clear that he was the glue that held the Union army togetheir.The strength of the book is its simplicity and easy flow. It takes you through Buford's military life and in so doing describes the evolution of the United States and Union armies. Longacre does a fine job describing the deficiencies of the Union and where appropriate Buford.The only limitation on the book is its lack of depth. The most likely cause is the lack of historical detail on Buford's life. But Longacre did the best with what he got."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"Yes, thank goodness for the movie, Gettysburg since without that movie, this fine and very needed biography on General John Buford may never been written or published. The movie brought forward General Buford's finest day as a soldier and this biography bring forward the real man behind the Hollywood image.Its appears that writing a biography on Buford may have been a problem due to lack of first hand material. Its appears that Buford was not a writer or many of it did not survived. But what comes out from Longacre's book is story of a decent and highly motivated man who took the long road to Gettysburg. His premature death probably robbed him of greater Civil War fame since he have proved to be one of the best cavalry commanders within the Army of the Potomac by the time Gettysburg came about. What he could have done if he lived would be one of the great \\"what if\\" of Civil War trivia.Longacre's book is bit short on Buford's early life, lacking material would be my guess on this short coming. But the author was successful in bring out Buford's early military career, thus doing justice the subtitle of this book, \\"Military Biography\\".Only part I am not sure on Longacre's account was his take on where Buford and General John Reynold's initially met on that first day of Gettysburg. Most well known and movie take would be at the Lutheran Seminary Cupola where that most quote \\"The Devil's to Pay\\" came out. Although the actual words may be questioned, I don't exactly buy the author's contention that the first meeting came about in the town of Gettysburg. Why would Buford be there, away from a crucial battle? This was based on civilian eye witnesses, of course the same type of civilians even today who can't tell the difference between a new born 2nd LT and a three star general!!Other then that, this book proves to be quite readable, nicely researched and quite informative on the life of John Buford. This is the only biographical material I have read on Buford outside of that booklet I brought at Gettysburg back in 1995 written by Michael Phipps and John S. Peterson titled \\"The Devil's To Pay\\"."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"Edward Longacre's General John Buford: A Military Biography is exactly what it presents itself to be-a military biography. Unlike more famous commanders, Buford's biography is not bogged down with mind-numbing detail, but instead focuses only briefly on the early and non-military aspects of his life. This is primarily due to the lack of information about Buford, which Longacre freely admits was a major problem in the writing of this book. This is not a point of detraction however, as Longacre fills in the historical gaps with very plausible suppositions based on Buford's well-known character.One of the more interesting aspects of this work was the description of Buford's early career on the plains. In the literature and television programming that followed the release of Gettysburg, one had the impression that Buford was a battle-hardened Indian fighter in the pre-war years. Longacre does a good job of showing that while he had some experience, he was by no means an expert in cavalry warfare when the Civil War broke out. Nevertheless, this part of the book was fascinating because it turns out that Buford was involved in several little known, but major campaigns in the antebellum west, including actions in Kansas and against Bringham Young's Mormons.The Civil War career of John Buford definitely climaxed on McPherson's ridge, July 1, 1863, it is therefore proper that his biography climaxes on the same episode of his life. Though exciting to read about, it was at the same time disappointing, as Longacre seemed intent upon dispelling every popular myth about Buford at Gettysburg-it seems the truth never makes a good story!After Gettysburg, the author tracks the twilight of Buford's career and life, as he literally rode himself to death. Though Longacre is over-zealous and unconvincing in his evaluation of Buford's contribution to cavalry warfare, he does leave the reader questioning how the war may have been different if he had lived."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"As the author states, there isn't a lot of source material available for Buford research, so given that, I think Longacre did a credible job. The book is short and very straightforward, so don't go looking for in depth examinations or startling revelations, but as an overview, it's an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"Many readers, even educated readers, see the US Civil War as an event in a glass bubble between 1861 and 1865 and the people who fought that conflict as having sprung up at First Bull Run. Mr. Longacre does an excellent job of giving depth and context to a truly professional cavalryman -- John Buford. A product of the &quot;Old Army&quot; and the ante-belleum Dragoons, General Buford was representative of the best qualities of that hard profession. While the popular movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot; may have brought General Buford to the eye of the public, he had a long and varied career before June 30 - July 1, 1863. Longacre puts it all in perspective."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"A very decent effort on Buford, but even the author admits he was reluctant to write a bio on this important, but obscure Civil War figure as there wasn't much original resource material to rely on. He decided to go through with the project after the movie Gettysburg came out in which Buford played such a dominant role on the first day. but the basic lack of resource material shows over and over in the book as the author is reduced to infering what Buford thought, and in some cases what he actually did. Still, there is much to learn here about this gallant soldier."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"I had high expectations for this book and I must admit that I am disappointed. I agree that this was well researched but I must say that I could not read more than a couple of pages before putting it down and doing something else. A couple of things Longacre lacks, and possibly this is from a lack of primary source material, is a weak background of the Union General. We learn little about where he was born, what his young life entailed, and most importantly who his family was. We also get a mediocre summary of his involvement at Gettysburg, the most important campaign in his military career. I think Longacre could have went deeper. He should have discussed the first day in more depth, and perhaps compare/contrast Buford's character with the one portrayed in the movie &quot;Gettysburg.&quot;But overall I would recommend this book to anyone simply because it is the only biography out there on Buford. I think you do get a sense of who the General was and how he commanded and respected his men. I just wish it was better written."},{"Title":"General John Buford","review":"Excellent research; well written. I hated to see it end! This book is most informative on a lesser known General of the civil war. It was good to see such an honorable man receive his due. I have always wondered about Buford and his unit. I read this book in one sitting. Great for both student and pleasure reader alike."},{"Title":"Empires of Flux and Anchor (Soul Rider Series, No 2)","review":"Let me start off by saying that I have read a LOT of Chalker. This series is going beyond my already high expectaions. The 1st book was great as an introduction to the worlds and the concepts that you will be struggling with throughout the series. The 2nd book jumped an order of magnitude forward in sheer brilliance. It is set quite a few years in the future from the ending of the last book, so you can really see how to social structures that were built in the past stack up (or fail to).A little more is revealed about the nature of the Soul Riders and how Anchor came to be in Flux. This is really great stuff, and I hope the rest of the series keeps the pace going. it could potentially even beat out the Well World books as my favourite series of his."},{"Title":"Grandma's Stories","review":"A friend of mine sent me quite a few books from Mr. Steber. He uses them when he teaches school. I have found no matter what your age is each book is interesting. While the stories are only a page long the history that you learn is priceless.Kids find it hard to realize that people could do without so much. I know that my own grandson's ask me why I always say ice box instead of refrigerator. Well that is because that is what we had.The reason I say this book is good for everyone is because I think we all take things for granted. So sit back with your child or grand-children and take them back through the history of the beginning of our country.

In fact it is educational. Superman believes that everyone would do the right thing if only they knew how profitable it was. He's not angry, he feels sorrow for our faults."},{"Title":"Superman Last Son of Krypton","review":"This novelization of Superman the Motion Picture is a good suspenseful read, and in case you need any point clarified from the movie here it is in black and white, including over 30 b&w still photos."},{"Title":"Superman Last Son of Krypton","review":"I loved Kingdom Come, but the same author. So I read this, an earlier book of his. It's nowhere near as good.The most problematic element of the novel is Superman himself, with all his glorious abilities and imperfection. In Lost Son Maggin reminds us in a few places that Superman can fly through the heart of the sun without harm. At one point he actually does it, after a late night session of doing medical research on a deadly virus (flying through the sun before going to work sterilizes him so he doesn't carry the contagion to Metropolis). And isn't Superman powerful enough without being able to trace a phone call with his x-ray vision?? Then there's his &quot;super ventriloquism.&quot; Not only can he throw his voice anywhere, he can disguise his voice so that it sounds like Lex Luthor's voice coming over a bad guy's radio headset. You get the picture. Maggin faithfully described a character who was bursting at the seams with about forty years of accumulated &quot;innovations&quot; by contless writers. There's a good reason the Superman character has been revamped in recent years -- the character was simply untenable otherwise.Maggin had no way of knowing how his subject material would be updated for modern tastes in the decade after he wrote his novel. Last Son was probably more palatable for readers at the time it came out. Today it is a lot of fun, but it's fun in part because it takes you back to a bygone era of comics. This means the book may appeal most to older readers interested in a nostalgic experience, or to those who read it for academic and historical reasons. In much the same way that nobody reads Le Guin for fun or excitement, Maggin's Last Son of Krypton may be a sort of &quot;classic&quot; for historical reasons, not because it's a great read. Serious fans of Superman of superhero novels will really enjoy this novel. I read it because I so loved Maggin's work on Kingdom Come. But for most people who are regular science fiction or comic book readers, this novel probably won't seem worthwhile.Perhaps Last Son would come across better if it was judged purely on its own merit, and not viewed through the prism of two decades of change in society and the comic book characters. It could be seen as a kind of grand operatic fantasy. The more modern, less eccentric version of Luthor may be absent, but in compensation, this book's Luther is generally funny. Some of the banter between this amoral but affable genius and his colorful hirelings recalls the best of Gene Hackman's scenes from the Christopher Reeve Superman movies. Put can you really remove this novel from all context? As an independent satirical fantasy Last Son certainly can't be compared to Candide or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or A Canticle for Leibowitz. This novel's satire isn't even about real society, but about the world of the Superman comics. People are going to read a book about Superman because it is a book about Superman, not because of who wrote it or because of its philosophical themes. Context is important."},{"Title":"Superman Last Son of Krypton","review":"If anyone needs to know how to write a comic-book novel, remain faithful to the spirit and mythology of the series and yet take make it solid enough for a text-based medium, this is it. I read this novel as a teenager (to the point where my only paperback copy now is coverless and taped together) and was enthralled by its depictions of Superman and his supporting cast. Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, Steve Lombard and *especially* Lex Luthor are painted with good humour and with a three-dimensionality they never truly achieved in the comics. Maggin takes the threads of Superman's history and the DC Universe, binding them together in a coherent narrative that gives us new insights into the psyche of the Man of Steel and his greatest foe. I cannot recommend this enough, and hope that someone brings it back into print one day."},{"Title":"Superman Last Son of Krypton","review":"It seems that most of the reviewers of this book started reading Superman comics *after* the Post-Crisis retrofit, and have limited appreciation for how this book, and its followup, _Superman: Miracle Monday_ fit into the continuity of the day, and that's too bad, because they fit flawlessly.I read each book when it was released--at the same time as the first two Superman movies--and in both cases, I felt that the books would have made better films than the stories the movies actually used. I still feel that way. I won't rehash what others have said about the depth of character development. Those reviewers were right on the mark. Take all they said times ten.But I do want to point out that what impressed me is how Eliot S! subtly wove so much of the DC universe into these two books, and how his attention to detail bound them so closely that I refuse to review them separately. Without wandering away from the actual main plots, Maggin manages to tell the reader about the universe beyond Metropolis, be it how to shop at an outer space bazaar, the nature and deployment of the Green Lantern Corps, or the heartbreak of unfair judging at a Smallville science fair.Scenes and situations in the first book are masterfully echoed in the second, and character emotions and motivations are anything but two dimensional. I get misty when I reflect on the thoughts of Clark's &quot;almost dad,&quot; who was wise enough to know that he should not raise the boy, when I consider Superman, his identity exposed, listening to the music that is humanity, and accidentally learning a lesson, and when I recall the only thing Superman wanted to know about the future--and the one thing Luthor wouldn't do despite the past.The book is well worth reading. And if at all possible, get _Miracle Monday_ as well. And if you want a real challenge, try to find the 1982 DC Comics Presents Annual, introducing Superwoman, which revisits characters introduced in the novels, and provides a nice little &quot;signature&quot; for the series."},{"Title":"Superman Last Son of Krypton","review":"Elliot S! Maggin was responsible for a great deal of the 1970's Superman mythos, and one of the creators influential in updating the character and making him the flagship of DC comics. With this novel and the sequel, Miracle Monday, he took the comic book characters and made them seem absolutely real. Maggin's Superman is THE Superman; the interpretation of the character that just feels right. The story is fantastic and the implications world-shattering, which is what should be the case when dealing with such a powerful protagonist. many modern comic book writers say they would not want to write Superman because he's too powerful and they feel like they couldn't come up with anything challenging for him. Well, this book shows that the trick is to write more powerful challenges, menaces that are a match for the Man of Steel. Maggin pulled this off many times in the comics and in both of the novels he wrote. His Lex Luthor is the most likeable and realistic version of the character ever put to print, which is a pretty good trick considering that this is the Lex who wears the 'Superfriends' costume with the jet boots. Lois Lane comes off as brash and independent, without the negative interpretation often seen in live action portrayals. This Lois isn't some spiteful witch or damsel in distress; she's a modern woman with a mind of her own. Superman and Clark Kent, the dichotomy between the two characters is almost palpable, and the reader really gets a sense of the terrible weight of living two lives. As much as I have enjoyed the more recent retellings of the Superman mythos, I have yet to see anything to equal this, even after almost thirty years. This book is fun for all ages, but definitely geared away from the kids. It's a book that should definitely go back into print, and one that anyone who loves Superman should pick up."},{"Title":"Superman Last Son of Krypton","review":"I had forgotten about this novel and its sister title Miracle Monday, both scripted by Elliot S! (the 's' stands for superman)Maggin until I was searching for the novelization of Kingdom Come. These are great books and really emblematic of the classic Man of Steel. There is great characterization in &quot;Last Son&quot;, particularly the Lex Luthor character who is portayed as a truly three dimensional character. The way Luthor stores his many revolutionary and futuristic weapons and inventions is inspired. It also provides some insight into why a man of Luthor's capabilities would choose to become the man he is, an arch-villain. If you can find either of these books, and have an interest in Superman, you could do no better."},{"Title":"Superman Last Son of Krypton","review":"This book and it's companion &quot;Superman: Miracle Monday&quot; provide the most destinctive take on the popular hero in his prime. Released along with the movie, this book was largely ignored by the comics industry, but gobbled up as a bestseller on the stands. It continues to rate as the &quot;perfect&quot; Superman book even years after it is no longer available from the publisher (although, one can only guess as to why a best-seller wouldn't still be available...).

As an enthusiast of the pre-Byrne Superman, I have to compliment Mr. Maggin for overcoming the difficulty of depicting thoughtful and believable challenges faced by an immensely powerful Superman. At the same time, Maggin expands on Superman's appeal as a hero with three-dimensional psychological qualities and a lengthy and often tragic history. Maggin's Superman, with his acute awareness of his alien nature and impact on human life, is refreshingly distinct from the super-human-who-just-happens-to-be-from-another-planet framework of the more recent version.Frankly, it's pure foolishness that Warner Books has taken this title out of print.

That underlying paradox provides the premise of this connected set of short stories. He travels the world at intervals, surveying the realm of unreason on each trip, and taking satisfaction in watching it shrink. Where he can, he applies his subtle magic in support of Reason's expanding domain.Brunner explores Chaos's control and degradation of humankind in several of its ways. The first story tweaks mindless religion. It might even show how one can choose atheism, after encountering a god face to face and finding him unworthy of belief. Another of these gentle stories undermines magical thinking - again, not because it fails, but because its success is not worth having. And so with the faith in luck that makes Las Vegas the holy city of Chance, and so the unwarranted sense of entitlement that demands ever-richer result for ever-poorer effort at earning it, and so for blind pursuit of power irrespective of the cost or of who pays it. Since these stories are built around layers of paradox, Brunner's mechanism is itself a paradox, the smallest of magics to achieve the largest of consequences.Brunner was one of the best SF writers of the 70s and 80s, author of \\"Shockwave Rider\\" and other stories of chilling prescience. Among all of his writings, though, \\"Traveller in Black\\" may be his finest and most under-stated, under-rated achievements. These stories have held up well over the thirty years since they were written; since they pass in a distant place and age, there is little in them that can look dated. I recommend these stories to any thinking reader.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Homesteads Ungovernable: Families, Sex, Race, and the Law in Frontier Texas, 1823-1860 (Jack and Doris Smothers Series in Texas History, Life, and Culture, Number Three)","review":"Typically, historical reviews can be dry and humorless.

Perhaps, after being in the field and working with people the likes of Col. David Hackworth, Holley thought that the &quot;REMF&quot; life at the 218th wouldn't interest his readers. Up until he transferred to the 218th, Holley's book is lively and full of incident; after the transfer, Holley complains of the personnel he has to work with and the &quot;REMF&quot; attitude that flourishes in the rear areas.

It is obvious that the author is on a mission, namely to convince the reader that contemporary mathematical foundations are important, applicable and useful to formulate, investigate and answer questions in mathematics and computer science. The book does so by drawing on many examples picked from widely across those disciplines, not only in the main text but even more so in the exercises.Particularly in the light of more critical reviews of this text, though, I must admit that this is not the first book I have been reading on the material covered here. But it is surely one of the more enjoyable and insightful expositions in this field."},{"Title":"Practical Foundations of Mathematics (Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics)","review":"This is a superlative book, a compendium of absolutely essential topics in the range between mathematics,philosophy, logic and theoretical computer science. This is a complex field. We often find writers addressing philosophical, logical and practical issues relating to logic, its implementation, the relation bt. theory and \\"reality\\" of reasoning, mathematical aspects at the hight end of pure mathematics: sheaves, topology, algebraic logic, ... and so on and on.To those who do not enjoy working in areas of enquiry that have multiple, perhaps indefinitely multiple aspects to them, there are welcome to write a book that unifies it all!"},{"Title":"A Death for Adonis","review":"A leading artist butchers his male model at his country estate--or does he?In 1944, Sebastian Calvert was tried and convicted of the most brutal, bizarre and perverse murder in England's history. Early one morning, Sebastian was found crouched in the study, dazed and incoherent. In his arms he cradled the dismembered body of David Mersey, his Adonis, which to this day rivals Michelangelo's David. Fifteen years later, Elizabeth Pennell Calvert, his daughter by an ill-fated first marriage, reopens the case to prove her father's innocence--and to allow her the freedom to love without the shadow of her father's horrible crime of passion.Which of the houseguests committed the savage crime? Was it: Vanessa, Sebastian's wife, a leonine statuesque blonde who wanted David and was willing to fight for him...? Rosemary Calvert, the precocious sixteen-year-old devoted to her uncle Sebastian and jealousy protective...? Elinor Atkin, Vanessa's dedicated cousin who had already lost Vanessa once--to Sebastian...? John Hrner, a passionate young poet, Sebastian's secretary, and wild for Vanessa, who spurned him nastily...?Retrieved from an early retirement, Robert Forsyth, a disgraced London barrister in his mid-thirties, and Miss Sanderson, his no-nonsense secretary, gather together the original players... each of whom had a motive for murder, among them: lust, pride, and revenge."},{"Title":"A Death for Adonis","review":"This is an enjoyable series, as much for the wit of the main characters as for the well-plotted mysteries. The investigation moves briskly and the explanation is neat -- no deus ex machina here. The final reasoning -- that brings the barrister out of his self-imposed retirement -- is as satisfactory as the wrapping up of the main thread of the book."},{"Title":"A Death for Adonis","review":"I LOVE books about murders that occurred in the past, and I love mysteries set in British country houses. This book has both elements, and the combination of the two makes for one of the better books I've read this year.Rarely do you come upon a mystery series first novel that is as good as this one. In many ways, this book was flawlessly executed and I read this in one sitting because it was good enough that I did not want to put it down.The story hinges on a brutal murder that had occurred in 1944. Well-known artist Sebastian Calvert was found in his studio holding the dismembered corpse of the mode for his statue of Adonis, David Mersey. It snapped his brain and sent him into a mental hospital, although he was tried and convicted of the murder. Now, 25 years later, Calvert's daughter Elizabeth (who did not grow up with him, living with an uncle instead), comes to Robert (Robby) Forsythe, to persuade him to look into the case and see if there's any way possible Calvert wasn't guilty, because she doesn't want her father's shadow following her into a new relationship. Robby, who used to be an up-and-coming barrister in London until a scandal forced him into a life of seclusion, and his faithful friend and secretary Sandy dive into the case. They discover that perhaps there's more to the story than what's on the surface.The writing is excellent; the story will keep you glued, and truly this was an incredible mystery. In parts it reminded me of the writing of Barbara Vine (whose works I admire), and I plan to continue the series. Robby's character isn't as well fleshed out as it could have been, but this is just a first novel, so I'll expect more as the series progresses. Highly recommended, especially to readers who enjoy a good, old-fashioned murder mystery in the British country house setting."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"Demetra has written the most lucid indepth description of how the goddess archetypes work in the individual's chart. This is an essential work for any astrologer"},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"This book is an important addition to anyones library in regards to astrology. The author has researched her material very well and is a major contributor to the new knowledge astrologers need covering this area."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"How this book ever got out of print for a minute I do not know. All students of astrology need Demetra in their bookshelf and on their desk. An understanding of the asteroid goddesses is a way to add an entire new dimension to understanding the natal and other charts. Demetra understands the ladies in myth, history, and in the psyche, and she details, amazingly well, their meaning in the chart.5 stars except that I wish the other asteroids were included ... The four main goddesses are here and understanding them is enough of a project for awhile ... but I wish we'd gotten the entire sisterhood ... probably they are around here somewhere ...The great thing Demetra has done is add the presence of feminine values and concerns to the horoscope. Supporting the Moon, the asteroid goddesses have as their interest, relationship, hearth, romance, adventure, protection, nurture. No natal chart should be without them."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"I REALLY liked this book EXCEPT for the fact that the information on the minor asteroids was disappointingly skimpy. The author provided an excellent amount of information about the major asteroids, and so it was surprising to see how little information was given on the minor asteroids. If the author did not have enough information yet about the minor asteroids, I would rather she had left out the &quot;junk&quot; and had a thinner (and less expensive) volume. By &quot;junk&quot;, I'm referring to the pages and pages of celebrities' asteroid placements. The endless lists about celebrities added nothing to the reader's enlightenment on the subject, and I don't share our culture's fascination with celebrities. If the filler was the publisher's decision - perhaps to leave the opportunity for another book (sale), then I am very disappointed in that publisher. Publishers of astrology books usually give fair value for the price of their books. Had I seen the book (in a book store), I would have been conflicted about buying it. The topic is new and fascinating, but there is just too much filler. As it now stands, the book is really worth about $13 or $14 at most. If the author were to remove the filler and add the same quality of information about the minor asteroids as she has for the major asteroids, the book would be worth the current price."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"The asteroids in a chart help to flavor enhance what you're looking at. This is one of the best, fleshed out reference guides to the asteroids. The mythological stories behind the goddesses is crucial to understanding the meaning assigned to the individual asteroids. Further, it sets up archtypal understanding which is great when working through the issues outlined by a chart. If you are a beginning student, put this on your list but skip it until you can put into perspective the influence of asteroids vs. planetary influence. Intermediate and up... don't cheat yourself. Get the book!"},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"Although I am all too aware that there is no scientific basis for astrology, I have always regarded the subject as the best amusement one can find for any price. It is only relatively recently that I have spent much time on the subject, though, and seeing - by sheer accident - asteroids being used interested me enough to want to read more.I first picked up a quite simple yet very detailedasteroid ephemerisbut it gave little detail as to the interpretations required to make people understand asteroids and why certain astrologers use them.\\"Asteroid Goddesses\\" does an extremely valuable if less-than-perfect job of interpreting the fist four asteroids discovered - Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta. There are good interpretations for each sign that are unfortunately not available in any other astrology book, though they actually might be even more detailed. There is also useful, if often much too abstract, information on other lesser asteroids and some basic though enlightening information about the astronomical characteristics of the asteroids.There are a number of problems, though, that make recommending \\"Asteroid Goddesses\\" less easy. The worst is the tendency of the author to follow rather slavishly belief inmatriarchal prehistoryfrom the likes ofElizabeth Gould DavisandMarija Gimbutas. George states this belief quite repeatedly and it effects the whole book. It would have been better if she had offered a less biased account of Roman and Greek mythology. She also focuses too much and too broadly on questions of \\"rulership\\", though her comments are quite enlightening, especially about Vesta.On the whole, I feel I am overrating \\"Asteroid Goddesses\\" a little because of the lack of competition. If you are interested in astrology, it is worth reading, but do take care about believing every word."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"Now in a newly published and expanded edition with updated ephemerides of 16 asteroids 1930-2050, Asteroid Goddesses by Demetra George and Douglas Bloch is an impressive astrology guide emphasizing the mythology and psychology intertwined with heavenly bodies and the practice of interpreting their prophecy and guidelines. An extremely lengthy and data-filled appendix of ephemerides enhances this technical and in-depth dissection. Asteroid Goddesses is a welcome and much appreciated contribution to the Astrology and Metaphysical Studies reference shelf."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"If you're interested in asteroids and astrology, this book is a must-have. There are extended discussions of the four &quot;major&quot; asteroids, as well as briefer looks at some of the &quot;minor&quot; ones. There's also an extremely useful ephemeris of 16 asteroids, allowing readers to make this still-evolving field a part of their own practice of astrology. For George, the asteroids are a key part of a feminist astrology that incorporates a great many insights from Greek and Roman mythology. While the mythic dimension was often valuable, I sometimes felt that the asteroids had trouble standing on their own as symbols--ideally, the asteroid Ceres should be as independent of the goddess Ceres as the planet Neptune is from the god. One problem in any discussion of asteroids is that there are so many of them; it's not really clear why the 12 &quot;minor&quot; asteroids she includes are singled out. (The four &quot;major&quot; asteroids are the first four to be discovered.) She organizes the minors into male-female pairs, which is problematic; since the first asteroids were overwhelmingly named for female figures, the male asteroids tend to be rather small and obscure pieces of rock. Quibbles aside, this book is an important contribution to astrological literature and a useful addition to an astrologer's library."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"I loved this book. I am someone who believes the asteroids have a fine tuning significance on the overall chart, and this book does a splendid job of explaining the archetypes behind them. I think the brevity of the minor asteroids goes along with the significance you should place on a chart. Psyche is not going to be as profound as Saturn for most people, Demetra George did a great job covering the material in a clear, concise way. Hopefully, she will write more good stuff for us to read and learn from."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"Demetra George's contribution to the field of Astrology is monumental, to say the very least. This material came along at a time when women were actively seeking new roles in society and thus it is evidence of the divine inspiration reflected in the ancient Hermetic maxim: \\"As above, so below; As without, so within.\\" This is absolutely a seminal work of gigantic implications.This material forces the modern astrologer to grapple with complex socio-political questions. If Astrology is truly a symbolic language to describe and give meaning to our Lives, should not the stories we populate with this language reflect the populations we see in our everyday lives? The facts are that the 10 planet modern astrology which became the norm in the last century has a 4:1 bias toward male figures!After the discovery of Uranus in the Age of Enlightenment -and the subsequent pronouncement that all MEN are created equal -we had the discovery of Ceres and the other Goddesses. Ever since then, we have been collectively struggling to re-integrate the splintered Feminine via women's rights and minority rights. It has been a long slow slog, however.Believe it or not, it wasn't until the 1970's that anyone came up with the idea that men and women could actually have qualities of the opposite gender (and still be OK). In the mid-1970's Sandra Bem revolutionized psychology with a new personality theory. Instead of masculinity and femininity traits being seen in the traditional light as dichotomous endpoints of a single continuum, Bem proposed they be seen independently and that individuals may possess varying degrees of each trait regardless of biological sex.Interestingly, it was in this same decade that modern astrologers began compiling ephemeredes of the asteroid Goddesses. By the 1980's Demetra George's seminal work Asteroid Goddesses made possible in astrology the movement toward balance which psychology was struggling to embrace. If you include these 4 exiled Olympian Goddesses in the Horoscope, then you now have a 15 planet astrology (10 planets plus Chiron and the Goddesses) with somewhat more equal numbers of guys and gals (9 to 6). In other words, you have a modern astrology which reflects the reality of modern life since at least the 70's. Women have begun to achieve significantly more power and visibility, but are still clearly biased against via such factors as the glass ceiling.I can tell you as a professional astrologer that working with this material has absolutely been one of the most transformative and liberative processes I have experienced. I offer much thanksgiving to the Goddess for manifesting through Demetra and honor the many doors that she opened with this work."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"This book is amazing. It is easy to read and very helpful in understanding the role of the goddesses. It also does an outstanding job relating the goddesses with astrology."},{"Title":"Asteroid Goddesses: The Mythology, Psychology and Astrology of the Reemerging Feminine","review":"This is the book that got lots of astrologers that had not got into asteroids to take them seriously There are tables in the back to see where yours are It's clear and interesting and no one has come up with anything better on asteroids yet in the years since it was written"},{"Title":"The Veil of Isis Or. Mysteries of the Druids","review":"I must disagree with the first reviewer. This is a cool book. Comparative religion is nothing new to us today, but this is a crisper, more direct and readable account than we usually get from our wordier writers. What may bother the first reviewer is that this is more polemical/openly opinionated and less encyclopedic than many of the books in its field, and the tone of the editorial and opinion is more bitter and cutting than one may be used to. However, Reade was an able writer and interesting thinker with his own style and wrote a good read here. He was certainly very opinionated and tendentious, the type of strong but problematic influencer we usually tend to conceal. It's OK and entertaining that he sometimes goes too far; just recognize that he's doing it, you don't have to agree with every single word to enjoy it. Provocateurs fill a niche.Reade's role is similar to that of Harold Bloom: a provocateur who asks annoying questions and starts an argument that is too strong to absorb all at once, but which plants a seed in the mind. Provocateurs are important. By degrees their ideas steal in to one's questions and thoughts and have more influence than one would like to admit. They become the background to those opinions we more consciously espouse.Overall, a quick, sharp, invigorating stab at comparative religious esoterica that will get one's attention and provide a few hours of diversion and ruminating. The Veil of Isis is worth reading not because it is comprehensive or the final word, but because of the personality infused into the learning--there is no other book exactly like it. The British bias toward the Druids is unabashedly nationalistic and should be taken with a grain of salt, but it does not detract from the caliber of Reade's general learning in ancient mythology and religion. The book will still trigger interesting thoughts even if is not always right. Above all this is a good, quick, provocative read one can enjoy and use to keep the mind sharp when time and attention do not allow for the longer compendia in the field such as The Golden Bough, The Hero with 1000 Faces, etc. If you don't come to it fraught with expectations, you might enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Veil of Isis Or.

This is concluded not only from the lack of florist industry examples, but also from the repeated grammatical error &quot;...an Retail Business&quot; throughout the book and the long list of &quot;How to Start &amp; Manage...&quot; material solicited in the back cover.There is only one page referencing three professional florist organizations and a small section with sparse information on the Retail Florist potential near the end of the book. I might mention that the Business Resource Information section (for How to Start &amp; Manage a Retail Florist Business) includes &quot;How to Start a Profitable Child Care Program in Your Home&quot;, &quot;How to Start Your Own Bed and Breakfast...&quot;, and &quot;How to Start a Successful Word Processing Business in Your Home&quot;.In short, if you are need of a good Retail Florist business book, look elsewhere.

But I worked through them, leaving the tricky-looking ones till last, and now I KNOW I can make almost any block I want to. I found the instructions very clear, and the shortcuts very helpful. And I didn't waste as much fabric as I expected, even with all the trimming (my 1/4\\" seam is not anywhere near that small!)

These two main authors include a number of contributing articles by a variety of educators in the assorted fields of bilingual education, English as a second language, Foreign Languages, Sociolinguistics, and Applied Linguistics. The book is interspersed with useful statistical data that, while useful, need to be updated to make the overall information more current for the present century.While the major focus of the text is on the impressive variety of languages in New York City, its sweeping documentation of these languages, leaves a lot to be said about some of the lesser known languages, particularly those of the so-called \\"English Caribbean.\\" These tend to be treated routinely by contributors who possess, at best, second-hand information about these languages; and therefore are not as scholarly forthright as they could be, had they had in-depth interviews from adequate informants of these languages(e.g., Jamaican/Jamaican Creole, Guyanese,Lesser Antillean Creole,Garifuna), which are not always entirely mutually exclusive among themselves, or even with other better known and 'well-attested' European Languages, such as English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. It would also have been helpful, had the book contained some samples of the written forms of these languages; although it must be recognized, that many of these languages still do not possess a uniform written code and, unfortunately, often rely on their \\"standard\\" English written counterpart to represent (misrepresent?) their articulated oral expressions (very much to the chagrin of achieving phonological, lexical, or even semantic adequacy).But perhaps this, in all fairness, is beyond the scope of this book and the authors' intent.Altogether, then, the book serves as a good introduction to the subject of multilingualism, and to the wealth of its representation in \\"The Big Apple.\\" I recommend it as a worthy contribution to the knowledge-base about the extant languages of the Great Metropolis.Karl C. Folkes, Ph.D.Retired Caribbean EducatorAugust, 2009"},{"Title":"The Plot Against the Peace: A Warning to the Nation!","review":"I was a teenager when this book was published. It awakened a rage in me that has never subsided. The analogy to America's current dilemma is freightening. Written from the perspective of WWII progressives. Great short book!"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I am black and grew up in poor, rural North Carolina in the 50s. I wish I had found this book in the late 60s when I wanted so much to read, hear, and talk with whites about this kind of true life story from the south. Shirley Ann Grau brings her characters to life so calmly and clearly. She writes of emotion, yet she hides much emotion, especially through the somewhat vague and underexposed storyteller-granddaugher, Abigail Howland Mason. The writing is so beautiful, and the story is so sorrowful. I left the ending wondering, not why the rage of the small town when racial secrets are discovered, but why the deep bitterness and anger shown by Abigail and her half-black, half-white kin. Yes, the south was - and in some respects remains - a cruel and contented place, and yes, people can be coarse and ugly, but in my heart I longed to see some sign of reconciliation.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fine language and is drawn to the exploration of love and hate, conformists and nonconformists, parents and children, greed and grace from a southern perspective. Ms. Grau deserved the Pulitzer in 1965 and I am glad I found her at last in 2001."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"What a fascinating read!! The Keepers Of The House is a marvelous book that I spent an entire Sunday reading, from cover to cover. It tells the story of William Howland, a wealthy white landowner, and Margaret Carmichael, a black woman who becomes his maid, and the love that they shared, along with the choses and consequences their love would bring. The story is told by William's grandaughter Abigail Howland Mason, in a long line of Abigails. She narrates this tale, William's and Margaret's history, how they met, their children and how they lived. She also tells how years later the marriage of William and Margaret affects her life. Grau tells the story of forbidden love and revenge that is laced with racism extraordinarily well. Even though throughout the book the reader is aware that the narrator is Abigail, it doesn't hinder the essence of William and Margaret. The soul of the characters are exposed. A very well written book. I know of no better way of spending a Sunday!!"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"If you have ever read about life in the south under segretation, you have an idea about how difficult things were for African Americans and how tense things were for whites.Ms. Grau won a Pulitzer for this book in 1965 for her fascinating story of a wealthy family and the scandal that arises when the truth comes out that the founding father was married to his mulatto housekeeper and had children with her after his first wife died.The intense human emotions, the political climate, the social temper and environment is the backdrop to the amazing character development that is the heart of all of Ms Grau's work. Truly one of America's most talented writers- her work deserves notice and study. Her writing style has a lyrical quality, it flows and builds. I find it impossible to put her books down- the quality of the writing, the interesting characters and the intensity of her storytelling is irresistible.The Keepers of the House is a must for anyone who considers themselves a true bibliophile!"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This book presents a very interesting insight into Southern values, particulary those related to class and race. I sometimes found the detailed descriptive style to be boring, tedious, and much too wordy. Further, the second part of the book after the main character, Abigail Howland, marries seemed to be presented as a very overdone, too obvious parody of a rich, upscale Southern family; i.e. the ponies for the children, the butler, the pearls, the fur coat...... O.K. I've got the idea- could you tone it down? The difference in style between the somewhat understated first part and overstated second part of the book was disconcerting.But- the insight into Southern values relating to race and class was fascinating. The startling ways in which the emotions (jealousy, revenge, hypocrisy, love, hatred, loyalty, and betrayal ) of the Howland family members were portrayed made it difficult to put the book down. Also, the message of Abigail Howland's enduring strength was inspiring (even if you don't believe in &quot;getting even&quot;). All in all a good book, but stylistically sometimes difficult."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"The proses in this book are extraordinary. Grau knows the land, the plants, the animals, the smells and the sensibility of the place she writes about so the reader can feel like s/he is walking down that rural road with her as she describes a place. There is something of a touch of Annie Dillard in Grau --the way she loves the natural world. And then there are the people who inhabit the places she describes...they are shaped by but different from the land that the Howland family inhabits, owns, nurtures and has grown a part of without fanfare or intention. The Howlands are a people who know and remember their history and where they live is part of who they are. As Grau builds this story, she gently introduces us to layer upon layer of the complex mix out of which racism grew and festered and which distorted the world, so that our narrator eventually ends up in the fetal position on the floor trying to fend off, alone the ugliness of a racist society full of people who use each other ruthlessly...a society that turns the narrator herself into a less than perfect character. This is a pulls-no-punches story. It is the kind of book people ought to talk about after they read. It is full of who we are as a nation-and it could help us find our way out of the mess we've made for ourselves."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I saw this book advertised and picked it up from the library. I cannot put the book down! I miss the characters so very much when I'm away from the book - my husband must think I'm insane! Now I have put this on my wish list as I need to purchase it to have for my daughter to read when she's old enough (she's only 3!). By all means get a hold of this book."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I strongly recommend this book. There are some characters in literature that I find admirable and this book contains several of them. The central characters in this book show great strength and resiliency. The story covers several generations, so it requires a bit of patience on the part of the reader. At one point, I briefly felt that the story was dragging a bit. The ending, however, makes it well worth the read. It is a very thought-provoking book. It certainly deserves the acclaim it has received."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This book won a Pulitzer Prize, so one expects fine writing. But would a book about race in the South written more than 40 years ago --- at the time of the I Have a Dream Speech --- seem like more than an historical relic today? With Keepers of the House, the answer is definitely yes.To begin with, Grau's spare, strong prose collects no cobwebs. It reads hard and clear 40 years later and will do so 100 years later. At the same time, she spins out her generational tale languidly and enigmatically. A relatively unimportant event (plot wise) can receive multipage treatment, and a critical event a few sentences. The pacing keeps the reader on her toes.Moreover, though race pervades every portion of the book, it is not a story just about race. It covers much more: love, loss, parent-child relations; male-female relations (almost protofeminist at points); the rural south; whiskey manufacture; coming of age . . . there is a lot in here to grab the heart and the mind, much more than its statement about the destructive power of racial hypocrisy.On the negative side, in its treatment of mixed race offspring and racial passing, the racist caricature of the \\"tragic mulatto\\" makes an appearance. (Check out this link if you are not familiar with the myth of the Tragic Mulatto: www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/mulatto). Although the book twists the traditional myth by, apparently, suggesting passing as the better course --- the characters who are set up to pass and stray from that path are condemned for it --- the message that racial mixing leads to tragedy comes through, albeit with the author's regrets.That treatment certainly makes the book anachronistic as a \\"progressive viewpoint,\\" and would understandbly play a role in its lack of prominence today. I would not prescribe it for a high school curriculum. It did not \\"spoil\\" the book for me, however, for two reasons.First, while I \\"rooted\\" for the narrator and cheered for her during times of violent confrontation, I didn't really like her, so that her beliefs came across much less as the message of the book. Instead, she is just another flawed character of the time. Those beliefs are part, but only a part, of what one doesn't like about her. I don't know if she seemed more of a straightforward heroine when the book was written, but she certainly doesn't now.Second, the core of the book is really the love story between the narrator's Grandfather and his housekeeper --- the interracial connection that drives the entire tale. The depiction of that relationship, far from perfect or idealized (though not portrayed either as the product of rape or powerlessness which would have been a real, but different, story) rang so true and was set out with such acceptance that, for me at least, it excused some of the bumps.Finally, I should add that, although the story builds slowly, it does build. By the last quarter or so, I was in \\"can't put it down\\" mode."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I read The Keepers of the House years ago (found it in a used book store), loaned it out and never got it back. I have been looking for it ever since and just found it on the Internet. I am so excited! It is a treasure for the lover of books about the South. It has been a long time since I read it but I can still smell the wet leaves at the spring. I am looking forward to reading it and savoring it all over again. If anyone hasn't read it, take it from me: It is a wonderfrul experience."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"family.privilege.death.revenge.Everything has its season. The book of Ecclesiastes explains \\"seasons\\" well which may explain why Grau opened the story and picked out the title from Ecclesiastes 12:3-5. At its very core The Keepers of the House is a story of forbidden love. William Howland was from a family of privileged white land owners who owned most of the county. While returning from a three day swamp journey to locate a whiskey still, William comes upon Margaret Carmicheal a large richly hued Black woman. Margaret is an orphan left with relatives but she spends most of her time alone. Alone and washing clothes is how William Howland found her that day when he walked out of the swamp. They spent the rest of their lives together.William and Margaret had three children together. William's first marriage had produced a daughter, Abigail, whose mother died. Abigail returned to the Howland home after a troubled marriage with her own young daughter, Abigail, our narrator. William and Margaret had that strong, understanding kind of love that didn't require much talking. Margaret and William's children Robert, Nina, and Christine were all sent away when they got of age to \\"pass\\" in northern cities. There was little to no communication from them. Life went on. Abigail married, John Tolliver, and had her own children. They remained on the Howland land. Her husband launched a successful political career built on segregation principles. John Tolliver thought his segregation rhetoric would go no further than the confines of the White Citizen's Councils he spoke to but it seeped out. His rhetoric caused the past to walk right up to their front door.The women characters within this novel stood out the most. They were strong when it mattered but their weaknesses cripppled them. They loved hard and gave up too easy. They were vengeful.The Keepers of the House read like the author was trying to put a story together and not a finished product. Grau can craft a landscape and make you feel like you are standing there but her characters never connected. I didn't feel like the story began until the last hundred pages. The author took us through 40years of wilderness to get to a promised land that was around the corner. I wanted the ending to be great since I had sluggishly made my way through such a dull narrative. The ending as well as the entire novel was an extreme disappointment"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I loved this book! It's about the family that has this house in the deep south and about their lives. There are some racial issues though the family is white. The woman who inheritis the house at the end of the story gets the BEST revenge! It's a wonderfully written book which I fell into and was so sorry to see end."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"So much of this book keeps coming back to mind and I chew on the meaning or the motivation for the character. Good read."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"The Keeper of the House is a book about the South After the Civil War but during the time of segregation. It covers the lives of the Howland Family, mostly William, Abigail and Margaret (William's Negro wife who was not officially recognized as a Howland). The Howlands and their eccentric ways (like ordering newspapers from the North and marrying foreigners) lead to some interesting situations. As the story is told by each of the three main characters, it covers the life of William and Margaret. Abigail, having had her fair share of difficulties, finishes the story as an adult.My Thoughts on the BookWhile I enjoyed the book, I only gave it three stars because there were a few things that bothered me. For one thing, the chapters were really long. When I'm reading, I need a place to rest my eyes and I didn't find that in this book. That made it much more difficult for me to concentrate and/or find a stopping point.The style of writing was what I consider heavy in that I sometimes had to read a sentence several times before I could move on. I considered this to be more literary and not a smooth flowing story. It really wasn't my style of book. Besides the heaviness, I thought the book was well written. The characters were developed nicely and you really got a peek into their minds. It was actually like sitting by Grandpa, listening to him telling the stories of his youth. He keeps talking and talking, barely taking a breath.The relationship between William and Margaret was odd to say the least but it seemed to work for the story. Abigail was eccentric in her own way before and after she left to go away to school. I would have to say she was probably my favorite character, particularly at the end.From a Christian perspectiveThere really isn't much to say from a Christian perspective. This was not Christian fiction at all, there was very little mention of God, and when it was it was as an afterthought. There were implied instances of extramarital sex (I don't recall the book mentioning when the two characters were married but it turns out they were), however it was not graphic. Towards the end there is a sad act of senseless violence but again it was not graphic.I would recommend this book for those who like Literary fiction. It reads similar to those types of books."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Shirley Ann Grau returns to a literary theme that has characterized much of southern literature for the last eighty years or so: the legacy of slavery and how this is manifested in the daily life of the American South. Often the literature (principally by white authors) that has emerged deals with a dismaying society created by history, resentment, prejudice and ignorance, and is usually handled with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Things are simply described in black and white with shades of gray almost invisible. It is only with authors such as Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and Flannery O'Connor that this society is shown in a more muted, as well as more complex, light. As I began reading this novel, I was thinking that Grau might fit this mold; however, by the book's end I was left with one main reaction: this book could have been so much more.The novel is a generational history of the Howland family, a family that has occupied the same land in south central Alabama (the exact location of the novel is never revealed but all the clues point to this location) from the early nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth. The family suffers through Indian raids and the destructiveness of the Civil War and Reconstruction, but manages, by sheer will and labor, to accumulate wealth and become the most important family of the area. It is on the penultimate generation that Grau focuses: Abigail, the granddaughter of the last of a long line of William Howlands. Abigail's mother (she is also named Abigail) dies when the girl is in her early teens and is raised by her grandfather and Margaret Carmichael, a mulatto housekeeper who has three children by Abigail's grandfather. In a trick of genetics, all three of Margaret's children are born white (except to the eyes of Southern whites who have, in Abigail's words, a \\"talent\\" for spotting signs of Negro blood). You would think that all the ingredients for a mesmerizing story would be at hand for Grau to create a world that would allow her to deal with such important themes as the interactions of a racially mixed family unit within the confines established by white southern traditon.Unfortunately, this is only hinted at and instead Grau spins out a narrative that is replete with political intrigue, violence and revenge that leaves the reader reeling a bit from the unbelievable chain of events that brings the story to a close. She almost completely ignores the loving relationship of her grandfather and Margaret and instead focuses on the difficulties that Margaret's children create in Abigail's life, all of which come across as a bit trivial and quite unconvincing. Grau definitely has talent, and her narrative is told in a very conversational tone, her southern accent almost palpable to the reader. Often the novel meanders (the overly long description of William Howland's search for an illegal still is one such example) and I wish that she could have given her story more focus, and not given in to the impulse to be a bit sensational."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This book was so real, its people and environments so brilliantly vivid I was captivated from start to finish. This is a breathtaking sorrowful story."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I just finished this book and really enjoyed it. It took me while to decide if I liked it or not. In the end, I decided that I did. It was really quite a satisfying read and a great story. Though somewhat bleak, I felt it was a true testament to family ties and bonds. I walked away with a real sense of history and rootedness. It's just too bad it had to be accompanied with so much bitterness and revenge. I would recommend this one to anyone who likes Southern stories."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"A story dealing with racism: several generations of the Howland family in the south from around the Civil War period to what seems to be the early 1950s - grandfather loves and bears several children with a back woman - the effects this has on the family.I was amazed this was a Pulitzer prize winner (1965). The writing style is easy and flows much like a light conversation, but it wasn't nearly as descriptive (except for plants and trees) or as powerful a story as I would have expected. I've read many in the same vein that were much better. I wanted more about the characters, and less about the trees and the sky. I didn't feel like I really knew or was connected to most of the characters (except Abigail jr.)...too much space was spent on sentence after sentence of describing peripheral incidents that didn't add much to the story. I did feel like I was getting an accurate birds eye view of the prejudices of the middle to upper white class of the 50s, but I would have liked to have heard the characters speak from their heart...and I couldn't hear it. It felt like a light dusting over of a story, nothing to get your teeth into. I enjoyed the sections of the book that delved more into the intimate parts of the characters or their daily lives, but those sections didn't go deep enough long enough and I finished the book a little disappointed."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I read this book because it won a Pulitzer Prize. That is what brought me to it. I would find myself liking passages at one moment and then not liking the book further along...only to have the cycle repeat itself. The prose, wasn't particularly poignant or poetic...two characteristics that for me make a book truly great and memorable. The storyline is what kept me reading... it was refreshing and for the time period in which the book was published, decidedly relevant. Three characters were given a voice beginning and ending with Abigail. Abigail always seemed like a vague child and an even vaguer woman... I was glad to see the novel end the way it did. Though perhaps it was a bit over the top... at least it would have been in &quot;real&quot; life. I am leaving the book wishing there had been a little more depth to the characters, but also eager to discuss the myriad details that held the book together and struck me as the most interesting."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I've read a few fictions about the south and the black trials.

He picked himself a likely spot and started to raise a house and a family. Over the next century or so, other people moved into Wade County and the boat landing grew into Madison City.Over the generations, the family property was always owned by a William Howland. When the William Howland of the Civil War generation died in the Wilderness, the property passed to a brother who dutifully named his heir William. When the William Howland of the First World War Era was called off to war, he never got beyond New Orleans, where the Flu almost killed him. He was the next to last William Howland.Now this William had married and brought his bride back to the family home. She bore him a daughter named Abigail and later a son, named William, of course, but caught a childbirth fever, passed away, and was laid in the family tomb. A year later the boy child was also laid to rest beside her.By the time of the Depression, the Howlands dominated Wade County. William could afford to send Abigail off to a good school, where she fell in love with an Englishman who taught literature and poetry. They were married and had a girl child, also named Abigail. However, the husband refused to stay on the sidelines when World War II started and returned to England to join the fight. Neither Abigail ever saw him again. Later, Abigail contracted tuberculosis and was taken out West to a sanitarium, but to no avail.Shortly after the elder Abigail's wedding, William took a trip into the swamp, fulfilling a foolish bet about finding a moonshine still. After discovering the still, he returned through New Church, a black settlement, mostly descended from the blacks freed by Andy Jackson after the Battle of New Orleans. These freejacks, as they were called, kept to themselves mostly, although they added a little Choctaw blood over the years. When William stopped of at a old baptismal font to get water, he noticed a young black girl washing clothes in the stream. Feeling a need for additional help around the place, he offered her a job if she wanted it. The next day she showed up at his house and took over the odd jobs that had been neglected by the cook.Margaret had ideas of her own. After all, she had walked twenty miles for this job and she admired the look of William Howland. That evening, while William was noisily taking off his boots, Margaret showed up to help and then stayed the night. She bore him five children, three of which lived.Everybody in the county soon knew about William's mistress. Abigail the younger grew up with it and didn't think it so strange. In fact, both Abigails rather liked Margaret. Everything was working out all right as they usually do in those small Southern towns, until Abigail the younger married a politician.This story has some of ambiance of William Faulkner, but much of that goes with the territory. The author gives the sights and smells and sounds of that country so that you feel that you are part of the story. Everything from Alabama country marriages and funerals to the flowers and coon hunts comes alive around you.The story is told from the point of view of William, Margaret and the Abigails. It covers the well-to-do Howlands and the poor-as-dirt Carmichaels, with dozens of others playing their part. It also has some biting commentary about Alabama politics and local prejudices. The ending is bitter, but not without hope.Highly recommended to anyone enjoys stories of the Old South or even who missed the years prior to integration.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Sometimes you come across a book that reminds you why you love your favorite genre. From me, the genre is literary fiction and for me The Keepers of The House is one of those books that reminds me why I am a literary fiction reader.The synopsis of the book is a little misleading. Yes, it is a story of family and tradition but the racial injustice angle is not a major issue. It's more like a reflection of the time and location. This novel spans two generation of the Howland family and their history after they settled in Alabama. The synopsis makes it seem that Abigail and the Howlands are mixed-race. They are not all of the Howlands (including Abigail) are white, there is small a branch of the family that is mixed race and their role in the story is not prominent until the end.The Keeper of The House starts off the the narrator, Abigail, reflecting on how her and her children ended up where they are. To fully understand the Howland family and the county the helped found. She takes the readers on a journey through her colorful and rich family history. A large portion of the story focuses on her grandfather, William Howland, and how he came to father three children by his mistress, Margaret who is black. The second part of the story is Abigail telling the reader about how her grandfather's past ends up effecting her present and the future of herself, her marriage and her children.Grau picked the prefect narrator in Abigail. Her voice was authentic. It was interesting to see how she developed as a person as the time pasted. I just can't say enough about her. I just really liked her and wanted to see how she got to the place in her life she was in when she was introduced in the first chapter. All the characters (good and bad) were well thought out and presented. Now of them were flat. They all had good qualities and bad.The Keepers of The House reminded me a lot of John Steinbeck's East of Eden (which I loved). The difference being that The Keeper of The House is a much smaller book, without all the details that Steinbeck's East of Eden had. But they were both tales of family history, how the started, and how they developed.*****I received this book from the published in exchange for an honest review***"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Enjoyed this book a lot . It gave you insight of how it was in the south back then . The details provided really let you invision what was happening."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"What did I like about this book? Everything.The plot was like a road that ran thru the lives of this family. There were turns and twists. It kept you moving forward to see where the family would end. You could feel things building without the author having to force feed it to you.The characters were well developed and multi-dimensional. Abigail was strong and smart, but had her own insecurities. I like when I can understand the decisions the characters make. I understood Abigail's perspective when she dealt with her grandfather's mixed race children, her husband, even the town's people.The language of the story helped to establish the setting. I am from Louisiana, so I love when writers are able to make me feel the humid, languid beauty of the south.I strongly recommend that anyone who wants a good read, purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"The Keepers of the House by Shirley Ann Grau is a hauntingly beautiful book that earned Grau a Pulitzer Prize in 1965. I'm surprised that this novel isn't more well-known as it would make a wonderful book club selection.Following seven generations of Howlands, The Keepers of the House is told mostly through the eyes of Abigail Howland Mason Tolliver. The original William Howland settled in the area after fighting in the Battle of New Orleans with Andrew Jackson. Abigail's grandfather, another William Howland, is a hard-working and prosperous farmer who owns much of the town. His young wife died soon after childbirth and he never remarried, despite the best efforts of his friends and family. When he was 48, he comes across a 17-year old black girl, Margaret Carmichael, and he invites her to work for him. She becomes his mistress and they have three children together. At first, the town seems to know and accept William's black children (who can pass for white). But the rules change when Abigail's husband runs for public office. This sets off a chain of events that will change Abigail's life, as well as the whole future of the town.Grau writes eloquently in The Keepers, when through both black and white eyes. Abigail thinks about her ancestors \\"They are dead, all of them. I am caught and tangled around by their doings. It is as if their lives left a weaving of invisible threads in the air of this house, of this town, of this county. And I stumbled and fell into them.\\" Margaret describes the death and funeral for her great-grandmother. The oldest women \\"Now they were sitting straight-backed in those close-packed rows, hands folded across their chests, rocking their bodies back and forth from the waist, mourning. It was a descending long nasal wail, repeated over and over again, each one exactly like the one before. It was not a hymn. It had no tune; it did not even have a rhythm. No two voices were together. It was only a raggedly picket line of sound to keep the evil spirits away from the dead.\\"For as much as I loved The Keepers of the House, I found that the ending was very unsettling. Without giving away the plot, I was disturbed by the way that Abigail treated Margaret's children and wonder if perhaps the ending might have been different if it was written today. But that ending is what makes this book so haunting and I found that I could not get The Keepers of the House out of my mind."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This was a delicious book - maybe because I read it right after finishing a book that I despised (Robert Cormier's The Chocolate War). Once I started reading, I couldn't put this book down until I finished it.This story is about the forbidden love between William Howland, a wealthy white landowner, and Margaret Carmichael, his black maid, in a small southern town at a time when segregation attempted to keep races separated.I'm a Melungeon (tri-racial heritage) from a predominately white area in WV - and while that's not the south, we do have some lingering confederate sympathizers. This is one of those stories that made me think of my Grandpa, who constantly worried about my school finding out about our heritage and the consequences it could have on my life. I wish I would've found this book fourteen years ago, so I could've read it with him. He, unfortunately, grew up in a world where very few writers broached such topics and had a hard time getting me to understand his fear. This book would have illustrated his point perfectly."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Set in the South this well-crafted book tells story of small town living and scandal. Intimately drawn characters, careful details of daily living, and a severe revenge put it on my list of recommended books."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"Having read this book, I think I have a better understanding of race relations in the South, particularly in the middle of this century. All the characters were fully developed, and all of the complexities and subtleties of a family with half black siblings, and the aftermath of that discovery, were handled convincingly. What I did not believe was that one of the siblings who went north and passed for white would risk it all by returning south on a well-publicized visit. Otherwise, I would have given the novel a &quot;9&quot;."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"There are opposing viewpoints about this novel. It won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1965. The Klan burned a cross on the author's front lawn after it was published. There is always some truth in fiction, as indicated by the recent revelations about a late U.S. Senator from a southern state, and the discussions about the mistress of President Thomas Jefferson.A prominant white widower, during times of racial segregation, has an affair with a black housekeeper producing three children who are raised with his grand-daughter until they are old enough to send to private boarding schools in the north. He provides for them financially, but does not acknowledge them publicly, although it is well known among the family and others.His grand-daughter marries a man with political aspirations who joins the Klan to further his career. Things go along fine, but the truth will out. People seeking vengence of whatever kind forget where their fortunes lie. And people should remember who owns the county and who pays the bills before throwing stones."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"This book was really really nice! I think going overboard with flattery and complements would not do this book justice. There are so many books out there on race, but they seem so blah, blah, blah is a good way to put it. Keepers of the House has a no-holds-bar cutting truth in the end that I like -- that unknown, unbearable truth that I have not seen in other books which try to tackle the subject of race, politics and interracial marriage. This book and Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird really do go hand in hand. Bravo Shirley!"},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"I liked the southern history so vividly described that you can see through somone else's eyes.

I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"As a whole, I enjoyed this book very much. It spanned several generations that were each interesting and complicated. All the way up to the last few pages, I was engrossed in the story line and the regional history of the South, especially the last characters ties to Southern politics before civil rights. My only disappointment was the way it ended. It left me wanting more information, and wondering what would happen to Abigail. Otherwise, it was a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Keepers of the House","review":"The Keepers of the House is a great book about the life of African Americans and the prejudices they have to face even in relatively modern times.

It was everything that i liked to read about and very interesting and i would recommend it to everyone who likes to read about the old south."},{"Title":"Neutral War: A Novel of Soul-Chilling Barter, Bioterror, and High-Stakes International Poker","review":"Neutral War is an undetached, unsympathtic, in your face story of the relationship between two men of differing cultures in the years before and during World War II. While I found the pace rather slow and the author seemed entrenched in conveying every fact he discovered it still didn't dispell the honesty, and truth which drips from every word.While I would have sincerly liked to have read more of the (fictional??) relationship between the Swedish narrator and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto since this clash of cultures was intelligent and at times humorous, Gold seems bent on pressing us with facts, facts, and more facts.Is there something wrong with this...not in my book. It was an inspiring and candid look at the protocol of war. It practically proves the adage 'those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it.'Neutral War is 'very' much a book for OUR times and should not be overlooked for thinner, fluffier, more cozy reads."},{"Title":"My Partner-In-Law: The Life and Times of George Morton Levy","review":"Great book about a great man.My Father used to work for him.I thoroughly enjoyed reading about his early lifeand law career.

The recipes are nothing to write home about, some of the scenting suggestions are plain awful, and the authors claim that those brown spots on your olive oil soap are supposed to be there (for the record, they're not; those brown spots are rancid spots!). This book gives absolutely NO information on sap values for various oils and fats, it doesn't explain lye discounting or superfatting, and it was clearly written by people with no background in even basic science.

However, when I attempted the goats milk soap (basic recipe 5) it was a disaster! The directions caution you about adding the lye to the goats milk...first it will be cloudy, then tan and you need to watch it carefully so you add to the oils before it turns orange. Well, my milk was tepid as the directions state but as I slowly added the lye, the mixture turned orange immediately...no cloudy stage and no tan stage! I poured it into the oils anyway following their instruction all the way..and the whole mess seperated as soon as it was poured into the mold...a complete waste.Stubborn as I am, I tried the recipe on page 64, &quot;Goats Milk and YLang Ylang&quot;, hoping to try again and this time it turned yellow immediatly as I added the lye. Again, I poured it anyway, no separation occured and the soap seems fine, but will have an expert friend look at it just to be safe.The problem seems to be that the book does not tell you that goats milk needs to be completely or partially frozen to avoid burning it when the lye is added.I will say it is a beautiful book, and will try the other recipes with hopes of better success."},{"Title":"Handmade Soap: Recipes For Crafting Soap At Home ( Country Living)","review":"Out of all the \\"popular\\" soap books, this was one of the first I bought and the one I use the most! I have made most of the recipes in this book and haven't had a failed batch yet, either hand stirred or with a stick blender. I was a beginner and now everyone wants my soaps because they are mild & natural, smell so \\"real\\" and are simply wonderful. Over the years I have become more sensitive to chemicals and \\"fake\\" smells. I have solved that problem by making and using these natural soaps for myself and my family.As with any new endevor, I researched as much as I could, and I run ALL recipes through a lye calculator which can be found for free on the web. I personally like the amount of essential oils used because you can still smell them after the soap has cured.If you want a soapmaking book, written by an awesome soapmaker, and don't want to spend hours being put to sleep by scientific chemical equations, then get this book and prepare to change your life forever!"},{"Title":"Handmade Soap: Recipes For Crafting Soap At Home ( Country Living)","review":"This beautifully illustrated book is an excellent resource for both the beginner and the experienced soapmaker.

He's pretty off on his lye calculations for a few of the recipes too."},{"Title":"Handmade Soap: Recipes For Crafting Soap At Home ( Country Living)","review":"This book is a pretty good reference for a beginner soap maker. It covers three soap-making processes: cold process, hand (or French) milling (a.k.a. rebatching), and melt and pour.This book has:1. Sufficient detail for me, a complete novice, to have made a successful batch of cold process soap my first time. (I was somewhat supplemented by internet searches of soap making.)2. A helpful, though not complete, troubleshooting section for cold-process soap.3. Wonderfully scented recipes!4. Blurbs about the properties of various essential oils, exfoliants, and other additives. These are not comprehensive, but are sufficient to get you started.5. A section on the properties of various oils.6. Seven basic (no additives) cold-process recipes that can be used with handmilling, along with basic properties of each.7. Alot of cold-process recipes, along with some hand-milling recipes and ideas.8. Ideas and recipes for herb-infused oils, making your own extracts, bath oils, bath teas, shampoo, shower gel, hair rinses, laundry and dishwashing soap.It LACKS:1. Hand-milling information. I'm having alot of trouble with it and can't find any answers! It would be great to have a troubleshooting section for handmilled soap.2. Melt-and-pour information. If you need ideas for making melt-and-pour soap, how to embed objects, how to layer, etc., this is not the book to turn to.3. A guide for developing your own soap recipes -- how to calculate lye/fats ratios, etc. And I wish the section on the properties of oils was a bit more extensive.4. Recipes for lotions, body butters, bath salts and bath fizzies, in this book.Another thing I did not like about the book is that it has some unrealistic expectations about one's soap-making budget. I'd've loved to see one (or a few) \\"grocery store\\" recipes, that can be made from oils one can easily find in any grocery store.So, in short, this book would be a useful addition to a soap-making library, but it should probably not be your only reference."},{"Title":"Handmade Soap: Recipes For Crafting Soap At Home ( Country Living)","review":"I used this book for my first soapmaking session.

I appreciated the chapter divisions, but wished there were more recipes for using all the basic soaps in hand-milled recipes.

It came out great. It made nice hard bars with a good lather and excellent cleaning properties. Though this is not the &quot;end all, be all&quot; of soap books, it is very good. The only caveat is that the recipes with frangrances or essential oils are a bit heavy on the nose. I recommend halving the essential oil requirements to achive a soap that isn't overpowering. This is a book for the beginner and is not technichal in nature. Professional soapmakers should look elswhere for comprhensive lists of what can go wrong and how to fix it. Most recipes here make a two to three pound batch, which hardly qualifies as huge quantities.

Visually, I thought the book was beautiful; however, it's not one I'd recommend to beginners who really need to understand the process as well as a more thorough run-down of pitfalls and dangers. I am also very concerned with safety for the soap maker and the end-user. I thought that in reviewing the recipes, some of them seemed lye excessive. Also, excessive in the amounts of pure essential oils he recommends per each batch. They may smell wonderful but many of us know the potential dangers of irritation and sensitization. Experienced soap makers could play with his recipes and make proper adjustments for safety and quality; however, a beginner won't know any better.

I look through other soap making books and am so dismayed by the horrible, dry looking soaps they present. I tend to quickly look through these other books for information, but I don't buy. The soaps in this Country Living book come out nicely though. I have made probably half the recipes in the book and have been very pleased. However, I have had to do much of my learning on the internet and from asking questions of other soapers. There is no information on colorants or saponification values included in this book. An encyclopedia of soap making it is not; but if a person's looking for reliable, nice looking, body friendly soap recipes, this is a good book. There are also no recipes using the more commonly found fats such as hydrogenated soybean oil, canola, safflower, lard, etc. Coconut, palm, olive, and castor oils are the most commonly used oils in this book.One thing not mentioned in the book is how helpful a hand blender is. The author recommends hand stirring the fat/lye mixture to trace, but it's so much quicker with a hand blender like the Braun. Who wants to be standing over a lye/water/fat mixture longer than they have to? ....So this is a book I'd recommend. Have fun but plan on checking out other sources for answers to questions you will have as your soaping continues.

I am not as fond of the rebatched recipes as those using the cold process method, and have been happiest when making the later. I can recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Handmade Soap: Recipes For Crafting Soap At Home ( Country Living)","review":"I am a very novice soap maker and while the recipes in the book are great when they work, there is very little explanation for when they don't.

Other books I've looked at have said to be cautios, but didn't really tell me how to go about it. This book put all my fears aside, and also listed the exact equipment. After researching through tons of soap books, I have found this book to be the most helpful, and the best book for beginning soapmakers; however, it is also good for advanced soapmakers, as it offers a wide variety of recipes and techniques"},{"Title":"Handmade Soap: Recipes For Crafting Soap At Home ( Country Living)","review":"Defintely some very nice pictures that would lure you into buying this book. I have the following comments: (1) The information given about soapmaking in this book is very superficial. Even worse, there is definitely some wrong info! For example, the book said that pure castile soap (olive-oil based) will have brown-orange spots on them as they cure. In my experience this only happens when one doesn't mix the lye/oil solution enough, or when the oil calculation is wrong and the orange spots indicite areas of rancid oil. (2) All the recipes in this book is lye-heavy! And worse yet, they don't tell you in the book how to check whether a recipe is lye-heavy (unsafe). (3) The recipes in this book also call for some outrageous amounts of essential oil. Essential oils have their beneficial properties. Remember these are really small molecular substances and can be easily absorbed into the body, and in excess can act just like drugs being overdosed! If you check any other reference books on essential oils, you will find that the quantity of the essnetial oils used in these recipes is over and above the limit. Dangerous! (4) There is also a lack of information as to how to design your own recipe and how to trouble-shoot if you have a problem. The same can be said about information on the different properties of oils--not enough info! So basically, you can only follow their dangerous recipes if you buy this book, but can't creat your own or even check if they are right.If you only care for nice pictures, and nothing else, this book is for you. But if you really want to make soap, I'd recommend &quot;Essnetially Soap&quot; by Robert McDaniel (or Dr. Bob)."},{"Title":"Handmade Soap: Recipes For Crafting Soap At Home ( Country Living)","review":"This is the book that taught me to make cold process soap.

However, when I attempted the goats milk soap (basic recipe 5) it was a disaster! The directions caution you about adding the lye to the goats milk...first it will be cloudy, then tan and you need to watch it carefully so you add to the oils before it turns orange. Well, my milk was tepid as the directions state but as I slowly added the lye, the mixture turned orange immediately...no cloudy stage and no tan stage! I poured it into the oils anyway following their instruction all the way..and the whole mess seperated as soon as it was poured into the mold...a complete waste.Stubborn as I am, I tried the recipe on page 64, \\"Goats Milk and YLang Ylang\\", hoping to try again and this time it turned yellow immediatly as I added the lye. Again, I poured it anyway, no separation occured and the soap seems fine, but will have an expert friend look at it just to be safe.The problem seems to be that the book does not tell you that goats milk needs to be completely or partially frozen to avoid burning it when the lye is added.I will say it is a beautiful book, and will try the other recipes with hopes of better success."},{"Title":"GOING DEEPER WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT","review":"This is an outstanding book.

There's a lot more action than the \\"Blacklight\\" book, more SEALs, a very tense climax, and a nice twist at the end.The only kind of downside I had with it was the romantic subplot with the Princess. Granted, it was a very very small portion of the book and it wasn't sappy or melodramatic like a romance novel or anything, but it seemed just a little out of place.The other bad part about it is that it's the last of the series. :( I really really wish Mike Murray would write more books featuring Getts and/or Peach. Granted, the guys are getting a little older now, but go back in time to some of their earlier missions, I don't care!"},{"Title":"Navy Seals 3: Green Solitaire","review":"First let me say, I admire Mr. Murray's books.I have only one nitpick.

So we hope they'll be worth the money. But the question is: are they really? What makes the book so great based on the fact that it was edited a thousand times and was even written mostly to make money?Not this book. The writer is unquestionable very much in touch with the story, and the story proves itself to be worth the time. Just look at the back: a timeline going from a thousand years ago to hundreds of years from now. That takes some thinking. I was also impressed with the numerous quotes before chapters by writers like Edgar Ellen Poe.So, give it a chance and check out this adventurous masterpiece. And don't be alarmed by a few typos in the text since this book wasn't brought to you through the corporate giants like Penguin Putnam and Simon books. Instead of having to go through a number of people evaluating whether this person's message was, well, \\"important\\" enough to be shared with the world, it was all done by Mr. Valentine's hard work and dedication.

But I know how well MB can put a story together, how touchingly real, and so I kept going. And truth be told it was an excellent story, I suppose. But I read a love story for warmth and passion. The overwhelming stiffness here, the self-denial, the inability for the heroine to acknowledge truth vs duty EVEN to HERSELF just left me empty. And OH LORD the sex scenes just made me cringe.Again, it is NOT the author's skill but my personal taste. If anything she did TOO well here. If one can appreciate that utter Stepford-ness and moral imprisonment of the Victorian era you will no doubt appreciate this story. If however you read romances for just that, romance & warmth & passion, I would suggest one of the other Balogh novels...Truly or Heartless or Longing."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"This is an incredible book: the first time I read it I couldn'tbear to put it down.Rebecca had married Julian, David's honorarybrother - they'd grown up together on David's father's estate. ButJulian was killed at war - and there's a dreadful secret there which David dares not reveal...The reader is shown the truth about the characters of the two men, but Rebecca remains ignorant...Balogh does eventually resolve this seemingly impossible situation, but not before all three main characters arrive at a better understanding of themselves and each other.As usual, Balogh's characterisations are excellent. One thing I really like about this writer is that she almost never writes a completely irredeemable character; even her villains tend to have some trace of good in them (and indeed, in some of her stories villains of previous books end up as heroes). She also does an excellent job of portraying emotions here, particularly the emotions of two characters who just have no idea how to communicate with each other.A beautiful and memorable love story."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"It reminds me in some ways of the Robert Frost poems the one about the two roads, except in Rebecca's case she was given a chance to taste what her life could have been like if she married David instead of Julian. When Julian came back it seemed to be the end of the type of life she had always craved for.The story is heart breaking in some part, as Rebecca and David were placed in a situation which they could not escape from because they were not ruthless enough to place their own happiness infront of others. The use of circumstances was wonderful and Balogh was incredibly consistent throughout the whole story."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"Tangled is a beautiful and complex love story that resonates with honesty and poignancy. I never felt I was reading about Rebecca, David and Julian; I felt as if I knew them. Balogh gives a better feeling for the Victorian period than any other writer of the genre. Rebecca leaves you feeling such sadness for what it must have been like for women in that era and David is truly the most magnificent antidote to Victorian repression. We should all have a David in our lives! Balogh does not create black and white characters. The heroine, Rebecca, is flawed and the villain, Julian, does have a heart and a good soul in the end. Truly a tangled, but satisfying love story."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"This is the worst historical romance I have ever read. The hero David is a pushover always taking the blame for his foster brother, and never standing up for himself. The heroin Rebecca is cold and heartless. And the ending is sad."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"I thought this book was really excellent because, unlike most romance novels, you actually had a real feel for what is was like to be married in that day and age. Between Rebecca's first marriage and her pre-conceived notions of what it was supposed to be like, it felt like a truly accurate portrayal of a couple, particularly one thrown together in marriage, way back when. The only real problem I had with the book was everyone's overwhelming love of Julian, who I thought was a real jerk and had little to no redeeming qualities. The end was a little too pat, as well, but overall I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"This story was painful to read...it took me a few days to finish it, instead of the usual 24 hours I spend reading a Mary Balogh book. First of all, the plot was very intense and heartbreaking. It was more than just a love triangle. I felt frustrated and annoyed by the heroine's way of thinking: old-fashioned and totally Victorian-era. (I've read about more outrageous heroines in stories set a century earlier, like Jessica Taggert in Jude Deveraux's The Raider) Anyway, it was a struggle having to read this book.The heroine, Rebecca, must've declared \\"I love Julian\\" about a hundred times throughout the entire story. It was hard to see what she saw in him, beyond her saying \\"He was my life...he was full of life, love and laughter...etc, etc.\\" I guess she fell for his lighthearted, charming nature, even though she herself was pretty intense and somber most of the time--she rarely smiled or showed joy. Such a serious young woman indeed.The hero, David, was also very intense and suffered from his own demons. But at least he had admitted to himself that he loved Rebecca (again, I kept wondering WHY). I felt his pain during the last third of the story, when he faced losing the love of his life. He had done everything to make her happy, and I truly admired him for that. The earlier sex scenes were a big disappointment, and just when it was described as being passionate and satisfying, the details were then left out.The major bummer about this story was the heroine itself. Her love and loyalty to Julian, her first husband, was quite commendable, as were her sense of honor and her lady-like dignity. But then she agreed to marry David, and after living with him for one and a half years, she still isn't in love with him? She is still willing to believe the worst? She still can't get over Julian? I wanted to shake some sense into her! She is putting David through hell and she does not even know it. She does not draw him out or help him overcome his own pain...she seems to be wrapped up in her own misery. Her sporadic shows of affection towards him felt insincere and unexpected, such as when they hugged and almost kissed at the top of the stairs towards the end of the story.In short, I just did not \\"feel the love.\\" Everything seemed one-sided. David loved Rebecca but not vice versa; Rebecca loved Julian, but he was constantly unfaithful (although there was a short section where his thoughts and feelings were disclosed, and I came to understand him better). When Rebecca said she loved Julian for the umpteenth time, I wanted to throw the book across the room, she was that repetitious.If the author had created a somewhat WARMER Rebecca, I might have enjoyed reading this book. As it was, compared to her other more passionate characters like Jane Ingleby from More Than a Mistress or talented Judith from Slightly Wicked or even brave Rachel from Slightly Sinful...well, Rebecca comes out sounding like the true epitome of those dutiful yet utterly conservative ladies from the Victorian period. (Her views about the marriage bed was so ridiculous, and I had to keep reminding myself of the time period) And the lack of communication between her and David and their inability to express their thoughts and feelings to each other made everything even more complicated. So sad, really. The plot had a lot of potential. Too bad the heroine was totally obsessed over one man..."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"This book made my heart ache for all the characters. This book did an excellent job of making you feel the despair in the situation. I disagree with the reviews that thought this book was too long - if anything, I thought that there could have been a little more character transition for Julian. But I loved it! Now I just have to try and find a copy to buy."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"I was able to find this as a used book, and was so thrilled with it.Tangled is an excellent title, because the story is so convoluted and thought provoking.It has a lot of agony, but I like heart-wrenching situations like these.It is not set in the Regency period, which was somewhat refreshing to me.Tangled is now my favorite of Balogh's novels and I was up late into the night to finish it, being riveted by what would happen next.I would urge anyone to get this book and give it a try."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"Although this was written with Mary Balogh's usual competence, it is not one of her better books. The hero, David, has taken the blame for his cousin Julian's misdeeds for most of his life. This led directly to the heroine, Rebecca, believing that Julian was a great guy and marrying him, while David, who adored her, was left on the sidelines and despised by the virtuous Rebecca. Julian and David go off to war, where Julian's escapades continue. By the time David returns home a couple of years later, wounded and guilt-ridden, Julian is constantly on his mind. But Julian is dead. Rebecca is still in mourning and very much at loose ends. David takes a chance - would Rebecca marry him? Circumstances lead her to agree, and they gradually come to a cautious understanding, which is abruptly shattered. When Julian returns years later, there is quite a mess to sort out, including what to do with the child of David and Rebecca's marriage. But many of the misunderstandings could have been cleared if either Rebecca or David had tried to communicate with each other, or if David had simply stopped being the scapegoat for Julian. I suppose Ms. Balogh was making a point about the restrictions of the Victorian era, but the book is entirely too grim, Rebecca is too prim, and when Julian offers her a way out of her dilemma, she refuses to accept it, which results in yet another tragedy. This book is a definite tear-jerker; I've cried each time I've read it. But Ms. Balogh has written many books of far better quality. This is a decent read, but not more. With Ms. Balogh, I'd advise holding out for more - she's capable of delivering it."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"This is an extremely heartwrenching novel by Balogh: the way she writes the heroine torn by her feelings for two very different men is just so well done. Balogh shows Rebecca's unwilling attraction to David extremely well. In the beginning she dislikes him (for reasons which seemed to be valid at the time, but all is not what it seems), but her feelings change gradually, in a way she does not even herself notice. Rebecca and David's inability to talk to each other, while it compounds their awkward situation, is very credible in the circumstances.And, since all Balogh's characters, including minor characters, are always very well drawn, Julian is portrayed extremely sympathetically. Given his 'back-story' it would have been very easy to paint him as the villain, but Balogh avoids that temptation and shows him as the flawed but well-meaning person he seems to be.I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"To be kind, I will only say this book is tedious. Maybe the problem lies in the fact Mary Balogh's Regency Books are usually 225 pages or close to, while this endeavor stretches to 400 pages. This novel is a test of endurance for a Balogh reader.David Tavistock grew up protecting his stepbrother, Julian. David loved him, shielded him, and covered for him. David Tavistock grew up loving their mutual childhood friend, Rebecca. Rebecca grew up and married Julian. David and Julian went off to war, only David returned. He returned and married his brother's widow, Rebecca. Their marriage became a marathon of guilt. In \\"Tangled,\\" Balogh pens a story about two people who do not communicate and her story exposes the consequences.The book's setting is Victorian England, an era engrossed in straitlaced thinking. Proper young ladies were taught that the marriage bed was a duty not a pleasure, and polite people were groomed to keep their uncomfortable concerns to themselves.The opening of the novel is in the year of 1854. Balogh furnishes an uncommon Victorian setting, during and after the Crimean War. This is an area in which Mary Balogh shines, she presents history but presents it entertainingly. \\"Tangled\\" would have been an excellent novelette, but as a full-length project it is monotonous.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"Her beautiful eyes flashing with hate, Rebecca faced Lord David Tavistock. He had come back, wounded but still vibrantly, sensually alive, from the Crimean War. Julian Cardwell, her sweet, gentle bridegroom-and David's foster brother-had not. She blamed wild, reckless David for Julian's decision to enter the Queen's Guards, and for the devastating loss of her perfect young husband, whose memory even now broke her heart and filled her dreams.His blue eyes shadowed by dark secrets, David had come to claim the woman he had always loved. All his life he had protected the charming Julian, hiding the truth from Rebecca about the women Julian dallied with, the child he had fathered, the scandalous way he died. Now David offered Rebecca a life of privilege and wealth-as his wife. She wanted a marriage of convenience, but he intended to awake her deepest passions, to make her forget Julian Cardwell...and to find in his bed all the ecstasy of a man's true love."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"I like Balogh's recent books a lot, but this older one is a real downer. The ending is depressing, and it is impossible to believe the hero and heroine can justify to themselves what happens to allow them to be together."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"Mary Balogh is one of the best writers of nineteenth century characters, and this is certainly among the finest of her books.

I must say this one is my favorite 'cuz I'm sooo crazy for David. Wish every hero in every romance novel could be as terrific &amp; passionate like him. I don't find Rebecca interesting enough, she should've chosen David over Julian (one of my favorite names, by the way =P) if she could just see him clearly as the kind-hearted guy who's been in love with her since they were growing up together. She's also too skittish when it comes to lovemaking. Even when she has the baby &amp; all the wonderful things David has done for her, how could she still have split feelings when Julian showed up out of the blue ? I guess there wouldn't be much of a story if all went well early on. I agree with most of Ms Balogh avid fans out there, no one can write more poignant, touching, endearingly human heroes &amp; heroines better than her. She knows how to describe every nuance of feeling the character has to suffer for love. Pls treat yourself to this magnificent classic &amp; it'll never leave your keeper-shelf.

This has a similar sad, poignant tone as other of Balogh's works of this time. Many might find it depressing, it is definitely not a lighthearted read. The characters are tormented as with other of Balogh's books of this tone. The writing is good with often beautiful prose. One of the few historical romance I've read where the heroine is predominantly submissive with no defiance (except for one thing). This goes against most of todays historical novel's independent/fiery heroine.Although I like novels with emotional depth with tormented characters like these, this one didn't move me as much as others of Balogh's works (Balogh's The Secret Pearl being one of my favourites of hers of this tone)."},{"Title":"Tangled","review":"This is a very good book.

I won't go into the history of the whole u-boat war as this book doesn't, read the two volume history of the U-Boat war by Blair Clay Jr. for true insight.This volume covers a basic history, but unlike the usual volumes, does not contain the technical data one would expect and has a somewhat melencoly presentation of a great weapon that was never given it's opportunity to shine as a comerce raider against unarmed merchantmen. A great deal of time and photos are dedicated to bomb damage to construction yards and unfinished u-boats by US and UK bombers.The line drawings are as usual excellent, and one is somewhat disappointed by the lack of overall expertise in presentation we expect from this wonderful series.

Whilst I was already familiar with the Type VII U-Boat, this was not the case with the Type XXI - so I had to do some additional research into the vessel before embarking on this review - which, incidentally, refers to the new \\"revised\\" edition of the book produced in late 2002.As with the V1 and V2 rockets, the Type XXI U-Boat was, much needed by Germany in the closing stages of World War Two but arrived too late to save them from defeat. It was an all-electric submarine and the closest it came to serious warfare was when U-2511 - having already received the order to cease hostilities, carried out a successful mock attack on a heavily defended British Cruiser without being detected. As the book quite rightly asserts, had this weapon appeared a few years earlier, the fierce battle of the Atlantic might have had a very different outcome.Conway Maritime Press are well known for their \\"Anatomy of the Ship\\" series in which they provide the finest technical documentation for specific ships or ship types ever published. \\"The Type XXI U-Boat\\" is hard-back measuring 10\\" (wide) x 9\\" with 127 pages of detailed and factual information. This wide format allows the publishers to produce first class detailed line drawings of every aspect of the ship in a size that is easy to see and follow. All the information is right there.Commencing with a potted history of how the type XXI came into being, we are then treated to a series of \\"Tables\\" which provide us with such technical details as; Design particulars, weights, boats delivered and commissioned and what happened after the war. This is followed by a chapter entitled \\"Construction\\" in which the publishers have reproduced 10 pages of stunning historic photographs - some of which still show their post-war classification of \\"Confidential.\\" After a short chapter on the SU and CHG underwater detection equipment we are then treated to another 36 pages of historic photographs - showing almost every aspect of this type of vessel, before coming to 69 pages of detailed line drawings.And once again, the information is very technical, very detailed and, by all accounts, very accurate. Under the first main heading \\"General arrangement and external appearance\\" we have drawing after drawing showing every aspect of the Type XXI in 1944 itemising each of the slight changes made as the vessel evolved throughout the planning and design process. Not only is the entire hull shown in both elevation, plan and cross-section, there are individual close-ups showing different aspects of the bridge layout and deck gun configurations. Then everything is repeated for the internal features both longitudinally and by cross section before concluding with a close examination of the conning tower and Junkers air compressor. Finally the book includes the internal arrangements and main deck plans of the \\"Wilhelm Bauer\\" - the only Type XXI submarine to have been restored and which is on display in Bremerhaven.Like it's sister book on the Type VII U-Boat, this is not about what this or that specific vessel achieved - although they do all get a mention. As the title suggests, this is a book about the design and construction of a \\"Type\\" of ship and, yet again, I find myself congratulating both the authors and publishers for a job well done.NM"},{"Title":"The Type XXI U-Boat (Anatomy of the Ship)","review":"Technically speaking now, this is the book for the type 21. Not a lot of background and battle history, but thats not the scope of this book. It is basically a technical book describing and modeling every inch of the type 21. Could have a bit more pictures but the technical drawings are great and the explainations and descriptions of equipment and areas of the subs are excellent. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Type XXI U-Boat (Anatomy of the Ship)","review":"I bought this book to help with a cut away model of a Type XXI that I am currently building. I only have one other of the \\"Anatomy of the Ship\\" series: \\"Type VII U-Boat\\" so I didn't have any expectations of the book format. Although it may differ from their normal layout, it has everything I need. And a lot more.To help with the layout and accuracy, I find this book indispensable. The photos and drawings are excellent, especially helpful since the instructions with the model (Revell #05078) are a little off.I have built five other sub models and have 16 other books on submarines: primarily U-boats. I feel that the \\"Type XXI U-Boat\\" was a necessary addition to my collection. Well worth the money. Glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Multiple Choice Questions : For Microeconomics and Macroeconomics","review":"I found the book to have very good study questions for students taking either microeconomics or macroeconomics.

If I could own only two quilting books, one would be Cutting Curves from Straight Lines by Debbie Bowles, the other would be Colorplay by Joen Wolfrom. These two books cut all the frustration, when trying to accomplish those eye popping wonderful pieces, that we see in these books. They are beautifully illustrated with great color on glossy paper. Debbie's book is the clearest and simplest book I have read on the dreaded curve in quilting. There is no time consuming pinning and I got instant success with my first block. I have little patients with written instruction and found this book really cut to the chase with step-by-step instruction. If you like traditional patterns with a contemporary twist this is it!"},{"Title":"Cutting Curves from Straight Pieces","review":"If I could only have one quilting book this would be it!! I love this book!! I am one of those compulsive quilters and fabric collectors. I have numerous quilting books and take many out of the library. I have been making quilts for almost 30 years.I signed up to take 2 workshops from the author and this book was included on the materials list. The book's instructions are so clear that I am not sure that I need to take the classes. I plan to take them anyway since I really want to meet Debbie Bowles.I couldn't wait to make a curved quilt block. I completed two pagoda blocks in less than one hour and then spent the next hour praising myself.Debbie Bowles really encourages you to experiment with color and patterns and provides excellent guidence and encouragement. I am pretty talented and adventurous with color but was astonished at the terrific results I have achieved from these techniques even with mediocre fabrics.I also purchased her other book, Dancing Quilts from Straight Pieces and am looking forward to trying this technique as well. (but I like Cutting Curves better)."},{"Title":"Cutting Curves from Straight Pieces","review":"The author and her technique were featured on an episode of Simply Quilts. I ordered the book immediately and have already made the double pagoda wall hanging and lap quilt. They were both so easy to make and the result was more than I hoped for. I'm already planning on making a queen sized double pagoda for my bed. The book takes you through each step, provides clear instruction and I feel it is one of the easiest and definitely most fun and enjoyable quilts that I've ever made. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a quilt or wallhanging that stands out from the rest! Happy Quilting!"},{"Title":"Cutting Curves from Straight Pieces","review":"I think this is an excellent book! The blocks were SO much fun to put together. After reading this book and trying out a few easy designs, my confidence in sewing curves has increased immensely! Ms. Bowles guides you thru her techniques in the first 25 or so pages and then devotes the rest of the book to creative designs. She shows you how to make a traditional log cabin design, among other designs, and give it a very contemporary feel and look! If you're very anxious about trying curves, give this book a try and see where it takes you!"},{"Title":"Cutting Curves from Straight Pieces","review":"Learn new, innovative methods of curved cutting and stitching with the help of Cutting Curves From Straight Pieces, a highly recommended guide which provides instructions and illustrations on making single and multiple cuts and arcs for quilts.

My father read it when he was in prep school in the '30's and had been pestering me for years to read it. After I finished it, I scoured every antique shop and used-book store to find other titles by this American author. Three of his books: Richard Carvel, followed by The Crisis and then The Crossing, team up to form what could be one of the first trilogies in American fiction.This is the story about a young Marylander in pre-Revolutionary America and his journey to independence. Anyone who likes historical novels will love reading this author. I will advise you, however, to have a good dictionary nearby as some of the words are archaic and need looking up - but that's half the fun of it."},{"Title":"Richard Carvel,","review":"Book was written by Winston Churchill, an American from St Louis.

It is also entertaining, but aimed more at the serious father, and it provides useful information."},{"Title":"A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy: Preparing for Parenthood Together","review":"HORRID! DO NOT BUY! We would return it...had we not only spent $0.59 on it in the first place. This terrible book treats men like rude, purely self-centered, uninterested idiots.

The author wants you to think this book, by a guy, is all guys need to know about the birthing process, but it seems like this book was written more to appease women, under the disguise of a guy's book. If you want a book that let's your wife think your interested, but contains little useful information and is easy to read, then this is it."},{"Title":"A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy: Preparing for Parenthood Together","review":"It's an easy read. Packed with insightful facts. I was reading it in bed one night and my wife (who is pregnant obviously) wanted me to read out loud to her.

How does he know that?&quot;I especially like the &quot;Guy Talk&quot; &amp; &quot;Girl Talk&quot; inserts. This book is not just informative, it's a lot of fun. I recommend it highly and will be giving it as a gift to other &quot;Dads-to-be&quot;.And guys, the author is right. Reading this book really does put you in good graces with your partner.

Every first time father should read this book in order to understand and more thoroughly enjoy his wife's/partner's pregnancy.Divided into forty chapters, one for each week of pregnancy, the reading is easy. I found myself heartily laughing,often. This book was given to me by my wife and we enjoyed the information it contained together. The book includes passages from couples interviewed specifically for their experiences related to pregnancy. Some of the incites the couples reveal are incredibly useful. In addition the quotes from the couples are very humorous.This book alleviated my fears, taught me a great deal about pregnancy, enabled me to enjoy my wife's pregnancy with her,and made me a better spouse and future father."},{"Title":"A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy: Preparing for Parenthood Together","review":"I have one of the best, most supportive husbands in the world but even he needed a book for the rollercoaster of pregnancy hormones. He selected this book to read and he laughed so much, we actually ended up reading it aloud and enjoying the whole thing! It is not a medical journal, nor is it insulting to men or women. It lays out the facts in guy-terms and tells them what to do to avoid big blow-ups. It doesn't command men that they have to give their wives three-hour massages every night, but it does explain things like hunger pangs during pregnancy go from zero to unbearable within minutes and this is something to remember when he hears his wife say \\"I'm kind of hungry\\". This book does a wonderful job of trying to explain to men what the women are going through, what they would like to see happen in most every situation and some great options, actions and compromises that can be taken at every point. Never does it say the man is an idiot who must be subserviant. On the contrary, the book promotes understanding, communication, love and empathy as the road map to getting through pregnancy without lots of blow-ups, misunderstandings and tears! I have to say it has made my great guy nearly perfect."},{"Title":"A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy: Preparing for Parenthood Together","review":"Having given birth to two children all I can say is &quot;I wish my husband had this book when I was pregnant!&quot; I bought this book for a co-worker whose wife is pregnant. It is so down-to-earth and humorous yet filled with all the medical info a guy needs to know. I couldn't believe how many of the issues and situations you go through in pregnancy mirrored what we went through; everything from the doctor's visits to baby showers to bringing home baby. Some of them may seem trivial but they are very real to a pregnant woman. I laughed out loud while reading this book. Run out and buy it for your husband now! Your pregnancy and relationship will benefit if he reads this book today!"},{"Title":"A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy: Preparing for Parenthood Together","review":"Okay, somewhere along the line men were labeled with the stigma that they are uninterested, unempathetic, cavemen, who care nothing about their pregnant wife or what's going on with their child. This book, to a certain extent, assumes that stereotype to be true. That being said, it's basically the experience of one man's journey to the birth of his son and how he related to it, and how his friends (both men and women) also talked about their own experiences. It's a quick read and he is a witty engaging writer.It is unfortunate that books about preganancy that are geared towards men tend to be pandering and make ridiculous assumptions about men as a gender. There's a few interesting things you'll pickup along the way here, though, and it's just interesting to go through the basic highlights of one man's pregnancy experience.If there is any stereotype of men and pregnancy, I think it is probably more along the lines of wanting to know the bottom line. A What, When, Where, and How book is what a man needs when go through a pregnancy. There are a few good books out there (geared, obviously to women, anyway).

I have since lent it to another expecting couple and I am looking to give one as a gift soon.The criticism here regarding the &quot;no fat joke&quot; is unwarranted as guys who really do not know better would not even touch a book like this; for starters, they would not get most of the jokes. From my experience the book is great for loosening up sometimes oh so serious and tight pregnancy discussions and at the same time getting some useful hints across. Both us and the other couple frequently were just laughing at the humor since it very often exactly describes the real-life situation and couples will recognize the little episodes experienced themselves after reading about them in an uncomplicated manner."},{"Title":"A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy: Preparing for Parenthood Together","review":"This book treats men like we are idiots.

The opening chapter even acknowledges this.Also, this book has some outdated information in it. In 1997 when the author was writing his first version, renting a pager from a hospital was probably worth mentioning. With 2012 around the corner and with the ubiquitousness of modern cell phones, this chapter should have been deleted from the 2008 printed version.Even though this book takes no time to read, it is not worth the effort.

And it tells him everything you would want him to know. I particulary like the suggestions about how he should act and treat the mom-to-be. Its funny, practical, and down to earth. Some things are a bit stereotypical and it sometimes generalizes, but for the most part I was very happy. It makes it easier when I talk to him, cause he can actually relate."},{"Title":"A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy: Preparing for Parenthood Together","review":"I groaned when my wife got me this book.

Each story uses animals to explain some aspect of Christian life in a way that is easily understood by children. An example is the chapter which the book is named after.

Originally published by Love Street Books, Louisville, Ky (No Longer in buisiness) it hit the streets in 1979 with a cute Super Beetle on it's cover.Revamped and updated by Survival Press, with current up to the minute information, the book still works! The system is the same from the bootlegger days to about ten minutes ago, from mash to Mason jar.Henry Ford produced the &quot;T&quot; with the intention of it running on alcohol, as well as gasoline. After all, in those days you didn't see a filling station on every corner. It was necessary to be able to run on alcohol, and it did just fine.Pure alcohol, 200 proof, burns cleaner than old Mort's pet pig after the Saturday nite bath. You don't have to fight OPEC to get it either ;-) It will be right where you put it last.Ask Minnesota if corn squeezin's burn in your car. Producing enough to totally eliminate gasoline is, perhaps, not practical. However, lots of us are gonna give it a run for its money.Jim and Barbara did a great job on this book, and Survival Press merely brought it up to the present date and time. Updated info on the ATF and the current requirements and applications --which by the by are included in the Appendices of the 2001 printing.If a person really wants to get shuck of the dinasaur juice and the OPEC clowns that control it, this is one great alternative.A marvelous tutorial, with step by step instructions.

The paper, cover, and binding are all excellent. The information is basically sound, and covers the topic well. Paul Scarlata is clearly a well-informed, authoritative, and readable author. The best part of the book is the hundreds of high-quality photographs and illustrations (all black and white) of Mannlicher's rifles, including many period photographs showing the rifles in use.Missing from the book, unfortunately, is substantive biographical information about Mannlicher the man. Scarlata does mention that such information is very hard to come by. This is partially offset by a review of the geopolitical era of Mannlicher, along with a discussion of rifle production facilities of the time, etc. Unfortunately, the single map of the Austro-Hungarian Empire provided is very difficult to read or use.The book (with few exceptions) covers only the 'production' rifles of Mannlicher in any detail (which makes sense, of course); for these models it compares favorably with W.H.B. Smith's authoritative 1947 Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols.I admit I was somewhat disappointed that the book devotes space to cover several non-Mannlicher rifles (e.g., the Schmidt-Rubin series, the Ross series, and the M1895 Lee) in some detail, instead of providing more topic-specific material.Finally, there are some minor errors. For example, the illustration on page 47 is labeled \\"Model 87 Repeating Rifle with Revolving Magazine\\"; it is instead (I believe) a Model 82 Repeating Rifle with Forestock Tube Magazine. Such copy errors in a book of this type are, of course, serious.All in all, a solid work from a competent author--very pleasing to own, informative to read, and well worth the purchase price. With a firm editor's hand, a future 2nd edition could be a true classic."},{"Title":"Mannlicher Military Rifles: Straight Pull and Turn Bolt Designs","review":"this book is very informative on mannlicher riles right down to the different clips usedbut the reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the historical flaws in the bookMr. Scarlata says that in 1278 rudolf IV defeated the magyars at the battle of marchfeld however this is wrongit was not rudolf IV but rudolf I and it was not the magyars he defeated but king ottokar of bohemiahe also says that after the austro prussian war instead of reorganizing the general staff and officer trainingthat they just searched for breech loading rifles this again is wrong while the austrian army did start right awaylooking for breechloaders one of the first things archduke albrecht and general Beck did was reorganize the general staff andofficer training there is even more flaws with regard to World war one however the book is truly remarkable on the history of themannlicher rifles i just wish he would have done better research on the history of the monarchy but if you want to know aboutmannlichers rifles this is a great book if you don't mind the historical flaws on the history of the monarchyRichard K"},{"Title":"Mannlicher Military Rifles: Straight Pull and Turn Bolt Designs","review":"For quite some time there has been little published on Mannlicher designed long arms in English. The only sources were the classic books by W.H.B. Smith, thesebeing \\"Mannlicher rifles and pistols\\" and other materialcover in books like \\"The rifle\\". Other than periodical itemsthat would appear over the years, most of the coverage of this type of military long arm was given over to Mannlicher'scompetitor, Mauser. This is somewhat ironic given the position of the Steyr Werke, that made the Mannlicher rifles,was at one time probably the largest producer of small arms in the world at the time. They even picked up the slack for a number a government arsenals, that could'nt meet their production qoutas.So in this work we have good solid coverage of the many bolt action designs of Mannlicher. These are complemented by good quality photographs, and numerous period photos of the arms in service.As far as previously mentioned in another review, the reason there are no production figures is that the recordswere supposedly \\"lost\\" during WW II. I have run across production figures in some of the Steyr literature, but theauthor probably didn't bother to look at these.Mannlicher is a difficult person to get a detailed biographyon, especially in English. In this book, is probably one of the most detailed accounts of the man to date.My only quibble with the book is that the author insists on injecting his interpretation of European geopolitical situations into what should remain a work on Mannlicher bolt action rifles. While a historical background and context is essential to understand why these guns were developed and produced, his superficial analysis lends nothing to the presentation.At the end of the book are pictures of the author at the rangefiring some of the rifles covered in the books.

I do have two comments which could be viewed as \\"constructive criticism\\": I question Scarlata's comment that Ferdinand Mannlicher had more rifle patents than any other maker of military rifles; I would have thought Paul Mauser had more!

I really liked this book because it was haunting - the descriptions of Spain and the sadness of a woman watching the man she loves be destroyed by the SPanish Civil War. Quite good."},{"Title":"The South","review":"The South by Colm Toibin is an intense, though fitful chronicle of a woman's life, a life as yet incomplete. It presents a patchwork of detail amidst vast tracts of unknown, like a painting that has a suggestion of complete outline interspersed with patches of intricate detail. Thus, eventually, we know some amazing things about Katherine Proctor and we have shared much of her life. She remains, paradoxically, largely anonymous, however, as she probably does to herself. The title carries an agenda for Katherine Proctor's life, since aspects of the word provide setting and context for phases in her life.We meet her having just left her husband and her ten-year-old son. She was unhappily married to Tom. Richard was her spitting image. We never really get to know why she left, why she so definitively broke with a past that appeared both secure and fulfilled. A part of her motives may have sprung from her status as a Protestant in Enniscorthy, a small town near the sea in the south of Ireland, in the south-east. She thus inherited a status that bore its own history, a history of which she was aware, but minus its detail. But it could only have been part of an explanation, because it was her husband and her life, her private concerns, that she fled.In the 1950s, she went south to Spain, settling in Barcelona. There she met Miguel, a man with his own history. He had fought with the anarchists in the Civil War. He still had friends, colleagues from the fight. Katherine falls for him. They move to a stone house in the Pyrenees. He paints. She paints. She bears him a child.Katherine meets Michael Graves, an Irishman, doubly coincidentally also from her home town. He is working in Barcelona. He seems to be an ailing, gently cynical character, who is clearly besotted with her. When things with Miguel turn unexpectedly sour, he offers solace and comfort. This time, however, Katherine had nothing to do with the split, a separation that also took away her young daughter.She painted more, hibernated. And then there grew an urge to trace the son she had left behind many years before. He was still in their family house, the one she had deserted, where he lived with his wife and daughter. There are tensions. They are solved. Michael Graves is also back in Ireland.Katherine rediscovers the south, her homeland, through painting it. Though penniless, she gets by, sometimes appearing to live off her own resources of passion and commitment. Though perhaps not conscious of it herself, she is always striving for a fulfilment she believes she never attains. In fact, she has it all along. Though a victim of circumstance, she is ready to grasp any opportunity and live it. \\"Only a protestant would go into sea so cold,\\" Michael says to her. She gets wet. He doesn't. And in the end, though we still hardly know her, we like Katherine proctor, and we respect her.The South alternates its narrative between first and third person in a subtle way tat allows the reader to sculpt its main character. She becomes wholly tangible, but rarely are we told anything about her. She lives. We meet her, and we react. Colm Toibin's achievement in this, his first novel, is considerable."},{"Title":"The South","review":"The South, the story of an Irish woman who falls in love with a Spanish anarchist in 1950's Barcelona, is captivating but tragic.Katherine Proctor, the Irish woman, was a well developed character and, throughout the novel, I was interested in herand cared about her. Often I wondered at her decisions because her chosen life with Miguel is poverty stricken, at timesviolent and sometimes impossible to continue. The most fascinating aspect for me was the revelation of the complexevents of the Spanish Civil War and, especially, the way Franco continued to hunt down those who had fought againsthis Nationalist army. The plot moves slowly, but that was not a problem for me. Overall,though, the book is a sad one; it beginsthis way and only becomes more so. Yet, I still feel it was valuable to read."},{"Title":"The South","review":"Review of \\"The South\\" by Colm Toibin, received via AmazonThis Colm Toibin novel is a disappointment. It's about an Irish artist and mother who needs to fulfill herself by abandoning her husband and child to experience hardships and harrassments with an anarchist-lover in the aftermath of Franco's Spanish Civil War victory. With the support of another (self?)-exiled Irish artist, she has success as an artist, despite the nonchalant loss of an infant daughter. She ends up returning to Ireland to visit the son abandoned decades ago and basically remains a totally self-centered individual. There's really no character development here and one feels the same empathy for her as one might feel for the sometime Hungarian Nazi collaborator in \\"The English Patient.\\"W.F.

Florentino Ariza would not give up after 50 years of pursuing Fermina. Amaranta would not take back Pietro, despite that fact that she loved him deeply, because he had insulted her ego by choosing her sister first.In this story, tragic-comic in style, the unnamed main character, whom you may never forget, an 80 year old colonel, refuses to see past his ego and pride. He lives in the memory of his revolutionary days, where he was a big shot, who \\"broke his back to save the republic.\\" But now, after 15 years of waiting for a pension yet to come, he is still waiting, going to the post-master every Friday in vain. All of his military peers had died without ever receiving it.His wife, an asthma sufferer, begs him to sell the fighting rooster for money, since they are flat broke and go to bed oftentimes without eating. He, however, refuses to beg his friends, since his ego wants to maintain a strong image of himself.The false hopes of his pride and the refusal to give up the memories of his revolutionary days disillusion him from reality. The rooster is a symbol of his undying pride.Even at the brink of starvation, his wife calls him \\"willful, stubborn and inconsiderate.\\" He nearly comes to his senses of selling the cock, until his pride chimes in with a sort of bottomless sweetness: \\"The rooster is not for sale.\\""},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"It seemed to take a while to ship, but not excessively so. Also, a few of the pages were bent - not sure if this was pre-existing or if it happened during shipping. Otherwise, minimal marks and a good value for the price."},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"The book and its popularity among a certain kind of readers in the erstwhile colonized third world countries explain a lot about those societies and their priorities and preferences. The colonel has been waiting for decades for a meagre pension while his friend Sabhas manages to accumulate some wealth by questionable means (how else,making profits!). If you have to like the book you have to read it as one identifying the difference between the good and the evil and no way between a lazy fatalistic person and the industrious in reality. If only one Gen. Aurlieno Buendia did not give up a certain kind of righteous fight, things would not have been so bad for the poor couple i.e. the colonel and his wife. The colonel was honest when it mattered (handed over a sum to Gen. Buendia faithfully), although a long time ago in his youth, and thus he very legitimately awaits a pension without looking for any alternative means of sustenance since then. He keeps pet, a rooster, which will fight when appropriate time arrives and that will be the second occasion when a fight may help the colonel in his life. In between, only poverty is the meaning and I am sure,to some readers of a certain kind of political grooming, glory of his life. The novel is competently written to dispense with the opiate of the daydreaming masses to whom revolutionary struggle (whatever that may mean) is the only magic to improve living. Those who will appreciate the novel will have to ask themselves why do they sympathize with the colonel - is it because he is poor,is it because he was once a fighter or is it because he does not show much interest in any form of income except pension at an early age. I think, of all those of his ilk, Marquez found the most effective style to move the fatalist romantics emotionally. And to them, emotion is only what matters."},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"a series of short stories from marquez that intrique the reader in the same sense his other novels have accomplished"},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"Marquez has done it again, to weave a story of pathos and vividness which, even a gifted painter would find it difficult to portray. Set in a small Mexican town, the world of the Colonel and his wife along with the memories of his lost son and his parting rooster, become a symbol of defiance, a triumph of human spirit amidst the ruin and the debris that has come to haunt the Colonel in all possible forms.A pension that never comes, an asthma of his wife that never cures and a life that does not have enough food, confront the world of the exploiter.The memories of the Colonel's dead son and his rooster become the living example of bravery which may have deserted many hardened Colonels. This bravery unfolds itself as the Colonel defies everything in life, even the approaching depriviation and death, as the Col. zealously protects his honours and values. The sale of his rooster, possibly his only option for continuance of his life, is heroically opposed, despite a clear possibility of stark and naked death knocking at his door. In thus defying death the Col.has sought to immortalize his life and possibly all that life stands for - hope.A million such examples abound. What is brilliant is that the pathos of a lonely life, devastated by a crumbling world, and the undaunting spirit of a man fighting against everything from insensitivity to disease has been so movingly portrayed in the novella. Beneath this brilliant portrayal of human pathos lies a subtext that is deeply political and social. Politics of the country and its victims are most tellingly described through the Col. and his travails. Marquez is a writer who is a dreamer and an activist too. In his Col.who is both the hero and the anti-hero, Marquez has punched politics and sufferings in a brilliantly conceived character and has invested him with a realism that transcends nations and nationalities and speaks a language which is moving and absorbing."},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"This story, about an old, sad Colonel who spends his time waiting for a pension that, deep down, he knows he will never receive, is simply heart-breaking. Every paragraph is laced with sadness - sadness that his circumstances are how they are and sadness that it won't ever really change, not even in the promised January when the rooster will finally pay off for him and his wife and they can finally put the memory of their dead son behind them.It was a short story, only ~60 pages long, so I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read something quickly. It is rather depressing, probably made more so by the fact that the Colonel is a dignified man and that he knows that the misfortunes of his life are not his fault at all. Unfortunately, even at the end, there isn't any real hope. It does end with a great last line, but there is no retribution, no deliverance, no satisfaction to be had for the Colonel and his wife. I think that if Marquez had solved all of the Colonel's problems, it would have been a weaker story, so I'm not too upset about that."},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"A set of short semi linked stories set in and around the wonderful Latin American Kingdom Maquez created in '100 Years of Solitude' including the novella of the Colonel, who fought in the revolution and has been betrayed;relying on a Cock to win him some money to keep starvation at bay.This is a superb collection, each tale in some way telling of the futile revolutions that never end up benefiting the people; the stiffling bureaucracy, the corruption, nepotism and autocracy of Latin American politics and life in a small town.Stand out stories ; 'There are no Thieves in this Town' where a pointless theft of the billiard balls from the pool hall affects the whole life of the town and reaps an innocent victim;the lyrical fable 'One Day After Saturday' and 'Montiels Widow'; a Town changes when the local tyrant dies...But the whole book is superb. Garcia Marquez just doesn't do 'average' and reading him is a pleasure."},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"The part that made me the most happy was how \\"One-Hundred years of Solitude\\" got referenced. This is a collection of short stories that is an easy read. The writing style is such that you can \\"see\\" what the author is saying. This may also be one of the most strange banterings between man and wife I have seen."},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"Although there are a few minor events in Marquez's muted novella - a funeral, a trip to the casino, the arrival of a circus, a cockfight trial - the story is more concerned with the mundane fact of the colonel's repetitive everyday existence, his domestic rituals, walks, conversations, his waiting for the official letter confirming his pension that never comes. Details about the region's political situation and history filter through gradually, and despite a shortage of exterior detail, there is some local colour - the postmaster drinking pink froth as he makes his way through harbour stalls to meet the launch; the priest who gives movie censorship details by bell-ringing, spying on the cinema to note the disobedient.'No-one writes to the colonel' is a portrait of old age, that period when physical decay conflicts with still-alert mental pride; the dependence on others with the unreliability of family, friends or the State; increasing poverty with forlorn attempts at gentility; the dreadful trauma of outliving your children; the perhaps worse fate of seeing your ideals and efforts fail, the world constituted in someone else's image.Your pleasure in this story will probably depend on how you take the colonel, from whose point of view it is almost entirely narrated - he has no interior life, there are no accounts of his feelings or opinions beyond what he says to others, so revelation of his character must be gleaned through movement and the things he notices. The focus on mundane objects, conversations and rituals takes on a spiritual force, but can come close to sentimentality as Marquez over-eggs the colonel's dignity; although it is just as easy to see the hero as a kind of moral monster in the way he treats his wife so that he can uphold his dubious honour.'Colonel' is written in that Hemingway-esque style which is always called 'deceptively simple': there are few of the heart-quickening flourishes that made Marquez's masterpiece '100 Years of solitude' so magical - a brilliant funeral scene where the wilting Colonel is addressed by the corpse; a crisp December morning in which the privy livitates, if only for a milimetre."},{"Title":"No one writes to the colonel, and other stories","review":"Every time when I'm feeling lonely, I always say \\"No one writes to the Colonel\\".

The story is about a boy who's father was an archeologist. Years ago Andy's father was on a trip in Alaska trying to find evidence of the firs people in north America. He was with another person but he slipped and fell. Now Andy was in Alaska looking for the Island that this father had died on. He's on a kayaking trip with a group of people but during a storm Andy is swept way off course and lands on what seems to be a deserted island. Until he sees a mysterious man with wild looking beard and dressed in bark and animal skins. Andy decides to find out who the man really is while trying to survive wind, rain, and mind numbing cold, along with the local grizzly bears.One of the strong points of this book is the suspense. There's always twisted that keep you reading and wanting to find out what happens next. The book also seems really realistic. Will Hobbs seems to know a lot about the outdoors and surviving and you can tell in the way he writes this book. I've never read any of his other books but after this one I think that I would enjoy another of his books.There was one thing that I didn't like about this book was that there wasn't really a whole lot of action. There was plenty of suspense, like I said before but the suspense was more from the plot and not from something that is physically happening to Andy. He never really gets in any fights or any action like that. Otherwise this book was great and I would recommend it to anyone who likes outdoors books."},{"Title":"Wild Man Island","review":"For my Amazon Book Review, I read the book Wild Man Island. It is about 14-year old Andy Galloway taking a trip to Alaska with a group to see the amazing humpback whales. One night, while the tour guides are asleep, he sneaks out and kayaks to the island where his father died trying to solve the mystery of the first Americans, and of course to see the whales in action. But on the way back, he gets caught in a storm, which takes him to Admiralty Island. What he doesn't know, however, is that there is a man on the deserted island who could help him, and with the help of his dog, Bear, leads Andy to a cave where danger, suspense, and mystery await him.The author has written the book in such a descriptive way, it takes the reader into Andy's adventure: the woods, the amazing cave explanation, the wild man. It is amazing! All the details and explanations were so well written, it was like a mini movie in my head imagining what happens next in the story. But in all books, there are parts you don't like. I didn't really like the fact that there were so many details about what Andy thinks, I felt like skipping pages when some chapters were like that. Some of the information was too much.I like Wild Man Island, because there is danger, excitement, and mystery waiting for me to read in every page. When I first read this book, I couldn't put the book down. It was so thrilling, I finished the book in two days. I thought to myself, this is an exciting book from the first page to the last. Every chapter I read keptgetting more and more mysterious and suspenseful. I rate this book with five stars. I recommend this book to all readers who like adventure and excitement all in one.\\"Descriptions of woods, wildlife, and the spectacular cave formations Andy discovers have a ring of authenticity that makes his hardships and adventures as compelling as any of Gary Paulsen's.\\" --- Kirkus Reviews\\" A well- paced adventure, this novel combines survival saga, mystery, and archeological expedition....

I suggest you read this book if you like books by Will Hobbs or you like books with a lot of unexpected twists in them. I never thought I would like this book when I got it form the library, I just got it because I couldnt find any other book but as I started reading it I got into it and couldnt put it down, I always wanted to know what was going to happend next. This book kept me on the edge of my chair the whole time I was reading it."},{"Title":"Wild Man Island","review":"I have to say, that after reading \\"Wild Man Island\\" by Will Hobbs, I was honestly let down. I usually love adventure stories but this book just couldn't hold my attention. I kept waiting for the exciting parts to get me to want to read more but it never happened. Even the part when Andy, the main character, got caught in a horrendous storm, and ended up on an island known as The Fortress of The Bears. Also, when Andy encounters the \`wild man'.This all began when Andy took a kayak trip to Alaska. His father, an archeologist, had passed away on an island near where Andy and his group were located. When everyone decides to make camp and go to sleep, Andy had an idea to borrow a kayak and go to the island where his father died. He thought about all the good times his father and him shared. Andy knew it was getting late and thought he'd better get back to his group so he left the island and started paddling back, when he got caught in the shocking storm. The storm blew him off track, causing him to land on an island with no food, no shelter, or a way to get a hold of anybody. This island was called The Fortress of The Bears, or Admiralty Island. Andy searches the island and faces many things. For example, he finds a Newfoundland dog, which had led him to the dog's owner or so called \\"master\\". This owner was known as the \`wild man'. Andy wonders who this \`wild man' is and what other hair-raising things he will come across. (Unfortunately, I didn't). I believe that I set my expectations high as to my reading selections and what I want from a book. Therefore, in all fairness, other readers may find 'Wild Man' interesting so I would recommend this book.The excerpt from the inside cover leads the readers to believe that the book is so exciting. Yet in actuality, I feel that it sums up all the excitement in a nutshell and sets the readers up for boredom and disappointment."},{"Title":"Wild Man Island","review":"In the book Wildman Island the mane character Andy goes on a kayaking trip in Alaska.

I would imagine that being a very difficult and exciting situation for any human, but in Will Hobbs' book, Wild Man Island, I found it quite boring.It all starts off with Andy Galloway, the main character, paddling his kayak on a sea kayaking trip. It mentions early in the book about Andy's father, once an archeologist, who had died not too far from where Andy and his group were located. Later on, when all the groups pitch their tents on a nearby island for the night to sleep, Andy sneeks off with a kayak over to the island where his father died. After visiting and sharing memories of his father, Andy realizes that he spent a little too much time on the island and decides to paddle back to where his group is. Unfortunately for him, he gets caught in a fierce storm, which pushes his kayak off course and over to Admiralty island, otherwise known as The Fortress Of The Bears. On this island, Andy encounters much wildlife, even a Newfoundland dog and his owner... a wild man. Who is this 'wild man' and why is there a dog on this island? What strange things does Andy discover on his adventure on Admiralty island? You'll have to read the book to find out for yourself.My opinion on this book is probably very similar to other kids my age. I don't enjoy reading about wildlife. I guess it's too bad for me because most of Will Hobbs' books are based on that genre. But I must say that Will Hobbs used many details which gave me mental pictures in my mind. I love doing that when I read because it gives me a better understanding of what's happening.

When she discovered the fog had magic in it was when she was looking for the milk cow and thought she saw a house in the fork of the road. Then Greta found friends on the other side of the mountain called Blue Cove. Her new friends name was Retha and Mrs. Morrill. My favorite part of the book was when Retha and Greta were picking berries and it was time for Greta to go home and Mrs. Morrill gave Greta a piece of pie to take home with her. When she got home the pie was gone from the pale. All in all I really liked reading this book and imagining what it would be like to be in another world.

She loves Blue Cove and makes a lot of friends as she figures out its secrets.The book was good, but it was slow and at some parts didn't allow the reader to get much of the feeling of the part. It was still good at other parts and sometimes shocking, but it gives and empty feeling. I mean, it doesn't explain why the fog opened to Blue Cove for Greta and why in every generation of the Addingtons there would be a child who loved the fog. It doesn't have that good of an ending. I love Newbery Honor books, but this one was a bit disappointing. It was still magical though, but I'll only recommend it to people who think such unsolved mysteries and are able to understand a lot of that kind of stuff. Instead of this book, I'd recommend \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIHM.\\" It's not exactly a fantasy, but its kind of like this book and its a lot, lot better."},{"Title":"Fog Magic (A Puffin Book)","review":"I think that Julia Sauer has done a great job in capturing the ethereal experiences of 11-year-old Greta in a way that readers of all ages can relate to.

James Henry asks a more fundamental question, where did the money go? Why is there so little to show for the more than $2.7 trillion of debt, aid, and investment made available to the developing world since the 1970s? One answer is that it was not spent but stolen and wasted, maybe as little as one-third of it ending up on the ground. Much of the rest has gone to provide the political elites of recipient countries with retirement homes in pleasant places.Henry, a lawyer and economist by training and an investigative journalist by avocation, has been working on this story since the late 1980s. He travelled to more than 50 countries in pursuit of it and his book contains original, first-hand accounts of decades of unscrupulous financial behavior in the Philippines, Brazil, Nicaragua, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Mexico.What started off as an economist's enquiry into the paradox of third world debt has ended up as an indictment of the first world corporations that helped to create it. Henry tells how many of the world's leading banks and financial groups have, often with the complicity of their governments and supranational institutions, created and fuelled the new high-growth global markets for dirty debt, capital flight, money laundering, tax evasion, corruption, illicit weapons traffic, and other new transnational forms of dubious economic activity.This is an essential book. Corruption is the scandal of third world debt. Attempts to relieve it must include the means to prevent its happening again."},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","review":"I'm a Latin American scholar. Henry's well-written book manages to get below the surface, and deliver some amazing new revelations about Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, in particular. I was also interested to find out exactly where Paraguay's General Stroessner, the Phillipines' Marcos, Pakistan's Bhutto, Zaire's Mobutu, and quite a few other Third World thugs kept their foreign loot -- and not only in Switzerland! Not easy reading, but it will definitely change your perspective on the global economy...."},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","review":"\\"The Blood Bankers\\" is an important contribution to our understanding of global financial instability. Most often, liberalized (legitimate) capital markets, international trade, state power, and international regulatory institutions are cited as the causes of destabilization. However, J. Henry allows us to look behind these forces and bodies to see how the liberalization of the global economy has unleashed illicit and/ or immoral financial forces, often acting through otherwise legitimate enterprises. Thus, \\"The Blood Bankers\\" gives us another level of understanding and critique of the agents of globalization. Without understanding the underground players, it would be impossible to fully understand the instability of modern international markets."},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","review":"The Blood Bankers:Tales from the Global Underground Economy is a non-fiction financial thriller/whodunit that illuminates the sordid, self-serving, elitist international money trail and the greedy creatures who travel shamelessly on it. Mr. Henry courageously lifts the veil of monetary indecency and carefully guarded fiscal secrecy as he takes the reader on an insider's guided tour of global corruption and greed. Truth is indeed, stranger than fiction and The Blood Bankers is a shocking account of unbridled greed, run wild in plain sight around the world. It features a virtual perp walk of duplicitous international bankers, beyond-corrupt politicans and heads of state, and a whole supporting cast of money launderers, corporate con men and underworld predators. If you're ready to lose your intellectual virginity, read this book. The world will never look the same."},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","review":"Major U.S. banks have knowingly dealt with the corrupt elites of the world's developing countries.They have harbored capital flight from wealthy investors who had lost confidence in their country.They have extended loans to corrupt industrialists, who promptly skimmed the profits and, through their political connections, convinced the national governments to guarantee the loans, placing the burden on the backs of the poor.They have lent money to violently repressive military dictators.They have accepted bribes; they have offered bribes; they have turned a blind eye to untold human suffering."},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","review":"Blood Bankers sets out to answer the question, \\"What has happened that over the last 30 years the industrialized countries of the world have loaned $3 trillion ($3,000,000,000,000) -ostensibly for the benefit of the underdeveloped countries of the world- and, without question, the latter are substantially worse off than they were 30 years ago?\\" Very often the effects that he reports are not marginal failures, but catastrophic results, that he rigorously illustrates in the book. Worse, the failures are not a collection of accidents, scattered ethical failures, or the like.Jim's book is a treasure of facts and speculative plots for any citizen of the world seriously concerned with exploring and then grounding his or her ethical claims for a different global convivencia - way of being together and engaging with the others in our daily lives-. The book brings, through a rich and engaging set of well-researched stories, a context for understanding the role played by a system of major institutions in crafting the failures and financial scandals that often appear as scattered and disconnected news in the media. He draws a clear picture of a sustained pattern of behaviors, practices, interpretations, institutionalized systems and ways of thinking and working that are embedded in worldwide economic institutions, investment banks, governments, the great construction companies of the world, major equipments vendors, that create exactly the right situation for growing the behaviors that bring and sustain these results.The book portrait the global machinery of nihilism were a dollar from dictator or a dollar from a legitimate president, a dollar from a organ trafficker or a dollar from a religious order, a dollar from the right or the left worth the same, and share the very same benefit of being tax free, secretly concealed, flying capital. The book shows the extent of a pervasive criminal side in America's claim of decency, fair practices, and humanitarian generosity - a kind of decency that is indecent and needs to be reinvented-Henry's voice seams to collide with some main stream voices. April 2004 HBR call in its front-page \\"Play to Win\\" through \\"hardball\\" strategies -G.Stalk, R.Lachenauer-. One of the five strategies -that in synthesis seams to be a call for a more predatory style- said \\" The hardball player venture closer to the boundary, whether establish by law or social conventions, than competitors will ever dare (...) Keep in mind, though, that a legal standard is often less than crystal clear. By aggressively pushing the limits of existing regulations, a hardball player can sometimes win tremendous competitive advantages.\\" How we could bring business decency out of this business ethic?, What is missing in the stablished design of the game?In calling for change in the way this machinery works, Jim defines the scope of a global task that is of the first order, and ultimately, unavoidable. This is a very bold piece of research denied by meanstream media and major political debates."},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","review":"This book is an eye-opening account of the financial chicanery that lay behind countless poorly planned, badly executed, over-priced and economically unviable development projects that were undertaken in Africa, Asia and Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s. Henry exposes the role played by leading international financial institutions in fueling the growth of dubious forms of transnational economic activity and shows how their behavior has been tolerated and even encouraged by the IMF, the World Bank and the US Treasury. He also sheds light on the influence that international financial interests have had on political developments in the third world - from the overthrow of Allende's elected government in Chile and the funding provided to Nicaragua's Contra rebels, to the support of thieving dictators like Ferdinand Marcos, General Somoza and Carlos Salinas, just to mention a few."},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","review":"For anyone wishing to get a clear and concise walk through the back-door dealings of International Banking, in specific what it has done to consistently derail and sabotage emerging financial markets, this is a must read.The book hinges on true and methodical investigative journalism (sadly, a talent in these precarious times often more feared than revered), and its revelations take you far beyond whatever information has been garnered from the print media's attempts to unravel the blatant crime behind the Third World Debt Crisis.Whether it be an account of what essentially killed the revolution in Nicaragua, the insane excesses of Imelda Marcos, or the twisted money trail leading to Sadam's WMDs, Mr. Henry will not disappoint in his efforts to reveal how we got ourselves into the Emerging Markets debacle, and what this has to say about the growing worldwide terrorism directed at the West."},{"Title":"BLOOD BANKERS : TALES FROM THE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY","review":"Based on the material presented in this book it is 5 Stars. Based on the fact that the author fails to connect the dots, 3 Stars. So, I gave the book 4 Stars.The author seems to be stumped by why all the loans to underdeveloped countries have not resulted in greater wealth and improvements. Well, maybe that wasn't the plan in the first place. For all the corrupt projects and statistics the author reveals, he seems extremely nave to the reality of the situation.if you want to read about corruption, how the U.S. taxpayers are getting screwed and speculate on where all the loan money went, this is the book. But if you want to know how the system is structured to achieve exactly what is going on in all these debt-ridden countries and why all the projects are colossal over-budget failures, read \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.\\" What is happening over and over in all these countries is not an accident. It is a plan by the CIA, IMF, World Bank and others to exploit these countries in what can be considered transnational colonialism.The same players are always involved, just the name of the country is changed. But the author can't seem to connect the dots... or he just doesn't want to admit that there is a conspiracy going on.

After reading this book twice, I realize that International Bankers of all varieties dominate the buisness world and are at fault for irresponsible lending to many 'developing' nations.

With an array of supernaturral characters (devils, gnomes, hobgoblings, prophets, imps, saints, and demons) Singer fulfils a mosaic of fantastic imagination, colored by a rich folklore, addressing moral issues that concern the child and the adult as well. Stories such as &quot;Zlateh the Goat,&quot; &quot;Popiel and Tekla,&quot; &quot;The Power of Light,&quot; amongst others, have a universal appeal because they address eternal questions. For Singer, now matter how young a child might be, he is a philosopher and seeker of God. An adult will surely enjoy these tales, and if he can share them with a child then his pleasure will be doubled!"},{"Title":"Stories For Children","review":"I had read Isaac Bashevis Singer in high school and enjoyed him. I picked up Stories for Children at the library and read it to myself straight through and found it very enjoyable. I thought my 4 and 5 year old might like it too so I read Zlateh the Goat since we're getting a lot of snow. You have to understand that basically the author has transcribed oral legend onto paper. It's the difference between reading Shakespeare and watching Hollywood doing Henry V. I have never so vividly experienced this as when I read the this story to the kids. They were rolling on the floor when the goat says Maaaa. At the end of the story the author ends one word short. Both kids shouted it out. I completely missed it when I read the book to myself silently."},{"Title":"Stories For Children","review":"I sometimes read these to my sick and elderly dad at bed time. He loves them. When he's not doing well, is worried about his health, is afraid to close his eyes, the stories work their magic. As I read, he sometimes clucks, murmers \\"oh, yes,\\" and makes other happy and endearing sounds--just great to hear. If he's still awake at the end, he goes to sleep, fearlessly, with a smile on his face."},{"Title":"Stories For Children","review":"As Singer noted in his 1984 Foreword, \\"in the beginning was the Logos, the power of the word.\\" He had never believed he could write for children, but editor Elizabeth Shub convinced him otherwise in the early 1960s. Twelve volumes of children's books followed, from which these 36 tales are gleaned. Young readers should remain eternally grateful.This collection opens in Chelm, the village of idiots young and old. Even the people have funny names--Gronam Ox, Dopey Lekisch, Zeinvel Ninny, Shmendrick Numskull and Feyvel Thickwit. The way they speak and act is still funnier.Gronam, for example, would have been a happy man, but for the elders who regularly visited--to whom he regularly spoke nonsense. His first wife Genendel would reproach him, to which he replied, \\"In the future, whenever you hear me saying something silly, come into the room and let me know. I will immediately change the subject.\\"She refused. \\"If they learn you're a fool, you'll lose your job as head of the council.\\" Instead, each time he said anything silly, she offered to hand him the key to their strongbox. \\"Then you'll know you've been talking like a fool.\\"That year, the town met with a scarcity of sour cream, which was sorely needed for the coming Pentecost, a holiday on which the townsfolk normally ate a lot of it. Gronam had the solution. He proposed making \\"a law that water is to be called sour cream, and sour cream is to be called water.\\" Given the wells full of water, he noted, all the women would have barrels full of sour cream as a result.Sender Donkey, Treitel Fool and their most foolish compatriots all heartily approved. So the new law was written. But Genendel shortly appeared with the strongbox key. When Gronam explained their arrangement, the elders grew enraged. How dare a woman suggest she knew better when wisdom or silliness had been spoken.They in turn changed another law: When Genendel believed Gronam's pronouncements silly, she should give the elders the strongbox key and let them decide. If they disagreed, she would double their portions of blintzes, cakes and tea. From that day forward, Gronam spoke freely, and Genendel hardly said a word: She was not about to serve blintzes generously.Then there is Shlemiel, also of the fabled Chelm, and as fine a businessman as the town could offer. He married Mrs. Shlemiel, whose father gave him a dowry, with which he bought a goat in Lublin. But en route home, he left the goat tethered to a tree while he went into an inn for some brandy, chopped liver and onions and a plate of chicken soup and noodles. The innkeeper (not surprisingly) switched his old blind billy goat for Shlemiel's milking goat. Lots more fun and some Chelmnick wisdom followed.Readers also encounter \\"Shrewd Todie and Lyzer the Miser.\\" The former had a wife Shaindel and seven children and never earned enough to feed them. He had such poor luck working at trades that he decided if he should make candles, the sun would never set. During an especially cold winter, Shaindel told Todie that if he could not get something to eat, she would go to the Rabbi and get a divorce. \\"And what will you do with it,\\" he asked her. \\"Eat it?\\"Lyzer meanwhile was so stingy, he'd let his wife bake bread but once every four weeks: Stale bread was eaten more slowly than fresh. He left his poor goats to feast on his neighbors' thatched roofs, rather than feed them. He preferred to eat his dry bread and borscht on a box so that his upholstered chairs would not wear out. And he never made a loan, preferring to keep his money in his strongbox.One day, Todie asked Lyzer to borrow a silver spoon, promising he would return it the next. Not one to doubt holy words, Lyzer loaned the spoon and was pleased the next day when Todie returned it, plus a silver teaspoon, explaining that the spoon had given birth. Todie was honest, and had to return both. He repeated the exercise twice more.At last, Todie came to Lyzer to borrow silver Shabbat candlesticks, which Lyzer gladly loaned. Todie sold the candlesticks, bought his wife and seven children a feast and on Sunday, returned to Lyzer, reporting that his candlesticks had died. \\"You fool! How can candlesticks die,\\" Lyzer screamed, dragging Todie to the Rabbi. \\"Did you expect candlesticks to give birth?\\" the Rabbi asked. \\"If you accept nonsense that brings you profit, you must also accept nonsense when it brings you loss.\\"Others stories are less silly. We meet Peziza the imp who lived with her friend Tsirtsur the cricket an old stove, where they shared gay, devilish, frightening, and delightful stories on long winter nights.And Rabbi Leib, who escaped the evil works of Cunegunde, a witch whose son Bolvan robbed the merchants on the roads and hid his stolen hoard in an invisible cave--rendered by his mother's evil magic.My favorite is \\"Zlateh the Goat.\\" Rueven instructed his son Aaron to take his pet to the butcher to pay for the struggling family's Hanukkah feast. Heartbroken, the heartbroken boy heeded his father and set out, but was overtaken by a snowstorm. I cannot tell what happened, but the tale warms hearts to the core.Like all Singer's work--these 36 agile stories offer spirit, life and the supernatural--with humor glinting at their edges. Children love them, be they young or old.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Stories For Children","review":"I enjoy reading these stories to my kids as much as they enjoy listening to them. These are truly wonderful and riveting stories by a master, who's as comfortable writing about the old country as he is describing quaint Jewish life in Manhattan as an immigrant.

Singer correctly states how the Bible stories are the best for entertaining youngsters since they all have beginnings , middles and endings an he cut his teeth on these same stories.

I have only found four of his stories in print and they all are excellent. The one in this anthology was no exception, although I was a little disappointed at its length (only three pages). I enjoyed the long story Royal Jelly by Roald Dahl quite a bit. His 'horror' stories for adults are always understated but brilliant. The Distributor by Richard Matheson is one of his most famous, but was so complex I had to read it twice to keep track of what was going on. Harlan Ellison, Isaac Asimov and Betty Ren Wright all turn in well written, enjoyable stories as well. My absolute favorite story was by an author I am unfamiliar with: Waldo Carlton Wright. Little Foxes Sleep Warm was an amazing read from start to finish. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"American Nightmare: The History of Jim Crow","review":"_American Nightmare: The History of Jim Crow_ (St. Martin's) by Jerrold Packard is in many ways a difficult book to read, for while the picayune and artificial rules by which blacks were kept in their place in the South are now so obviously stupid, they were for years maintained by whites and endured by blacks. As Packard says, this is a history of the worst of America, an examination of how poorly it had lived up to the ideals for which it really stands. There is also inspiration here, in the courage of black Americans who were able to achieve basic justice out of oppression. There is also some need for congratulation; we have not achieved harmony between the races, but the egregious practices described here will never come back.There was hardly a part of society that the Jim Crow laws or customs did not control. Naturally, the rules were different in different places (leading to confusion for black people who traveled anywhere), but the examples given in the book will remind Southerners who are old enough just how strange the system was. There might be two lines for movie tickets, if blacks were allowed in the theater, and if they were, they had to sit upstairs. In North Carolina and Florida, officials insisted that schoolbooks used by blacks had to be stored in different spaces than those used by whites. Sometimes a town library might have a room for black users, but often they were barred from the library altogether. A 1900 Mississippi law allowed black corpses to be dug up from white cemeteries and sent to black ones. Whereas slaves could have gone to white churches, within a specified section, free blacks were barred from white congregations, who were told that such discrimination was decreed by God himself. Streetcar and bus conductors were given police power to enforce seating regulations; in some places, the front of a streetcar was regarded as the place for inferiors, prompting a white person to remark on the variant: \\"It isn't important which end of the car is given to a nigger. The main point is that he must sit where he is told.\\" Of course Jim Crow ruled on housing, schooling, and voting. Eventually, Packard demonstrates, the economic and social forces from World War II, and the glare of international embarrassment, provided important reasons for the nation to make changes.Whatever forms of racism remain, Jim Crow is dead, killed by hundreds of heroic acts large and small. Thus Packard's final chapters are inspiring, showing Rosa Parks refusing to surrender a bus seat to a white passenger in 1955, and the resultant Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott. A preacher named Martin Luther King, Jr., was launched into leadership by the boycott, which grew into a movement of freedom riding, lunch counter sit-ins, and voting registration drives. It was no easy victory; though the blacks were constantly accused of violence, they were the victims, not the culprits, of church bombings, lynchings, and police dog attacks. Equal treatment should not have been so long denied, and this battle never should have had to happen, but it is in the end a victorious tale. Packard reflects upon the ambiguous lesson that many young people in the south now have no idea what Jim Crow means, and are astounded to learn how ubiquitous it was. His book is a useful and compelling history of the institution, a reminder that understanding the past will help us confront the current challenges of race relations."},{"Title":"American Nightmare: The History of Jim Crow","review":"The African American has come a long way, or have they? American Nightmare: The History of Jim Crow by Jerrold M. Packard chronicles the very beginnings of the well know, well established Jim Crow system developed in America decades ago. It was a successful system that put into place, laws which kept the African America a second-class citizen even after slavery was abolished. The purpose was to keep sacred and separate any person of color from becoming equal to the white establishment.American Nightmare is an intense historical recollection of Jim Crow years and the plight of the African American. It is a powerful book and Mr. Jerrold very skillfully details in length the root causes, the rationale, the religious and educational aspects, and the dismantling of the vicious Jim Crow system. This book reminds us how devastating this era was and that we should never allow anything resembling this degrading system to ever surface again.I applaud Jerrold M. Packard for producing a book that reminds us all of who we are and where we are today. It is an historical and educational guide of the past, present, and for the future of America to strengthen its human rights policies to insure that all citizens are treated equal. As mentioned earlier, the African American has come a long way or have they?

This became known as Jim Crow.Sore losers, the traitors had almost nothing in common with the victorious north, except that lowest of common denominators: RACE. And so, pathetically, the insurgents poisoned the nation's well against the confederates' chosen enemy, the minority, the other, the weak, the landless, their former human-farm-equipment--blacks. Former slaves who would no longer make the south's ends meet for them. That is until they could conjure up bogus laws & rules: vagrancy, sharecropping, Angola-like prisons. And over all: Jim Crow.And so the tail wagged the dog. 100 years of sheer madness was the price the nation had to pay for the south's racism. Their tantrum at having to work for a living.\\"American Nightmare\\" is a sordid tale that could have come from H.G.Wells.But Jim Crow is the century-long, historical truth.Insane? No doubt, but this tome illuminates the dark corners of Jim Crow well. And it strikes just the right note while it does."},{"Title":"American Nightmare: The History of Jim Crow","review":"Although this book was not the easiest read, it was very informative about our country's history. Not only does it cover all aspects of the Jim Crow laws in the legislative branch , but ties in personal accounts of the laws as well. The book gives detailed descriptions of the events that led up to the Brown vs. Board of Education case, which eventually outlawed the \\"separate but equal\\" facilities. The non-fiction book begins with the civil war, and the freeing of the slaves. It goes into detail about when the slaves were finally freed, they had no place to go. President Andrew Johnson vetoed both measures of Congress to aid the former slaves, and some form of help finally came almost three years after the war had ended. The book also explains how the Jim Crow laws came into affect, because the South was still upset that they did not have total control of the African Americans.The book, written by Jerrold M. Packard, is a present-day account of the history of our country. It explains all the concepts of the Jim Crow laws, and how, even today, the laws affect our country. Packard describes for his audience the horrid details of the segregation in our country, and its affect on society today, 40 years later."},{"Title":"American Nightmare: The History of Jim Crow","review":"Life in the South in segregaded times wasn't so bad. Life was easier for everyone. No dissension or crime against the other race. No problems of any kind in this town where I grew up. Only a few miles from here, in Oak Ridge, the school was integrated without provocation, as George Wallace was not our governor. It wasn't so easy to make changes in the smaller towns near Alabama, because of his influence, no doubt. I was told that they were driving around town with guns. Most people were afraid to get out at night.In this town now, it is that way again. No one is safe, but mostly I think it is all about drugs and not race. For thirty years or more, they have had their way with the white trash who wanted the drugs. They have the big cars, Jaguars, Cadillacs, and TownCars as the drug money will allow them to pay cash."},{"Title":"The Oneness View of Jesus Christ","review":"This book is an excellent companion to Bernard's other books such as The Oneness of God and Oneness and Trinity, AD 100-300. It provides a clear scriptual understanding of a subject that is filled with so many confusing man-made ideas regarding the identity of Jesus Christ. Is He the second person in a Trinity or is He the one God manifested in the flesh?

BERNARD."},{"Title":"The Oneness View of Jesus Christ","review":"As with his earlier work \\"The Oneness of God\\" Bernard reveals how unreasonable and confusing his view of the real Oneness of God is. Readers will find that for the most part the Scriptures Bernard cites are taken out of context and distorted by contadictory views of the real Son of God. Oneness theology cannot seem to put a finger on Who Jesus Christ really is. For example, Bernard and other Oneness writers of the United Pentecoatal Church claim that Jesus is really God the Father, however, fail to address the fact that the Apostle Paul speaks of God the Father as \\"the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\\" (Eph.1:3;1 Peter 1:3). Therefore, Oneness is forced into the position that it teaches Jesus Christ is His Own Father and His Own Son, something that any Bible reader would recognize as totally unbiblical. Bernard's book does have value in that it reveals what Oneness theology has developed and changed into in the last century. For a different view of Oneness theology as it was taught in the early days of it's existence by such Oneness pioneers as Howard A. Goss, John Paterson, Andrew Urshan, and C. H. Yadon, the reader is advised to read the new book \\"Christianity Without The Cross\\" by Thomas Fudge."},{"Title":"The Oneness View of Jesus Christ","review":"Suffers the same problems as Bernard's earlier work &quot;the Oneness of God&quot;.

On reading her work, I now understand why. Her writing is simply excellent. And her scholarship is outstanding. Herein, Mrs. Webster has left us with a beautiful and compelling account of the revolutionary movement from the French Revolution to the Bolshevik, the Chinese, the Indochinese, and the African. According to her excellent account, there is a guiding thread throughout all of this revolutionary activity, illuminated freemasonry. And the author certainly makes a solid case for this, skillfully tying together the writings of Weishaupt with the pronouncements of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion and the actions of the Soviet state.However, the work has two flaws, which may in fact be related. Mrs. Webster inveighs against Continental freemasonry, but honors Anglo Saxon freemasonry. She also portrays communism as a monstrous evil, but leaves the evil of zionism totally unaddressed. As it seems that Continental freemasonry is most closely affiliated with the communism movement and Anglo Saxon freemasonry with zionism, it may be that these errors are both intentional and related. In any case, this is an outstanding book, which this reviewer highly recommends."},{"Title":"World revolution: The plot against civilization","review":"Without a doubt, Ms. Webster, an accomplished woman in times when not many did it, is of an excellent breed, the old type, the one that we, at these times, don't meet anymore, not in high frequency, anyway. Erudite, eloquent and wise, not just intelligent, she makes her point pointedly and in an elaborate manner, supported amply by a broad bibliography. I certainly recommend it.One point which I am set to emphasize, is the Jewish question as to their participation and initialization of the World Revolution, an issue that continues to be a thorn in their side stuck there by their vilifiers, those of all kinds, but especially the antisemites and the extreme right, in short their haters, the ones that will use any kind of argument, even the worst or, worse yet, the false, to do that.I would like to bring here a note about this book, written by the American Opinion Bookstore, which is carrying conservative, constitutional and libertarian materials, so no stoogery here. The note is attached to each copy of the book purchased.quote\\"OBITER DICTUMBefore her death in 1960, Nesta Webster corrected errors she had made in earliereditions - mostly due to the limited information then available. In those editions, she had been led to overemphasize the involvement of conspirators of German and Jewish extraction.In the 1971 hardback edition of World revolution, published in London , we find these corrections: on page 10, she states \\"... I devoted some pages to the Protocols. Today, however, both the German and Jewish questions have undergone changes which necessitate a different viewpoint.\\" Again, on page 300, \\"... To regard World Revolution therefore as merely a Jewish conspiracy seems contrary to the facts of history...\\"These corrections are consistently ignored by both her critics and those who wish to perpetuate these errors.\\"end of quoteThis should tell anyone who is of the opinion that it's wise to do so, that this is not so, and to just stop the perpetuated vilification of the Jews, and the deliberate falsification of history."},{"Title":"World revolution: The plot against civilization","review":"I live in Russia and I am old enough to remember last decades of the \\"Communist\\" rule.

How many famous paintings go at great lengths to somehow drape the male genitalia for fear of offending the eyes of both women and men - as though no one has other access to anatomy with their own eyes? It remains a conundrum, this false modesty, one that some of our finer contemporary artists are now addressing.But on to this particular book. As in is previous volumes BITES, this fine photographic survey PRIVATE PARTS in both black and white and color photographs has as its model the male phallus - in varying states of tumescence - and while not every photograph is an art piece (some good shots idea-wise are out of focus or poorly reproduced), the body of work is fascinating on many levels. It is a perfect adjunct to the books written about the importance of size in the male self-perception: while nearly every model sports superior equipment, the sensuous aspect of each photo has more to do with positioning than with girth or preputial statements or piercing. The photographs are for the most part isolated in the privacy of the model's perineum and rarely involve the presence of other models in the same frame.The question arises (!): in this second successful foray into forbidden territory, an apparent attempt to shine light and acceptance on a subject that most artists and photographers avoid, why doesn't Giovanni follow through with stepping forward with his true identity? Just a question. All things aside, this is a very well designed and executed book that hopefully will make a difference in the psychology of phallus avoidance.

This \\"soda straw\\" perspective is a sure way to over-task people, make project cost and delivery unpredictable, and ensure a poor reputation for the organization executing projects. While business leaders do not set out to cripple and distract their organizations, the lack of an institutionalized process frequently yields poor results. While this book addresses the narrow space of project alignment with organizational objectives, the authors propose a framework and tools that organizations with the commitment to follow it through can use to get optimum results from their project portfolio. Specifically, the approach offered by the authors helps organizations align their project portfolio with corporate objectives, align individual projects with one another, and enable organizational flexibility.The process provides a certain rigor, but those seeking to implement this process in their organization should consider 1) first implementing a functional basic project portfolio management process, 2) ensuring that the process proposed in this book is a good match to their organizational culture, and 3) that in implementing this process they do not over-engineer their project portfolio management process.Those proposing this process for adoption, or who are conducting a project portfolio alignment workshop, may wish to visit the book Website (HBSP), which has Microsoft PowerPoint slide presentations and graphics available for download. This Website is a useful adjunct to the book.This is a useful book for project portfolio managers in organizations who want more rigor in their project portfolio management process.Utility of the InformationThe value of the book, in my view, lies in the following attributes:* The authors present complex ideas in an easy-going, not scholarly style, making the book easy to read. They use graphics to communicate concepts like frameworks and tools, and they employ a case-study approach to illustrate application.* The framework consisting short- and long-term objectives along with organizational trait objectives provides for a balanced perspective.* The alignment tools provide an approach to view projects in a portfolio view. This allows the portfolio management team to align projects and the portfolio with organizational direction, improve project efficiency, manage risks, and achieve flexibility.* The framework and tools consciously align the project portfolio with organizational goals, bringing focus to the portfolio.* Workshop attendees can use the tools to gain fresh a perspective of projects instead of a traditional, organizational alignment point of view where, say, projects are always associated with the division who sponsors the projects.* Incorporates a change management perspective by asking how much change an organization can digest in a given time period.* Supports and promotes program management by forcing analysis of the interdependencies of projects and project deliverables.* Supports and promotes spiral (iterative development) through the \\"project chunking\\" perspective.* Aids the risk management process by balancing project benefits versus risks in the project proposal and review process.* Portfolio managers or teams can apply the framework and tools in a step-by-step fashion, reducing anxiety about \\"how to eat the elephant\\". This stepwise approach supports workshop breakout sessions.Application of the Framework and ToolsSeveral questions arise when one considers if one can apply an authors approach to solving business problems; is the approach practicable.Position of the Framework in the Larger Project Portfolio Management ContextIf the project portfolio management process includes 1) understanding supply and demand (people, money and projects), alignment of decision boards with authority, project assessment, and continuous process improvement (IPS Associates and Stanford APM), this framework fits toward the end of that process spectrum. This book does not describe the overall project portfolio management process, or how to implement project portfolio management in an organization. This book really answers the question \\"Now that I have a project portfolio management process in place, how do I mature my portfolio alignment and balance process?\\"Feasibility, Suitability and AcceptabilityFor organizations which have implemented project portfolio management and wish for more rigor in the project-business alignment sub-process, this book is a credible offering. One would expect that if a portfolio management team applied all the tools in this book to their portfolio that the result would be 1) a considerable time investment and 2) a better aligned portfolio. The portfolio management team must therefore be willing to take the time to 1) learn several tools and 2) apply the tools in a step-wise and iterative fashion over time.The framework, tools and examples emphasize application in a business (for profit) context. Practitioners in governmental or other not for profit organizations will need to critically review, tailor and possibly adapt the framework and tools to their purposes.Organizations with a small number of projects and who have portfolio management team members who are more inclined to make decisions quickly, who are not possessed with an engineering or analytical mindset may think that they do not need or have the patience for such a process. Team members may respond to this approach saying \\"I'll just use my business experience and common sense to achieve balance in my portfolio\\". While this statement may or may not be true, I would expect this response in some cultures. One approach to this may be for the portfolio management support office to compile the data, apply the tools, and make a staff recommendation to the portfolio management team for decision.While the authors bring both academic (McFarlan is a professor) and business experience (Benko is a consultant) to this book, they cite no studies to support the effectiveness of their approach. Therefore, organizations which require empirical evidence of process effectiveness before accepting or implementing a new business process may be resistant to implementing this process.References, Footnoting and BibliographyThis book is well referenced, footnoted and indexed. This increases the utility of the book for one who has first read and understood the book.One can often tell when an academic was on the team of authors; the footnoting is excellent, and the Notes section (Benko and McFarlan 221-30) is a useful resource for exploring other sources of information for further research. Specifically, the notes section is ample at nine pages, the lexicon is helpful with three pages of content, and the index is well populated with nine pages of indexed words."},{"Title":"Connecting the Dots: Aligning Projects With Objectives in Unpredictable Times","review":"I read about this book in CFO & CIO so I picked up a copy.

Focus is on alignment of projects with concern's goals (short-term, long-term, and in \\"traits\\" to handle globalization-world's uncertainties), with each other, and against the \\"world context.\\" Book does state to check your guns at the door, and your slide rule, too. Approach is not quantitative as presented, and requires good faith relooks at projects. Individual tools are described to bring out misalignments, and list projects on a sheet of paper with the results of the tool analysis in a table form. Traits suggested are of four types, eco-driven for forming alliances and focusing on your own concern's strengths, outside-in for viewing yourself as stakeholders view you and adjusting your priorities accordingly, fighting-trim for being responsive and adaptable, and house-in-order for breaking down silo-thinking. Tools are in three groupings. One for traits. A group of three for alignments. And another group of three for reforming projects by looking for common threads, breaking big projects into chunks, and doing contingency planning. I don't believe I have the capability to assess the book further without trying it out, ideally in a group setting, against projects that people feel is important to them.

Today's companies need to bring their misaligned, overlapping, and inconsistent projects into alignment through \\"frontier living\\". This means delivering results in the present while adapting for the future's business context by using four \\"traits\\" to configure your project portfolio for confusing, volatile, and unpredictable conditions.The title of the book refers to the need to &quot;connect the dots&quot; between an organization's objectives and its project investments to create and balance present and future value. The book's plethora of tools combined with the easygoing writing style makes it engaging and painless to absorb. Benko and McFarlan can be forgiven for overstating the role of project alignment - that is, after all, the standard book author's tendency. It is true, however, that companies project initiatives total up into the trillions of dollars and it requires no stretch to accept the claim that those initiatives have grown faster than companies' ability to manage them. Benko and McFarlan focus on the project portfolio as the most promising key to unlocking value, arguing that the portfolio is a company's future currency. We find their underlying principle that \\"companies are better served by adapting themselves for the future rather than by trying to predict its destination\\" to be a sound one.Alignment, in this book, specifically means aligning three drivers of business performance: a company's project portfolio with its objectives; the projects in the portfolio to each other; and the portfolio and company's objectives with the ever-changing realities of the business context. To prosper on the \\"information frontier\\", certain shifts in mind-set - \\"traits\\" - are needed. Along with operational short-term and strategic long-term objectives, these constitute the organization's *intentions*. Four traits are used throughout the book as each of the various tools are explained and applied: Eco-Driven (effective collaborations), Outside-In (looking at yourself the way others look at you), Fighting Trim (agility, coordination, and options orientation to deal with uncertainty and respond to change), and House in Order (provisioning the other traits to enable cross-enterprise collaboration).The seven alignment tools in this book fall three groups. The Trait Meter assesses, plans, and measures trait development according to the four traits. Once this first step is completed (which includes creating an Intentions Framework), the second group of diagnostic tools comes into play: The Intentions, Sides, and Right Brain tools. These measure the nature and size of the alignment opportunity, identify organizational bias and sort projects into business activities, and identify change capacity issues. The third group of tools - Common Threads, Project Chunking, and What-If Planning - focus on building flexibility into the portfolio.Working through the book for real will, of course, be far more challenging than merely reading it. But the authors have done a good job of clarifying important issues of alignment and have provided a workable and appealing framework and toolset for tackling those issues.(3 stars from me is good. 4-star ratings are given too easily.)"},{"Title":"Connecting the Dots: Aligning Projects With Objectives in Unpredictable Times","review":"Connecting the Dots is a great read for anyone working in IT management. It can help you gain better control of your capital expenditures and information technology projects - both critical success factors in our industry.Some of the ideas in the book are new and some aren't, but the book has done a great job at simplifying these concepts (ie. portfolio management) and making them accessible and usable. Instead of the usual \`pie in the sky' statements, this book dives into a company and illustrates how the tools and frameworks can be used in a typical business. It's refreshing to find the kind of book that can help you manage the execution of these issues.The book claims that a company's project portfolio is what moves it into the future and provides great tools and techniques that teach you how to get your company to focus on producing business results and think about the bigger picture: where all these projects are actually taking your organization. The book also does a good job at helping you bridge the technology and business sides of an organization even though I could have done without the business history lesson in Chapter 2.This book can easily be read in two to three hours. I just read it over the weekend and was able to start applying some of the ideas."},{"Title":"Connecting the Dots: Aligning Projects With Objectives in Unpredictable Times","review":"This book provided a useful framework for helping me think about the biggest challenge facing my company: growing the business while reducing costs. Connecting the Dots provides a unique approach by focusing on the project portfolio. Through greater alignment, organizations better focus on their goals while reducing costs through improved efficiency. It's a clever solution that breaks the logjam between growth and cost cutting that paralyzes a lot of organizations.The other new idea which I liked was how the book thought about the future. With an interesting historical context, Benko and McFarlan basically recommend that companies should focus on &quot;adapting not predicting.&quot; They counsel companies to build &quot;traits&quot; into their organization. These characteristics reflect the future of the networked economy. It will require most organizations to take some time to wrap their heads around the concept and translate it into tangible goals for the company but I have already begun experimenting with the concept.Overall, the book gets you thinking about the importance of your project portfolio and how it can help you prepare for uncertainty. It then provides interesting tools and techniques for achieving greater alignment.The book is an easy to read and engaging. It's written almost like Warren McFarlan's speeches. Lots of historical references and analogies. Moreover, the book doesn't &quot;preach at you&quot;, rather it understands that each business has it's own context. And they reconginze that you don't need to adopt all their recommendations and techniques.For conceptual thinkers, I'd skim chapters 5 and 6. They are for people who like to slog through the details. I found Chapter 1 was a great overview and Chapter 4 provided concise summaries of all the tools and techniques. If you are looking for a practical but novel approach to producing results, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Connecting the Dots: Aligning Projects With Objectives in Unpredictable Times","review":"I thought this book was well written and the examples are salient. One of the major benefits of the book is demonstrating the benefits of how to clearly link the portfolio of projects to the company's strategic map. By having a strategy map, the company drives consensus,creates common vocabulary and establishes entry point for performance measures.The expected benefits which can be expected are:* Aligns the business and IT initiatives and provides foundation for achieving the mission.* Decomposes the business mission into specific business capabilities and then determines the technology solutions required.* Analyzes the current IT architecture, organization and processes to determine if they provide an adequate foundation for the business solutions.I would highly recommend this book to any one who wonders \\"why are we working on this project\\"."},{"Title":"Connecting the Dots: Aligning Projects With Objectives in Unpredictable Times","review":"I don't read a lot of business books because most of them are to hard to apply to everyday business issues.

Helping her besides her feline bodyguard Louie is her lover Max Kinsella (a magician and part-time counter terrorist operative) and ex-priest Matthew Devine. Matt has also been stalked and threatened by Kathleen O'Connor an IRA agent, who wants his virginity in exchange for leaving him and the females in his life alone. Max, who was once Kathleen's lover, and Lt. Carman Molina of the Las Vegas Police Department tell him to have sex with a high priced call girl so that he wouldn't be of any value to his stalker anymore.He takes their advice and when he leaves the room, the hooker was very much alive. When Molina sees her she is dead and she knows Matt is the last person to see her alive. Molina suffers a crisis of conscience because she has to think of him as a suspect even though she doesn't want her personal life to spill over into her professional one. Meanwhile Max is busy infiltrating the Synth, a cabal of magicians who might be responsible for the murder attempts on him, Matt and Temple. Midnight Louie saves Max's life from an old enemy with a long grudge.Temple Barr, who is usually center stage in the Midnight Louis novels, plays a secondary role in CAT IN A NEON NIGHTMARE. The spotlight shines on Max who must come to terms with his own feelings of guilt. Midnight Louis is the true hero of this tale as he saves a life and guards the two men who are an integral part of his human's life. This book is the cat's meow.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cat in a Neon Nightmare: A Midnight Louie Mystery","review":"Las Vegas has never been so boring.This series has gone progressively downhill since &quot;Cat in a Jeweled Jumpsuit&quot;. CND has stopped writing characters and has started to write caricatures. We all know Temple is petite and loves shoes. We all know Matt is an ex-priest. We all know Molina is dedicated to her job and her daughter. And, I swear, if I see the totally cliched phrase &quot;lone wolf&quot; to describe Max one more time, I'm going to scream. After fifteen books, we get it. Really, we do. Try moving beyond those character shortcuts to give us something fresh about these people.Max has become the ultimate Marty Stu. There isn't anything the man can't make happen and it removes any suspense from the book since CND simply will not allow Max to fail. He's annoying, smarmy and two-dimensional at best with all his ramblings about the &quot;Auld Sod&quot; and his cousin; and he goes on and on in this book about it in this look-at-me-angst fashion that, frankly, makes me want to tell him to get over it more than anything else. He's solely the author's deus ex machina.Matt did some growing in the beginning books but he's been stalled out for the last few novels as well. A crisis of conscience or faith is one thing. A crisis of conscience or faith stretched out over several books is quite another because the conceit loses its effect the more it's taken out, looked at, and dissected. At a certain point, it stops being introspection and becomes navel gazing and CND bangs on about it well past that point.Midnight Louie's faux noir ramblings are stale and tired as is his little sniping relationship with Midnight Louise. I don't need Louie to give me a rundown of everything that I've just read in the previous chapters or to be at just the right place at just the right time. He's as much of a deus ex machina as Max is at this point.The Synth plotline has run on far too long. Quite honestly, I don't care and all CND's attempts to make them seem mysterious and deadly are really just laughable. Why should they be all that formidable when Max can apparently thwart them/find them/gain access to them with ridiculous ease? At least the Kitty the Cutter plotline finally finds some resolution - enough that I don't have to hear about her again and again and again and again...This is definitely the last CND &quot;Cat in a...&quot; book that I will read. They are no longer fresh, inviting and cozy reads. Instead, they are hackneyed, tedious and lackluster with characters who remain trapped in amber."},{"Title":"Cat in a Neon Nightmare: A Midnight Louie Mystery","review":"In _Cat in a Neon Nightmare_ Matt Devine deals with the moral implications of his date with a call girl and its aftermath, Max indulges in some unwonted maudlin introspection while continuing to track down the mysterious \\"Synth,\\" Temple alternately feels betrayed, works a convention for no apparent reason and considers the strange differences between men and women, and Lt. Molina tries very hard to convince the reader that she's right about everything while acting her usual \\"I must be strong while denying everything feminine about me\\" role. Oh yeah, and Louie wanders around getting underfoot to no real purpose.I really enjoyed the first nine or ten books in this series, but at this point I think Carole Nelson Douglas has bitten off more than she can effectively chew. Personally, I like a book with a coherent plot. \\"Neon Nightmare\\" pays lip service to the idea of actually having a crime solved in every book, but the ostensible main story is pushed so far to the rear of the various sub-plots that in the end it seems pointless; it added that little to the book. All in all, the book had a very scattered feeling as it leapt from one subplot to another without much evidence of any connecting thread.CND is not a bad writer, and there are times even here when her descriptions of place and action are very engaging. Unfortunately all too often the book devolves into the internal musings of the characters, all of whom seem to have read way too much pop psychology, which often causes them to make smug value judgements about the choices of anyone with any kind of alternative lifestyle. I am also just a little bit tired of the continual revelations that every single character has some major abuse issue in his or her past. All in all, the tone of the book crossed the line, at too many times, into the sententious and preachy.Added to that, the book was sloppily constructed, with numerous pointless scenes, jumps in timeline, missing explanations and inattention to detail -- for example, referring to the barrier between the actor and the audience as both the \\"third wall\\" and the \\"fourth wall\\" at different times, using similes based in ignorance, and not knowing how to spell \\"Spider-Man.\\"I must admit that I still have some curiosity as to how all this is going to turn out. But at this point I think I'm going to give it one more book to convince me that finding the answers is worth the trouble of continued reading."},{"Title":"Cat in a Neon Nightmare: A Midnight Louie Mystery","review":"I just discovered this series a couple books back, but I went back and read all the previous books (tip: there's an interior alphabet in the titles after the first two books). What a trip! This is unlike any mysteries series I've read, more like a long-running TV series where the characterization just gets richer along with the plot complications.Of course there's the addictive voice of Midnight Louie, the hard-boiled cat PI, coming and going between the adventures of the four main human characters. Louie is \\"just a cat\\" to the human characters, so it's only the reader who knows what he's really up to and how he helps them solve crimes. He's all cat and yet also a very funny send-up of PI cliches. The Las Vegas background provides even more larger-than-life opportunities for poking fun at human (and feline) follies.The four humans include two professional crimefighters and two amateur, so the action can be satirical and amusing . . . or darker and thought-provoking. While there are traditional murders to solve in the books, the sequence is as messy as in real life, with some crimes going unsolved as an underlying conspiracy is slowly revealed. I found in reading the series in one go that the earlier books had little clues sprinkled throughout that became significant later, so I really recommend starting with Catnap and Pussyfoot. The books even get thicker as the story gets richer and more intricate, and rereadings reveal even more of the fine points. I love series that create a universe you can get lost in, that always feels bigger than the book you're reading right now.This book surprised me though, with sudden plot twists that totally turned my expectations (and some of the characters') upside down. The edgy relationship of the humans (two men and two women, all interesting. . . and they DON'T all have abuse issues) really drives this series. Romance is a factor, but so is rivalry.This series is unique for being wildly amusing, suspenseful, and thought-provoking all at the same time. I can't wait for the next installment, and hope the author invents a way to extend the alphabet!"},{"Title":"Cat in a Neon Nightmare: A Midnight Louie Mystery","review":"I just read Cat In a Neon Nightmare, and overall found it an enjoyable book in the series. I've been reading the Midnight Louie series since the early 90's, and have often recommended the books to friends.And, though there is some truth to the complaint that the stories have become a bit too PC and preachy, I have to admit these stories still leave me with that feeling of immediately wanting to read the next one, wondering what will happen. And there were some interesting plot twists in this one. I also find them very re-readable. I would also recommend CND's Irene Adler series."},{"Title":"Cat in a Neon Nightmare: A Midnight Louie Mystery","review":"I've just finished this one, and each book in the MidnightLouie series becomes more exciting! I love the Big Cats and the addition of Louie's mother. I see the love interests of the main characters becoming more confused, complex and even more interesting. I enjoy the characters immensely and feel that I know Temple, Matt, Max and even Molina. I can't wait for the next book to come out in paperback to find out what happens to all of them next.I've loved this series from the beginning because of the continuing character growth as well as the humor. And the zany Las Vegas background has evolved along with the main characters.The author spoke recently at my local library, so I asked how come books I love, like this one, sometimes get such negative reviews online. She said sometimes a book's content will hit too close to home and really push a reader's buttons; at least that's what she's found with completely negative reactions. When I showed her a review on this book that was so opposite my reaction, she also said that people's opinions are just that, and they can't be argued with.But she also was pretty puzzled that someone complained she'd labeled the character of Max as a &quot;lone wolf&quot; so many times it was to the point of nausea. So she did a word search for the phrase after she flew back home and emailed me the results: Max is called a lone wolf in only one of the 16 books: this last one, Cat in a Neon Nightmare. She only found that the phrase lone wolf used twice in earlier books, once by the cat detective, Midnight Louie, contrasting feline and canine behavior, and once as a metaphor for a motorcycle that plays a role in the series.Amazing, some people aren't really seeing what's in the books, they're reacting to what they think they see. In fact, their comments can be downright wrong in terms of fact as well as opinion.So my advice is to read these books for yourself and make up your own minds. And write your own review if you don't agree with with what's posted!"},{"Title":"Cat in a Neon Nightmare: A Midnight Louie Mystery","review":"You will want to read this series in order.

I haven't. This is the first \\"Midnight Louie\\" book I've read.I won't be reading any more of this series, though I might try the author's Adler series.The author spends a lot of time trying to bring new readers up to speed. Unfortunately, the attempts to explain the various twists and turns in past books add little by way of clarity, and serve to distract the reader (at least this reader) from the story at hand.While this mystery theoretically addresses the violent death of a woman, the human characters invest relatively little time, energy, or thought in trying to solve that mystery. The feline characters are considerably more interested in finding out what happened.The investigation of this death is lost amidst a tangle of sub-plots. Characters appear, initiate discussions of Important Topics (not related to the woman's death), and vanish.Imagine someone going to the roof of a building with a bushel basket of tennis balls. Imagine that person upending the basket so that the balls fall to the sidewalk below, bouncing in every direction. Imagine the person then describing where the various balls bounced to, and where some of the balls came to rest. That's the sense I had with this book -- the author's attention followed this bouncing ball, then dropped that one to check out another bouncing ball, and then on to another, then back to the first from another perspective. The investigation of the character's death was just one bouncing ball, often overlooked.For me as one reader, this book was completely unsatisfactory as a mystery.Readers who like stories with a lot of divergence would probably like this book better than readers like me, who like a sense of convergence and even closure of the story at hand.Readers who enjoy characters who are talking cats, or characters who are humans with a penchant for feeling many emotions and then expressing their views about how they feel to other human characters, will undoubtedly like this book better than I did."},{"Title":"Cat in a Neon Nightmare: A Midnight Louie Mystery","review":"I discovered the Midnight Louie books over 2 years ago and have ravenosly read them all. Cat in a Neon Nightmare is full of unexpected surprises. A major chapter unexpectedly closes here and through Mrs. Nelson Douglas' artistry we are made to feel the void opened by this event as closely as those it affects in the book. Almost every character this time around is exposed to a truth or happenstance that disappoints them/shocks them at a deep soul biting level and we feel it right with them. Everything is not black and white, not all things happen due to premeditation--like real life--somethings just do. A wonderful continuation of the Midnight Louie adventures and by the emotions it evokes, a wonderful example of what a writer can make their readers feel when they have a grasp of the craft as well as Carole Nelson Douglas obviously does.

Besides, I liked it, too."},{"Title":"Fox Makes Friends","review":"Please understand that my son did not even acknowledge there were other children at the library story time until he had been going for approximately one year. The presence of the other children either:1) totally blew his mind and he couldn't process it;or 2) dismayed him through watching their unpredictable behavior.Now understand, this child has been around people from the very start (we have a big family), and he gets along well with adults. But he doesn't click well with other kids, and the idea of making friends with one of these specimens was really too much for him to imagine at age 4.But this book, with its pun on \\"making\\" friends, really clicks with him. It sort of lit the light that doing stuff alongside another person is a first step to friendship. The ending line, that they stayed friends forever, I just gloss over -- this child comprehends \\"forever\\" and would scoff at the very notion that a predator and two prey animals would stay friends through the next snack time, let alone forever.We still read it. It is very well illustrated, and we all need reminders about making friends through being friends."},{"Title":"Fox Makes Friends","review":"My daughter loved this book at 5 years old and still loves it at 6.

No matter how much we talked about how to make friends, his efforts basically consisted of walking up to someone and growling, glaring, and making gutteral noises. I'm sure you can imagine how well that was working for him.So, I looked for all the age-appropriate books I could find on making friends. I found several, but this one seemed to click with him more than all the others combined. He asked me to read it to him many, many times over a period of many months, and still sometimes asks for it again. He loves it.While reading it, I would talk about why the \\"friends\\" he built weren't really friends, and how he made friends with the rabbit and squirrel without even realizing it, and how that happened (the fox asked for their help and they did things together). After a while, he was telling me what the problem was with the built friends and how he really made friends.Today, at 5, he usually seems pretty comfortable making friends with kids his age. This book was a huge help.Also, the illustrations are beautiful. This is one of the few books I don't get tired of reading repeatedly.I would enthusiastically recommend this book for any child around that age.

However, don't just read it and think that &quot;it&quot; will come to you. It takes time, thought, and introspection to WORK through this book. I left the position I was formerly in which resulted in an 8% pay cut, however my life it much more balanced, I'm incrementally happier, and I can't believe the difference (nor can my wife or in-laws!).

An Updated Guide to Your Second Life","review":"I love the title of the book! It's mainly the reason why I bought it. However, I almost didn't read beyond the introduction. I began to think, &quot;This isn't for me!&quot; Among the folks who decided to &quot;run away&quot; included a stockbroker (yoga instructor), a lawyer (blacksmith) and a company vice president (winery owner), people who could most likely afford to leave the corporate world behind and yet still be financially secure when they started up their new ventures.I would have preferred an introduction that included what an everyday office worker or a laborer dreams about doing. They want to run away too, but can't afford to hop aboard the circus train. Whose success story can they read and really relate to for inspiration?Running away and joining the circus is a grand idea if you're looking for something new, exciting, and fun! The adventure lies in getting there. Just make sure you don't end up with the same bunch of clowns! And watch where you step!"},{"Title":"Is It Too Late to Run Away and Join the Circus? An Updated Guide to Your Second Life","review":"I think the author presents an intersting theory about managing midlife career changes.She asks the reader to think of themselves as a small business and she then maps out her theory of how a person can sucessfully run away to the &quot;circus&quot;. She does so by using an organizational approach to managing change. 1)The organization as a whole 2)Groups and 3) the individual. All of these &quot;rings&quot; need to facilitate the change so the transition can set in. Each of these is then divided up into 3 subcategories for a more individual, internal approach to making a change. This is where it gets dense and I do think some of chapters could be pared down.I don't think the author is encouraging people to &quot;run away&quot; she is asking the reader to confront your environment. Sometimes it is not you, it is your environment. She is encouraging the reader to dream, evaluate, design and find your new &quot;circus&quot; before one is assigned to you."},{"Title":"Is It Too Late to Run Away and Join the Circus? An Updated Guide to Your Second Life","review":"The people who think Smye is encouraging people to &quot;run away&quot; and ignore problems apparently didn't read much more than the title of the book. It's a metaphor, and in fact to be able to &quot;run away&quot; from something that is affecting you requires being able to recognize what that thing is in the first place. That is Smye's first message in this book. The second is how to accomplish that. Just &quot;toughing it out&quot; in the face of evidence that things aren't right isn't always the best solution. Sometimes leaving things behind is the right choice... and the hardest choice you'll ever make. This is true even if the changes might seem superficial at first glance.As someone who is currently in the midst of a drastic career change, Syme's book is one of several that I've found helpful. Not all of it is great, and Smye's somewhat brusque and occasionally sarcastic tone might put some people off. But there is enough substance that most folks seriously considering a big change will find food for thought. Don't expect one book to change your life -- that part is still up to you! But Smye might give you some insight into what's eating you, and some ideas and tools to help you figure out how to fix things... even if you don't want to become a clown or a trapeze artist."},{"Title":"Is It Too Late to Run Away and Join the Circus? An Updated Guide to Your Second Life","review":"The back cover of the book touts Smye as an important \\"thought leader,\\" whatever that is, but it sounded impressive, so I had high expectations for this book.After reading the book, however, I found most of the advice is basically common sense. Anyone who has spent five years or more in the corporate world will already know much or most of it, but there is some value in bringing this sort of practical information under one cover. Perhaps I would have found it more impressive if I hadn't been expecting so much. Still, there is much good advice here and Smye's style is quite readable and certainly not dry or boring.The book's message, however, is pretty basic and hard to argue with: change is inevitable, so you either get in sync or learn to adapt to it or get run over. And if you can follow your own mantra and opt out of the corporation, even better. That I can certainly agree with. However, I also appreciate the fact that most people, as in the example of the book, can't became a Yoga instructor and sacrifice the better paying corporate job to do that.I wanted to say one more thing about American business's fascination with continuous change. Of course, the goal of change is \\"improvement.\\" It is difficult to disagree with this idea in theory. And I agree with Smye that people need books and info like this in order to better deal with change. However, to my mind, that's not the main problem.Especially in the corporate world, there is too much change just for the sake of change that is not particularly well thought out or original and therefore not likely to produce anything positive in the way of results. Or, the changes are based on a good idea that had real potential but the execution is so poor that it has little effect or ends up causing more harm than good. There are even times it is obvious to everybody (except management) that the new changes are completely wrong-headed but get executed anyway, and then they're surprised when they have a disaster on their hands.That having been said, given that changes are quickly and inexorably coming your way, Smye's book contains, as I said, much good advice on how to deal with change that most people will find helpful.Finally, and not to sound too cynical about it, but it's just the reality of the situation--management loves it when employees really get behind the new, proposed changes--so you can probably win points that way with your boss if you do. Again, at the risk of sounding too Machiavellian, you do have a choice in terms of how you handle change that will put you in management's good graces or not--and may even influence your future career or not--irrespective of the validity of the changes themselves.The principle lesson here is that it is better to be an agent for change rather than just remaining passive and having it forced on you anyway. The choice is up to you."},{"Title":"Is It Too Late to Run Away and Join the Circus? An Updated Guide to Your Second Life","review":"It's an OK book.

An Updated Guide to Your Second Life","review":"Found the book to be encouraging people to run away from the issues that we all deal with on a daily basis. Instead of helping people to pull it together and make their relationships, jobs, family situation, etc better, this book tells you to run away. Wouldn't the world be a chaotic and insane place if we all ran away from our responsibilities and joined a circus.Also, I can't believe that 6 people even read this dumb book!"},{"Title":"Is It Too Late to Run Away and Join the Circus? An Updated Guide to Your Second Life","review":"This book is poorly written for the immature, those unable to commit or take responsibility for their lives. Rather than work on a relationship or issue, according to Smye, just run away..leave your job, your family and all responsibilities and drop your self into a different place...and when that gets tough, just do it again, and again. When does it stop? When is it time to stop running away from your problems?Immature, weak in content and message.DO NOT recommend!!!"},{"Title":"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896","review":"I've read this book several times and it has a special place in my heart as one of the best books out there on prayer and spiritual healing.It is a compilation of Mrs. Eddy's writings and includes &quot;Christian Healing,&quot; which is a MUST READ for anyone interested in prayers that heal and restore.Also included in Miscellaneous Writings is &quot;Ways That are Vain&quot; which is one of the best explanations of evil that I've ever seen in print.If you just want to know more about Mary Baker Eddy, this book really gives an inside look at the woman's life and work. &quot;Retrospection and Introspection&quot; (in Misc.

An interactive hyperlinked table of contents makes this book a dream for serious students of Christian Science.When the text is all over the place, as in some versions, it is distracting.

Altar Ego is the kind of book that shocks you with its outrageous characters, naughty scenes and devilish humor. Definitely a book to read for pure entertainment.On her wedding day, 32-year-old Becky finds herself hiding in the bathroom with one pantyhosed leg hanging out the window. With fears of marriage running rampant and the horrible idea of being monogamous filling her with dread, Becky does the only feasible thing - she jumps. Naturally, fianc&eacute; Julian is devastated; however, he doesn't give up and decides to continue with their relationship as is. Meanwhile, Becky gets all sorts of advice from her best friends: anti-men, psycho-feminist Kate and desperate-to-marry-royalty Anouska.And then the unthinkable happens.... Becky meets Zachary, an American rap star trying to make it big in Europe. He's rude, crude and socially unacceptable, but he's also gorgeous, sexy and wild in the sack. Torn between a comfortable and safe relationship with boring workaholic Julian or a glittering rock-star romance with Zachary, Becky does what she does best - she takes the fun, easy way out. This one simple action begins a spiraling domino effect that will inspire shock and humor for the reader. Finding out what Becky will do next is half the fun. Seeing the unnecessary results of her actions is the other.Altar Ego is an outrageous romp of a novel, candidly fresh and downright dirty. Each deed done spawns another twice as bad and leaves the reader gasping and wide-eyed. A true pleasure to read with an important lesson to be learned: Future brides, beware. This could happen to you.... Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Altar Ego","review":"This is a &quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot; wannabe but without: 1.decent writing 2. believable dialogue 3. likable or credible characters, or 4. wit. I've never written a review about any book, but if I can save just one person from buying this horrible thing, I consider my time well spent. The author is overcome with her own wit, which is so far from being amusing that I found myself cringing at every line. I finally put the book in the furthest reaches of my shelves with a note on it not to lend it to anyone I like. It's like a bad &quot;Three's Company&quot; type of sitcom."},{"Title":"Altar Ego","review":"This is British &quot;new feminist&quot; humour at it's very best. Kathy Lette really nails it with this one! I giggled, gasped and on occasion blushed at this very humourous take on a &quot;party girl's&quot; life, loves and tribulations. It was my Mum who gave me book as an early wedding present just 2 weeks before I took the plunge. Becky's character is great - funny, smart, strong and what many of us wish we had the nerve to be like. Good Girl!! Kathy - keep up the great work. I look forward to your next installment of bitter sweat life."},{"Title":"Altar Ego","review":"Maybe I'm missing something by quitting halfway through, but I found the book annoying and disgusting. (And it's hard to disgust me)"},{"Title":"Altar Ego","review":"Kathy Lette is one of the most talented writers I have come across in a long time. Her wit is sharp and her ability to bring it to the written page is magical. This story of Becky Steele, a woman who wants her cake and eat it too, will make you laugh out loud, wince in despair at her ludicrous life choices, astound you with her amazing ability to live out what should only be fantasies ... I could just go on and on. The book is funny, sexy, a little on the crude side at times - but I adored it!"},{"Title":"Altar Ego","review":"Kathy Lette is an Australian living in London and in Altar Ego, the humour of both continents is mixed into a politically-incorrect novel that will have you weeping with laughter. Lette is clearly well-versed in antipodean one-liners and mixes these with British inuendo to produce a naughty-but-nice novel that I class amongst my 'girlie books that men can read too'.Becky Steele gets cold feet on her wedding day and jumps out of the bathroom window - right into the arms of Julian, her fiance. Things move from bad to better when she meets Zach, an American rap star trying to make it big in Europe, and she decides to dump Julian and move in with Zach. Unfortunately, it hadn't dawned on her that she still loved Julian. From that point, the story moves forward like an unstoppable wall of water. Events tumble out of control and Becky finds her life getting more and more convoluted.Rich with dubious and memorable characters, Altar Ego is a rollicking roller-coaster ride of sexy mishaps. If you're easily shocked, leave this one alone. If you enjoy bawdy fun, grab it now and get laughing."},{"Title":"Altar Ego","review":"Honestly I tried to give this book a chance. I struggled through to the end of this book despite the fact that I kept telling myself to just put it down and never pick it back up again. But unfortunately I did pick it back up and it never got any better. I do not get offended easily, however, as an African-American woman I found parts of this book to be very offensive but, sorry to say, that was not the only downfall of this book. \`ALTAR EGO' was not very funny, the characters were totally unlikable (to the point where I almost didn't even care what happened to them next), and the ending was completely unbelievable.Becky, the main character of this book ditches Julian, her fianc&eacute;, at the altar feeling overwhelmed by the idea of commitment, despite this Julian takes Becky back into his life and his home. But at a friends wedding Becky meets an American rap star and begins a long-term affair with him. Throughout this book Becky proceeds to hurt everyone in her life from her lover and fianc&eacute; to her best friends and yet Lette expects us to feel sympathy for her when things don't go her way. I am a big fan of British humor but \`ALTAR EGO' is not a good example of a \`BRIDGET JONES DIARY' style of book. And the portrayal of this Lenny Kravitz type rap star (a combination that is unbelievable enough by itself) was a completely inaccurate representation of American culture. Simply put \`ALTAR EGO' was just plain bad, 1 star!!"},{"Title":"Altar Ego","review":"Becky is in her 30's and about to get married, but at the last minute...she asks herself, \\"Am I really ready to be with just one guy for the rest of my life?\\" No more one night stands?

Where will life take her? Who will she choose? Who will have her? Well, you will have to get this book because I am not going to give all of it away!This book has everything and will have your head in a spin! Your stomach will hurt with laughter!
