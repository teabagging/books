The dangers and privation in the fishing industry of the time are appaling by present standards in what is still a dangerous business. The journey into manhood and the development of character, as well s the quality of mentoring is still inspiring."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Rudyard Kipling's original 1897 novelistic way of telling CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS offered many things to many readers. It was short, nautical, cod-fishing oriented, about a spoiled rich kid Harvey (Harve) Cheyne, Jr., given a bloody nose and made to grow up quickly among a small multi-national body of fishermen good at their work. The nine other males, all lacing their speech with sea jargon, were gifted with plenty of gab to fill idle hours at night or during bad weather with tales of the sea. Kipling also wrote of the lost at sea boy's grieving mother and of his self-made multi-millionaire father. These simple elements are well translated for children ten years and older by adapter Malvina Vogel and illustrator Max Landgraf.But Kipling's original in addition to its simple plot had depths that fascinate and puzzle adults and keep scholars busy throughout their careers.-- CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS: the title refers to an early modern English heroine named Mary Abree who fought against Spanish \\"Captains Courageous\\" in the Netherlands. A major puzzle: what is the title's relevance to a Kipling's story in which the only females to have any roles worth mentioning are two mothers concerned for their teen age sons at sea, along with one young woman grieving for her recently drowned,fiance, yet another teen on whom a boy on Harve's schooner has a schoolboy crush and finally a flock of Portuguese beauties in Gloucester courted by Manuel -- the fisherman, who plucked drowning Harve from the Atlantic?-- Symbolism abounds in the novel -- secular, religious, supernatural, superstitious: the sea as baptism, Captain Troop's bloodying young Harve Cheyne's nose as analogous to a bishop's wake up slap at Confirmation, the 70-ton fishing schooner We're Here as small floating monastery full of hard working celibate male monks who welcome 15-year old Harve as a novice.-- Kipling also warned against the then already increasing contemporary excesses of America's Gilded Age led by ill-educated Captain of Industry Harvey Cheyne, Sr. and against the extra amoral self-seeking future edge that tycoons like Cheyne will gain when their offspring take degrees from Stanford and their great grandchildren flourish Harvard M.B.A.s.Kipling's text, though not long as novels go, is probably six times longer than adapter Malvina Vogel's. Fortunately for young readers, illustrator Ken Landgraf's sketches take up just as many pages as Vogel's shortened text. Vogel, unlike some of the three film versions of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS, retains all of Kipling's major characters and Landgraf sketches each of them, including the barely mentioned girl friend of 15-year old Harve's year older teenage shipmate and friend Dan Troop aboard the 70-ton fishing schooner We're Here.There are several things that the 2002 Vogel-Landgraf Great Illustrated Classics version of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS have made me think about. I will conclude this review with just one of them. No matter which version of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS I have dealt with: (the original in both a scholarly and a non-scholarly edition, the simplified illustrated abridgment of Vogel-Landgraf and the three filmed versions), I have always found it hard to believe that a successful search for young Harve might not have been made.-- First: might not the liner that he fell overboard from, have halted and begun to ask the numerous fishing boats on the Grand Banks if they had heard of a boy being picked up from the sea?-- Second, the fishing schooners, some more often than others, would put into Canadian or French ports in the Bay of Saint Lawrence for bait, supplies, new sails, etc. Kipling tells us that it did not take long for news of Harvey's rescue to spread through the regular \\"fleet\\" of 100 schooners out for three months of fishing. Why wasn't one of them, once it reached land, asked to send a telegram or write a letter at least to a newspaper about the happy event?In Kipling's Chapter Seven, an ocean liner traveling at 20 knots in thick fog cuts the fishing trawler Jennie Cushman in half. There are only two survivors. Harve Cheyne's We're Here picks up one, its captain. The nearby schooner Carrie Pitman rescues the Captain's injured son. The Carrie Pitman's captain then invites the father to join their depleted crew for the rest of the fishing season and to be with his son.The captain of the Carrie Pitman said in Kipling's words: \\"We're runnin' in fer more bait an' graound tackle.\\" In her version, Malvina Vogel writes of the Carrie Pitman: \\"She was headed back to Gloucester for more bait.\\" That is not likely. For Gloucester, Massacusetts, home port for 30 or 40 of the fishing schooners, is a thousand miles to the southwest.The Carrie Pitman would have gone somewhere much closer for bait and ground tackle. But she wherever she went would have been inhabited dry land: island or continent.QUESTIONS:-- Why didn't 15-year old Harve Cheyne ask to be transferred forthwith to the Carrie Pitman and get back to his parents as fast as possible?-- Why didn't Harve's rescuer Captain Disko Troop not suggest the same thing?-- Or at least write a letter to be passed to a newspaper?I noticed this apparent gaffe by Kipling only when Malvina Vogel rewrote it as an impossibly bigger gaffe.I plan to read the simplified, illustrated Vogel - Landgraf edition to the three youngest of my six grandsons when my wife and I drive 75 miles south tomorrow to overnight with them. Later I will give it to them as a present. I do not doubt that they will eat it up and ask for more.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This book by Kipling is impressive.Though it is not as good as Harry Potter and other books it is well thought out and has a good choice of words which improves vocablary immensly. The story is imaginative and the characters of Harvey, Dan Troop and others are well described. Though this book is interesting it does not absorb or engross you. Mr. Kipling did a better job in his other books like Oliver Twist etc. Though the book is original and the hard work is visible it is not any masterpiece. From spoilt children to fishermen the book has its own world. Though I have read it many a time with interest and liked it better each time I have liked Rudyard Kipling's other books better still. It is a great book for sea lovers."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"While the plot may be a bit outdated (we don't go in so much for moral improvement stories these days), the real star of Captains Courageous for me was the documentation of life aboard a cod trawler at the end of the last century. All-night gutting and salting sessions, life among the fleet, the risks and lifestyle -- all fascinating. I read it in conjunction with Cod: Biography of the Fish that Changed the World, and the two together were a terrific education in how exactly fish gets onto our plates, and the risks that people take to get it there."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"As others have noted, this is the tale of a spoiled rich brat, who has the very good luck to fall off a luxury ocean-liner at sea, and be introduced to the Real World of hard work, earned money, and self-respect which is deserved.Rudyard Kipling once again shows himself to be a master story-teller, and the story of the friendship that grows between the Portuguese fisherman, Manuel, and the former brat, Harvey Cheyne, is memorable.If you like this book, be sure to see the classic movie made from it, with Spencer Tracy as Manuel."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Of course an excellent book, truely a classic. I have read it to my children and will likey read it again to them and perhaps their children."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This is one Kipling opus that didn't age well at all. It depends far too much on an assumed interest by its readership in seafaring and the culture of the fishermen of old New England. Page after page after page. Then after that there's a lot of gee-whiz-ain't-he-rich stuff that gets old fast. And all the while these two teenage boys are having this great time working their butts off in the sheer drudgery of manual labor. With all that, it's very hard not to fall into an abject slumber and then to wake up fervently wishing this particular read was all over. Hey, you want a good book about a guy who gets picked up at sea and gets forced to work for his keep? &quot;The Sea Wolf,&quot; of course! It's a 10!"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"A lot of the people that gave this book a low rating are lucky that they were not forced to read it for summer homework like I was. I am at the second to last chapter and so far there has been no suspense, or plot, it is just a kid doing chores and catching fish. The way the sailors talk is anoying but easy to get over, the overal story however is hard to understand, many of the terms used are words that not many people know, and when the virgin comes out of the water, well what the !@#$ is the virgin what dose it look like? The author dose not say. There are some exiting moments but the book is overall boring. Mabey it's just the school's fault for making kids going into 7th grade read this type of book. I think an Adult would enjoy this book much more than I did. If you are a kid then you should probably not get this book."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"I enjoyed the book because it was short, around 200 pages, and read it in 1 day. Not a whole lot of detail like the kind you see reading James Fenimore Cooper, but it is one that will not let you put it down. Trying to understand the slang used in the book can be rough at times but a minimal knowledge of naval terminology will get you through it. It is a simple tale with a simple point to make. Hard work pays off. If you have a person in mind that needs this type of nudging, this is a fairly inexpensive, short read, book that will keep them entertained while getting a point across. You can read about the contents of the book in other reviews, I just wanted to let eveyone know it isn't as horrible as a previous reveiwing states."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"All sixteen year old boys should be required to read this book.

He won that at the young age of just 42, in 1907. He had made a career as a journalist and writer working in India and England. His main strength was the short story.The present book - a Penguin Classic - is not a literary masterpiece. This is a 200 page story aimed at a reader - who I suspect - would be a teenage boy or similar. It is a story about how a young boy, Harvey, falls overboard on an Atlantic crossing from a cruise ship that sailed from New York. He is rescued by a fishing boat that is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Most of the story - for about 125 of the 200 pages - is about Harvey and another boy, named Dan, who he meets on the fishing boat. Harvey has lead a pampered life, but undergoes some character building as a result of the accident and then his time on the fishing boat, helping catch and clean the fish.Later, Harvey bonds with his parents.This is not a great novel by a Nobel prize winner, and if you are expecting a masterpiece in literature you will be disappointed; but, it is a short introduction to the writing of Kipling, and most teenage readers will enjoy the book. As an adult, I thought it a bit slow in the middle, and I was not too excited about the use of so much colloquial English.It reminds me of a \\"Hardy Boys\\" novel for teenage boys, or younger."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This book is very boring. The characters (except for Harvey) speak very poorly which makes them very hard to understand. There are a lot of ain'ts which drives me crazy. This book seems to jump from one thing to the next. They might be talking about cod and the next minute they talk about cattle. It is one of those classics which was appealing back then but not now. Captain's Courageous is about a spoiled boy who transforms into a good person with the help of some fishermen...This book has made my top three dullest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This book was so stupid.

Behind ye!&quot; And does anyone know what &quot;Pshaw!&quot; means? This is a boring book and I would never hope that a poor soul has to ever read this book again in the history of mankind!"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Captains Courageous is a wonderful story of a pampered and indulged boy, the son of a millionaire, named Harvey Cheyne. He has no responsibilities and is given anything he wants. He lacks respect for anyone and that includes himself. He is washed overboard from a luxury liner while on a trip with his mother and is picked up by a fisherman. The fishing boat can not return him immediately because they have a crew that needs to earn a living. Harvey's family presumes that he is dead, drowned at sea. The story of Harvey's growing up involves responsibilty, hard work, trust and honor. Rudyard Kipling tells the story marvelously. The story is brilliantly crafted and a pure delight to read. The language of the story gives it the feel of the times and helps illustrate the rough lifestyles involved. This is a grand morality tale of adventure, human nature and the value of real love. I read this as a young teenager, but now (many years later!!) I see what an awesome author Kipling truly was!!!! This is a book to be read again!"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Many people say this is a boring book, or has no story line, or is just about someone working their b---- off, but I found it to be a *wonderful* book.Harvey Cheyne is a spoiled brat who falls off a ship and is picked up by a small fishing boat. Since the boat can't possibly go back to port without getting a full load of fish Harvey will have to wait. Meanwhile, since he _is_ eating their food (the man who does not work shall not eat...), they quickly have him join in on the work aboard ship. He goes against it at first, but gradually comes to see what really matters in life. It's not how much money you have- but how you affect those around you. Harvey learns diligence and plain, hard work. Sure- it's not always a ton of fun, but no one said life was pure fun. He learns many lessons through different experiences. I found this to be *very* enjoyable. I also liked reading about the different descriptions of how fishing was done back then.All in all, this made for a very fascinating read, and I recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Is The Captain Courageous enough for a Critique? The book \\"Captains Courageous\\", written by Rudyard Kipling is the struggle of a young, immature boy learning what it is to be a real man through different hardships and ordeals he encounters. The young boys name is Harvey Cheyne. The book is an adventure story take takes place on the ocean. The struggle that Harvey goes through could be argued that it is similar to Kipling's life in a way. Harvey is a fifteen-year-old boy whose parents are extremely rich. He has a very demanding and strong personality that shows up early in the novel. Harvey is thrown into a situation where he has to learn to become a man so he can survive. In the beginning Harvey falls of his ship into the ocean where he is then rescued by a small New England fishing boat. He demands that the captain returns him to his home with his parents and wealth, but the captain and crew do not listen. If they were to turn around they would lose several hundred dollars. Instead the captain makes a deal with Harvey. He tells him, that they will feed and clothe him if he helps on the ship. Harvey has no other choice so he accepts the deal. When he first begins work he is clumsy and slow at getting it done. He has never really had to do physical work before, so this is all new to him. Harvey works for months on the fishing vessel and some changes finally become apparent. His hands are rough and covered in work calluses, unlike the soft and smooth hands he use to have. He also begins to realize what it is like to be a real man. He has to work not only for himself, but for others as well. He also learns that everyone has to put their best effort into everything they do so everyone benefits. Later in the book Harvey witnesses a death of a Frenchman. While watching the funeral he realizes how important life and death really is. At the end of the story Harvey is returned to his family, but not as an immature boy, but as a strong and stable man with a new look at life. Throughout the novel Harvey goes through different hardships that shape him into a new person. Kipling also went through different events that changed him into a different person. At an early age Kipling was put into a foster home where another family then took him to the South Sea where he was beaten and bullied. He was left with psychological scars and a sense of betrayal. Kipling was taken away from his family where he had no control, just like Harvey when he fell into the ocean and then had to stay on the fishing boat for several months. Kipling was also bullied in a way just like Harvey was. Harvey had to do things he wasn't use to and it wasn't his choice. He had to do this to survive and Kipling had to do things to keep progressing through his life. Kipling was also reunited with his family after some his life changing events took place. Kipling also experienced a death like Harvey, but it was a bit different. Kipling had to experience dealing with the death of his son John. His son was killed in action during World War 1. This death was different then the one Harvey saw, but it still left a huge impact on his life. After facing his childhood events and going through a war and the death of his son, Kipling had many ideas he could use in his writings. The events might not have been good ones from his life, but they stuck with him for his whole life. Throughout the novel Kipling used many descriptive words to help give me the whole idea of what was going on. At times it was like I was there and was experiencing it in first person. Kipling did a good job at keeping me interested throughout the book. He didn't leave the story hanging, or have many slow and boring points in the book. There was always something to keep my interest. I also like how it was easy to understand and I didn't have to analyze everything to make sure I knew what was happening. I like how he seemed to base some of his ideas for this story on his own life. I think in doing this he gave the story extra thought into how it was wrote. I also think because he bases some of it on his own real life experiences he knew how to describe the events in the story better. The book, \\"Captains Courageous\\", is a well-written adventure story about boy and how he changes through part of his life. With well describe scenes and a good story line; Kipling keeps the reader interested through the whole book. If you are a person that likes a good adventure story or likes to read about opinions on how some people change throughout their lives then I recommend this book. I think that the story would have been a bit better if at the end the story had continued a bit into Harvey's life once he was back with his family with his new knowledge. Overall, I think that Kipling did a good job with the descriptions and whole idea of the story."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"The main character of this book,15-year-old Harvey, is one year older than I am, so I am in a unique position to know that he was very fortunate to be taught the life lesson he learned. I know some people who would benefit from this lesson. This book tells of a story where arrogance must be tossed overboard to survive the challenges of life. Harvey learned about that the hard way. It paid off tremendously. He finally appreciated his parents instead of torturing them emotionally. He learned how to fish and to earn his keep. Harvey became a genuine person to his father, to his mother, to the crew on the We're Here, and to himself. Perhaps you should read Captains Courageous, too."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"This book is loaded with convincing and picturesque details of life at sea in a small fishing boat, and details particular to the time. But these are the book's best points.Characters are 2-dimensional and relatively unconvincing, the prose is loaded with jargon (interesting and picturesque jargon, but still jargon), and the story line, though believable, is uninspired.The basic tale is this: a spoiled rich brat falls off a luxury liner, and is saved from death in the depths by a small fishing boat. On the boat, for the first time in his life the brat must follow orders, and do some real work. It's a good basis for a story, but done unrealistically. (If you want to see the same basic idea done well, read &quot;Sand&quot;, by Will James) The supposedly incorrigible brat converts overnight, and begins doing his best to learn the ropes. The conflict is over instantly, and all that is left to the book is the details of day-to-day on the fishing boat, with an occasional adventure.It's not terrible; it is believable in most ways, loaded with interesting detail, and has a satisfying ending. But it has little or none of Kipling's more typical tales' whimsy and grace of language."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"An exciting, sea-faring adventure, Captains Courageous was first published in 1896. It takes place in the North Atlantic in the late 1800s. The main characters are:Harvey Cheyne, a 15-year-old boy raised in high society who has been indulged with the best of everything;Disko Troop, captain of a small fishing boat, the We're Here, who teaches Harvey some important lessons; Dan Troop, Disko's son and Harvey's comrade while stranded on the ship.Summary:The rich and spoiled Harvey Cheyne was on a large ship with his adoring mother in the middle of the sea when he tumbled overboard. His own ship couldn't find him in the thick fog. Luckily, a Portuguese fisherman hauled him into his dory and brought him safely back to a fishing boat, the We're Here. Harvey told the captain of the boat, Disko Troop, how he had fallen overboard and that he would be generously rewarded by his father, the rich Mr. Cheyne, when he took him home. Disko thought Harvey had &quot;swallowed too much seawater.&quot; Instead, he put the boy to work. At first, Harvey did not accept this as he had never done a days work in his life, but Disko Troop made it clear that unless he wanted to swim home, he would work for his stay. So Harvey worked. At first, he got the most undesirable jobs like cleaning and salting the cod they caught, as well as mopping the deck. Gradually, as Harvey began to prove himself a hard worker, Disko Troop gave him jobs that required more responsibility. As Harvey learned the ropes of the fishermen, he grew to like it and began to be accepted as one of them. But, when will he get home? Will he want to go home? What will the fishermen say when they find out who he really is?On a scale of 1 to 10, Captains Courageous deserves a solid 9 because it's a great adventure and the characters become real people in one's mind."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"When I started this book, I couldn't help but make some comparisons to Jack London's, Sea Wolf. The protagonist is picked up by a boat at sea and wants to be dropped off on shore, but the captain refuses and, instead, solicits his help on the ship's voyage, hoping to teach him something about real work along the way. And right about there the two novels diverge. While Jack London's, Sea Wolf goes through an increasingly complicated plot and conflict, Rudyard Kipling's, Captains Courageous simply lets us in on the cruise. Though they take two very different courses, I think that they both succeeded in their separate endeavors. Kipling relies on his description and scenes to set the story before us, and he achieves this masterfully. Describing life on board a fishing vessel could very easily turn out to be tedious, but Kipling uses such nice language and great characters that you almost feel as if you are there experiencing it with them, through the good and the bad. The ending is hardly surprising, but more importantly it feels right. One thing to note is that, while Kipling does describe things fairly well, this is still written back in the age of sail, so many of the terms are taken for granted for someone not well versed in that era. If that is the case, the reader might feel lost for a good portion of the story. Still, the writing is pleasant enough that you almost don't need to know what is going on, you're just happy to be along for the ride."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"Like many other teenagers, I was quite reluctant to begin the task of reading Captains Courageous. Since it was required reading, it couldn't possibly be exciting reading, right? Wrong! I found Captains Courageous extremely entertaining, exciting, and thought-provoking. I feel like many people, young and old alike, can learn a lesson from Harvey Cheyne. Though Harvey saw himself as a big-shot, he was just another laborer in the eyes of the We're Here crew. In the overall scheme of things, we are all equal. When it came to sea-life, Harvey's privileged upbringing availed little. I would certainly reccomend this book to anyone who likes adventure stories, or who just likes a good book!"},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"For a better experience, watch the movie instead. This 'classical' work is full of accents (o -> aou, as in naouw rather than now) and nautical jargon. Deciphering them detracts from the experience of reading. Be prepared to skim.Harvey Cheyne falls off his cruise line and gets picked up by poor fishermen. They don't believe he's rich and make him work, beating the bad habits out of him (violence solves problems, nice life lesson). Harvey accepts his situation unrealistically fast. The major conflict is over within twenty-five pages, and swiftly the novel is reduced to a tedium of everyday life on a fishing boat circa 1890, English waters. The other high point (near the end) is Harvey having a heart-to-heart talk with his Dad about his adventures.A good beginning and end, but tedious middle. This is a window into old fisher customs, and not a coming-of-age novel (minor theme). As a man's man, Captain Long Jack finds his way into derivative works, and I was curious enough to read the original. This 'classic' work needs modern editing for readability and story flow."},{"Title":"Captains Courageous","review":"With such a classic novel like this, its important that the image you get from a casseste is the same you get in your head from reading it.

I look forward to this author's next work, and all her books to come."},{"Title":"The Mermaid of Penperro","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesKonstanze Bugg was married to a much older man who abused her and isolated her from everyone and everything. One especially dreadful night, she just snaps and realizes she has to get away immediately. She takes several valuables from her husband's home, figuring she can sell them, and heads for Cornwall, to a small cottage left to her by her uncle. She longs to escape her past, yet remain true to the promises she made to her mother, an opera singer whose talentKonstanze inherited, before she died. Konstanze takes only her trusted servant Hilde on her journey to freedom.Tom Trewella was Konstanze's late uncle's solicitor, settling the man's estate. He is also the mastermind behind the smuggling ring operating out of Penperro, which is how many of the townspeople make enough money to survive. Upon meeting, Konstanze, he is immediately attracted but forbidden as she is already married and he has no idea why she left her husband.Robert Foweather is the chief Preventive officer for the crown, sent to Penperro to put a stop to the smuggling centered there that is costing the King thousands of pounds. As he is investigating a cove one day, he comes across Konstanze who was there sunbathing on a rock as she sang. Foweather is struck by the beauty of her song, and her appearance, and is convinced she is a mermaid.Tom seizes upon Foweather's mistake and convinces Konstanze to play along. A scheme is born. Konstanze will pose as the mermaid and make an appearance every time Foweather starts to get too close to finding the smuggling ring. She will serve as the distraction necessary to let the smugglers operate as usual. She disagrees at first but later gives in, relishing the chance to play at being something more exotic and exciting than she herself is. This forced constant contact between Konstanze and Tom causes sparks to fly and attraction to grow. But it is all bittersweet as she knows nothing can come of itas she is still married. Will they be successful in their plot to distract Foweather? Will they give in to their newfound love and find a way to be together?This is an exciting story, full of humor and comedies of errors, as well as plenty of passion to satisfy every reader. This book is different from Ms. Cach's other books in that it is not even the slightest bit a paranormal. It is also far more inspiring of lustful thoughts than many of her previous works. This book borders on erotica in a few scenes and is definitely enjoyable to read.The characters are enchanting and will all attract plenty of attention. From the beautiful and talented Konstanze and the intelligent mastermind Tom, to the soulful vicar Matt and the formidable Hilde, and even the bumbling but comedic Foweather, there is bound to be a favorite for everyone. Ms. Cach never detracts from the primary storyline, even with all of the side line plots happening at the same time.Having read all but one of Ms. Cach's previous works, this reviewer has seen a marked improvement to the talents in each one, Mermaid of Penperro being the best to date. Ms. Cach is well on the rise to stardom in the genre, guaranteed to become a powerhouse of the romance market in the not to distant future. Each and every book is a delight, bound to be a keeper. The reader will certainly be looking forward to each future book."},{"Title":"The Mermaid of Penperro","review":"Konstanze had been gifted with her mother's talent of singing opera.

A horrified Buffy learns she is now known as &quot;The Lost Slayer,&quot; forgotten by the Watcher's Council. The most dramatic scene in this book comes early, when Buffy stages a chilling escape from her cell after resolving the cliffhanger that ended Part One, when August, the recently imprisoned second Slayer called to replace Faith, decided to kill Buffy so that a new Slayer could be called. This is definitely one of those sequences that is too intense for small children. Meanwhile, in the present, Giles is still being held hostage while Willow and the Scoobys discover something is not right with Buffy.A photograph of Willow appears prominently on the cover of &quot;Dark Times,&quot; because Buffy's best bud is a significant figure in both of the time periods in which this tale is told. Christopher Golden might have gone back to the start of Buffy's freshman year at UC-Sunnydale (i.e., the beginning of Season 4 of &quot;Buffy&quot;), but he is obviously setting up Willow's growth as a Wicca on the show. The once and future Willow gets to see almost as much action as the Slayer this time around, which is one of the strengths of &quot;Dark Times.&quot; Certainly there are some flaws in the story, having mainly to do with the fact the vampires actually put a door into Buffy's cell (without which, escape would be totally impossible), but such things are easily forgivable when Golden has constructed a storyline that is trying to work on the same sort of operatic level as the best Buffy episodes (e.g., &quot;Becoming&quot;). I can still nitpick the details and thoroughly enjoy the novel.One of the things that makes &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; one of the best shows on television is that there is a dark side, a world in which bad things happen to good people and the world just might come to an end as we know it. In &quot;Dark Times&quot; we get to see such a world, which is as horrific as when Anyanka granted Cordelia's wish that Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale in &quot;Dopplegangland.&quot; Unlike &quot;Prophecies,&quot; where the book ended with a dramatic cliffhanger that made you rush to pick up the next installment in the series, &quot;Dark Times&quot; ends with a shattering revelation as Buffy receives some unbelievably bad news. Thus, Golden again achieves the main goal when writing a serial novel: to leave the reader dying to find out what happens next and read Part Three, &quot;King of the Dead.&quot;"},{"Title":"La Maison haute (French Edition)","review":"(Based on the Dutch translation) La Maison Haute is a collection of stories from people either working or living in the Kotelnicheskaya Naberezhnaya building in Moscow, one of Stalin's \`seven sisters' skyscrapers built in the 1950's. Basically these are pretty much individual stories of people who happen to be bound by this building for as with many residential towers, there doesn't seem to be much social interaction between the residents. Of the residents, there is a sharp distinction between old Russians who were invited to live there because they have a gift for the arts, and modern and also foreign people who live there because they have a talent for fast money. It's not a book about the ordinary Russian. As a skyscraper is an extreme building type and as such presenting these two groups of 'extraordinary' Russians side by side, one can have a glimpse of the impact of the rapid political and economical transformation of Russia."},{"Title":"Nature's medicines;: The folklore, romance, and value of herbal remedies","review":"Richard Lucas Nature's Medicines Parker Publishing Award Books NY 1966This is a popular style book on 30-40 natural plants/products that can be used to alleviate physical problems.

Scientifically, Mr. Ford makes no mistake, as there are many antioxidants in wine (primarily anthocyanins extracted from tannin-rich reds); however, one cannot overlook that wine contains alcohol, a chemical which has been well-documented as toxic. The French Paradox provides for very interesting reading, as it sheds an entirely new perspective on a long-examined indulgence. Mr. Ford's words must be taken with a grain of salt; He is not providing a solution, rather just a fresh bout of information to supplant the nutrition experts. If viewed intolerantly, The French Paradox can only serve to feed the &quot;educated fool&quot;, as many &quot;experts&quot; have so often done in glorifying numerous unverified methods of grandeur."},{"Title":"The French Paradox & Drinking for Health","review":"This is the book the wine industry wants you to read. It is completely out of date. It makes the well known case that wine is good for your because it reduces your risk of cardiovascular disease.

It is also really bad for cognitive skills for obvious reasons.There are far better ways to get the cardiovascular risk reduction benefit of wines.

Her books stand out among the best. This book was also well-written. My problem with it was the very sad turn of events it takes. It was too much. Even though the ending made up for it, I was too wrung out."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I am always advocating for more drama in romance novels, so I didn't think I would say this, but this novel had too much drama. I just finished reading it and it has my emotions in turmoil. I would certainly recommend it, but beware, this is not a lighthearted, easy to read story, nor is your usual, uncomplicated romance. This book gets you emotionally involved, makes you lose sleep and throws your feelings into a whirlwind at times. I think for the first time since I started reading romance novels, I found one that made me unsure it would have a happy ending. The novel got so complicated and tragic at times that I really feared for their &quot;happily everafter&quot;.I just learned when I read the review in this page that this novel is loosely based on real facts. Maybe that explains some things that happened that I considered unnecesarilly tragic, like the death of someone towards the end of the book that made absolutely no sense to me, since it didn't contribute anything important to the main story and was a very sad event. I won't say who it is as to not spoil the surprise. You'll know who I'm talking about if you read the novel.The one complain I have about this book is that it was too long. In fact the first one hundred pages or so, where so slow that I actually put it down 3 times and read other books before I finally decided to finish this one. In the end I'm glad that I read it completely, because after the first initial calm the book picks up the pace, but after that outburst, it slows down again after Elizabeth marries. Her married life took too much of the novel, and John Campbell, who was supossedly the other main character rather dissapears from the book for long periods of time, only appearing sporadically. During that time the story is only from Elizabeth point of view, and we don't know much about John. The novel was more about Elizabeth journey from an innocent little girl to a mature woman, and I felt that John was only slightly more important in the novel than the rest of the secondary characters. To put it in other words, if the novel was a movie we would probably be seeing more of the villain and the support cast than the hero. I really think that more than 400 pages of small print were not justified to tell the love story of this book. But then that is just my personal opinion.This said, I can only add that if you are ready for a strongly emotional and intense novel, don't miss this one. If you are just looking for a light and fun read, &quot;Undone&quot; is not for you."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"After reading the reviews that panned UNDONE, I felt I had to write a review.I very much enjoyed this story and read it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down! It is an extraordinary example of the BEST that Romantic fiction has to offer!!!There are two points I wanted to make in response to other reviews posted here.I appreciate the research that Ms. Henley and her team has done and it made this novel exceptional in its genre.I researched Elizabeth Gunning online and I also saw that Elizabeth had three children from her marriage with James. However, I give Ms. Henley kudos for her use of artistic license which allows Elizabeth to have one child from that marriage. It is essential to the storyline, and in keeping with our ideas of what a romance novel should be, that the child be fathered by her true love and not the &quot;villain&quot;. Three, all fathered by John and not James, would have been ridiculous.Yes, we DO expect to see the lovers end up happily together in the end. THAT is what makes it a romance novel. I enjoyed the twists in the storyline which kept the lovers apart and kept me on the edge of my seat.Ms Henley has created wonderful complex characters in this novel and I enjoyed watching them grow and mature through the story, especially our heroine. Elizabeth begins our story as a 16 year old girl who is completely controlled by her mother and becomes a strong and courageous woman and mother before the story is through. I was shocked when Elizabeth refused to marry her true love after she had become a widow, but after reading on it all became clear. Elizabeth was refusing MARRIAGE (essentially a state of ownership in those times) not LOVE. After considering this last twist I also understood that Ms. Henley was being true to her characters and I appreciated the novel all the more for it.Thank you, Ms. Henley for an extraordinary novel!!!"},{"Title":"Undone","review":"Setting - Great Britain 1751 ---- Virginia Henley has taken a piece of history about a common, lowborn but beautiful young woman, done her research, and given her readers this romantic and fictionalized remarkable story of her life. The young woman, Elizabeth Gunning (1733-1790), and her older sister Maria, whose beginnings from an impoverished family rose to impressive heights through the ambitious and clever manipulations of their mother. With nothing but their incredible good looks these two sisters, manipulated by their ambitious mother, posed as minor nobility where they were soon courted by the cream of the Georgian nobility. Elizabeth, became a Duchess, not once but twice and her story is told in Henley's most impressive and sensual style.The story is told from Elizabeth's meager beginnings in Ireland, where she first met the handsome John Campbell, heir to the Duke of Argyll and her story is fictionalized and chronicled thru to her first marriage to Campbell's enemy the Duke of Hamilton. The author will depict Campbell's love for Elizabeth as all consuming, yet, he alone knowing the truth of her origins, couldn't see his way clear to offer her marriage due to the difference in their status. When the Duke of Hamilton heard of Campbell's regard for the glorious Elizabeth, he thought to kill two birds with one stone by tweaking his archenemies nose and gaining for himself a \`trophy wife' and duchess!The fictionalized story of the Gunning sisters rise to fame was, for me, a most enjoyable read. The historical details were numerous as one comes to expect in a novel from Henley, yet I was unaware of the existence of this person until I read the author's note at the end. Be that as it may, where it is fictionalized I found it to be deeply sensual with some very torrid love scenes. One can only imagine that for a woman in that early period of history to have won not one, but two Dukes of the realm in marriage, must have been a most remarkable woman. So, for those of you looking for a most enjoyable and entertaining look back into history - enjoy, and for those looking for a very sensual and steamy read - look no further! **** Marilyn, Official Reviewer for www.historicromancewriters.com"},{"Title":"Undone","review":"In Virginia Henley's much awaited new release, UNDONE, we meet two lovely sisters, Elizabeth and Maria. Both sisters are equally lovely but their mother Bridget favors Maria, the oldest, and sets her very ambitious sights on her. Since they are poor and Bridge comes from a theatrical background at first she trains both daughters to be actresses. As their prospects change, Bridget realizes she can set her sites higher and decides to enter society and present her daughters. To do this her husband must borrow huge sums of money, sell their family home, and present an air of wealth.Elizabeth, who had met John Campbell quite by chance before moving to London, meets him again in society. They are drawn to each other and there is a very passionate connection between these two characters. Elizabeth, constantly overseen by her very dominate and controlling mother, finds herself maneuvered from party to party, and giving up lovely dresses to Maria, her sister, in her mother's effort to marry her off. Elizabeth, whose natural and genuine appeal shines through, befriends Charlie a very wealthy heiress and her beau Will, a friend of John's. As they plan many secret \\"couple rendezvous\\" events John and Elizabeth become closer. Meanwhile, Bridget continues to plan her daughters' future and as John leaves for Scotland and official business plans for Elizabeth to marry the very wealthy Duke of Hamilton. Realizing that John will never marry her, and the prospects of her family lie in her hands...she marries the Duke.This story is lovely. Virginia Henley has reigned in her fiery pen to tantalize us with a subtler sensual tale than her previous works. Still filled with the steamy scenes we all expect from Ms. Henley, this story is presented to us at a slower pace, allowing us to get to know and care about the characters. Elizabeth's delightful innocence and growth into a strong woman who knows what she wants is an empowering tale for anyone to read who knows the progression from girl to womanhood well - and the trials and tribulations that shape a persons character.UNDONE is not be missed!"},{"Title":"Undone","review":"Let me start with the good before I go to the bad...This book is a lusty novel full of romance (how cliche!)... The two main characters are helplessly in love and are tragically kept apart by a sequence of events. Sounds like the perfect novel, no?Well, I don't know about you, but passion doesn't hold a novel together. This is not the book to curl up and read if you want a light happy reading. Expect to be brought to the brink of tears over and over again.I personally read this and felt as if the author was playing with my emotions a tad to much. The drama was becoming well insufferable. There came a point that I honestly was ready to put the book down and not pick it up again. Now don't get me wrong, drama can be a good thing, and the use of pathos (the techinque of playing with the readers emotions) can create a very very good book, but only if it is done subtly. By the end of this book I was honestly happy I had finished it, almost like someone would feel after they weathered a hurricane.If you like the tragic romance, this book is for you, but if you are like me, and read romances to get that warm glowy feeling after you finish, I don't suggest it. It is, in all aspects, a matter of taste..."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I read this book when I was deployed in the Middle East back in 2004. The story of this romance novel was just so different from the way many of romance novels are written and I could not put it down. I carried this book in my duffel bag and read it in a tent, a humvee, the chow hall, and even for long hours stranded on flightlines on my way to Germany. The story offered a great escape from my current environment then and made me smile, laugh, feel sad, and fortunate that I had those few moments to take this book out and read it whenever I had the opportunity. I pictured myself reading this at home and probably letting the dish pile up because I just did not care for anything else (a little too much but at the time it offered a better alternative than missing my husband and home). The heroin Maria was a victim of circumstances and her own cruel mother. She had to go through a series of tests but in the end came out triumphant against all odds. I loved it that she was married off to someone else but she still had her first child from the man she truly loved. Well, just read it and enjoy the twists and surprises."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"In 1751 in a remote part of Ireland, Duke John Gunning and Elizabeth Gunning, meeting for the first time, share a Midsummer Night's Dream encounter. Both are attracted to one another, but neither expects an aristocrat and a commoner to run into each other ever again as their circles are quite different.Elizabeth's pushy mom plans to have both her daughters perform on the stage. She turns to her friend actress Peg Wolffington for help. Peg takes to the two young females and arranges for the three women to see her perform at Dublin Castle. She goes so far as to sham a relationship insisting that the two siblings are daughters of Viscount Mayo, a lord in the most remote isolated part of the country. However, also at the castle is John, whose silence can only be bought with kisses from the real Elizabeth, not the performer.This is a fun Georgian Era romance that puts a twist on the taboo of acting by making it an acceptable occupation. The story line grips the readers as John and Elizabeth fall in love, but must cope with the overarching reach of her mom, who would be the mother-in-law from hell. Fans of the period will enjoy Virginia Henley's latest tale because as usual the author provides a deep historical piece inside a strong character driven romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Undone","review":"In 1751 in a remote part of Ireland, Duke John Gunning and Elizabeth Gunning, meeting for the first time, share a Midsummer Night's Dream encounter.

However, also at the castle is John, whose silence can only be bought with kisses from the real Elizabeth, not the performer.This is a fun Georgian Era romance that puts a twist on the taboo of acting by making it an acceptable occupation. The story line grips the readers as John and Elizabeth fall in love, but must cope with the overarching reach of her mom, who would be the mother-in-law from hell. Fans of the period will enjoy Virginia Henley's latest tale because as usual the author provides a deep historical piece inside a strong character driven romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Undone","review":"Supposedly Ms. Henley &quot;researched&quot; this book before she began writing - if that was the case, then I really think all the &quot;research&quot; she did was to verify some names and places and leave it at that.I don't know, maybe I would have enjoyed it better if I hadn't done a little research of my own before I started reading it, but unfortunately I did. The book was ruined for me because I kept thinking how Beth had more than one child by James Hamilton, the dates were all wrong, and how the actual story of their wedding was a heck of a lot more romantic than the fictional account Ms. Henley gave.The dialogue just wasn't up to par for her either, with the characters coming off just a little stilted. And since Ms. Henley was taking the literary license that she was, it would have been nice if perhaps she would have seen fit to give Beth a backbone, rather than just let her mother and Hamilton walk all over her the way they did. I would have also liked a little more story with Beth and her first husband. Supposedly she was scared of him, but I could never quite understand why?As for the ending, well, that just seemed to be tacked on to the end to give a little drama to the book, but it didn't make any sense in the flow of the narrative. Beth had spent nearly the entire book in love with this man, so why bulk at marriage when he was proposing? Was the reader supposed to be surprised when Beth decided to marry him after all?This could have been an outstanding book if she would have stuck to the facts a little more - that and perhaps tacked on 200 more pages and cut out some of the filler that was used. But as it was, the literary license she took just kept bothering me, therefore keeping me from enjoying this book as much as I could have.I do understand that this was a fictional account of the romance between Elizabeth Gunning and John Campbell, but really, the truth appears to be a heck of a lot more romantic than what Ms. Henley came up with."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"A book that not only you cannot put down, but you will feel like you're losing a friend when it's over! Go get it!"},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I don't usually post reviews, but after reading this book, and the other reviews, I really feel that I must. In my opinion, this was one of the worst books I've read in a long time, and I'm a voracious reader. Very little actually happened in the story, most of the characters were boring, and their actions and dialogue were predictable.Although it's been several years since I read any of Ms. Henley's novels, I do not remember those older ones being as poorly written and uninteresting as this one. If you enjoy this genre, there are many books by other authors that are much more enjoyable from which to choose. Don't waste your time and money on this one.If I could give the book 0 stars, I would."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It kept me enthralled through out the entire story. I loved it."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"This was the biggest waste of time i've ever applied to a book. I've been an avid reader of romance for about 10 years, and this book is on my top 5 worst books ever written. First and formost, i hated the female protagonist, despite the four years she had to grow and mature, she just becomes more dislikable. At fist i didn't like her b/c she was a small child barely teen with pathetic romantic dreams, who could never seem to stand up for herself. Yea life was tough, but come on get some backbone hun. And i kept tryin to give the book a chance, but the closer i got to the end the more i wanted to knock my head agianst a wall. 1 chapter to the end, I couldn't take it anymore, i skimmed the last few pages, saw nothing of interest and then just gave up! If your interested in a good read, try Kat Martin, Elaine Coffman, anything but this woman. Sadly i've tried 3 of her novels, and always seemed to think she came up lacking. Maybe i've just been reading her recent novels and she's in a slump, but i don't think i'll try my luck with her agian!"},{"Title":"Undone","review":"My God, where are these authors going. This is porn. I would have actually loved this book. Beth, what a story it could have been. Historical and all. I just couldn't get past the non-romance, non-feeling, do depth of relationship, yuk, that is love? Are these new &quot;romance&quot; historical/regencey, etc. written for women? No way, not for me. I think there were pages and pages I skipped through of pure porn. Just took away from the story, terribly. Just such a shame. Where is the touch, the look, the word's, the tenderness, all that would make a women feel? So sad. If you're into the porn genre, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I think I forgot to mention that I destroyed my copy of this book. For a while I thought about returning it to the bookstore and getting my money back, but then I decided that I didn't even want anyone else to be able to buy it. I only wish that I could rip apart every existing copy of this book ... sorry, Virginia."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"The last few books that I've read by Ms. Henley just seemed lacking in either romance, interesting characters, or a combination there of. Her latest though has it all a great storyline, a heroine that you want to see have a happy ending, the tall dark and handsome hero, and of course the tragic set of circumstances that keep our young lovers apart.This is really like a Cinderella story. Elizabeth and John enjoy a chance meeting by a stream in Ireland. Elizabeth enjoys their brief time together not realizing that John is heir to a Dukedom, and John is totally capitivated by Elizabeth's innocence and charm not realizing that the blonde beauty is will be his heart's desire instead of a passing fancy. Soon they must part but their lives will cross paths again and despite her wicked mother (mom's not the nicest women in the world) and her nasty sister Maria, Elizabeth manages to enter proper society and steals tender moments with John that she hopes will eventually lead to marriage. Problem is the entire Gunning family is lying about their heritage and background. Elizabeth is not comfortable with this but finds that she is unable to change her mothers mind on the course that she has set out for herself and that is to catch rich, titled husband for the &quot;Beautiful Gunning Daughters.&quot;Of course there are road block and situations that will keep John and Elizabeth from each other but since you like the characters you will be compelled to keep turning the pages. Ms. Henley really knows her history and so her story is very descriptive and vivid and really brings to life these people that truly lived at one time. If you love romance, sensual love scenes, and history in your historical romance you will find this to be a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"Totally lost Myself in this book! I read it twice, and will probably read it again. Definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Ms. Henley puts most romance writers to shame, and this book is clear evidence of how she is able to draw the reader into the very time and place where the characters existed. I did a little research on the characters and the time period and was amazed at how well the author set the scenes down to small details and descriptive words (spatulate - referring to Hamilton's hands, which was a very amusing description for this villain) used for that time period -- fabulous.I read this book into the wee hours of the night/morning almost being unable to put it down, savoring every page & chapter, and I was sorry when it ended. This is my second Virginia Henley book (The Raven & The Rose was great which led me to more of this author's books).Thank you, Ms. Henley for being a dramatic cut above! I marveled at the amount of work that must have gone into this book. I am looking forward to reading several more of your books which I've just purchased & I'll be reading this one again!"},{"Title":"Undone","review":"UndoneBy Virginia HenleyI always enjoy Virginia Henley books. She writes about real women, who lived before women were liberated and who succeeded in life against great odds.Undone is about Elizabeth Gunning (ca Dec., 1733-Dec. 20, 1790), daughter of impoverished Irish gentry, who became wife of two Dukes - an unheard of scenario at the time. Her sister, Maria, became the wife of an Earl. Henley credits their rise in the world to an overbearing mother and amazing beauty.As always, Ms. Henley vividly describes the relationships between her heroine, her partners, and other important characters. They act within a historically accurate scene. Their friends and enemies actually existed. Their stories reveal themselves in realistic, riveting, emotionally satisfying plots.Whether Henley's characters are actually like the people she depicts is questionable. Certain facts about Elizabeth, which would weaken Henley's plot and characterization, are omitted. These omissions suggest that the real people and the real story may differ from Henley's version. For example, in Undone, Elizabeth and her first husband have one child. They actually had three. This fact sheds a different light upon her relationship with her first husband. Similarly, in Undone, Elizabeth enters marriage to a second husband without an interim relationship. Actually, she was engaged to the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater before her second marriage. He broke off the engagement. This suggests a different relationship between Elizabeth and John Campbell than that depicted in the novel.Usually I think Henley novels rate five stars. But I am giving this one four. Henley's introduction of characters and plot was not as good as I would expect. In this phase, her writing was awkward and the dialogues seemed stilted. But once this rather long introduction was finished, she rose to her usual delightful standard."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I wasn't sure whether I should have given this 3 or 4 stars. I went with 4 due to the fact that when it is all said and done I really liked the main characters.Henley often makes the heroine a victim in some shape or form. Kind of gives them that damsel in distress look. In this novel it was taken pretty far, and I would have liked to have seen more time between the 2 main characters. They made a beautiful couple, but the suffering that had to happen before that could be accomplished was a bit much. I really hated the duke, her mother, and her sister. Usually I feel that evil is needed and that they contribute as much as the main characters themselves, but in this case the hatred directed towards the heroine was undeserved and overdone.Overall, this was a good read."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I like Virginia Henley's writing style. The book was good, but it wasn't a stay up all-night reading sizzler. If you liked this book, I would also recommend, my favorite Virginia Henley book \\"A Year and a Day\\"."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I'm an avid historical romance reader and just picked this book up the other day on a whim. I had never read anything by Virginia Henley. I have my favorite authors and usually stick to reading only thier books. Well, I can add this author to my list of favorites. I was not disappointed in this book or this authors ability to write her knowledge of the 18th century. It is a riviting story that has true romance along with the reality of lifes hardships in marriage and life in general. I am looking forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I've read many historical romance, but never one author I had to keep reading, I liked a couple Julie Garwood, a couple Bertrice Small- but not more than a couple. With Virginia Henley I Liked some more than others, but liked them--Loved them. I search out her books at libraries and book stores. I've reread her books instead of reading others, which I start but can't go on. One of my faves is Undone. 2 side charators -Charlie and Will are the parents of the Duke in the movie \\" The Dutchess\\" (SPOILER) Although Charlie doesn't raise him. I e-mailed VH asking who she liked,she told me to read the Other Boleyn Girl, which I loved- ,but the movie lacked -the story -( as far as - actors, costumes,set AMAZING)Anyway all VH books are worth reading."},{"Title":"Undone","review":"I was at the store one day and I happen to come across this book.

It was so wonderful to pick up a book that engrossed me so that I could read it well into the morning hours. Thank you Ms. Henley!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book is really good. Better than the movie. It came quickly and I read it even quicker. I recommend this to anyone that loved the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I had to think about this book for awhile after finishing it to clarify what I thought about it. I'd seen the movie several times and the last time saw that it was based on a book. Since I usually love the book way more than the movie I picked this up. Hollywood really romanticized and simplified much of what was in the book, still while reading the book I enjoyed comparing the two stories and various plot points, enjoying different aspects, like the fact that the girls were given a more substantial role in the book and the fact that Sally left home rather than subject her girls to the same ostracizing that she received as a child. So if you saw the movie and you're interested in seeing the author's original intent for the characters, buy this book. To be honest, I don't think I would have enjoyed this book if not for the opportunity to compare it to the film version and then get some plot and character questions answered."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this book because I loved the movie. I find that I almost always love the book more than the movie, however I can't say so in this case. Of course many things were different which was to be expected. I didn't go into reading the book thinking that it would be the same. I was hoping it would be more magical and was disappointed. I probably should have read the book first. I would read another Alice Hoffman as I did enjoy the writing."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book just touches my soul as does the film adaptation.

Did a bad thing and saw the movie first, but I was a kid when it came out so I have a decent excuse. (Loved the movie by the way.) But I'm still not 100% sure if I liked Practical Magic.The story is wonderful. Adult fairy tale with beautifully written characters and some pretty bad ass imagery. Buuuttt (there's always a but), I felt really disconnected. I didn't feel like part of the story, and as a major book-lover, that's a big no-no. I just wasn't sure what the hell was going on. Haven't read any other Alice Hoffman books and people just love her, so I guess I was a little disappointed by the whole thing.Glad I finally read it, but a Hoffman fan was not born. Maybe I should have another go at something else of hers. Any recommendations?[...]"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended on the Kindle forums. The movie is one of my all-time favorites, so I was sure I would love the book. The book barely followed the movie, so at first I was disappointed.

I plan to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic is my first Alice Hoffman book. It's a fairly quick read, with just the right dynamic of magic and reality. Hoffman's writing is at times sensual and moody; others it is light and subtle. It's a stirring contrast. Hoffman has a real knack for romance, too. The way she describes the various loves of the Owens girls is raw, dramatic, yet not completely unrealistic.Awesome book. I read it in two sittings."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I enjoyed how this book didn't make a big deal about being fantasy, or about witches and all that. It kind of took the stereotypes about old school New England witches and applied it to a situation in normal modern life. It was fast and fun, and I will read more Alice Hoffman when it comes my way."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you are looking for a fantasy that will keep you engrossed, you will find it here. Practical Magic is a fairy tale for adults. Like all of Ms. Hoffman's books, it is a sheer reading delight.The characters in the book are endearing. The elderly aunts in the story are like eccentric good witches of the north. The story is absolutely engaging. This is as good a book as any of Ms. Hoffman's with which to begin.Ms. Hoffman has a gift for exploring human relationships in such a way that is uplifting to the soul. From that standpoint, this book is a deeply spiritual one. As the author of a series of books with a spiritual theme, I especially appreciated that. You will love this book if you have a sentimental bone in your body.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"A beautiful and magical story about love and the bond between sisters, with the author's trademark mystical touch. One of my favourite books."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was okay. It had a new look on desire, love, and obsession that was fairly interesting, and it had a good perspective on being young and beautiful. However, I thought that the narrative seemed to wander a bit, and I often wondered when it would actually get to the real story, which it never seemed to do. Despite these faults, I found the book Practical Magic to be somewhat entertaining, and a nice way to pass an afternoon."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I seem to be one of the few people who had read the book before seeing the movie. I enjoyed the book so much I have read it about five times already. The relationships between Gillian and Sally compare to the sister relationship between their two magically inclined aunts. The movie leaves a lot of this sisterly relationship to the imagination where the book gives a broad prospective into the details that make Gillian and Sally so close. I highly recommend this book, but recommend you read the book before seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book is something I can definitly relate to.

It made me laugh, cry and touched me in ways that few books have. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"It's true, it's true: Alice Hoffman is a lazy writer. I have now read three of her books where people &quot;spoil cats with cream&quot; -- and once caught the reference twice in the SAME book assigned to two different characters! But that aside, I'll just say that I read her books for the way they make me feel. They make me think my life has more possibility. They make me think magic (meaning, to me, you can get what you want, things have a way or turning out, or that sometimes you can believe that life is good) is possible. And that's pretty rare! Sure, it's true, every woman in her book is THE most beautiful woman in the world, so beautiful the teenage boys line up and go all moony-eyed. But who hasn't imagined herself to be exactly that way? And don't jump all over me; I am a college-educated, early-'30s writer, rampant liberal and a feminist! I like them anyway."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This was the first Hoffman novel I read. The original cover of shimmery blue, black and silver caught my eye. This was just the kind of story I like, one of magic, mystery and love. Hoffman's writing entices the reader, creating a vivid picture of her characters and their lives. I couldn't put it down. Read it on a warm summer night and you'll feel like you're part of the story. Oh, by the way, definitely read the book before seeing the movie!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic is the best book I've ever read. I picked up the book (after seeing the movie) one night, and refused to put it down. It was amazingly written and had a terrific plot.

While the book was not a bad book, it just wasn't what I expected."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I enjoy fairy tale and thought this book would provide that-but for me it didn't. However, it was a wonderful book. The relationships between the characters were well developed and I found Alice HOffman's writing engaging and inspiring. I did not find this book whimsical, though. I noticed a strong underlying theme of anxiety, abuse, and co-dependence which was just a little too close to real life for me to find the whole book a fun time."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is my first Alice Hoffman book, and I was pleasantly surprised. This book is a fairy tale that explores the magical occurrences in the lives of sisters (2 main pairs). It reminds of the magic realism style of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and other Latin American writers.Ms. Hoffman weaves a beautiful, interesting world where good and bad things happen. Add a layer of magic and you end up with a fun book to read.Some people may find the book to be slow and plotless. It certainly is not the fastest book ever, but its slowness adds a silkiness that envelops you as you read and enter this world.As to it being plotless, I disagree. It's not your average genre plot. It's a character study showing you how the main characters react to new obstacles and themselves.All in all, I highly recommend it.If you liked this book, I also recommend Laura Esquivel's &quot;Like Water For Chocolate.&quot;Enjoy"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Alice Hoffman uses a splendid narrative style to reveal how extraordinary life is. Her talent has captured me from the beginning till the end. This novel starts with telling us the Owens women had been blamed for everything that had gone wrong in their Massachusetts town. Gillian and Sally were two of them, one was beautiful and lazy whereas another one was very responsible. Their aunts encouraged them to practise witchery but what Gillian and Sally only wanted was to escape. Though they were seperated, but finally they're back together. Practical Magic not only describes withcery, but also the &quot;magical&quot; relationship between the Owen sisters.The novel is charming, funny and written in great rhythm. Once you start reading Practical Magic, it's hard to put it down because of the great narrative flow. The novel is as enchanting as the movie. Practical Magic is one of her best novels and you can't miss it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I will confess I picked up the book because I liked the movie. While I found that they were very different, I think that its those differences that make both the movie and the book so good.I found this slightly slow to start with but by about page 75 I was having trouble putting it down and finally finished it a 1am in the morning.I am now looking forward to reading another of her novels and hope that I find the same depth of feeling in those."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it before it was made into a movie, and few books have touched me heart, soul and mind so completely.Hoffman has a great gift for weaving magic into her storytelling, quite literally. If you like kindness, empathy, and humanity in your supernatural tales, this is the book for you. The realism and everyday sincerity of this book is well represented by the term &quot;Practical Magic&quot;.If your child loves Harry Potter and you've developed a taste for witchcraft and magic, you MUST read this book. You'll fall in love."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I love Alice Hoffman. So does the rest of the literature world, it would seem. Her books capture me, make me emotional and I can't (usually) put them down. Practical Magic was no exception. But i've realized I can only take Alice in small doses before I start rolling my eyes. She lays on the 'beautiful descriptions' a bit, and lately, i've been picking &quot;Local Girls&quot; up and snorting at the ridiculousness of it all. I couldn't finish it.I *know* Alice has broken the 'literature fiction/women's genre with her mystical writing, but I think she could still manage to write in that way without making some of the characters and relationships so darn unrealistic.I find offense that a man would just cry at the sight of a beautiful woman and ask her to marry him, without knowing if she was a total lunatic--men aren't *that* dumb. So, ugly simpletonoes with wonderful personalities aren't exotic enough to write about?Alice's view of beauty is narrow-minded: what about beauty on the inside? Her heroines seem to grace an incredible beauty, but no brains and they're usually not very likeable or funny, (except for Gretel in Local Girls) yet men still fall at their feet. And all the sobbing they do when they 'glance at a violet bush' and the 'moon is so silvery it...' etc etc. I love most of her writing, but I do wish she wouldn't make it so ludicrously unrealistic. It feels like i'm reading a Mills and Boon sometimes with all the fawning over pretty girls."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"...I enjoyed reading the book, so I guess that's good enough for 2 1/2 stars. I'll round up to be generous.There were a few things that bothered me about this book. It sort of bothered me that all the women in this book were SO beautiful that men lost control of themselves just by looking at them. The main characters were either overly practical domestics (Sally)or irrational out of control wild women (Gillian). The whole book sort of danced around that sort of feminist kind of sexism that states pretty much the same things about women's roles that traditional sexism does, but tries to get away with it by talking about how important those roles are. This book hints that it is of utmost importance for women to be beautiful, but escapes veiwing them as objects by acting like somehow beauty is the *power* that women have. I can't see this as much more comforting then traditional sexism; if you aren't beautiful enough, then tough noodles for you, you're a failure as a woman. At the same time it sort of glorifies women's role as caretaker and domestics, without really giving them much of another option.This is probably a bit overstated, the book sort of borders on these ideas without crossing the line enough to clearly take a position.The men in the book were pretty flat, and mostly just there to give the women something to do (with one exception that I can't talk about without ruining things).I thought it was odd how Antonia seemed like she was going to be important, and then she just kind of faded away from the plot.Some people were bothered by the way the point of view would jump from one character to another, but I thought it was a pretty effective literary device.The plot was kind of wandering and directionless, but the prose was pretty fun to read so that made up for it somewhat, as did the unexpected occurances of magical realism. The ending was a classical example of Deus Ex Machina if I've ever seen one."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The author of this book personally told me that the book differed quite a bit from the movie, and she wasn't exaggerating. That is the reason I read it. The movie is one of my favorites. In the novel, the story focuses a lot more on the third generation, Sally's daughters. They really only appear as children in the movie. Although, I love Alice's books, in some ways, I liked the movie version better. It is so well done. However, it was great to read the book, because for me it expanded and deepened the story. I recommend it for everyone, whether or not you are a fan of the popular movie.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"When I read Garden Spells by Sarah Addison Allen, a number of the reviews compared it to Practical Magic, complaining about how similar the two books are, so I eagerly put this on my to-read list. While I certainly see the similarities--sisters raised by witches trying to find their place in a modern world, one the stay-at-home and the other the wayward spirit, etc.--the tone is very different. This is the darker twin, edging into horror at times. While there is romance, it tends toward the sudden and overwhelming, rather than sweet. The narrative passes smoothly between past and present, history and current events, and the writing is lyrical and moody, but the ending comes almost too suddenly. A good book for a hot night, waiting for the storm."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The author writes with an omnipresent/fairy tale voice that sometimes works in short stories, but becomes grating in novels. The characters are bizarre, not charming, with the aunts being creepy hags, Gillian a self-centered jerk, and Sally a sad sack who raises two brats. Worst of all? No real magic is presented (at least in the parts I manged to read).I got through 28% of the book on my Kindle before I got tired of waiting for the plot to show up"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic was one of the warmest, funniest, most &quot;real&quot; books I have ever read.

I first heard about this book from a review in Seventeen magazine and it sounded interesting so I got it out from the library. It's a touching story about two sisters, Gillian and Sally, who grow up shunned by the village children because the aunts that they live with are witches. Gillian elopes, and Sally stays until her husband dies, leaving her with two daughters who she feels are being uncannily influenced by the aunts. And then Gillian comes home with a problem. A big problem. And it's the aunts' magic that saves them in the end. A very good book that doesn't want to be put down"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I adore this book. Yet it irks me greatly how commercialized the film version was. The book is always better than the movie, but I was still disappointed. Hoffman's tale of these two sisters reads like a dark fairy tale. It falls into place with much of the &quot;witchy&quot; awareness that lately has engulfed literature, television and movies. With great power comes great responsibility and this is doubly so of witchcraft. What I do enjoy is how Hoffman presents the other side: these women are people with pasts and choices, none of which flow easily. That fact alone is much trickier than a game of Quidditch (Harry Potter), a nasty demon (Charmed), or any predictable black cat (hey, even I have one of those). For those with occult knowledge, the hints of the past that Hoffman writes about is more true than any CGI special effect. Houses might have ghosts, but then so do people. It's a respect and knowledge of your elders and the old ways that make up the basis of any solid spiritual work. The judgment and fear that erupts from the other people are the basis of her loveable characters. Who wouldn't want to whip up a spell or read minds? Sadly, in real life, it's not that simple. Hoffman's characters always struggle with that and that seems to be glossed over and forgotten with the flick of Nicole Kidman's red tresses and the tightness of Sandra Bullock's jeans. Take the movie and enjoy it, but take the book a bit more seriously. It's a great jumping point to exploring other areas of the Craft (fiction and non-fiction) without the fluffy-bunny-cupcake nonsense of what passes for a witch in the media these days. Spiritual work is serious stuff. We are lucky to see Hoffman hint at the darkness of such things, which is the joy and beauty of her work as much as the Craft itself."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book is the story of Sally and her sister Gillian. Sally and Gillian were orphaned when they were younger and raised by their aunts who were the town witches. The girls' childhood was hard and both looked forward to a time when they could leave the staring and name calling and mean spiritedness behind.The writing in this book has a magical quality to it, although there isn't that much magic mentioned in the book. I would have liked more 'magic' sort of like in the movie. Another thing that bothered me about the book was that they spent a majority of the book setting up the big problem and it all got resolved within a few pages and tied up nicely with a little bow. That part just seemed rushed.I did like reading more about Sally and more about her daughters. I liked the charm that Hoffman brought to the novel and I would be interested in reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I, too, watched the movie first. Normally once I have watched a movie, I won't read the book on a dare, it is always a disappointment, until now.There is a real relationship between book and movie but this book can stand alone. The relationships between the characters alone made me not want to put this book down ever. Alice Hoffman does an incredible job with this story , which ends up being less about witchy magic and more about the magic that exists in all of us. I will have to read more of Hoffman because if the rest of her book are this good, I don't want to miss out."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic is a difficult book to forget.It has numerous ups and downs,which also makes it difficult to review.It is definitely unusual,with a very unique style of writing that gives it a hazy,dreamy atmosphere that's carefully woven into the plot.This usually works,but gets stale at the end,making the book's theme overly repetitive and sappy.The conclusion is the only problem I had with the book.It's too well thought-out to be ruined by such a predictable mess.I would recommend the book to people who are looking for an interesting read.If you are especially interested in magic or romance,it's bound to have an effect."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was extremely believable. For example, it's supposed to be about magic..but really it's just about one sister's connection with the other. I really loved it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this, got done and said 'Huh? Did I miss the point?' I'm sure someone else would say 'Oh it's a character study.' Me - I like a plot.

Definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was made into the recent movie with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. Rarely have I ever said that the movie was better than the book, but I think I'm going to have to make that statement in this case. The events in the movie and book were markedly different and I just liked the way they played out in the movie a bit better. Plus I felt that the book left out the theme that I felt was most important in the movie - the community of women coming together, united in a common goal, even though they had shunned the Owens women before. This part just isn't in the book at all. The Owenses take care of their problems all by themselves. But the book was good for itself, as long as you don't have the movie to compare it with."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"i had to read a book for school and i just randomnly picjed &quot;Practical Magic&quot; b/c it was a movie also and i figured if i didn't get the book then i could just rent the movie. it turns out that i loved this book. it's such a captivating story line and although i haven't seen the movie yet, i know i'll love it. plus sandra bullock is one of my fave actresses also. now i just need to get some info on alice hoffman for my report. she is a great writer. i love how she mixes suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Very little actual magic, practical or otherwise is included in this overly sentimental and boring story about sisters who grow up under the stigma of being witches. There's crying aplenty as EVERY single character breaks into tears at the drop of a hat. You read and read waiting for something to HAPPEN, but nothing interesting ever does. This is one case in which the movie was much better than the book."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book truly touched me; it stirs thoughts of past, present and future and gives a new appreciation for the depth and beauty, the sadness and poignancy of them all. I would recommend this book to anyone I knew who enjoyed thoroughly touching, viscerally romantic stories about /people./"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"As a former English teacher and lover of good fiction, I have enjoyed Alice Hoffman's &quot;Turtle Moon,&quot; &quot;Illumination Night,&quot; and &quot;Seventh Heaven.&quot; When my daughter offered &quot;Practical Magic,&quot; I snapped it up, and read it in a day, while attending a conference in Boston. I couldn't believe the poor quality of the writing, when compared with &quot;Turtle Moon,&quot; say. Use of the f--- word was gratuitous, and the plot was strained to say the least. The witchy aunts (up there in Salem, I presume,) were interesting, once Hoffman got around to coloring in their sketches, in the last few pages. Lust, not true love, seemed to be the driving force. Come on, this is for ninth graders. What about the rest of us, who expect much more from Alice Hoffman? If you really want to enjoy Magic Realism, read &quot;Like Water for Chocolate!!&quot;"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I finished this book in about 3 days realizing that the only thing that was noteworthy was the fact I had lost 3 days in my life to which I could have been reading something that was worthy of my time rather than wasting my time on this book. I read the book and saw the movie at the same time. If Hoffman had written a book with the same heart as the movie, maybe then I would not be so harsh. Plus, did she even do any kind of research for this book? Being a Wiccian,I am very disappointed.This girl needs to learn a few things about magic and the occult before she writes a book on it!!!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I'm reading this book because my book club choose it. It's mostly narrartive. There are no scenes of action and very little dialogue. Then in part two the author switches to using the present tense which is an irrating tense to read in and certainly didn't make the story &quot;now&quot;. I kept waiting for the real story to happen, but it doesn't. One thing, if writing this bad can be acclaimed, maybe my efforts have hope. I won't read another of her books."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Drag, drag, drag. I kept reading for two reasons: the first, I had nothing better to do one Sunday, and the second, I kept hoping something significant would happen. It didn't. This story had no climax, no capture, no passion. Who wants to read about the somber day to day lives of boring spinsters? (Of course I did, what a waste). Alice Hoffman is off my reading list. Her use of profanity was unwarranted and did not emphasize meaning in anything. Her characters were flat and the overall flow was slow if not stagnant. The ending was short and curt, as if she was just as bored writing it as it was to read. Unremarkable!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I loved this book since the beginning. Is a sweet, moody fairy tale about a family of witches. If you are expecting to find stories of wild revenge, outrageous love potions and dazzling spells, read something else; this story is very smooth and serene, with a kind of quiet charm that is impossible to ignore. It will be hard for you not to believe in magic after you have read this book."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I loved this book! As I love all of Alice Hoffmans books!....but I have to add, watch the movie first, then read the book. The movie was really good, but I think reading the book first would just make the movie look really bad. Sorry if this makes no sense, it too late at night, but i'm sure you get what i'm trying to say! lol"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have this book in hardback.Loved it then and love it now.

I'll be first in line!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I am in ninth grade english, and I have read this book in less than three days. Lemme just say, this is one heck of a book and one heck of a page turner! I really liked this book, because it told parts from all characters views. It's nice to follow Sally and Gillian from the time they lived with Aunt Frances and Aunt Jet to when Gillian falls head over heels with a science teacher and Sally has two daughters, Antonia and Kylie. This book is magnificent except for some bad words. GOOD BOOK!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I'm a second year student of english and therefore I'm forced to read all the classics available, maybe that it is why it was such a delight reading this novel. It's easy to read and you just can't put it down. Hoffman has written a truly delightful novel. I've told everybody about it and recommend it to everyone. You'll won't regret reading it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I think Alice Hoffman would be a wonderful person to sit out on a porch with, drink some ice tea and talk about life and all the forces out there that people are too often not aware of... It seems she has an incredible imagination and a miriad of beliefs. I really enjoyed reading Practical Magic and look forward to discussing it in my next book group meeting. I did not want the book to end and in fact kept a pen handy to underline passages that I want to discuss and lines I want to remember!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Alice Hoffman is one of the few writers who really weaves a magic spell with her writing. The writing itself is as captivating as the story. I really enjoyed escaping to her world, and am thrilled that it may be made into a movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I'm a big fan of Alice Hoffman.

My second-favorate Alice Hoffman book, after Seventh Heaven."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Just finished reading PRACTICAL MAGIC and had that rare experience of being sorry to see the book end. It left me wanting to learn more about those intense, lovely, witchy Owens women (and girls). I recently &quot;discovered&quot; Alice Hoffman and have read three of her earlier books, including PRACTICAL MAGIC. Hoffman has the gift! Her artistry is breath-taking. Thank God she is a prolific writer. I have many more titles of hers to enjoy. Can't wait to get to them."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Alice Hoffman, but it certainly will not be the last.

I loved it from the very beginning. It's written very well."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book seemed really awesome at first. The story line is interesting and the characters are also. I felt it was really in depth about some points but lacked in other areas. I found myself thinking that it was trying to be a \\"romance novel\\" and just threw in sex scenes whenever possible, making it more of a weak story. I was surprised that it was so much more R rated than the movie. Another part of me was pleasantly surprised that it was so different from the movie since I still could get into it without only thinking of the movie. Overall I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone unless they liked somewhat... I hate to say trashy... romance novels. If you do then it's great! Plus it has a cool story along with it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The book was great! I have already recommended it to friends of mine.

I watch the movie at least once a year and I can see re-reading this book a few times too."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I bought this book about two years ago and couldn't get into it. After I saw the movie, I decided to give it another shot because I loved the movie. I could not believe how poorly written the book really was. The author goes back and forth between present and past tenses. She abruptly changes character viewpoints without a transition so you think you're reading about one character only to find she had changed to a different one. Very confusing. To make matters worse, she stops action right in the middle with long narrative flashbacks. The movie was a huge improvement over the book, and I actually liked it a lot. Now if I could only learn to fly off the roof..."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book covers a lot of ground in a very short time. Within the first 50 pages, Sally and Gillian, the two protagonist sisters of this tome, grow through adolescence and into young adulthood. Sally falls in love with a hardware store clerk, gets married, has two children who also grow into their teen years and then lose their, by now hardware store manager, father in a tragic automobile accident, and then they all move to another state. Meanwhile, Gillian rebels and leaves the roost, marrying three times, divorcing twice, committing apparent homicide against the third, and returning to Sally with a corpse in the back of her car.To say that Hoffman is in a hurry to get somewhere is to say everything. Unfortunately, where she is going is anyone's guess, but dinner would be a good bet. If Magic were indexed, one could probably find over two hundred and fifty references to food (more than one for every page) including twenty references for coke, eighteen for ice cream, and three for butter. Sadly, there would be only three references to witchcraft or magic. Why Hoffman decided to write about four generations of witches without including more than an occasional episode of witchcraft is the real mystery here. The answer may be that she wanted to ration the spells lest she really need them for conjuring something serious, like finding a plot. This practical side of Hoffman belies the unlikely title of Magic.There are conflicts, of course, but every problem along the way is solved with equal dispatch and economy: stuck in a bad marriage? Get a divorce. Stuck in a really bad marriage? Poison your husband. The house is haunted? Cut down the lilac bush. The kids are at each other's throats? Have the youngest confide to no one but the eldest a truly traumatic event and poof, best of friends. Feeling lonely? Meet a private investigator who just happens to intercept a letter meant for your sister. Need an ending for a book? Break out that ration card and cast a spell. The only significant problem in the book that doesn't get resolved is Hoffman's apparent obsession with food.Hoffman has difficulty describing anything without relating it, in some way, to eating. Gillian's emotional attachment to her suitor is so intense, that the butter in Sally's house kept melting, &quot;the way it does whenever love is under a roof. Even the sticks of butter in the refrigerator would melt, and anyone who wanted some would have to pour it on a piece of toast or measure it out with a tablespoon.&quot; Sally is so nice and kind that &quot;she'll pick your kids up at the high school or lend you sugar or eggs.&quot; When Kylie turns thirteen, instead of eating the special breakfast of pancakes that Sally makes for her, Kylie &quot;scoops two measly spoonfuls of fruit into a bowl and takes teeny, tiny bites, even though she's nearly six feet tall and weighs only a hundred and eighteen pounds.&quot;It is entirely possible that the five pounds that I gained while reading this book came as a direct result of reading this book. With all this emphasis on food, every page makes you hungry for something, anything. Anything, that is, except for the next page. Or anything else written by Hoffman."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"How the words of this book will stick with me all my life. Alice Hoffman has used such descriptive language and imagry that you just cant put it down. Looking for a book to get caught up in, you have found it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"ok it is late in the night as i'm writing this. forgive me if i don't use the correct mechanics of grammer and other such nonsense that should only be forced when writing a term paper or when you are a NOVICE writer trying to start out. first let me say that the book is worth five stars for the way it captures you from the first page i have read many books in my life shakespeare being the top man in the the field of literature and i can safely say that practical magic has the stuff to make it a classic despite the bad tie in movie. one other thing to you grammer buffs out there when a writer is first starting out yes it is necessary for the writer to use the proper mechanics of english but when you have built up a reputation as worthy of MS HOFFMAN you can you as much vulgarity and bad grammar and what have you as you want get over it it was a good if not excellent book and i wish that someday i will be able to capture the magic in her prose. don't mess with alice"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I did not like this book. Not one bit. I study the occult and the occult references in the book were hazy at best, but that is acceptable since it is meant for mainstream consumption. What got to me most about this book is that there is almost no dialog, there are periods where there are three pages without dialog, without vaugely meaninful description (like say Moby Dick), but just pure nariation. The book is written from an omni-scentiant point of view, so it is hard to care very much about any one of the characters as a main character. Now perhaps it is acceptable for Clancy to have five main characters, when he writes a 900 page book, but this book being around 250, can't support the lack of focus."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"After being drawn in by the magical possibilities of a Rossetti painting on the dustjacket (of the hardcover) and an epigraph from Mother Goose, I was disappointed that what followed was sheer hokum. Most disappointing: the characters are based on cliched ideas. For example, the author reinforces the tired dichotomy that women are either rational and practical or wild and irresponsible. And the author's primary characterization of all the prominent females in the book is that they are stunningly beautiful, as if she has nothing else in her bag of tricks to make them likable. This is a world where a woman must use her beauty to secure the love of a handsome man before she can like herself, and that is very unfortunate given the possibilities for strong feminine characters in such a storyline. The ending is likewise predictable and cloying, which seems to be a prerequisite for authors who eventually end up in the &quot;Oprah Bookclub.&quot;"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I first saw the film when I was 17 and fell in love with the story. So after years of being a fan of the film I decided to try out the book. The book is nothing like the movie. I set that detail aside and decided to continue reading even though it was not the story I was hoping for. The book was dull with what I feel is poor character development. So 2 months after my purchase I still have several chapters to go and no real interest continue reading. Her style of writing is annoying at times when she tries to add poetic sequences in places where you just want information. Its likely I wont buy another book from this author."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read one of Hoffman's other books, Illumination Night, and liked it well enough, though it seemed at time as if she were trying to imitate Anne Tyler with soem magical realism thrown in. Practical Magic started with some potential, but after about a third of the way into the book I had to stop reading. Her characers, and the way she staged their interactions, did not ring true and come to life. Rather, the book seemed mired in the emotional and imaginative level of a second-rate TV movie. All of which was especially disappointing, since Hoffman's original setup had some real potential- she just never realized it by pulling out all the stops and letting her tale set its own internal logic. Instead, she settled for cheap melodrama."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is the first time in my reading life that I can say that the movie is better than the book. I honestly wish that I'd read the book first, because the monumental let down of reading the book after the movie has been something I cannot reconcile. The movie is beautiful, the storyline is engaging and witty, and the characters draw you in and make you laugh and cry. Yet the book is so far removed from the movie, they are hardly relatable at all, with such flimsy linkages, you could actually see them as two completely different stories.The book is slow, very American, with a somewhat annoying narration. I did not love any of the main characters, and for a book that makes a vague attempt at being supernatural, many of the 'magical' things that happened in the book were less believable because it did not step strongly enough into the supernatural theme. It was like any other suburban novel, with a few sparkly tweaks.I've never been so disappointed in a novel. I was looking forward to really knowing the Aunts, to feel myself in that old house, but it wasn't too be. I felt like I was reading just some book, not the original premise of my favourite movie.I'm completely bummed."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"About once a month I get this movie out and watch it. My daughters and my 2 best friends are equally hooked on it. We've just about worn out the soundtrack too.The appeal isn't just the relationships, it's the house, the herbs, the setting, the humor, the wardrobe,the spells, the life style.... I could go on forever.....I keep trying to win new fans for this movie. A MUST SEE, MUST OWN!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The movie version of this story is one of the most fun, exhilerating movies - a favorite in this household. This book bears very little relation to the movie. The only similarities are that the main characters exist as they do in the movie, but they don't live with the aunts and magic is not quite the focus as it was in the movie.Now, that said ...This is one of the best books I've had the opportunity to read. Written in the beautiful prose Alice Hoffman is so well known for, it follows the life of Gillian and Sally as they go on their diverse paths. Sally is the stable widow with two girls in tow. She leaves the aunts in New England, leaving her sad life behind, and moves to a Long Island suburb with her two girls where tries to live a normal life. Meanwhile, Gillian is a bad girl who is in and out of relationships and in and out of trouble. She finds the awful, abusive Jimmy and eventually kills him accidentally while enroute to visit her sister. Unsure of what to do, she brings him to her sister's house dead in the passenger seat of the car - she thinks stable Sally would know what to do to keep her out of jail. Sally meets the situation with borderline hysteria at first, then the two decide to bury him in Sally's backyard. Gillian moves in with Sally and her girls and tries to forget the body in the back yard. Sally's boring, stable life changes dramatically while Gillian's naughty life changes to a more stable one. Meanwhile they are haunted by the evil spirit of Jimmy, threatening to destroy the tenuous stability they try to build.This book is not written in standard chapters - instead it is written in four large sections. Fortunately there are enough scene breaks in each section that you can put it down and read it in separate sittings. The thing is, once you're drawn into the story, you won't want to put it down. You'll want to read this one in a day, in one sitting if you can read fast enough. It is so beautifully written with an edge of suspense and just a tiny touch of magic. It will become a treasure on your bookshelf and one you'll only loan to your most reliable friends. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"That is an admonishment at the end of this wonderful book by Alice Hoffman. I'll preface my mini-review here with the following statement: Had anyone told me a year ago that I would read --in one day-- a romance about lives and loves of successive generations of women blessed or cursed with witchy powers, I would have laughed at them. A few years back, I tried to watch the movie &quot;Practical Magic&quot; and found myself thoroughly bored by what I considered a talky &quot;chick flick.&quot; Since then, I've become a fan of Sandra Bullock and recently saw the film again, and found myself liking it for the most part. I particularly loved the sad, wistful character played by Bullock, that of Sally Owens.So I checked the book out from the library, not knowing what to expect, and like a man in the story who becomes enchanted by a letter Sally writes that comes into his possession, &quot;Practical Magic&quot; hooked me. Hoffman writes with such easy, beautiful prose and the characters really spring to life and find a place in your heart and imagination.I won't regurgitate the plot here. But I will say that Hoffman writes so well about perhaps the most exquisite and maybe the rarest kind of love, the type that hits both a man and a woman like a thunderbolt, overpowering and sweeping them both away. Hoffman's descriptions of this happening to Sally and her sister and the two men that they are destined to be with packs a tremendous and very satisfying emotional punch for any romantic, which I guess I am. Oh, how I found myself envying the lucky men who won the hearts of Sally and Gillian! To feel love as strong as that and be loved as fiercely in return must be the best thing in the world.So read the book and like Sally Owens would say, fall in love whenever you can."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"My first taste of Alice Hoffman was Here on Earth. While the prose was beautiful, I was disappointed in the characters and plot. However, deep in my gut, I had a feeling there was more to Alice Hoffman than what she was displaying in that book. I couldn't write her off with all of the books she had written, and I felt there was more to her than I was shown. So, I did a little research and took some of her books out of the library. The second book I read was, Practical Magic, and I'm glad to see my instincts were right.This bewitching, captivating novel is full of spellbounding characters, which is the main thing that was missing from Here on Earth.Sally and Gillian are sisters who, because of the passing of their parents, end up getting raised by their two aunts, who are witches. Because of this, the sisters are ostrasized a bit from their peers, and long to be free from the house and the Aunts on Magnolia Street.Raven-haired Sally is the older of the two sisters. She's practical, hard-working, good, responsible, and afraid to love. Golden-haired Gillian is wild, lazy, coniving, airy, and also afraid to love.Gillian is the first to escape, by running off with a boy. She moves from town to town, from guy to guy, with three failing marriages behind her, before she shows up on her sister's doorstep with the dead body of her recent boyfriend, Jimmy, in the car.Sally, who continued to stay with the Aunts, fell in love and got married to a wonderful man named Michael, finding a happy life of her own. She had a man she loved, and two daughters, Antonia and Kylie. Her world came crumbling down on her when Michael got killed by a drunk driver. She went into a deep depression, and when she finally snapped out of it, she packed up her two daughters and moved out into the Aunts' house and into one of her own.There, she tried to provide a normal life for her daughters, wanting them to go to school without being called a witch. She was trying her best to build her life again when her sister appeared at her doorstep.The book then focuses on Sally's two daughters, the red-headed, spunky, spoiled Antonia, and the more sensative, introverted Kylie, who seemed to develop powers to &quot;see&quot; things on her own.To add depth to the story, Gillian and Sally are both challenged to love again when Ben comes into Gillian's life, and, towards the end of the story, Gary comes into Sally's.The Aunts, who were always background characters, finally have dialogue towards the end of the story when their &quot;help&quot; is needed. Not only do the Aunts have something to say, but they have names: Aunt Frances and Aunt Jet. We also have the pleasure of getting to know them a little bit, too.This is a book that's absolutely rich in characterization. There's three generations of Owens women in this book, and each one of them has a depth and personality all her own. The men that come into these womens' lives only add more depth and richness to the book.What a wonderfully enchanting, imaginative story. I have a feeling this book will end up being one of my favorite books by Ms. Hoffman."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you liked the movie and then decided to check out the book like me, you were probably, dissapointed. This isn't that good of a book. And it is depressing in some parts, especially the parts about Antonia and Kylie. I did like the parts with the Aunts and I wish they had been in there more. The movie was beautiful and magical, and the book was pretty much ho hum. Don't buy it if you are searching for the prettiness of the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic by Alice Hoffman is an enticing and exciting book to read. It was one of those books where once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I read the book in one night, as I was in anticipation of what would happen next. I even read it a second time, since it was so interesting and to see if I could catch anything I missed the first time around. The thing I enjoyed most about this book is its look at love. I am a total romantic at heart and I loved how the book dealt with love that was destined to be and just took over people so strongly, concerning Sally and Gillian and the two men they are destined to spend their lives with. This emotional and spiritual aspect just drew me in and kept my attention throughout the entire book. I have seen the movie version, years ago when it first came out, and I really liked the movie as well. Now that I have the book, I prefer the book to the movie, because the books gives the reader a more in-depth look into their lives and just gives overall more details. Also, the book is very different than the movie in the way they play out, so drawing a conclusion about the two is somewhat difficult. I have also read Turtle Moon by Hoffman and I enjoyed that book as well. She has a very distinct writing style, so if you enjoyed one of her other books the odds are that you will enjoy giving this book a chance and reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone to read; this book has relevance and would be enjoyable to both genders, any race, and people from all walks of life as everyone can relate to some part of the book and take that to heart. This is now one of my favorite books I have ever read and I give it my full approval and highly urge everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Most people complain that this book didn't rely as heavily on the steretypical magic as the movie did but so what? There is more than one type of magic, and one of the strongest, most natural ones is love and this book proved that. This book had a more romantic and passionate element than the movie did which I enjoyed very much, especially when Gillian finds the love of her life at long last which I don't understand why they wouldn't put in the film because that's one of the best parts of the novel. Yet regardless of love being the strongest magic in this book there is magic as well in the witch sense, including the aunts with their love spells for those poor lovedrunk women. But people need to understand the reason why it is called Practical in the first place is because the girls Sally and Gillian are trying to be practical all their lives. That's the main point of the story. Gillian runs off and Sally lives her life as best as she can normally and makes sure her daughters, as best she can, live that way too.I did really love this story. It was endlessly fascinating and yes very romantic. I usually am not too deep into romance stories but this novel is a guilty reading pleasure for me I read every now and then. The way Alice writes is very beautiful, and the characters are very realistic- not just some dingy witches who stand over a black pot but actual women who want and need just what every other woman wants. This book proved that although the Owens may have a little more witch in them than other women, they still were women with desires, and share bonds with people they would sacrifice themselves to save.One thing I particularly enjoyed was how Sally's two daughters were centered on a lot more than they were in the film. I liked reading on them and how they grew up, and how different they were- just like Gillian and Sally- they were as different as the sun and the moon, and how much tension grows because of it. I also enjoyed of course meeting Gillian's and Sally's eventual loves at the end and the pages literally steam with passion at these parts.So I loved the whole novel basically. What can I say it is one of the best stories I have read. It has more than one type of magic that keeps this story constantly fresh and loveable. The book is better than the movie, mainly because of all they cut out of the novel that made it the great story it was. But the movie nonetheless is still good to watch- yet I highly recommend the book as well if you love the movie for it gives you a more deeper look on espeically Sally's daughters that's worth reading- and as well as just has a lot more to the story that makes the story even better.Overall it is about two sisters that even though they part their ways to avoid their ancestor's history come back together under rather unpleasant circumstances and despite their differences share an amazingly deep love and bond to help each other with their difficult lives. Gillian, with a man who just won't leave, and Sally, with her fear of love."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Let me say first off that I went to see the movie first, and loved it. I read the book expecting the movie, and there's the rub. Quite simply, they are two different works of art, with varying flaws and merits to each. Alice Hoffman's writing is amazingly stylized, swinging between being a fairy tale to an urban drama and back again, with a few shakes of witches and hedge magic thrown in just for fun. Some reviewers complain about the lack of plot or characterization, but this is just not true. Sally and Gillian are both painstakingly realized throughout, their different viewpoints meeting and overlapping as their lives are twisted and casually tossed about. What makes the book is seeing these characters grow and change, evolving into powerful, complete women. The men are somewhat undeveloped, but their role was less as co-stars in this drama then as events, or forces of nature. Which comes down to what I got out of the book, and the movie, which was less about people then it was about love, or desire, take your pick, and the incredible knots we tie ourselves into over it, or the pits we dig when we lose it. Slow and dreamy, this is not a book about solid lines and &quot;This Is What Happened In This Chapter.&quot; Read it as you would the Brothers Grimm, and the whole thing will make much more sense. Truly."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If I ever expect it to be as hocus-pocus as the one in movie, I was TOTALLY wrong! Well, sure, the aunts are able to make love potion but Sally and Gillian... They know something about magic but they don't do it like jumping from the roof ala Wicked Witch of The West.At the core, it is from, for and about women. It's about 3 generations of Owens women who are all very beautiful and have big grey eyes just like their first known ancestor, Maria Owens. I said known because there's no story about how and where Maria came from. She just came with her baby daughter, built a house and became a legend, superstitious legend that is.This is my first book by Hoffman and I enjoyed it very much. It's so brilliant of how she wrapped deep emotional issues with fairytale-like plot. And the weird coincidences are the practical magic that sometimes does happen in real life."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Being the odd one out in a community is not a new problem but when you've got a family history like the Owens' it's the most likely outcome. For Sally and Gillian the family secret- the power of the super-natural/ witchcraft has lead to a lonely life, but they overcome all problems. The story of Practical Magic follows the lives of two sisters on their paths of life but always in the background their aunts keep a watchful eye. The story follows their love for eachother and for the men in their lives but in the back of the story is the idea of a family cursed throughout the generations. I would give this book top marks; it is the type of book that you could read over and over again and never tire of it. &quot;Keep rosemary by your garden gate; Plant lavender for luck; And fall in love whenever you can.&quot;"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of my most favorite books in my collection, and some day I hope to have it in hardcover.If you've seen the movie, forget it, go grab yourself a copy of this book, and sit down and read one of the most stirring and wonderful tales you are going to read in a contemporary setting.Sally and Gillian Owens have a gift, a touch of magic that they wield in their lives with different philosophies. For Gillian, the world is a place to meet, enjoy, and move on. For Sally, the notion of a &quot;regular&quot; life is the prize, to be married, to have children, and to be a regular woman. Neither of them get what they're expecting, and the result is, well, magic.The evocative prose of this book left me breathless: Hoffman has a way to work with present and past tense narrative that will work wonders on most readers. Her past tense writing gives you a sense of a fairy tale unfolding, and her present tense writing sucks you in with its sharp immediacy. Most of all, her generational writing, dealing with the Aunts, to the Sisters, to the daughters of Sally, is a wonderful perspective and a truly moving piece of narrative.The blend of folklore with life, and the sharp clarity of Hoffman's eye toward the emotional made this one of my favorites, and I have given copies of this book to many people in my time. I recently mailed a copy to the Netherlands, for a friend there who couldn't find the book.This book will move you, and make you believe."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have to say I was slightly disappointed by this novel. I've heard such good things, and I loved The Dovekeepers, Hoffman's most recent novel. I haven't read anything else by her yet, but I will.From the PublisherPractical Magic is a tale of two sisters, Gillian and Sally Owens, brought up by their two elderly guardian aunts in a world of spells and exotica from which they eventually escape - one by running away, the other by marrying - but which never escapes from them. Many years go by before strange circumstances thrust them together again, and again they are in a world that blends the mundane and the mysterious, the familiar and the fantastic, the normal and the numinous. Three generations of Owens women are then united in an experience of unexpected insight and revelation, teaching all of them that the perceptions provided by what is called the magical are rare and wonderful endowments.This book was good. Please, don't get me wrong. But...I guess it was the POV that threw me off. It was a strange POV. Third person, very distanced from the characters. Sometimes, it was present tense, and sometimes, Hoffman would go into the future. She's say something like, \\"The winds would later become so strong that in the morning, not a single trash can would be left standing.\\"That's not a direct quote, but it's close. Then, after a paragraph of describing what the strong winds would do, Hoffman would come back to the present.Though it was odd to me, it did work with the overall tone for the novel in a way I can't really explain. I guess, the aura of mystery surrounding the main characters. The fear of the unknown and the gravity of the sisters' positions in life, being gifted with this magic that can reveal so much about other people, both the good and the evil.I enjoyed it. But compared to other books I've read, I have to rate it only 2 stars."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Watching the movie Practical Magic is a Halloween tradition of mine, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was a novel first. I can't believe I had never heard of Alice Hoffman, since after looking her up online, all of her books look absolutely wonderful!In Practical Magic, the Owens' women of Massachusetts have always been known to have strange powers and are therefore mainly ostracized (unless someone is in need of a spell!). Sisters Gillian and Sally Owens both desire to live normal lives where no one knows their background, so both leave their aunts and the town where they were raised. Sally becomes a widower and takes her two girls to New York State, while Gillian drifts getting into various degrees of trouble with the wrong type of men. They rarely have contact with each other, until Gillian gets into serious trouble and comes to Sally for help.I can't say enough good things about this book. The women are all delightful (in their own ways) and the various mother-daughter-sister relationship aspects are touching and real. Even more than the characters, Alice Hoffman's writing style makes this book! She makes even onions seem magical with her excellent sentences and when describing the scents of lemons, lilacs, or a summer evening transports the reader to her scene. Now, off to find some more of her books to read!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I suppose I'll make this quick: this book is really nothing like the movie. Or I guess I should say the movies is not much like the book. They share similar characters and a few key events but for the most part, very different. So if you are a fan of the movie, like myself, you may not enjoy the book. It took me a while to get into it, but once I put away my preconceived notions brought about by the movie, I found that I really, really liked it! In short, give it a chance. It's not the movie, but it's just as good if not better."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"We will not go into the details of this book...dear lovers of magic,... those can be read in other reviews, other than to say it is about a family of eccentric witches, death and a haunting. More importantly, Alice Hoffman is a wonderful writer and this is a marvelous book, different, although not completely, from the moviePractical Magic (Snap Case), which we also loved and is one of the few movies we don't mind watching again and again.

Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world (maybe something like Harry Potter!) but this book failed to deliver on that front. The magic was underhanded and unorganized. However, with that said, this was still a good read.

Overall, it's worth reading, but don't expect to be mesmerized!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I absolutely loved this book. As many others have said, it is as different as night and day from the movie. Even the basic plot and character development are completely different. I, however, LOVED both versions.WARNING: There is a short scene, just past the middle of the book, that is highly sexual. It really took me by suprise.

I did not know that it had been a book first until recently. I am so happy that I found the book, I was afraid at first to order it however. I assumed the movie would set me up for a disappointment in the book, but it's the other way around! The book is so captivating and soothing to the soul. It makes me feel like I'm there in the story, and it's so fun and mystical and romantic all in one. It leaves me wishing they would've followed the exact story a little more in the movie than they did.

It kind of fell in my lap one day, though, and I thought I would give it a chance. So glad I did! Walker's writing is absolutely beautiful, and she really can create a mood and an image through her use of words. There is none of the hokey, aww-how-cute stuff that marred the movie so badly, and I found the characters much more believable and human. I also liked that Sally's children were older and had a bigger part in the story. There is magic in the store, but it's much more subtle and the aunts actually do resemble an old-time \\"cunning woman\\" or village witch. I highly recommend this book. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is for the ending; it wraps up a little too neatly, and I felt that some of the characters behaved in an unrealistic way."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book is so well written is just blew my mind. The descriptions of the setting and the placement of characters throughout the narrative is excellent, and the way in which Hoffman drawn you into the narrative, so gently and naturally, that you barely notice when you become so interested in the lives of the characters. Even the movie based on this book was good, so as far as that goes I think it's a good thing. I have read other of Hoffman's novels, but this one is the one that touched me the most, with the manifold personalities of the two sisters and their relationships and lives, pretty much perfect!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic by Alice Hoffman was made into a movie. Kind of. The movie takes great liberties from the book and is much better in my opinion. Although I really did not care for the book, I am giving it three stars because I know I am biased in my review. If you are looking for the book to be like the movie, move on! If you haven't seen the movie or you are looking for a women's fiction type book with some romance, look no further. The main themes of the book seem to be love, human desire and self responsibility/growing up. There is a lot of love. Everyone is falling in and out of love. Love is very, very important in this novel and you must have it. It was too much love for me. At the same time, I felt there was overkill with the \\"f\\" word. I've never thought that before, but it seemed to really stick out here - almost as if it was out of place.Some of the characters were likeable and some were annoying. For instance, Gary really needed to stop crying! And I don't know why all the women had to be so beautiful. I'm not sure what the message was there but apparently it's very important to be stunning and have men swoon all over you all the time.The writing is well done. Ms. Hoffman is a master at the craft and an accomplished writer, but all in all I did not enjoy the story. I'm giving it three stars (would have given it two) because I feel like my disappointment is more my problem than Ms. Hoffmans."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Three generations of a family form the core of this novel. Sisters, Gillian and Sally, are raised by their aunts Frances and Jet, also sisters. Sally's two daughters, Antonia and Kylie, create the third generation. Magical realism is woven into the storyline which focuses on the issues of fate, trust, love, sibling rivalry, and family ties. I highly recommended Practical Magic for readers of multigenerational tales, magical realism, and stories where love, both romantic and between family members, can conquer all."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Like so many others have written, if you are buying this to read the movie you will be disappointed.

Then I realized there was a book! The book and movie are slightly different from each other but both are so amazing. I LOVED this book. I just couldn't put it down. Alice Hoffman knows what she is doing that's for sure!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you saw the film that this book inspired in 1998 and think you know all about the Owens women who \\"for more than two hundred years...have been blamed for everything that went wrong in their Massachusetts town,\\" then think again. Like most books that make the jump to the silver screen certain changes were made that affected the story as a whole. Some subplots were abandoned while others were expanded.After the untimely death of their parents in a fire, two sisters Sally and Gillian are taken in by their eccentric Aunts. Due to their family's reputation for being witches, Sally and Gillian are harassed and ostracized by their peers and so have no one to turn to but each other. The two sisters couldn't be more unlike one another. Sally, the eldest sibling, copes by being the perfect child. She cooks nutritional dinners, washes and hangs the laundry and always goes to bed on time. Gillian, however, dreams of being free from the house, the Aunts, the taunting and teasing of the boys who fear her.However, the sisters have one thing in common. They spend many nights in the shadows of the landing above the stairs in their house listening to their Aunts ply their trade as witches who specialize in affairs of the heart. They listen to the women who come to their Aunts desperate to gain love. The sisters see the toll that unrequited love takes on a woman and are disgusted at the lengths these desperate women will go to in order to obtain the one they desire. Consequently, both of the girls are afraid to love.In an expanded subplot from the movie, as the story unfolds we actually get to see the long-term results of the love spell performed on behalf of one of the Aunts clients and the consequences of the magic invoked one night with little forethought and much desperation.Gillian escapes the house on Magnolia Street by running off with a boy in the middle of the night after having spiked their Aunts soup so she wouldn't be caught. She finds herself unable to settle on any one guy, not for very long. However that doesn't stop her from getting married three times. Sally, on the other hand, stays with the Aunts and fills her days working in the garden, doing household chores, and shopping at the hardware store for cleaning supplies.Sally finally meets a man named Michael at the hardware store. They fall in love, get married and have two daughters Antonia and Kylie. For a time, she is happy. Nonetheless, the death-watch beetle begins to mark off Michael's time on earth and he is doomed to die. At first Sally doesn't believe her Aunts when they tell her, until she slowly begins to believe their warnings and Sally goes to the Aunts for help. Having already secretly done everything they were able, the Aunts could offer no advice but to accept the inevitable.After Michael's death, Sally goes into a deep depression which last for exactly one year. During that time the Aunts become Antonia and Kyle's main caregivers. When Sally comes out of her depression, she witnesses that her daughters are now being subjected to the same harassment that she and her sisters suffered through so many years ago. She then decides to do just as her sister had done years before. She uses Michael's insurance money and some of her own savings to move away from the Aunts and start a new life in New York. There she attempts to give her daughters something that she herself felt that she never had...a normal life.Rather than opening her own business as in the movie, Sally takes a job as a school secretary so that she can be home when her daughters come home from school and the job has the added bonus of allowing her to have summers off. Just when it seems that Sally has achieved her goal of a normal life, Gillian shows up on her doorstep one hot summer night with Jimmy Hawkins, her dead boyfriend, in her car.Gillian fears that she has murdered Jimmy because she had been slipping him nightshade every night to prevent him from getting drunk and consequently hurting her. It seems that though Jimmy has a long history of hurting, even murdering, the ones around him Gillian is compelled to love him and like many abused women, can't seem to leave her abuser. Not even her magic seems strong enough to take away her love for him. This is in direct contrast with all her previous experiences with men, in that since the time she was a teenager men and boys fell in love with her at first sight. She often had them wrapped around her little finger and just when they thought their love was secure---she left the relationship. The sisters ultimately decide to bury Jimmy in the backyard and forget about the entire incident.The book then begins to focus on the relationship between Sally's daughters Antonia and Kylie. Being teenagers, the girls have a strained relationship. Like Sally and Gillian, they appear to be more unlike that alike in their outlook and attitudes. Antonia is more like her Aunt Gillian--beautiful, spoiled, wild, and carefree; whereas Kylie is more like her mother--responsible, introverted, and sensitive. It is only when Kylie's beauty threatens to outshine her own that Antonia begins to contemplate her future and what she has to offer the world, rather than what the world has to offer her. As Kylie develops physically, she becomes surer of herself and more aware of her own beauty. It is only after she is almost sexually assaulted that Antonia and Kylie renew their sisterly bond.Throughout these events, Gillian has formed a relationship with Kylie who looks to her Aunt as a role model for what she believes a woman should be. Thus further strains the relationship between Sally and Gillian as Sally feels that her daughters are still babies, and is not eager to see them grow up just yet. Jimmy's ghostly influence uses their resentment for one another to further destroy Sally and Gillian's sisterly bond and drive them apart forever. Jimmy's spirit seems to take over the back yard where he is buried. The lilacs grow great lengths overnight and their scent draws the attention of the neighborhood women who come to the garden gate to look at them. It seems that the scent of the lilacs stir painful memories in these women, who uncontrollably weep when these memories resurface. Jimmy's influence reaches into the house as well, as food begins to spoil overnight and dead creatures are found in the toilet and sink.On Kylie's 13th birthday, she develops the ability to see auras and other mystical phenomena. It is her that eventually causes Sally and Gillian to realize that Jimmy's spirit is attacking not only the house, but Sally and Gillian themselves. After Sally cuts down the lilacs, things seem to improve. Antonia's biology teacher, Ben Frye, falls in love with Gillian and begins to peruse a relationship with her, although she is adamant that she will be \\"single forever.\\" Sally too is challenged by love when Gary Hallet, an investigator from Arizona looking into Jimmy's disappearance, arrives at her doorstep drawn by a letter Sally sent to Gillian some months prior. With no where else to turn, Sally and Gillian call the Aunts for help in ridding themselves of Jimmy's ghostly influence.On the whole, the beginning and ending of the book is somewhat similar to the movie. Although Jimmy's spiritual death is not as dramatic as it was in the movie and no one becomes possessed, however, this is in keeping with the magical realism genre. The middle part of the book focuses more on Sally's daughters as they grow from teenagers to young adults and draws a parallel between them and the generations of Owens women who have come before.Thankfully the absolutely absurd scene from the movie where the witches jump off their roof with umbrellas is absent from the book. I loved the inclusion of actual spells that are so descriptive of the Aunt's old-world flavor of witchcraft. Although we do get some background information on the Aunts, I think it would be wonderful for Hoffman to write a prequel featuring these wonderful characters.Practical Magic is a book that I will return to again and again. The author's descriptive prose and attention to detail brings a greater depth to the story. It is rich in imagination, ripe with characterization, and possessed of a wisdom that will not be lost on the attentive reader."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"As with many, I saw the movie first. This is where there is a rift as to whether the book or movie is better. I will leave that to you. (See my review of the movie)This is the story of a family that on the surface that seems different from most families. Later we see it is anything but. The lives of several generations of the Owens family are covered from major events to those things that seem minor at the time. This book has a dark undertone and makes you think the cat is going to jump off the refrigerator at any moment. Yet if you quit trying to anticipate the story, you find it rich in beautiful pose and people interaction. Contrarily, this story is interspersed with vulgar language and repugnant images (probably necessary to portray bad guys and bad times.)I personally do not like to read what I call \\"broke neck\\" books. The ones with some girl on the cover that has a neck bent back so she can look up the nostrils of the guy. If it weren't for the promise of magic, I would say they caught me. And I enjoyed reading it. I suppose now I will have to read something else by Alice Hoffman to see if this is her style or a radical departure.Throughout the story, you are not sure if it is luck, logic, or just practical magic.Conjure Wife"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"For centuries the Owens women have been the oddballs.

It is full of suspence, and magic. If you like to read to escape into another world, than this is the book for you. It has love, family, and relationship drama.

It is like the smoothest liquid, like wonderful silk and summer evenings. I mean it. That's what I envision when I read it. It's also very real to me. It seems to capture the feeling of something real. I can almost feel the same moods, the same places. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This story is one filled with family dynamics and love. Hoffman's prose is magically written to keep you enchanted. The characters are similar to the ones in the movie but there are a great number of differences in the story line. The Hollywood version of the story makes it faster paced and better for the 'big screen' with more magic and fantasy. The book is different enough from the movie that you will not feel as though you already know the entire story. There were times when I found myself hoping for a certain event to occur in the storyline or was plesently surprised when something else was not present in the book as seen in the movie.The Owen women are powerful individuals in their own right - all searching for true love (regardless if they admit it or not.) I found it to be a powerful story that was a well blended mixture of emotions and expereinces. The magic she weaves through the story is not overwhelming or too fictionalized to not be believable. Practical, coincidences, with just a hint of magic power often taking the mundance and making it sparkle.If you love the movie-read the book. If you have not seen the movie -read the book then watch the movie. Becareful what you wish for because you may just get it...and more.

This baby deserves one."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Hmmm - I'm not sure what to say about this book because my feelings towards it are so mixed. On one hand, I love Alice Hoffman's unique style of writing and lyrical use of language. I also enjoy stories about love that are non-romances, such as this one concerning sisterly love and the love between mother and daughters. On the other hand, I was rather put off by paranormal aspects of the story, which made the story unrealistic. If I were Sally, I never would have allowed Gillian to move in, and I was quite frustrated through that part of the story and wanted to throw Gillian out myself.I hadn't seen the movie so I had no prior experience with this story. I expect unusual and dark books from Alice Hoffman, and this one was very well-crafted, however it was also too weird and over-the-top for me, and would be my least favorite of her books, even below Turtle Moon. Still, I'm glad I read it because when I admire an author, especially one of Alice Hoffman's calibre, I like to read her entire collection of stories, not just the best or most appealing ones."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Before I begin I would like to say that I am a fan of Alice Hoffman's work, having read over ten of her novels. With that said, Alice Hoffman disapointed me with her lack of \\"magical imagination\\" in this novel, where as the movie version captured a deeper feel for the world of witches and magic (without seeming corny or unrealistic). The charcaters in this novel all share a common desire to be wanted and loved. Sally and Ginny are two sisters who couldn't be more oppisite but Hoffman left me disapointed once again with their realtionship. All throughout the novel I waited for Sally and Gilly to united with an unbrakable bond (much like the movie) however, the two sisters looked towards men instead of eachother for love and companionship. I was hoping for a story more identical to the movie where the owens women are the glue to their family. Instead of Sally and Gilly turning to their family for support they ran away from the aunts and eachother. I especially hated the part where Hoffman tries to show Gilly's loyalty to her sister by calling once a week for a year, as if that would be enough of an insentive to get a deprested widow out of bed, at least in the movie Gilly went to visit her sister and gave her the physical and emotional comfort she needed. Another factored that seemed water down is the description of the aunts and Maria Owens. They were sadly neglected, without enough reading time, and therefor the reader is teased with the idea of who these amazing characters are. I guess my conclusion is that if you are a fan of the movie, as I am and have seen the movie first, brace yourself before picking up this book for it pales in comparison and is nothing more than practical."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I am a man who reads a wide variety of literature. I like Jane Austin and Dickens... loved Jane Eyre. Also love fantasy, Harry Potter, young adult adventures involving magic... I thought this might be a good match for my interests. It read fine- I can't say that I didn't enjoy it at all- I would just say that it was a little too much of a woman's book for me. The magic aspects are merely the gimmick to get you interested- the bulk of the book is about the romantic attachments of the four women involved in the story. Lots of female angst and self doubt, and lusting after the various flavors of studs in the story. If you are a woman, you might love it- if you are a man, it might test your empathy skills. It bears some resemblance to the movie but does not match it closely."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I love Alice Hoffman but think this is the worst book I have ever read by her. There are so many refrences to food and stupid ones that it reads like a bad Julia Childs cookbook, and the only magic in this book is omens. Omens like swans and black cats, a bad Anne Rice. Aside from this the story is weak and without a point. Where is the Hoffman I enjoy?"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I simply don't know what all the fuss is about. Alice Hoffman's style of writing does not impress me in the least. Where's the dialogue!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have no idea how they got the movie from this awful book. It had such potential, such a unique and interesting setting, but went nowhere, did nothing! Every time it seemed like the author was moving towards something interesting, some plot point or twist, she'd just let it DROP! None of her build-ups went anywhere, leaving the plot empty and pointless. She just let everything hang in the air with nowhere to fall. And then she tried to cover up her lack of writing ability by putting an f-bomb about every other page or so. I always thought the movie had a couple of little plot holes in it, but now I know what they were working from, and the movie totally SAVED this shallow story.This is one of the ONLY times I have ever liked the MOVIE more than the BOOK! Ordinarily, I would recommend a book over its film counterpart, but in this case, I would tell anybody to watch the movie and stay far away from the book! What a staggeringly disappointing novel."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have seen the movie and love it. I also have the soundtrack to the movie and love that. I got about half way thru the book and just stopped. I did not like the authors writing style, from a third person point of view. I could not get inside the characters because the book was not told from one of their view- points. Also, it did not flow smoothly for me. The story jumped around and did not unfold evenly. I was very disappointed.

I'm sorry I'm one of them people who usually read the book first and will usually like the book better than the movie. However in this overall situation it's vice versa. When I first saw the movie it was fun and interesting. Highly entertaining and witty. The book was a dreadful bore. Okay first of all the movie added more to the whole overall \\"Magic\\" theme. Here it's pretty much just implied. So okay I can deal with that, Hollywood changes a lot of things. The second thing was the story itself. These woman, interesting but really there just plain boring. Sally and Gillian were only just okay the story itself the situations seem plain and farfetched. As if she was trying to keep it realistic but failed miserably. The worst thing overall I must say it's the writing itself. It was dull. I mean she poured us in detail that could of simply been put across by the actions of the characters, even dialogue . I don't need to know a five sentence paragraph to figure out why Gillian did such a thing because of her personality is different than Sally's which has been described earlier in the book before countless times. I hated the writing of it too much droning details not enough action, I'm sorry but Hollywood saved this story overall. I mean by the time something did seem to happen it was too late I've waited long enough and merely lost interest. Overall it's not worth buying, hardly worth checking out in your public library."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"i like books and this was a bad one. the end"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I am an 8th grader, and I read this book after hearing about the film Practical Magic. Everyone probably thinks this story is mostly about witchcraft, but it doesnt really emphasize on it considering Hoffmann doesnt know that much about it. But overall, it is a fairly good story, about the bonds betweenm these very different sisters and their lives. But the characters were rather undeveloped, and you hardly find any information about who the hell these people are. And the characters personalities were rather bland, because first, there was Gillian, wild, sexy, Sally, plain, Antonia, beautiful, and Kylie, awkward. Women are no simple creatures, and are made of all different elements. If Hoffmann really does understand the feelings of her female readers (which i believe are all of the readers) this should show in her writing. A great story, but these are not very realistic characters. Women want someone they can relate to. If the author followed this form, I believe the book would've had much more praise than it recently has."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The characters are one dimensional. I don't want to be yet another \\"broken record\\" repeating what's already been said but I have to say this: the movie captures the title \\"practical magic\\" better than the book does. I never thought I'd see the day when a movie would out-do the book!The movie captures the essence of magic, whereas the novel tries to give \\"magical advice,\\" but still comes across as bland. The movie is a lot more whimsically inclined and loyal to the title.*possible spoilers as I compare it to the movie*The book is a lot more vulgar and crass. Simplistic in its narration and lacking in the depth of the characters and plot.Jimmy is never even alive in the book (save for his ghost, of course) he was a woman-beater and never really in love with Gillian. Just as insecure and simplistic as she was but just more aggressive about it.Gillian was a blonde (not a redhead) and ditzy to boot! Her self esteem and confidence were non-existent. The movie showed her in a more dignified manner -- and that's pretty bad.Sally was supposed to be the rational and structured one (according to the book AND movie), and she was for the first few chapters, then she deteriorates to an insecure mother who behaves like childishly at times.Antonia is a complete simpleton brat throughout the majority of the book.There's a scene with Kylie almost getting raped.The men are all the same. With only one thing in their mind. Unlike the movie which gives them some form of character.The aunts actually age... etcI could go on, but my point is... the book is a lot less like magic and more like real life drama with simplistic narration to it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have always liked the movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock and I was expecting a very satisfying read. Unfortunately, Practical Magic proved to be a disappointment with its bland characters, loose plot and childish, simplistic tone. Gillian and Sally are one dimensional and mostly just pathetic. Although Sally's daughters are better portrayed than the grown up characters, teenage depression is simply not enough to save a lagging story. Jimmy and his angry ghost, the aunts, the conservative little town the girls grew up and Sally's love interest have very little place in the book and this does not help either.The only real success of the novel is Alice Hoffman's ability to \\"feed\\" magical realism into an impossible place such as the lower middle class American suburbia. Still, this does not compensate for a story that has no charm within itself."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"For someone with AH's writing style, this is how I feel about this book. It really could've been better, although it was not painfully difficult to read. I will agree with the reviews that said that they \\"don't understand how the movie ever came from this book apart from Gillian, and Sally, and the two aunts.\\" I think that seeing the movie frist gave me unfair expectations for how the plot should've been in the book. Not only was the plot out of order, but most parts were so unreccognizable that this book should really be set completely apart from the movie altogether.Now After I got over the fact that the book is different from the movie, even character-wise, I couldn't get over the writing style. It is just not something I'm used to. AH is excellent for her comparative descriptions, and painting a pretty \\"still\\" picture, but she is not good with following through in this story. I have never read another one of her books so I do not know if this is common for her. Also her writing style is described by others as light and easy to read. For me her pen was so light within this story that at some points it barely touched the paper. This is essentially a love story with many twists and turns. I am definately NOT a fan of romance novels, although I guess this one is alright. The fact that it is a romance novel is cleverly almost hidden.If there are those of you who haven't seen the movie as of yet and wish to get this book, I say read the book first and then see the movie. Although I can bet that whichever one is examined first will leave you hating the other. Either the book or the movie since the plot-lines are barely reccognizable. Still, I'm not sorry to have purchased this book as I am a sort of collector of these things."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was a fast page turner and written with alot of satire and humor. The story focuses on two sisters that grew up in a small Massachusetts community under the care of two aunts that everyone knows are witches. One sister, has no desire to live anything but a normal life, to the point of rigid conformity and the other is a free spirit that runs away and wants nothing to do with her family or her history and certainly does not want to be caught dead within a hundred miles of her hometown.But, as adults, one a PTA soccer type mom and the other barely on the run from the law, they find balance together and have to accept the magic with the mundane.The book is very nicely written (I have never seen the movie)and it is heartwarming. It sort of shows how pleasure is to be found in the simple things and that there is nothing wrong with opening your heart to another.When I was done reading the book, I closed it with a smile on my face. A modern day fairy tale, where the characters are flawed and human.The gift of the simple things in life is apparent on every page."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is a great book and it is a real shame that the book got turned into some Hollywood poltergeist movie.

They are so wonderful. And you come to know and love them. And after Reading the book I started to read it again...That's how wonderful it was. I would recomend this at my strongest!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I cannot believe that some reviewers did not like this book. I read it for the first time when I was 13, and stayed up all night reading. I couldn't finifh it in time, so I ran home after school the next day and immediately finished the book. I can reread it over and over again. Read the book before seeing the movie- it is a million times better (except without the great soundtrack). I cannot stress how much I love this book. Teenagers especially can relate to this book, and the struggles of teenagers in the book are perfect even coming from an adult. The fantasy aspect of the book, with the witchcraft, may seem on the outside to be slightly kooky and unrealistic, but Hoffman's writing is so lyrical you can taste everything she describes, you can feel what they feel. I have read and reread this book. All teenage girls should read it, and all mothers of teenage girls should read it to relate... Practical Magic makes you believe in love fairy tales, even after you've been hurt again and agian."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I loved &quot;Practical Magic&quot; the movie when it came out. Mostly due to the fact that it took a different twist towards what &quot;witches&quot; are and kind of stuck to the modern definition that they are more peaceful people -- of course, there's a bit of Hollywood thrown in, but it's forgiveable since &quot;Witches of Eastwick&quot; was so much fun as well. The book, however, is much more fun. If you've seen the movie, you should know that it's based on about 3/8 of the book. It is lengthy, but enjoyable as well. If they were to make a movie out of the whole book, it probably would end up a mini-series on TV. Not only to we get to see what happened to Sally and Gillian, but we get a more indepth look and relationship with Sally's daughters as well. We see the torment they went through school in details, we see their problems with men and boys, growing up, falling in love and searching for happiness. It's more realistic than the movie and it's relatable, which always gets me to keep the books I read in the end. The usage of magic is mostly limited to &quot;thought&quot; and small vocal incantations. Remember the woman who wanted the man to leave his wife and become her lover? We get to see what happens to her -- and remember &quot;be careful what you wish for...&quot; Other than that, I will not reveal any spoilers. It's not just about witches -- it's about women. It's a good book and it's fun. Unfortunately, the two aunts are more developed in the movie than the book, but you'll see why Sally, Gillian and the daughters are more focused upon than they are. Highly recommended reading for those who love a really good book."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! It is such a wonderful read. I was SO disappionted with the film. It could have been wonderful. The casting was terrific, but it doesn't touch on the magical realism, well, except for the Aunts never aging, and there was no silly exorcism scene in the book.I love how Ms. Hoffman weaves her magiacal realism through her plots. Also, how she developes these amazingly honest and rteal relationships between her characters. I think that is one of her strongest themes, family.Anyway, do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK! It was lovely, charming and yes, MAGICAL!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this book before it was made into a movie and found it to be an interesting combination of fantasy and real life situations. The Owens' sisters witchcraft allowed them to do what many of us wished we could do when faced with various situations in our life."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I began *Practical Magic* without expectations -- what a fantastic surprise to stumble upon an author with a true talent for creating complex female characters. Hoffman has made me look at the world around me differently -- now the clouds, grass, and flowers seem to positively glow with life. Best advice: read this book when your in love, finished with love, or waiting for that extraordinary someone (i.e. this is a great book for everyone)!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"A wonderful little ragdoll of a novel - brilliant, but undisciplined, and who cares? It follows something like thirty years in the lives of Gillian and Sally Owens, who are orphaned at the ages of three and four, respectively, and grow up with their aunts (who are neither named nor described until the last fifty pages, as if Ms. Hoffman simply forgot to until that point). Their aunts just happen to be the last in a long line of honest-to-goodness wise woman, herbalist, spell-casting New England witches.I put off reading this for a long time, because, strangely, I don't like to read the sort of fiction I myself write. I finally did because my girlfriend, all of whose friends must summarily read it, would've had my head if I didn't. Well, actually, she probably would've frowned, tapped her foot, and said, &quot;grr,&quot; but you know what I mean. I liked it. It shoots off in weird directions, threads get lost and refound, or not, Antonia (one of Sally's daughters) is tragically neglected, and it's still one of very few books I read in less than two days."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I resented rewatched this movie and noticed it was based on a book so i eagerly got it for my kindle. I'm about a quarter of the way through and I'm not sure I'm going to bother to finish reading it. I'm finding the writing style a bit slow and where the movie was charming and characters were lovable, even with their flaws I'm not finding myself unsympathetic to any of the characters in the book. I'm not compelled to learn what happens to any of them because i just don't care about them. Each character is described as being totally selfish in their own way so i haven't bonded with any of the characters enough to want to read about them."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you like fairy tales, and I'm not talking the watered-down cartoon versions that we grew up on, but classic fairy tales, then you're going to love Hoffman. I'm a fan of all of her work, but Practical Magic and Turtle Moon are my absolute favorites. Although I liked the movie, it does not even begin to compare to this amazing novel. It will transport you into a magical place, scare you a little, and make you appreciate love and family a lot. I would suggest buying this book now, that way you'll have it for the next rainy day. On that day, lock yourself in your house, light some candles, put a Danny Elfman soundtrack and an Anna Madorsky CD on random in your CD player, pour a glass of your favorite beverage, and wrap yourself up thick in a blanket. If you do so, I promise you a little slice of Heaven on Earth."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The first thing to know about the book is that it isn't really at all like the movie with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. So it's almost like false advertisement to have the movie's pictures on the bookcover. Don't get me wrong, both the book and movie are great in their own right. The problem I had with Hoffman's writing was that it was mainly in the narrative. This almost always keeps a reader from connecting with the characters so you're not as involved or moved, so the book never reaches its full potential. It also makes reading it more stilted, awkward although writing in the narrative--without any offense to Hoffman--is cake.The plot on the other hand is great. Superb. This is one of those books that you struggle to get through--not because it's hard to get but because it starts to drag (another sign of too much narrative)--and then love it in hindsight. If you read this, there will be things that you won't forget for a long time. Mostly the little things. One of the Owens' ancestors dancing on broken glass in the moonlight, the story of Maria, cats following Sally home. The detail is amazing and I don't say that lightly, the connection that Sally and Gilly have are described excellantly and overall, if Ms. Hoffman had just written it more from the view of a participant rather than an observer I would have loved it that much more.I actually wish the movie had been more like the book in details. Like Sally's girls are older and there was a lot more character development in the book of all the persons. I do suggest that you read this though because I think I'm the only person picky enough to mind how the book was actually written. My only valid warning though is to not expect it to be like the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Though the time periods and character viewpoints jump around too much, this novel about a NE family of psuedo- witches is full of lush, evocative description. I enjoyed the many descriptions of food, plants and weather, and agree it is similar to Like Water For Chocolate.However, I also agree the plot is somewhat weak, the women too obviously beautiful and somewhat lacking in real personality. This I would blame on the disappointing lack of dialogue in Practical Magic. The men are basically flat. Lust seems to be more important than love--the author seems to want to drive the point home that you cannot escape lust/love no matter how hard you try. I didn't really learn anything from this novel, especially not anything to do with Wicca, witchcraft, or New Age philosophy.Overall it's a pretty good read if you're not too fussy."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I tracked down this book because I loved the movie. And, as hollywood usually does, the movie is generally poorer than the book it is based on. Boy, was I disappointed! The movie is far far far superior to the book. Interesting plots are dangled before you, but lead nowhere. Character development and growth is hoped for in the story, but never achieved. Gillian and Sally in the movie? Fabulous and fascinating. Gillian and Sally (and their daughters) in the book? Unremarkable and annoying. Allegory and symbolism in the movie? Ok, I'll admit, dumbed down a bit. But in the book? Terrible, and stuffed down your throat in the most condesending way. And the overall writing style? Atrocious! Seems like a draft of a book, rather than the finished product. I love modern fiction, but I am very sorry I spent money on this book. Also note that, on purpose, I didn't watch the movie again right before reading the book, just to take a clearer perspective of the author's words - and I still thought it was terrible!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"and after mulling it over I think that the book was OK, but not great. I admit I did see the movie several times before I bought the book, and they are VERY different from one another. The movie was much more dramatic, whereas the book(for me) moved very slowly. the aunts were not very promiant. There was barely any magic in the book and it didn't seem like much of a love story, Gary only shows up near the end. I didn't care about the characters, unlike the movie where it made me ache to have a sister! So, I went and bought the movie! I'm quite happy now."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read the book before I saw the movie. I loved it. I found it an easy, relaxing read. It was scary without being a horror story. What I found unique about this book is that it is a modern day fantasy story that almost seemed as if it could happen. It was out there, but not in the same way as the TV show, Charmed. I did not predict the ending. I liked it and I will read it again."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this book and I was hooked on Alice Hoffman's amazing writing ability.

Haven't seen the movie yet - I heard it wasn't very good, but then when do the movies ever live up to the book? Practical Magic has truly amazing characters and Hoffman's descriptions are just beautiful. Read this book and I guarantee it will become one of your favorites."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"As the book has not yet come out on the market I saw the film. Its humoristic, romantic and magic. Sandra Bullock does a good job as the &quot;I'll-never-fall-in-love-sister&quot; and she makes the movie live. I belive that the book is just as good as the movie, if not better as books offen are and when it comes out on the market I'll be the first to red it. I hope that you see the film or red the book, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I've read nearly all of Hoffman's work, and &quot;Practical Magic&quot; simply aces them all. The characters are well shaped, the story lovingly crafted and the writing style is evocative and lush. Those who snipe at the &quot;mistakes&quot; she makes in occult lore are missing the point. She's not out to write a textbook in witchcraft. Hoffman writes about the unseen and mystical events that hide beneath the mundane goings on of everyday life--and she does so with vivid imagination and unrestrained verve."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I heard about this book when the movie came out and I thought I might go see it but I didn't. Well while I was at an airport getting ready to go on my vacation I spotted this book and I decided &quot;Sure why not? I need something to read during the flight and boring times on the cruise.&quot; so I did. I started reading on the plane and I couldn't put it down. I kept on reading and reading and it just captured me. I was stuck to the book! I didn't even realize when we were about to land but I was already half way through the book! I couldn't wait to read the rest of it! So I finished the book within 2 days. The book was good, really good, it quite possibly could be my all time favorite book so far. The tale about 2 sisters and how they had to live in a town where they were ridiculed and made fun of because they were part of the Owens family, the most rumored and gossiped family in the town. How Alice Hoffman described scenes also captured me. The use of words she used were absolutley beautiful. I could picture the old Owens house, I could picture the lilacs growing in front of Sally's house. Even the characters stood out in my mind. And what interesting characters they were. It was like they were real and you were watching them live. This book was written with a wonderful rythm that just kept me going and going. A charming book, I extremley suggest people to get a hold of this book."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This was the first book I had ever read by Alice Hoffman, and I can honestly say this is turely my favorite book of all time. This book touched my soul from the beginning. Sally and Gillian's characters are so real that by the end of the book your ready to call them on the phone. If you want to read a book about unconditional love and hope, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"A helluva lot better than the movie"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I don't know why all the other reviews are so horrible! I read this book a long time ago, and have read it tons of times since! It's sad, but yet heartwarming. I can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was more about sisters and the power of females than it was about magic. If they wernt all so self absorbed the plot might have gone somewhere but they spent most of the time bickering over clothes and who was prettier. It was ok but I wouldnt read it again."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The people who've been giving this book a negative review must never have had fairytales told to them during scary thunderstorm nights. It has that sort of quiet, thoughtful quality. The &quot;frightening&quot; part was how much the sisters lives are like my own family's life. I read it twice in as many days, finding something new in it both times. It's meant only to make you stop and think for a moment."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I read this book in a span of 5 days, a big feat with school and homework. The book was very fun to read. I saw the movie first, and when I realized it was based on a book, I went out and bought it. The movie wasn't the best, but the characters were intriguing and the plot line was interesting. The book was, to my surprise, much better than the movie. I didn't want to put it down. It's a great story for &quot;realistic fantasy&quot; lovers."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"For anyone who has seen the movie, this book is surprising. It's such a well written story, yet so not what I pictured."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Great product. Im very happy with it! In new condition and great for the gift i got it for! Christmas Present"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Read this book on a cross-country road trip and it was really enjoyable. Couldn't wait to read the next segment when I switched off from driving. Great characters, great story, very engaging. Almost nothing like the film, but if you go into the book knowing that, you can enjoy both the film and the book based on their separate merits. Both have things to offer."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I watched the movie first never knowing that there was a book that this movie was based on. I loved the movie, I really believe that this was the first time I was glad &#34;hollywood&#34; changed things in the book to make this book stand apart from the rest. Made it more believable and realistic. I was not so enamored of the book. My mother always said that to get through a few chapters you'll find something to catch your interest, nothing in this book captured my interest. It was boring and uneventful, like everyday life. Sometimes we like to take a trip through the writers eyes and enjoy the scenery and the drama for something outside our lives and this for me just was not it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is not my sort of book. Having said that, I loved it. Fortunately someone recommended it to me, and I didn't read that it really was about \\"magic\\". I'm so glad, since I wouldn't have read it otherwise. I'm working at convincing others who say that it isn't their type of book to give it a try. Again, loved it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Anyone that loved the movie, will not like this book. I have seen the movie more times than I can count, so I was excited to get this book. I was very disappointed. The aunts really do not have a place except here and there. The closeness of all the women was just lacking to me. One of my favorite parts of the movie is what led up to Jimmy's death and the solution. So not in the book. The magic is just lacking. Sorry."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Why read: Loved the movie.What impressed me: I loved the characters, the magic and the obviously deeper meaning that family is more powerful than any magical ability. This was an extremely well-written book.What disappointed me: I really, really loved the movie adaptation and the book just didn't give off the same vibe. It was sort of stuffier, less light-hearted at times and just not all that easy to get through. It was just way more serious than I was expecting or wanting.Recommended: Yes, but only for those who didn't see and absolutely love the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Over the years, I have heard a wide range of reviews of Hoffman's books, and I have always been curious. This marks the third of her books that I have read, and maybe it was the low-bar of expectations that I had, but it is definitely the one that I have enjoyed the most. It was a fun read - and surprisingly fast considering the lengthiness of the chapters. And though the plot was mostly predictable, the likable characters made it still an enjoyable read.The only main drawback with the novel was one of my own preference. I do not like third-person omniscient narrators in general - particularly not when the perspective flits about erratically \\"zooming\\" in and out in focus. It gives the entire story a very heavy-handed \\"storyteller\\"-vibe that does work for the magic of the story overall, but would probably be less abrasive to me personally in an audiobook version.All in all, it is a quaint story and a lot more charming than I expected it to be. I have yet to see the film version, but I am looking forward to comparing the two - I definitely can see why this was made into a movie. It will be interesting to see how Hollywood tackles this!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"And, I liked this better for having seen the movie. The book doesn't have the same humor or sweetness, unfortunately, nor does it treat witches with the same semi-flip fun magical attitude. It does portray a somewhat similar plot, though, and all the depth of the relationship between the sisters. I probably won't read another Hoffman, but I'm glad I read this one."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic is an amazing book and way better than the film adaptation. Like many, I discovered the film first and thought it was adorable but the book is on a whole different level. I've recommended this book to many of my friends and I haven't had any negative feedback yet. However, having an interest and/ or acceptance of the world of natural magick may possibly be the key to fully enjoying and even relating to the book. I just wish they would make another movie that follows the book version more closely."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I really liked the book. It was different than what I expected....Practical Magic is a tale of two sisters, Gillian and Sally Owens, brought up by their guardian aunts in a world of magic from which they eventually escape - one by running away, the other by marrying. Many years go by before strange circumstances thrust them together again. Three generations of Owens women are then united in an experience of unexpected insight and revelation, teaching all of them that what is called the magical are rare and wonderful endowments."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Very good - Differs from the movie as it gives more insight into family life. At times, cannot put it down."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"For once, in the history of time, I've found that I like the MOVIE better than the book.Such a shock.This is still a good read, but having seen the movie first, I was disappointed that the characters weren't the same as the movie, and that there wasn't a fuller version of the story in the book, more on their witchy side, their lives filled in...Well, their lives were filled in, but not as you'd expect the Sally and Jilly that you know from the big screen.Alice Hoffman still pulls you in with her writing, she knows how to make it all real, sexy, and even dark.A very good read - I'm just prejudiced by the movie!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"When their parents died, Sally stepped up to bad, calming the sitter down long enough to have her riffle through her mother's address book and called the aunts. If the aunts didn't step up to the plate, Sally and Gillian would become wards of the state.The aunts took them in. While growing up, Sally and Gillian are teased and tormented while growing up, asll all Owens daughters are. Gillian, the youngest, rude and selfish, runs away at 18. Sally, ever so smart, calm and responsible, has done nothing but take care of them all, cleaning, laundry, healthy meals. She meets a man, falls in love and has two beautiful girls, Antonia and Kylie.When her husband dies, remained in bed for year before she finally awakens and begins fresh. She's tired of the life she lives while in the aunts' house; Kylie, the youngest, is much like Sally, while Antonia is growing up just as spoiled, rude and selfish as her aunt Gillian. Desperate for a change, she buys a house on Long Island and moves the girls away.And just when the monotony of life feels comfortable to Sally, Gillian shows up at her door in the middle of the night, her mean and abusive boyfriend, Jimmy, stone cold dead in the passenger seat of his car. In the heat of the moment, it's decided they'd bury Jimmy in the back yard.And that's when their lives completely change...While I thought the story was good, I had a hard time with it. Yes, the characters were interesting, watching them grow, and change from who they were to someone better, learning about themselves as they go along. When Hoffman wanted her character to be rude, the character was; happy, sad, determined... You could feel everything with the characters.But I had such a difficult time reading this one. There were no chapters, only four parts - which made it a long story with no breathing room. It was getting to the point where my attention was wandering and I wanted to skim the pages, which I barely refrained from doing. There was no separation between scenes from the past, present, and future; it's reading memories as each of the characters are in focus, or what's to come later. And no differentiation between characters, either. And for me, that's a huge fault, and it took away from the book. I hate to say it, but if I'd read the book first, I may have never had the urge to watch the movie. And I own the movie on VHS and DVD.However, I thought the feelings and lessons learned were beautiful. How each learned to love, forgive, forget, changing themselves into a better person, is the best part of the story. I'm rating this one 3.5 stars - I say read it and come to your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The book was delivered in excellent condition:) I was concerned when it did not arrive by the estimated date. Truckee has had some mail dilvery issues. I e-mailed the vendor and they responded very quickly:):) This put my mind as ease, and I received the book within a few days. Thank you so much. This vendor is absolutely wonderful to deal with :):):)P.S. I am really enjoying this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you've only seen the movie then you need to read the book. You're missing so much and that is such a shame. The movie is only a wildly adapted slice of what the book contains. Gillian is even more flawed than Nicole Kidman could have handled and Sally is as rigid as rebar. These are older, wiser, more complex characters than the film portrays. Although the aunts, delightfully fleshed out by Stockard Channing and Diane Weist, are only background characters here, Sally's daughers are given front and center attention as girls becoming women. It is, I think, an even trade. Hoffman tells the story of the Owens' sisters simply and beautifully. The tone is almost matter-of-fact, not unlike wisdom shared, sage advice given by the older and the wiser."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This isn't Haffman's best, but was still a desent read. I would reccomend it to someone who wasn't expecting anytihng like the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"It took me a little bit to get through this book. I lost interest a couple of times. It had a lot of potential, but I have not been able to read another Hoffman book since."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I enjoyed watching the movie that was based on the book. I wanted to see what the differnce between the two."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I liked the movie better. And this is something I never say. The book focuses less on Sally and more on her daughters and her sister,Gillian. The aunts, so colorful in the movie, have little to do until the very end of the book. Gary is not a very well developed character either. In the book, Sally's daughters are teenagers, going through all those things teenagers go through. I guess I just like the emphasis on Sally that the movie presented. There were many scenes in the movie which were not in the book. I really liked the scene where the women of the town overcame their fears and went to the aunts' house to help the Owens women get rid of Jimmy for good. This is not in the book. This is the first Alice Hoffman book I have read. I'm not sure I would invest in another one. I'll probably just borrow one from a friend or the library."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The book Practical Magic was the inspiration for the movie Practical Magic, which happens to be one of my favourite movies! There are a number of changes from the book to the movie, but both have that special charm for which Ms. Hoffman is known.I did find some of the changes interesting though. I have to admit, I missed the presence of the aunt's in the novel. The charm of their characters was still in the novel, but I would have liked that they played a larger role. I also found it a bit unusual that Sally moved away from her family.Regardless, the basic plot still remains, whereby Gillian accidentally kills her boyfriend, and the resulting cover-up creates a magical intrusion in her and Sally's lives. This intrusion takes a slightly different form in the novel however. This is in part due to the fact that Sally's children are teenagers in the novel, not children. This certainly doesn't take away from either the written or movie version of the story, it's just a little difference I noticed!So, if you have ever seen the movie, I highly suggest reading the book as well! Books are always better than the movies after all."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Enjoyed the beautiful writing and magical story. I had seen the movie years ago and I liked the movie. However, the book in all of its elements is much better. The characters and places are much more real in the book. Great read!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This purchase was well worth the effort. Though it was lacking a dust jacket I was pleased nonetheless. The important parts are within the covers. For the price and speed of shipment this copy of Practical Magic by Alice Hoffman was well worth it. The book arrived in good shape and I would definately do business again."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"what a great story...i saw the movie first not knowing that there was a book and i love them both."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I felt like a light & short witchy book which is exactly what this book is. I haven't seen the movie so I was not biased by that.It's aimed squarely at females, even so I found it quite good."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Practical Magic is one of my all time favorite movies. I love everything about it, from the sweeping views to the gorgeous home that was built just for the set! When I found the book on Amazon I decided to give it a read.I was so not expecting what I found! This book is enthralling, it pulls you in and holds you captive with it's rich descriptions and full bodied characters. No wonder they made it a movie.I'm so impressed with this author I've ordered two more of her books. I would highly recommend this book to anyone! It's wonderfully written, and not too \\"witchy\\" for those who aren't into witches.Happy Reading =}"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This story is the perfect blend of the real and the magical. Starting with two orphaned girls being raised by their \\"unconventional\\" aunts...the book then blossoms into an examination of family relationships, true love, and what hope and belief really mean.The relationships between the Aunts (Frances and Bridget-known as Jet), the girls (Sally and Gillian), and Sally's children (Antonia and Kylie) develop and change over the 30 year or so timespan of the book in a way that is absolutely something beautiful. The growth of all of these characters, the hard lessons learned, the joy and wonder embraced...make it a treasure even aside from it's magic.But this book does indeed also have a very magical side. There is magic woven through the Owens family dating back hundreds of years. The Aunts actively practice love magic for the town's women, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Sally and Gillian struggle though out their lives wavering between embracing what they are and rejecting it in the attempt to live a more normal life. By the conclusion, after one particularly hard lesson is learned, they seem to have found that balance...Note: I would have given this a full 5 stars if not for the element of animal sacrifice involved in the Aunts love magic.NOTE: Honest Review of a book from my personal library - purchased from another retailer."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I mostly read HORROR. However, I'd seen the movie several years earlier & liked it, so I went ahead and tried the book. I was AMAZED at How Well Written the Novel is. It's Up-Beat & Bewitching. The momentum that Hoffman had for this book never faltered. As for the \\"Witches\\" it's only a minor part of the tale.Honestly, I'm not a big fan of female writers. IMO, they mostly write Fluff these days. I still like the movie, even if you're like me; usually the book is always better.It's 1 of the few books I'll reread in the future.:)"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This book was enjoyable but if you are a fan of the movie then you might want to wait for a while to read this when the movie isn't so fresh in your mind. They expand a lot more on the daughters of Sally which I really loved but it isn't a quick read book & can get laborous. Still good, glad I finished it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I just loved loved loved this book. I had bought it on hard cover but loaned it out and never got it back. Now with my kindle it is mine forever :)similar to the movie but better"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"When two young girls, Sally and Gillian, are orphaned it is Sally (who is wise beyond her years) that calls her aunts (white witches) and says that she and her sister are coming to live with them. The girls spend their childhood as targets for taunts and pranks of the other townschildren simply because no one understands them and associates them with the Owens women who have been rumored to be witches. Indeed they are witches, of the benevolent kind. The girls get a view of hypocrasy when every evening the women of the town come to the back door of the aunts' house and beg and plead for a spell to bring them true love. But as Aunt Bridget cautions, \\"Be careful what you wish for\\". In an effort to save herself from heartbreak young Sally vows never to fall in love; Gillian, however, \\"can't wait to fall in love\\".As they grow both girls can't wait to be free from the aunts. Gillian runs off with a young man and works her way through three husbands. Sally finds herself deeply in love with a local man. They marry and have two lovely daughters but alas, Sally's husband meets with an untimely death. She moves herself and her daughters back to the aunts house and suffers a year-long bout of depression. She vows yet again to take keep her daughters from harm and herself from love. To that end she moves her small family to Long Island, a place where she feels they can be normal.One night Gillian arrives at the Long Island house with the body of her dead boyfriend in the car. In an effort to cover up the deed (an overdose of a potent natural drug), Sally helps Gillian bury the body in her yard. That's when strange and potentially evil things start to happen. It takes a visit by the aunts along with some strong magic to dispell the strange happenings and bring true love to both Gillian and Sally.I enjoyed this book immensely. Tightly woven story, lyrical prose, a bit of humor, lots of magic, and charismatic characters. Like other reviewers I wanted to finish this book in one sitting. It is definitely a page-turner. Hoffman has a definite winner in this book.Also recommended: The Probable Future by Alice Hoffman"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Nothing at all like the movie, with a few exceptions. But all in all, a beautifully written novel about love, luck, and pain.I loved the fact that the book had what the movie did not, a love story for Sally and Gillian as well as Sally's daughters. So interesting.It took me a bit to get into it, but by the time I made it to the 2nd of 3rd section I was really interested.Hoffman's use of superstitions and folklore are a nice addition and I really loved characters like Ben who were excluded from the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"A weird situation, where the movie was so good it overwhelmed the book. Unfortunately I read the book afterwards, and kept resenting the diversion from the script. However the book is great, and evokes the Owens family in a more realistic and twisting way, rather than the script which focused on only one aspect, ie Jimmy. This stays in my library.

Just one or two flaws with this plan. Nothing is going to be simple when you have a zombie ex after you, and that your elderly aunts are all witches.Being your chick-lit romance, a new bloke of course will enter the picture, as well.A reasonably entertaining book that is deliberately fluffy, and maybe a little slow in places with the flashbacks."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This was my first Alice Hoffman book, and I have been hooked ever since.If you are looking for the movie in print, you have found the WRONG book! Though the same basic idea is still there, the book is a separate entity from the movie.I enjoyed every page of the book. I found the writing so well presented that I read as slow as possible, just to relish every word.The characters are more lovable than in the movie, and I found the story of two sisters magical.This is a must-read for anyone who enjoys reading mysticism."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is a great story written so well with love, lust and magic.

I did not know she existed before the promo for the movie. I am now one of her biggest fans. Her style of writing is so refreshing. She spins a tale of adventure,hope, and everlasting love like no one has in a long time. There was never a dull moment in the book and the reader felt that they were a part of the story the whole time. Can't wait to see how they portrayed the charecters in the movie."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Gripping, can't put the book down, detailed, exciting. I like how the book keeps adding new adventures, and held my interest to the very end.

What ended up happening was within the next twenty four hours i had finished the book, to my dissapointment. What's a girl to do? I read it again. And again. And again. Hoffamn is at her best with this book, her voice light and compelling as she draws you into the story of Sally and Gillian. This book is absolutely one of my favourites, ever. People who say otherwise watch too much TV and play too much golf, and have had their imaginations long since rotted away."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is the first novel by Alice Hoffman that I have read, and let me tell you, I have put an order for the rest of her books. The novel is an easy read, fast paced, enchanting, with beautiful descriptive powers and very believable characters-unlike others who characters are far from a real person's reality. The only regret I have is the book ended too soon-I wanted to stay with the Owens LONGER! Looking forward to the movie to see if it's possible to come close to the beauty of the book. If the star rating went higher than five stars, she would definitely deserve at least ten!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Alice Hoffman has a way with words that is truly unique.

Trying to read the book in one day or sneak back whenever i had a chance"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"This is my favorite book by Alice Hoffman. Sure, it's a fairy tale, but the characters are so interesting it makes you wish you really knew people like that. I got this book from the library, read it straight through, and went out and bought a copy for myself. I have no idea what the movie version will be like, but the book is just pure magic, there are no other words to describe it!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Much like the other reviewers, I only came to this book after falling in love with the film adaptation. It is entirely impossible for me to discern which of the two is better- I'll leave that distinction up to you! My preference seems to really depend on the mood I am in.For those of you who are unacquainted with the film, I can tell you that this is a highly enjoyable, but at times heart-wrenching story. This is especially so in the novel. It tackles heavy subject matter, including death, lust, the pains of adolescence, alcohol abuse, and domestic violence. This story follows the lives of several characters as they move through life, always trying to run from their past and their upbringing, but never quite winning the battle, no matter how hard they try. What makes this gritty story so special though, is the magic that weaves in and out of the lives of these characters. The author presents this magic as completely matter of fact. It is just a part of the lives and world of these character, whether they buy into it or not, making it more a fascinating part of the setting than a spotlight in the story. Those who have viewed the film know that magic is essential to the plot in many ways, and is one of the main focuses of the film, but in the novel, we can see that it plays second fiddle to the intimate details of these characters' lives.Overall, I was impressed with the scope of this story and the messages that rang true over and over as I flew through the pages. This story is intense, dark, tense, and sensual - a very enjoyable combination. If you like a good dollop of witchiness with your tea and often find a little bit of magic interspersed into your own life, you will certainly be in good company here.The only reason the book gets four stars is because I was at times a bit distracted by the author's writing style. It takes an imaginative reader to make it through this story. The way the author writes is very blunt. She spells the plot out for you, but seems to struggle with spreading descriptive information seamlessly into the work. Sometimes there is beautiful prose describing a scene or a sensation a character is feeling, but other times, the words simply guide the reader through a progression of events. If the author had been able to integrate more detailed description into the overall plot, this novel could have been improved.Still, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book, especially to anyone who likes emotional stories with a solid plot and a basis in magical realism."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I have enjoyed more than one of Alice Hoffman's books, but this may be my favorite.I was swept up in the story immediately and finished the book in three nights. The story is about family life, and how love can drive people to extremes.The author's style really shines in this book. Her descriptions of flowers, trees, smell, the weather are utterly poetic. There is a magical quality to Hoffman's writing that I absolutely love.I highly recommend this book whether or not you have read any of Alice Hoffmans other novels."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I had seen a movie on TV of the book and I liked it so well I wanted to read the whole book to see what I was missing.The book was as enjoyable as the movie and more.Pat Rose"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I found TURTLE MOON and SECOND NATURE at a used book store and have been an Alice Hoffman fan ever since.PRACTICAL MAGIC is one my favorite Hoffman stories because of the quirky characters and off-beat plot.The movie, however, did the book no justice, except in the casting of Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist as the 'aunts.' They were dead on. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman just didn't do it for me.If you want a good read for the beach or a stormy summer night, this book is for you. Hoffman continues to turn out quality work...she's one of the best.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book and I absolutely loved the movie. I decided to try the book. It was one of the most fascinating reading experiences I have ever embarked upon. There are only two other authors who bring me that depth of involvement-- Madeleine L'Engle and Lucy Maud Montgomery. But Hoffman has a narrative style that makes me think that this is a story that one should read aloud or hear from someone. She captures you from beginning to end with the weave of narrative. I read each section of the book without stopping within a section. To have stopped in a section would have taken away from the narrative flow.It is best to look at the book and the movie as two separate stories. They must be told differently because they are different media. The movie medium is sound and pictures, so the narrative cannot be the same as the book, a medium which relies on words. You could not have translated Hoffman's story as it was into a movie. This is why I'm glad that the movie is so much different than the book. Each is a good story on its own and could have only been told the way it was in the medium it was produced in."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Don't expect this book to be anything like the movie. The movie took the characters' names, some of their personality traits, and a couple of plot lines and mixed them up into an unrecognizable parody of this amazing book. That's not to say the movie was all bad. I might have liked it more if I hadn't read this book first and loved it so much.Practical Magic tells the story of the Owens' women whose bad luck with men is notorious. It would be difficult to give a short summary of the plot since it is interjected with little anecdotes from the lives of ancestors, the girls who grow up(Sally and Gillian) under their aunts' (more or less) care, and Sally's daughters.As usual, Hoffman paints the tale with beautiful descriptions and a wonderful narrative. One of my favorite parts is the the description of the lilacs and the effect they have on other people in the town.I highly recommend this book. Not all of Hoffman's books are as good, but this is one of her best. See my review of &quot;Turtle Moon&quot; as well."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I thoroughly enjoy all of Alice Hoffman's work. She has a way of turning phrases into works of magic. Her 11th novel, PRACTICAL MAGIC, may be her best work to date. In this novel she explores the lives of two sisters who share one powerful secret, the gift of magic. They bring their powers together not just to ease their own unhappiness and cover up a deadly mistake, but also to bind them together after life has torn them apart. The movie version is extremely entertaining and one of my favorite movies, but if you have only seen the movie don't miss out on the reading experience. Hoffman's power with the English language is a remarkable achievement, maybe even magical!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"As a faithful reader of Alice Hoffman for years, this is her most fantastic book ever. I've read all her books, and are currently half-way through her newest release &quot;River King&quot;, I must say that it seems hard to outstand &quot;Practical Magic&quot;. The film was entertaining, but the script was changed in too many ways, I guess we all make up the settings in books differently. For new Alice Hoffman readers, I would recommend to start with &quot;Practical Magic&quot; and then read her earlier and later books. She has something in her books that really appeal to me, making the magic seem so ordinary, and the ordinary seem so magic. Alice Hoffman really knows how to drag you into her world and make you stay - the books are just too exiting to put away. Try them - enjoy!"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I experienced something with Practical Magic that I've absolutely never experienced before--I liked the movie better than the book. Truthfully, I didn't know the movie was based on a book until many years after my first--and numerous subsequent--viewings of the film later. I'm not even sure it's fair to judge one agaisnt the other; we could be talking about two entirely different stories here that just happen to have the same title. But not judgeing one against the other is a very hard thing to do, especially since I found one far superior to the other.I had to give the book at least three stars, though, because if there's one thing Alice Hoffman knows how to do it's turn a sentence. Her stories all have a unique, lyrical, unbroken flow to them from beginning to end, and Practical Magic is no different. But she also has a trademark style that, in a story like this which covers three generations of Owens women, you wish she would break away from a bit. Most of the nearly three hundred pages is told in narrative form that's pretty, but doesn't give the characters much of a voice. At times I found myself thinking \\"Enough peotry alreay, let the girls speak!\\" However, whenever I got my way I'd regret it: the diologue only made the women seem mean and selfish, which they absolutely were niney percent of the time. Only Sally ever came across as likable, and even then it was because she was the only one who didn't act senseless at best, and downwright spiteful at worse.I really thought I was going to like this book tremendously, because it starts out like the film: Sally and Gillian are orphaned, move in with the aunts, and are alienated by the townsfolk, who think of the Owens as witches and shun them except when they're desperate for a \\"love potion\\". Soon after, though, is when the movie veered off course with the book, and rightly so, in my opinion. After Sally loses her husband, she packs the girls up and moves to New York, and THAT is where the rest of the novel takes place. Not the aunts beautiful, magical house by the sea, but a boring, unoriginal suburb off the Turnpike. That's when I started to fall out of the story. For me, setting was a huge part of what made Practical Magic the movie so charming. I kept hoping Sally and Gillian would pack it up and go back to the aunts, but it never happened. And as for Sally's daughters, they didn't stay sweet, cute little girls with hair identical to their mommy and aunt Gillian, but instead quickly became bratty teenagers that I could have gone all book long without.I guess what I found most dissapointing about Practical Magic the book is that it didn't have the innocent, whimsical quailty I was expecting. I should have known early on in the story when the girls were still young, and Gillian, after she and Sally are teased by some town kids, says [...] them all.\\" AFter that, the F word is dropped a little too regularly, and sex and lust become practically interchangeable. The R rated aspects of the novel were completely unnecessary, and in fact clashed with the overall feel of the story. In the end I'm glad I read it, if for no other reason than to see what Practical Magic was intended to be, but I wish I had done what I always do and read the book before I saw the movie. Maybe then the movie version would be foremost on my mind, and I wouldn't have this bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"You've read the summary, so I'll just cut to the chase. First of all, loved, loved, loved Hoffman's 'voice' and use of language: Gillian's passion for her new biology teacher lover melts all the butter in the house, a woman pounds on her lover's door until she literally breaks her hand -- Hoffman is very good at powerful, evocative images, at gliding on the surface and gazing at the tempestuous emotions below her.However, everything else about this novel began to irritate me before long. Hoffman was obsessed with pairing everyone up, down to the last obnoxious teenager, and the only romance that held any appeal for me was the one between Gillian and Ben. Gary (Sally's love interest) was boring and entered the story much too late for me. (He doesn't seem to be a very good investigator, either.) Also, the swearing seemed unnecessary, as if it came out of a different book. I might try Hoffman again, but I won't be re-reading this one."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Growing up is difficult for everyone- even when you're normal but for Gillian and Sally life is almost impossible for they have a gift, a gift of MAGIC.This book follows the girls as they grow up with their strange aunts, in a own that just can't accept them. Sally is the quiet, down to earth type that cares more for others and is always willing to lend a helping hand where as Gillian is the opposite she is a wild child that has only one thing on her mind - MEN. When Sally is called unexpectantly one evening her life is changed forever. This book has to be give 5 stars because where would you find such realism in one place. Alice Hoffman is a true writer that has the power to pull you into a story and make you want to read it over and over again!!!!Pick this book and you will never put it down."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I admit that I saw the movie before I read the book and to be honest was a little disappointed in the book. I felt that it just lacked the drama to keep the reader interested. I kind of felt that the Aunts were just a side part of the book and they should not have been. I also felt that it wasn't clearly portrayed that both Sally and Gillian were &quot;witches&quot; and why Sally was so determined to not bring her girls up that way. I also felt the appearance of Gary didn't make any sense since he was only in the last three chapters and his character was never developed beyond a side character to whom Sally falls in love with. We don't know why she falls in love she just does. To her credit Ms. Hoffman is a remarkable writer and I would purchase books by her again."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"You never know what to expect from an Alice Hoffman book, except for an incredibly light touch that belies her sharp contol of plot. She has such finesse as she writes, and she writes in such a unique style, it is hard to put one of her books down for a second. This author loves writing, and it shows. You will love the results. I do not think there is another living writer who is able to entwine such magic and realism into a story the way she does, all the time focusing on daily life and never losing sight of the mysteries that cause us to act in the ways that we do, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad reasons.When there is a double ragged ring around the moon, when the smell of lilacs is strong and it is well past the time they should have finished blooming...when you have a family whose odd heritage goes back hundreds of years and they draw people to them unexpectedly...there you will find Alice Hoffman, weaving happy endings out of strange happenings, and lovely images out of eerie events. Don't ever try to outthink her. Part of the fun is just enjoying the way she pulls it all together in the end. Truly special."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I am a real fan of magic realism. But most of the genre is from South America or Mexico. So it is delightful to find one that is American. I read this book years before the movie came out. I've seen the book a couple of times. I just recently re-read the book.The movie retains the major events from the book, but the timespan is greater in the book. The book revolves around the theme of love. The damage that love can do, the transformative nature of love, and the beauty of love.In both the book and the movie, there is a minor character who comes to the aunts because she is obsessed with a married man. She begs them to do anything to get his love and attention. In the movie, that's the end of it. In the book, however, the man becomes obsessed with her and won't give her a moment of peace and she ends up regretting it.If you haven't read the book, please do. It is wonderful, lyrical, thoughful, and moving. There is a lot to think about, and I really enjoyed re-reading it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Once again, Alice Hoffman has given us a delightfully charming story that starts out as a fairy tale and becomes true life extraordinary.

The writing was so beautiful and I loved the fact that Ms. Hoffman didn't have to anything dealing with magic to make the plot interesting. It was wonderful the way it was.

I loved it."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you are a factual person and prefer drama and law movies/books, you will despise this novel. Luckily, I'm not one of them.I admit, there ARE other novels out there by Hoffman that are better (including *Turtle Moon*) that give more rational explanations for the outcomes. However, *Practical Magic* delievers a feeling I've never gotten from a novel before. The way her words weave the characters in and out of trouble; the way her descriptions intice you and give you an aching feeling in your heart; the way mystical things happen to an everday tale when you least expect it.I realize that I am female and that the lead characters are all females so I would relate to them easier than males, but that does not mean that men should not read this novel. Everyone, including males and three-year olds and eighty-one -year olds, have always fantasized and dreamed about the day that they will be riding that white horse off into the sunset, and in this novel, that is as close as you will get.Because it is only . . . magic."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"The Magic in this book lies in the exquisite ability Alice Hoffman has of seeing the mystical aspect of everyday living and loving. Her characters are richly developed, explored, and endearing. From beginning to end I was enchanted--I'm a sucker for vivid detail and flawless imagery. Please read it before seeing the movie (though the film will disappoint, I think)"},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"Yes, it seems to me that a male person really misses something essential about this book. I've just read a load of praising reviews by female readers, and it's all very confusing: I didn't find any special magic in this book, though it's well written and not boring in any sense. I think the endless and ever-so-deadly love affairs make this a comedy. The emotions are so overwhelmingly powerful that they aren't simply realistic. Well, that goes for entertainment, but this is not a masterpiece, believe me."},{"Title":"Practical Magic","review":"I don't usually complain about the prices of Kindle books, but -- paperback $7, Kindle version $13?

Not to say that I didn't like the book, but it was missing everything I loved about \\"Practical Magic.\\" In the film it was real magic...in the book it seemed more like silly little love 'spells' that aunts liked to do in their spare time.

O'Connell got in on the ground floor of research into questions regarding man's origins. He read all the relevant literature in English, French, Italian, Spanish and German. Here he brings forth the archaeological, paleontogical and astronomical evidence which confirms the traditional Catholic teaching that the human race did not evolve from lower animals - and that it began with a single man and woman. Though he wrote in 1959, the research findings he reports are still almost unknown today and the crisis of faith caused by unfounded scientific hypotheses has worked havoc in the Church and undermined the faith of most Catholic intellectuals and of many &quot;ordinary&quot; Catholics. Fr. O'Connell gives the scientific evidence why the Church was right about Adam and Eve and the Great Flood. This book is a major contribution and is destined to have a tremendous impact on rebuilding the faith of Catholics! 439pp. PB. Imprimatur."},{"Title":"Science of Today & The Problems of Genesis","review":"This is a very good book for those who wish to refute evolution, in favor of creation as written in the Bible.The author uses many reference materials from both evolutionists and creationists to show that, when all is said and done, evolution is a religious viewpoint that has no foundation to stand on.Some of the most interesting cases are those &quot;hard-core&quot; evolutionists, who, when they finally began to examine the evidence, chose to abandon evolution in favor of creation. The author goes on to show that those who are most strongly in favor of evolution are those who are the least education regarding it - people who are relying on theories abandoned a long time ago, yet still claim them as &quot;fact&quot; (i.e., those who still demand a man-from-ape evolution).This book gives much needed strength to those wishing to combat evolutionism, for the truth of creation.There are several major sub-headings in the book: the author first runs thru several of the days of creation; he then continues on with the well-known hoaxes of &quot;the missing links&quot;. For me, the most interesting subject was the Flood of Noah, and how geological evidence quite squarely denies evolution.The author is Catholic. That may not make a lot of difference to people, but being ex-Catholic turned Protestant, I admit I have my bias. However the author usually writes in such a way that is unbiased towards Catholicism. He does use references to the Pope's Encyclical Letters, but he generally refers to the Bible as the ultimate authority."},{"Title":"Science of Today & The Problems of Genesis","review":"Fr. O'Connell was a missionary in China for 50 years. He wrote in the Preface to this 1968 book, \\"The object of this book is to give the scientific conclusions about the Six Days of Creation and the origin of man arrived at during the past few years, but not generally known, and to show that these conclusions are in agreement with the Mosaic account of Creation, and are a vindication of the Papal Encyclicals issued for its interpretation.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"To explain how Moses could have written an account of Creation so vastly superior (to Laplace's), not only from a religious, but from a scientific point of view ... we must return to the view that Moses was not only inspired by the Holy Ghost so that his account would contain no error against faith and morals, but that in addition he had received sufficient information by revelation about the facts of Creation...\\" (Pg. xxviii)\\"...every case of 'missing link' put forward by evolutionists since the time of Darwin was a case of either fraud or error.\\" (Pg. xxxii)\\"(George Gaylord) Simpson's verdict on Fr.

The author, like so many other Catholic authors addressing the interpretation of Genesis, makes the fundamental exegetical error of accepting uncritically the Darwinian hypothesis of an old earth. While Father's arguments in favor of a literal interpretation of many of the histiorical events chronicled in Genesis, including the historical reality and necessity of Adam and Eve as our first parents, the Flood etc, are laudable and much needed in light of today's hyper-Darwinian dogmatism, it would have been a pleasant surprise to read Father's analysis of the age of the earth in light of hsitorical teaching of the Church and the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, who almost universally held to a very young age of the earth prior to the advent of the false theory of evolution."},{"Title":"Science of Today & The Problems of Genesis","review":"I came across this book recently in a catholic bookstore and I was very impressed with it. The author does an outstanding job of refuting the claim that evolution is true. He shows how the account given in genesis is actually being proven by scientists today. He goes on to write that not only is evolution false, but that the universe is not billions of years old as some scientists continue to claim. He believes that society began somewhere in the middle east and that humans continued to populate the earth until we have present day culture as we know it. The author writes that he read many books on evolution to see the other point of view but he disagrees with evolution as being inconsistent with logic and know facts. There is no doubt about it. This book makes sense out of history. This is a badly needed book that should be read by those who are religious or non religious to clear the air about evolution. A definite must read."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"This is a historico-legal research and summary of the applicable treason law--as actually applied to convict and sentence other American citizens who gave aid and comfort to our enemies during armed conflict.The author clearly shows that Jane Fonda's actions in 1972 would have brought her case to a grand jury. Based on comparison to the actions of convicted American citizens during WWII, Jane Fonda would likely have been convicted as well.The eight-minute O'Reilly Factor in which author Professor Henry Mark Holzer confronted Fonda's former husband and comrade Tom Hayden is devastating to observe. Hayden falls back on a lame First Amendment defense, and cannot even grasp that North Vietnamese leaders themselves said Fonda had given them the strength to continue.The American citizens who broadcast for the Nazis and Japanese propaganda radio in WWII were convicted on less evidence than is displayed concerning Fonda's July, 1972 work for the North Vietnamese.That the U.S. Department of Justice failed to prosecute for fear of a public relations backlash seems in retrospect cowardly and badly reasoned.The service of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines was valiant, and their betrayal by Fonda is a vile thing to behold. Her betrayal of the duties of a citizen is clear, and resonates in the cases of John Walker Lindh and Jose Padilla.Aid and Comfort is relevant for then and now."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"It is now more than 30 years since the last Americans left Saigon, and while most of the embers stoked in the 1960s have cooled, the visit by anti-war activist Jane Fonda to North Vietnam still inflames many. Given the temperature of the topic, any indictment of Fonda should be documented thoroughly and analyzed rigorously. The review of Fonda's activities should be divorced from any discussion of the merit of the war itself (or whether the United States was right to have been involved.) This book fits the bill on all counts.Unsurprisingly, since one of the authors is a law professor emeritus, this book is written as a legal brief would be: the Holzers discuss the facts in detail; then explain the law; and finally apply the law to the facts. \\"Aid and Comfort\\" starts with a discussion of Fonda's early life and her involvement as a young adult with left-leaning French friends of her then-husband Roger Vadim. None of this background is necessary for the indictment, as Fonda's motive in going to Vietnam is irrelevant -- what counts are her acts. Nonetheless, it is interesting, and provides a picture of a very insecure woman whose political opinions were formed and shaped by the men with whom she was involved.The next chapter is a harrowing discussion of the treatment of American POWs by the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong. It is hard to read, but is necessary to demonstrate the effects that Fonda's words would have on these servicemen. After all, broadcasting propoganda aimed at destroying the spirit of those who were barely clinging to life is more serious than disseminating it to a well-fed population with other sources of news. (In either case, as the Holzers demonstrate, a charge of treason could be levied.) The authors then discuss Fonda's actual speeches (reproduced in full at the end of the book.) They make an eye-popping read. I was unaware, for example, that Fonda had falsely accused the POWs themselves of taking anti-war positions -- a charge which could only sap the strength and morale of these men when the broadcasts were later played to them.The Holzers then devote two chapters to a detailed discussion of the law of treason. Although legal discussions sometimes can be dry for non-lawyers, the facts of the cases (including the prosecutions of \\"Axis Sally\\" and \\"Tokyo Rose\\") are interesting and the authors clearly explain the standards for treason. The book then demonstrates why there is enough evidence against Fonda to at least bring a case to a jury. That the government did not do so was due more to the politics of the time than any lack of proof.Many believe that we should put the Vietnam War behind us and stop ripping scabs off festering wounds. This, in my opinion, is the wrong way to view it. As with Holocaust survivors, the POWs of Vietnam need some measure of justice, no matter how late it comes. While the US government will never actually prosecute Fonda, this book provides necessary healing by trying -- and convicting -- Fonda in the \\"moral\\" court."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"This text is a superbly written and seriously scholarly product that provides the fundamental basis, based on a foundation of thorough legal analysis of documented events, for formulating what amounts to an indictment of the behaviors of a traitor. The text is fascinating but nevertheless maintains a rigorous adherence to analyses of various data bases, and provides the reader with a fine example of integrated logic and reasoning in what could easily have been be a purely emotional treatise which typically characterizes much of the published articles concerning Ms. Fonda's behaviors in time of war."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"This book should be read by everyone like myself who, at one time, felt that Jane Fonda was an American idol. The revelations described here, with the irrefutable primary source evidence, will convince even the most diehard supporters that Jane Fonda committed treason as defined by the U.S. Constitution. Instead of being deified by women's groups and opponents of the Vietnam War ( of which I number myself) she should be indicted for treason. The treachery and malevolence of this woman is a revelation."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"It was stupid of Jane Fonda to make a statement against the war from the seat of an anti-aircraft gun. The authors make a good case for treason, but the United States was not officially at war, which questions the validity of the charges.I served in Vietnam from 1970-71 and can tell you that the troops would have welcomed Jane Fonda as a performer in a USO show much more than her eventual 1972 performance.For all who now say that the events of 1972 are immaterial, what would be the consequence today of a Hollywood personality appearing in Bhagdad in support of the Baathist Party?Never forget that after the fall of South Vietnam, over 80,000 of their people were systematically murdered by the communists that Jane Fonda supported.For those who really care, we would love to hear Jane Fonda say that she made a mistake.

Many of her ilk (for example Bill Clinton)protested our involvement in Vietnam because it was fashionable.

Some even went to prison as a \\"fruit\\" of their protest. Some went to Canada to avoid the draft. Many took part in various public events and protests. Whether you choose to indict that large group or not, it is true that (almost) none of them went to give \\"aid and comfort\\" to the enemy. With one major exception:Except for Jane Fonda, by actually contacting the North Vietnamese, and using her public persona and fame to visit the POWs, make defamatory statements about them and posing in front of weaponry used to fight against the US. This was an entirely new and unprecedented type of \\"protest.\\"Now that I write this, there are still South Vietnamese ex-residents who were severely damaged by the loss of the War. By this I mean they were forced to leave in tiny boats, many drowning in the process, spend years in \\"re-education\\" camps in starvation, lost all of their property, and in some cases were actively tortured by the \\"winners.\\"Pacifism always has a cost. True, it was a civil war. But when we left (after doing everything we could to try to prevent loss of the war), there were consequences.Pacifism (or if you prefer, non-intervention) is still a very active topic of discussion and has great relevance today, as much as it did during the Vietnam War.Fonda seemed to support the doctrine of pacifism, at least in this war. I am not familiar with any comments she has made about subsequent US conflicts. For example, as an erstwhile supporter of woman's rights, what has she done to further the rights of the women of Islam? Nothing...to my knowledge. If she would wish to be consistent, she has an obligation to defend the rights of Islamic females who remain enslaved by that religion and culture. This is not an unrelated issue. Either she stands up for the \\"downtrodden,\\" or she does not.Instead, she continues to promote herself. That is her right in the US. But according to the authors of this book, she deserved to face a jury for treason. As an over-privileged, indulged, wealthy female blessed with exceedingly good looks, she has much to be thankful for. The authors present a compelling case for their indictment.Fonda never to my knowledge had a university level experience on Modern Communism. At the least, prior to accepting the \\"new left's\\" statements as facts, she was bereft of knowledge on this subject. What did she know about the Stalin purges? The take-over of Europe and the East by Communism? The genocides of Mao? The mass starvation of millions to a failed economic system. Instead, she swallowed the doctrine of Communism and dialectical materialism hook, line and sinker...without so much as a glance to its history. Nobody expected her, as basically an uneducated entertainer to read Hegel or Marx...or to understand their critics. But she openly accepted their doctrines as unquestioning as many who signed up for the draft to fight this very war.Forgive me if I continue to hold her in contempt, not just for her \\"Vietnam\\" years, but all of the years subsequent. She has openly welcomed and accepted REAL capitalism with a capital C for herself. Yet, she denied that to the very people in South Vietnam who wished for the same privileges.It's possible to write inflamed and angry posts about Jane Fonda. But none is more egregious than Fonda's personal embrace of capitalism...and her utter refusal to allow others in the Third World to share it by her open acceptance of North Vietnam's Communism. That act alone re-defines selfishness and greed."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"For some time, I have owned this book and would often think about reading it, even picking it up and toying with the idea of glancing through it before placing it back on the shelf opting for another book instead. I guess I was afraid that Erika and Henry Holzer might somehow tarnish my view of Jane Fonda- my pristine unveiled despising of Jane. I always liked my attitude in such matters. What if they told me things about her that I hadn't known were true or worse that I had thought I had known? Though it would be another testimonial to the mystique and unrest of the Vietnam War, I really did not want anymore knowledge of Jane in my head.I broke down and read it recently and in fact my worst fears were true, but not in the way I expected. I did feel pangs of guilt as I read page after page. They did tell me things about Jane Fonda I had not known, though none improved my image of her. What the authors did do however, was give a very detailed accounting of the cloud surrounding Jane Fonda and her activities in the early 1970's, including trips to Vietnam and other foreign lands. I felt guilt because I had wasted so much time avoiding this book. It is a fine book. It is an incredible book actually. I found it to impressively detailed and well documented. As the scholars that they surely must be, they presented the information based on many sources that are easily verified. I cannot imagine the level of dedication and tenacity required of the authors in order for them to complete their work so thoroughly. I have read many books related to Jane Fonda and her exploits of the early 1970's and none are better. None are even close.They presented information that was damning to say the least but were just as quick to give research that exonerated Ms. Fonda of acts that she has been accused of for years. Usually books that would seem more of a reference book than a memoir or fiction would bore me, even if they had useful information. To the contrary I was able to start from one cover and work to the other with little interruption. At the end, I was struck by the fact that this book was so well researched and written that it could also easily be used as a reference book.Knowing what I know about the activities of some American citizens during the Vietnam War, I am quite grateful to authors/researchers such as Erika and Henry Holzer, for I credit them with great wisdom and fortitude themselves for being more objective than the person they chose to write about. I would think the authors would agree with my response to a friend not long ago who told me that Jane Fonda was vilified. \\"If Jane has been vilified, it has been by her own actions\\". The authors make clear at the conclusion of their book what they think of Jane Fonda and her actions during the Vietnam War and I completely and wholeheartedly agree and am not afraid to say so. I do not know what the authors think now with so much time that has passed both since the war and since the writing of their book. Perhaps they feel a slight pang now and then that there is a time to let things go, to forget or pretend at least that past wrongs, however vile never happened. I feel a slight pang now and then like that, but it is so small it is a little like gas, maybe it is gas. Because I know that the proof is in the pudding or the book as it were and the things Jane Fonda and her associates did were in fact treacherous and immoral and yes villainous. I recommend this book more highly than I ever recommended any book as a work for history to be truly known."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"This book deals with Jane Fonda and her actions when she visited North Vietnam during the Vietnam War and in authors' sense of belief, gave aid and comfort to the enemy during the time of war. On this, I have utterly no doubt that Jane Fonda, one of our most infamous liberal nazis of Hollywoodland, is guility as she stand.However, the presentation of the book is bit questionable because the authors appears to be too overzealous in their approach. Research although pretty good, appears to be bit one sided. Not to say that on certain things, they almost sounds outright racists. A good example would be on page 33 when they referred to the term \\"subhuman Asian communists\\". Indeed, if the Asian communists were \\"subhuman\\", then their behavior would be acceptable since they are not human anyway, right?? Second example, the authors' zealous to paint traitors got them looking in the case of Iva Toguri, and they got her on the crosshair right with Jane Fonda. Unfortuately for the authors, Toguri was actually pardoned by President Ford (first time ever for a case like this). Her trial was misfire of justice as perjury tainted her actions and supporting statements by American and Australian POWs who were aided by her went unnoticed by the court of that period as well as by the authors today. (It was also left out that most of broadcasts made by Toguri were written by American and Australian POWs). It doesn't helped the authors that most American high commands regards Toguri's broadcasts as more of a morale booster for American troops who enjoyed her music and meaningless bombastic statements. Putting Toguri case in this book reflects on one sided research and utter lack of understanding on the part of the authors.So what is the point of all this? The authors put together a nice case against Jane Fonda but the text of this book is filled with overzealous errors. Most people who read this book like me, needs no convincing that Jane Fonda should be hung, drawn and quartered for she is an out right traitor to our nation. The authors I believed, should stick to that element since every traitor got a their own different story and Jane Fonda's story is unique by itself. There isn't enough impact story on her personally and why even today, Jane Fonda should not be let off the hook. I am not aware of any statue of limitation on treason!"},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"There is so much stuff on the internet on Fonda that is just incorrect. The Holzers, Mark and Erica, have done the research and have written the facts on Fonda's traitorous acts along with other individuals who were harmful to America.While some folks have decided to forgive and forget many more will never forget nor forgive. For those, this book will bring clarity to the many statements that are either false or misleading. I believe it is important to remind America and, especially, America's youth who should be learning history as it was.

Contrary to what other reviewers have opined, this is NOT \\"ancient history.\\" With our troops once again in harm's way in a shooting war, Ms. Fonda's despicable activities need to be kept clearly in mind by those who would cross the line separating robust discourse from the giving of aid and comfort to the enemy. Disagreeing with our nation's foreign policy does not give one license to commit treason. Ms. Fonda's treasonous actions, and our government's weak-kneed failure to prosecute her for her crime, also need to be kept in mind by our current leaders. When the government makes the decision to commit our armed forces to war and (for some) death, it has an obligation to prosecute those who cast in their lot with the enemy our troops have been ordered to defeat. Like it or not, time during war is different; not everything goes. And any government who, in the name of \\"freedom,\\" fails or is afraid to prosecute the treasonous, itself betrays our nation and its armed forces. The tale of Jane Fonda -- and what she did, and what the government didn't do -- is indeed a timely one, and this book is important right now."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"I was in Vietnam from March 1968 to March 1969, served my tour of duty and then moved on to a successful career, like most veterans. Of course I later heard about Jane Fonda's despicable words and actions but was busy and did not look into the details.This book does a thorough job of informing you about how her pro-communist,anti-American propaganda directly hurt the American POW's from both a physical torture point of view when they would not validate her traitorous words, and also from a moral point of view, hearing a well known American condemn their service and sacrifices.Her radical anti-war, anti-U.S servicmen, anti-American rants had a strong negative impact on the POW's already miserable existance when struggling to stay alive. And then when those who had survived came home, she actually called their recounts of torture lies!A powerful highly informative book that highlights her disgraceful actions and many of her speeches and comments, in proving conclusively that she clearly should have been tried and convicted of treason-and sadly why the U.S. government pathetically capitulated.

Meticulously documented, logically argued indictment of Jane Fonda--with \\"character\\" development that no Hollywood biographer, let alone autobiographer, would dare pursue. We learn far more about the actress-agitator in Aid and Comfort than in her own fact- and reality-deprived My Life So Far which, I'm not the first to suggest, appears to have been written for no more compelling reason than mitigating the Holzers' claims. The claims, unfortunately for Ms. Fonda, however, leave little or no spin-room. Ms. Fonda wasn't tried for treason for lack of evidence or lack of intent but for lack of prosecutorial will. As a result, the very concept of treason--the only crime defined in our Constitution--has become so gravely defined-down as to render the crime meaningless and prosecution impossible.A great read for all who see the spectre of the Vietnam antiwar, antimilitary, antiAmerica movement looming over our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and a must-read for those who don't."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"or are also willing to forgive John Wilkes Booth for murdering Abraham Lincoln, or wish to bestow honors on Benedict Arnold.This review is being written on the 160th anniversary of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but some of the other reviewers who are willing to forgive Janey Fonda for sitting and grinning in a North Vietnamese Anti-Aircraft pit, or making her \\"Axis Sally\\" style broadcasts on Radio Hanoi would probably give ol' John Wilkes a pass too.Oh yeah, we committed atrocities in 'Nam.

She was used to not being heard by her father, whose approval she wanted so much, and did not think she would be heard or paid so much attention to. She was wrong, and she has apologized. She realized later she had done something stupid, she apologized. I think she would have risked her life for one of our boys then, and I think she would now. I think she is a good person.

Instead of definitive answers we were continually spoon-fed reports guaranteed to magnify our spiraling fears of Communism and threats to the Free World.In the years since the cessation of hostilities it has come to light that our involvement in Vietnam was the result of political blundering on the part of President John Kennedyand by extension, his successors Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. With Vietnam Kennedy illustrated once again his inexperience in handling world affairs (U-2 Spy Plane Incident, Bay of Pigs Invasion, etc.)and after our committment, he proved reluctant to withdraw American forces for fear of political disaster. Johnson and Nixon, both inheriting this political quagmire, continued to send us deeper into the conflict for similar reasons.What the author's fail to take into account is that most everything Jane Fonda told us in her shrill crusade has proven to be true. For example, Richard Nixon DID secretly escalate the bombing of Cambodia, then lied to the U.S. people about it; U.S. troops continued to be sent to Vietnam in growing numbers while we were officially told withdrawals were occurring; and Jane Fonda's claims of political harassment were also proven to be true-she was placed on secret FBI and Justice Department harassment lists and targeted by authorities for her activities, at Nixon's request.As the war dragged on other high profile celebrities began to openly and vocally oppose the war-among them Candice Bergen, Judy Collins, Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, Donald Sutherland, even America's TV homemaker, Donna Reed-yet Jane was the first to place her career and her life in possible jeopardy for her beliefs. Cassius Clay made a public refusal to serve in Vietnam when called to duty, yet he is still revered by many of the same Americans quick to condemn Jane Fonda.The fact that our government repeatedly refused to classify the Vietnam conflict as a war-though we were involved over a 10 year period-reduces the author's charges of treason to dust and clearly illustrates what a bungled attempt this government made to win a conflict that from the outset was impossible.Jane Fonda in many ways used the wrong approach to educate us on the truths about Vietnam-her methods were extreme and often objectionable, yet it was ultimately shown that her instincts and quest for the truth were well-founded and accurate."},{"Title":"Aid and Comfort: Jane Fonda in North Vietnam","review":"As a young and idealistic man in the mid sixties I had strongly opposed the Vietnam War particularly after reports of attrocities committed by US troops started to trickle in. As the war dragged on I felt that there was no act of civil disobedience or non-violent public protest strong enough to convey the anti-war message to the Government. In that respect I felt an admiration and a form of kinship for Jane Fonda. Her broadcast highlighted the contrast of the realities of Vietnam, the determination of the 'enemy' and the ongoing assertions by the Government that victory was just around the corner. The claim that her actions lengthened the war and, thus, amounted to a betrayal of the US soldiers is aburd because it totally ignores the timeline. Her visit took place in August 1972, while US troop withdrawals demanded by Congress started in January of 1973. If her visit to Vietnam represented in some way a final nail in the coffin of the pro-war sentiment than I say: More power to her.In view of the attrocities committed in Vietnam, the massive bombing campaigns against rural civilians, the use of noxcious chemicals that have created over one million birth defects it would seem that there is ample room for bringing legal actions against those who have perpetrated these acts and have brought shame on this country. But Mr. Holzer's picking on Jane Fonda typically represents the corporate mentality of punishing whistle blowers rather than wrong doers.

Contrary to another reviewer of this book, evangelicals are not inconsistent when they maintain that we are saved through faith alone and at the same time maintain that there are moral absolutes that we ought to uphold. The evangelical view is not that works are unimportant, but that none of us can attain a right standing before God on the basis of our works. In other words, being good is definitely important, but none of us is good enough. That's why Christ died on the cross! The whole point is that we have all violated God's moral absolute standards, and therefore we all deserve his punishment. Yet, by his mercy, we may be forgiven and reconciled to God, and spared that punishment, because Christ died in our place. This basic Christian belief cannot be maintained without also maintaining that such moral absolutes exist.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"An Unchanging Faith in a Changing World: Understanding and Responding to Critical Issues That Christians Face Today","review":"This book is indeed interesting, some of the time. There are long stretches of paragraphs that are a bit of a struggle to read through, particularly the sections on psychology and postmodernism.The most interesting passages are about the other major religions,how they came to be, and the influence they have on Christianity.Now back to the reason I claim this book to be inconsistent. There are sections that expound on a &quot;faith only&quot; salvation, and how fundamentalist &quot;cults&quot; believe too much in a literal translation of the bible and salvation through &quot;works.&quot; While these authors go to great lengths to show that faith is the only need for salvation, the second half of the book discusses declining morality in the world. If works are not necessary to Christianity, then why should morality be promoted? Wouldn't living a moral life be a &quot;work?&quot; I find it foolish to say that all you must do to be saved is believe and have faith.

His first story, somewhat prescient, was about a nuclear submarine being used for warfare under the Arctic, a story he wrote in the 1950's.Dune was not Herbert's first novel, but is his most famous. It is basically an epic in the same sense War and Peace or Lord of the Rings are epics, though this epic is set to a science fiction theme, rather than history or fantasy.The novel is set in the distant future when humanity has mastered interstellar space flight and has colonised many planets throughout the galaxy. Humanity has not achieved this easily though; first there was the Butlerian Jihad, a war against a hostile A.I. civilisation which had enslaved humanity (which is told in the novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson based on Frank Herbert's unpublished notes on the series) and then a massive series of religious wars, caused in part by the advent of FTL spaceflight and partly by the stresses of the anti-machine jihad.Human spaceflight however has come at a cost; FTL travel throughout the universe can only be achieved by 'folding space', a process which requires vastly enhanced states of human conciousness that are capable of performing the incredibly complex mathematical calculations necessary for FTL spaceflight and navigation. These enhanced states can only be accomplished by consuming a substance known as 'The Spice', a hyper-psychotropic substance that completely alters human conciousness and physiology.The only known supply of Spice in the universe is the planet Dune, also known as Arrakis. Since Spice is such a valuable, rare and essential commodity, without which the human interstellar empire would collapse, human politics in the period of time in which the novel is set revolves around the control of its production, extraction, harvesting and trade. Many wars have been fought over control of Arrakeen spice, however by the time the novel begins, a sort of uneasy stability reigns.The political control of human civilisation rests with a complex arrangement between the Spacing Guild (a Guild of humans who navigate foldspace using spice), The Houses of the Laandsrad (the most powerful stellar empires in the galaxy), dominated by Houses Atreides and Harkonen and by the Emperor Shaddam the IVth, and by the religious order known as the Bene Gesserit, whose aim is to create a superhuman being with super-cognitive powers, including the ability to accurately forsee the future.The focal character is Paul Atreides, son of Leto Atreides, the King of House Atreides. House Atreides control the harvesting of Spice on Arrakis and the lucrative power and wealth that flows from it. But Baron Harkonen is determined to unseat this dominance and destroy the Atreides, who are mortal enemies of the Harkonens.The story unfolds with an almost Byzantine complexity in terms of politics and power relationships, intruige, war, and betrayal. Towards the end however, both the Harkonens and the Emperor himself are undone by the hidden power and strength of the native people of Arrakis, Sufi-Buddhist warriors called the Fremen, under Paul's leadership and military skills. However, this is not the end but only the beginning of the story, one which will unfold over thousands of years and across entire planets.The book is a staggering achievement of vision, scope and complexity. Herbert manages to create a convincing set of worlds with their unique politics, religions, civilisations and history told in a way that is plausible and fascinating. While hard SF fans may be dissapointed at the lack of details over things such as space folding, soft SF fans will no doubt be fascinated with topics such as interplanetary politics and economics, interstellar diffusion of religions, the effect of drugs on human conciousness and its possibilities, and extra-ordinary forms of human cognition such as prescience. In terms of world builders Herbert is one of the most imaginative and inventive, and make the Dune series one of the boldest and most successful attempts ever made in science fiction to create a convincing universe where humans have made it to the stars and carried the human condition with them.This book is a must read for any serious fan of SF, hard or soft, and will be enjoyed by anyone at multiple levels."},{"Title":"Dune (Spanish Edition)","review":"Author Frank Herbert's masterpiece of science fiction, \\"Dune,\\" has earned the bragging rights to be known as one of the premier sci-fi classical writings of all time.If you can get past the commercialism spanning over decades of a board game or two, a movie, a television series, comic books, etc., and read the book objectively with no biases, you most likely will find an unbelievably rich and detailed story that harkens back to the likings of a Greek tragedy.The setting in \\"Dune\\" is far into the future where mankind has warred and has spread out into the universe. Organized religion still plays a vital role (Orange Catholic Bible, etc.). The nobility of each habitable planet bicker, plot, negotiate, and war with each other like Renaissance city-states.

The main plot involves two warring Noble Houses that compete for control of \\"Dune\\" for various reasons involving much deceit and treachery. The protagonist of the story, Paul Atreides, finds himself a sort of \\"Hamlet\\" type of figure who grows physically, mentally, and spiritually to become a Messianic type of figure who controls the desert planet and terraforms it to become habitable (like Earth). The story is so much more involved than this though! I believe, however, that the sci-fi reader will not be disappointed.I read this book in 1987 after having seen the Dino DeLaurentis movie of the same name a few years before.

Lamour's stories are realistic, as he has a thorough knowledge of the terrain and the history of the old west."},{"Title":"Kilrone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Bantam Book)","review":"This was the first western that I've read. I liked this book. However it does have its faults.1.) The book stereotypes Indians as \\"savages.\\" They are \\"uncivilized,\\"\\"noble warriors,\\" who are evil yet \\"brave.\\" They are the bad guys who are easily influenced by a White merchant into doing malicious deeds. The one positive image is a \\"civilized\\" Indian woman who has learned the White man's ways. Early in the book, this woman speaks perfect English. However, as the book goes on her English become more and more stilted.2.) The book is full of cliches. A drifter, who was once an army officer, tells a fort's commanding officer about a troop of soldiers masacred by the Indians. The drifter and the commanding officer know each other previosly.The drifter had dated the officer's wife prior to him marrying her. The officer is jealous of the drifter, so he ignores the drifter's warnings not to leave the fort unprotected by going off to fight the Indians. The drifter, who is wiser than the officer, stays at the fort to help a few soldiers, women and children protect the fort from an Indian attack. Does this story sound familiar? Even if you haven't read this same story, it has elements that can be found in about a half a dozen different Westerns.So with these faults, why do I still recommend this book? Well, because it is well written. L'Amour is a good storyteller. It's a good adventure. Think about it: do you like action adventure movies even though most of them follow the same formula? If you do, you'll like this story.Another reason why I was interested in this book was that it demonstrates archaic attitudes towards Native Americans. We should not ignore the fact that these stereotypes existed - in fact they are still around. Our culture is just not as blatent as before. While we are shaking our heads in disgust over these blatent stereotypes, maybe we can also analyize our own prejudices towards others."},{"Title":"Kilrone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Bantam Book)","review":"Kilrone is an ex-army man comes across a massacre of I-company and realises that the nearby fort is in danger. His trip there literally takes him back to the past. Denise the woman he used to love is there, as is her husband, and on a more sinister note, Iron John has set up business there. Last time Kilrone dealt with Iron John he might have won but he had been forced to retire.Iron John, it seems, is dealing with the Indians, more particularly Medicine Dog an upstart fighter who wants more weapons. Now the fort is in danger and there is only Kilrone who can hold it until the troops come back.I think Iron John last turned up in Fallon and this book is like a poor reflection of that - at least to me. Fallon was funny and wry. This one seems to take itself really seriously. I loved the easy Western humour of Fallon, but this one was more of a pedestrian read. Readable but wouldn't try again in a hurry."},{"Title":"Kilrone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Bantam Book)","review":"I'm sorry for anyone who would judge Louis L'Amour entirely after reading this book. It was one of his poorer works. L'Amour writes about a man named Barney Kilrone. He was an ex-soldier who had been given a raw deal and blamed for something he had never done. He finds himself in the middle of a bad situation that entangles him in a mess of renegade indians, massacres, and jealousy, and a drunken commander who seeks notoriety. In the end he saves the day and gets the girl, but not the girl some might have expected. Although the ending was rushed as others have stated, I did like the fact that the main villian was finished off by someone other than the main character. Take a look at this one despite it's low rating."},{"Title":"Kilrone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Bantam Book)","review":"I love Louis L'Amour. I have read every one of his books.

Or it would be were it not for the terribly rushed ending. L'amour does a wonderful job of pacing the story and building suspense up until the very end of the book at which point several major plot points occur suddenly with no explanation. For example, the cavalry commander who has been so set on tracking the renegade Indians down has a sudden, unexplained change of heart and returns to the beleaguered outpost just in time to save the day. One minute he's discussing with his scouts the best route to take to rendezvous with another cavalry troop. The next time we see him, he's returned to the outpost and there's no explanation for why he turned his troop around. Another example, there is foreshadowing throughout the book that a certain minor character is going to play a very pivotal role in things before the story is over. They do, in fact, play a pivotal role in events but we don't get to see it. We only learn about it after the fact from another character and even then we don't really learn any details. It's almost as if L'amour suddenly found himself up against a deadline and didn't have enough time to finish the story properly so he just tacked on a quick ending. It's very unsatisfying to have a great story, which is a very gripping read, build up to an ending that basically amounts to, &quot;...and then the cavalry came back and saved the day, the renegade Indians disbanded and went their seperate ways, the villain got his just desserts, and the hero got the girl.&quot; Kilrone is an okay book but L'amour has written much better. If you want to read something in this vein I would suggest the classic &quot;Hondo&quot;, also by L'amour, which is a far superior book."},{"Title":"Kilrone (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Bantam Book)","review":"Kilrone was my first L'Amour book to ever read, and needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I was expecting L'Amour novel events to be more plausible. At times, a better description of some of Kilrone's feats would probably be defined as ludicrous. Kilrone during the fort siege jumped astride a gray horse bareback. I found it odd that Kilrone later during that same day on the ride away from the fort, he reaches for the pommel, without mention of ever finding a saddle along the way. The ending to the novel was very rushed -- absolutely nothing flowed well. If anyone is considering a L'Amour book to read, maybe it is best he/she chooses another."},{"Title":"Children and Teens Afraid to Eat: Helping Youth in Today's Weight-Obsessed World","review":"To be overweight is to fail&quot; . It sums up our society's attitude towards eating and body size today. This is a quote from 'AFRAID TO EAT: Children and Teens in Weight Crisis' by Frances M. Berg. While the book is a cultural commentary, it is also filled with practical advice on ways to prevent eating disorders, obesity, and dysfunctional eating.The first step to help, is to help understand the roots of the problem. This book does that. It points out the many ways in which we are not nurturing our children, particularly our girls. We are a society that has become fatter and fatter, yet simultaneously bombards our kids with the message that they need to achieve a body size and shape that is biologically unsustainable for the majority of them. This may be the seed for eating disorders. How high levels of obesity and disordered eating and starving teens can coexist is explained. AFRAID TO EAT explores the many forces at play....cultural expectations, media, the role of family and athletics, peer pressure, and more. It explores the issue of size rejudice and lifestyle choices, both of which lead to eating disorders and obesity.The second half of the book focuses on how to prevent eating disorders, how to make changes to promote normal eating where it doesn't exist, and how to intervene with childhood obesity. There are guidelines for healthy food choices, designs for new health approaches for families, how to include schools in prevention programs, and finally a call to action that challenges us to make changes in attitude (e.g. a greater appreciation for healthy lifestyles versus being thin), lifestyle (e.g. active living, improving phys ed programs in school), prevention (e.g. by promoting healthy attitudes and lifestyles and developing special prevention programs for schools and communities), health care (e.g. reduce size prejudice in health care, focus on improving health, not on ineffective weight loss) and knowledge ( e.g. improved communication to consumers, better education in medical school).There is useful information in this book not only for a parent, but also for teachers and health care workers. Perhaps after reading it you can share it with your school nurse or phys ed teacher. I am sure you will find its approach not only informative but practical and useful. The word 'vitality' is used a lot in this book as it helps us focus eating away from dieting and size/shape obsession towards eating that promotes a healthy and 'vital' lifestyle.I work as a professional nutritionist and see firsthand the consequences of the fear of eating. This book takes a big stab at addressing the revolutionary changes that need to be made in our personal and societal approaches towards eating. I recommend it to any who want to join in that revolution, or simply wish to help their own kids enjoy nutritious, guilt free eating for life."},{"Title":"Children and Teens Afraid to Eat: Helping Youth in Today's Weight-Obsessed World","review":"Without a doubt, this book should be reading material for all parents before their first child is born.We want to think our youth are active and healthy. During my years of teaching, I have been more and more disturbed at inactivity of our children, disruption of normal eating, and the amount of fat and sugar calories served in school lunch rooms.The food the children who carry their lunch bring from home can be nourishing, but parents might be surprised if they watch their children eat. A child's lunch sack might have a good turkey sandwich with greens, two large cookies, a bar of candy, and a soft drink. The child almost always has the candy ond/or cookies at recess. When lunchtime comes, he often throws that good sandwich in the trash with the apple. The food he brought from home has now become two cookies, candy, and a soft drink.During recess too many children are inactive. Day after day, we watched the same ones stand around talking all recess while they eat their candy or cookies. After observing this for a few years, we scheduled a quarter-mile run twice a week and a full mile on Friday for P. E. Also, three times a week we have exercises appropriate to the age groups. You'd be surprised how many look forward to all the activity once they get used to it. We think it also stimulates brain activity in the classroom.On the other hand, there are the healthy, active children who might have a cookie at recess, then play hard. They eat their sandwich and apple at lunch and the cookies and are eaten or saved for after school. In these children's lunch boxes there is porbably no candy. What's happening here? Berg says studies show that parents that don't \\"bug\\" their children about eating, produce children who don't have hang-ups about eating.Berg writes that research shows that family attitudes can play a big part in the future eating patterns of their children. When a healthy baby's hunger is satisfied, it will then stop drinking. Parents who \\"urge him to finish the bottle, disguise cereal with applesauce to get it down\\" and thus feel frustrated for fear the baby isn't eating enough, is teaching the infant that it's important to eat more than his body needs. All parents should read carefully and think about what Berg has to say.A parent who \\"hesitates to let a chubby toddler have seconds, makes a preschooler stay at the table until she finishes her peas, insists that the child eat \`two bites of each food,' or lectures a school-age child to get him to drink his milk...is overmanaging, and it teaches children to ignore their natural signals of hunger and satiety.\\"By allowing a child to listen and heed these natural signals, Berg tells us that this is an important way to begin the youngster on a lifetime of healthy eating patterns.Americans serve too large portions. A friend of mine returned from a long vacation in England and remarked that she didn't see an overweight English person all the time she was there. I said I was surprised, I always thought Britons were gluttons. She said she did, too, but she didn't see any.Berg tells why. \\"A Healthy Weight Journal subscriber in London sent me an article titled: \`Portions all out of Proportion' that decried \`America's elephantine cuisine.' The writer compares national foods: hot dogs (350 calories in the U.S. versus 150 calories in Britain), cookies (493 vs. 65), ice cream cone (625 vs.160), muffin (705 vs. 158), and a meal of steak and fries (2,060 vs. 730). Until recently, our very large muffins were called \\"jumbo muffins,\\" the article notes, now they are simply \`muffins.' \\" Apparently, we are the ones who have become the nation of gluttons.Berg says that even some our food that is considered healthy, non-junk food is astoundingly high in calories. And the more a child above the age of 3 is served, the more he eats. Big portions promote over-eating. Berg says studies show that our school-age children are getting heavier every year. Younger and younger children are becoming anorexic to stay slim, an astounding number alternately diet and binge. These patterns used to be found among those high school age and older, now they appear among elementary children.Berg says problems such as eating disorders, dysfunctional eating, undernutrition of teenage girls trying to be thin, hazardous weight loss, and size prejudice all are increasing. Surprisingly, all that can be prevented. The author, Francie Berg, when asked why she wrote this book, says she grows more and more concerned about the appalling research on children and youth eating problems. The true facts were there, but no one was telling those who need to know: our parents and teachers.Now that she's telling us-we need to listen.Berg's research is well done. Anyone who doubts what she writes, can read the studies for themselves as her sources are well documented.Jeanie T."},{"Title":"Children and Teens Afraid to Eat: Helping Youth in Today's Weight-Obsessed World","review":"Two important guides to weight and eating are presented in these excellent surveys by Frances Berg.

Both are excellent resources, but the Insight Guide has better pictures and their hotel/restaurant choices are more targeted at mid-range travellers (the Lonely Planet Guides typically address themselves to budget travellers a bit more).I really enjoyed the rich color pictures and the style of writing, but the Insight Guide definitely comes up short in some critical areas: its hotel and restaurant listings are relatively sparse, it doesn't provide any information on transportation between the various sights or on when/how to see them, and is missing suggested iteneraries, which I find really helpful.All in all, I'd rate this book as worth your money, but buy the Lonely Planet Guide, too. If you only buy one guide, get the LPG instead of this book."},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Memory, suffering and loss are the themes of this rather abstract and densely imagined book by Trezza Azzopardi. I can't say this is one of my favourite books of the year - the story takes a little too long to develop and Azzopardi's method of switching backwards and forwards in time becomes, at times, a little blurred. But the story is still a quite elegant and engaging study of one woman's anguish and torment and of the puzzle of a life at last reclaimed. Narrated in the first person by the seventy-two-year old Winifred - homeless and abused time after time by those she's trusted - she is content to sit on park benches watching the world go by, or read the \\"free sheets\\" for furniture she can't afford to buy. She would rather not recall the past, but after a young girl robs her of her suitcase and wig - her only material possessions - she is propelled out of her exile, and forced on a journey to find the thief.Remember Me is a cerebral venture, a journey of the mind and memory. Winifred must confront her stolen life and her time living as a young girl against the backdrop of the Second World War. In fragments and illusions, she is gradually forced to take stock of how abuse, long obscured have bought her to a dilapidated house on the edge of nowhere. She recalls the upheaval caused by her mentally ill Mother, and her disaffected father; and the betrayal by her strict and domineering grandfather, her embittered, sallow Aunt Ena and the kindness offered by the lodger, Mr. Stadnik. She also recalls Joseph Dodd, her lost and only love, a young man who she meets in the country. As Winifred pieces together her life, she realizes that she is not only searching for a thief, but she is searching for a life that was lived, and at once, irretrievably lost.Remember Me requires a close reading as Azzopardi peppers the narrative with many subtle and understated clues to Winifred's life. The story unfolds slowly and mellifluously as Winifred's identity and her \\"mistakes\\" are gradually revealed. Like her Mother, Winifred feels an affinity with the spirit world and is trained to see ghosts -she sees herself in reflection, \\"the girl looking back at me from underneath, like a premonition of what was to come\\" Winifred sees \\"future ghosts\\", memories stored on top of one another; she's building a \\"tower without bells\\" and later, she will bring them down in an earthquake of her own making. Full of poetic imagery, Remember Me draws a sharp contrast with the dreamlike quality of Winifred's youth and her ambling, wondering and solitary present life. Azzopardi uses short, sharp, yet incredibly descriptive sentences to create a world of reverie and emotion. This is a complex and opaque novel, full of feeling and passion.Michael"},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Trezza Azzopardi burst upon the literary scene with a hauntingly beautiful novel, &quot;The Hiding,&quot; which was a Booker finalist. Her initial work was a heads up that here was a new writer of note. She undergirds our original assumption with &quot;Remember Me,&quot; an equally compelling story related in lovely measured cadence through the voice of Winnie who narrates her life in flashback form.Corrie James presents a splendid reading, capturing perfectly the voice of an elderly homeless woman who is lost in the world. Winnie has precious few material possessions and suffers trauma when they are stolen from her. She begins a search for the thief and as she does so recounts a past of pain and disillusionment.Born to a mentally deficient mother and uncaring father the girl is left with a grandfather and later foisted off on an aunt. There comes a time when she is a teenager when all she knows of relatives in this world are gone. Thus begins a downward spiral during which she becomes a pawn, used to satisfy the greed and lust of others.The tale sounds depressing yet it is anything but as it is uplifted by Azzopardi's elegant prose and Winnie's gumption.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Welsh-born Trezza Azzopardi has followed up her remarkable debut novel (\\"Hiding Place\\") with one that shows maturity and skill in addition to a gentle empathy with her characters. The narrative is related by an old woman who is what was once called \\"simple-minded.\\" Passed around as a child amongst adults who alternately love, use, tolerate and scorn her, she struggles to make sense of events in terms she can understand. Painfully aware of her \\"differentness\\", she learns to ride the hard times patiently and fight back only when pushed beyond endurance.Azzopardi has cleverly allowed the thoughts of her protagonist, as expressed in the story, to be articulate and perceptive, although the character struggles to express herself out loud to others. The result is a sustained level of tension with poetic imagery that never becomes overwrought or maudlin.By the end of \\"Remember Me\\", Winnie has made her peace with the world, and neither wants nor needs our sympathy. Nevertheless, we should be ashamed that she was based on a real life \\"resident of the streets\\", one of those forced to squat in abandoned buildings in the middle of so much affluence."},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Of the half dozen or more books I read per month, the vast majority are forgotten before I'm through chapter 1 of the next. This is one of those rare gems that stay in your mind and heart long after the last chapter.In this emotional (surprisingly NOT depressing) book, Azzopardi weaves a story out of fragments of memory, waiting until the end to show the subtle, yet startling, tapestry. It is an artfully impressionistic image of a life--unprotected, unsheltered, unfulfilled. In the end, the picture is clear, the author provides all the information we really need to know.Other reviewers have given an idea of the story.

But once you get so far into her story, you see that the way she has organized it is a careful reconstruction of how memory chases us, how so much remains buried, and when it does surface, it comes in fits and fleets, in a dream-like dance. This is the process of becoming conscious that the great psychiatrist, Carl Jung, pioneered.Patricia/Lillian/Winnie isn't just a sad old homeless woman Azzopardi means for us to pity and think, &quot;There but for the grace of God go I.&quot; Winnie is those among us--and we are legion, as the demons said to Christ--who have let objects usurp the place in our lives that real feeling, actual people, and the truth of events should hold. Looking at Winnie this way, we see that her actual poverty is our poverty of soul, regardless of economic status, which we hide from ourselves by acquiring things as some sort of cushion against facing up to our alienation and despair. When we save &quot;artefacts&quot; from our past and the pasts of those close to us, it is to remember only what was not painful and to color falsely what was reality. But finding meaning in life involves shedding the things AND the illusions and taking on the despair. Hope is on its other side.Azzopardi is a fascinating master of character and words, and her work so far is some of the best I've read ever. She truly captures the nature of the human problem at the beginning of the 21st century and points us in the direction of its solution."},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"What a strange and beautifully written novel. It's written in reverse timeline, as the protagonist (called at different times, Lillian, Patsy, Beautiful, Princess and Winnie), a more-than-a-little loony bag lady, attempts to recreate her own life while at the same time trying to forget some of the more painful parts.The reader is left to figure out what is truth, what is a figment of Winnie's imagination, what is a result of her mental illness, and what is just pure creation on her part in order to keep herself from feeling pain too deeply.The storyline brought to mind the movie \\"Memento\\" where the main character suffered from short-term memory loss and had to tattoo reminders onto his body. Like \\"Memento,\\" \\"Remember Me\\" plays with the idea of truth and memory, and the secrets we tell to -- and keep from -- even ourselves."},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I must say, this is one of the strangest books I have ever listened to. I still am not sure what is is about, where it is set, or what the plot is. But you keep listening to it just to see what happens next, just thinking that soon you will figure it out. All I know is that it is about a crazy lady, and her upbringing. You feel sorry for her, and begin to understand how she got that way, but it jumps around so much that you never know for sure what is real and what is not. In the begining you think that it is going to change and soon it will start to make sence, but it never really does until the end."},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am thrilled that the author chose this disjointed narrative for her main character; how else would the voice of a woman living rough in the streets, her mind jumbled from years of abuse and willful neglect, sound?The back and forth movement of time as the plot moves steadily forward, is a little like what an addled brain might do to chronological time, if pressed for explanation.The dialogue is real and the characters fully realized.Strange and mesmerizing, this book is amazing."},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I'm sorry, I gave up after p. 72.

The voice -- yeah, it had emotion. But not enough to interest me past p. 72. Frankly, it was a bore.I wrote the above a few days ago. Then I read the review from someone who said she nearly gave up but kept on going and the book does get better. Something about what that reader said made me pick up the book again.

The description on the dust jacket sounded promising. In reality, neither was true. the story starts out slow and mixed with emotion, and ends up slower, confusing, and flat out boring. If ever I had to force myself to read a book, this was it.

First half of this book is dark, somewhat confusing and borderline boring. I am glad I kept reading since it did pick up in the second half, but would not read it again and will not keep this book. I felt it was a bit pretentious, and not quite finished. Too many lose ends, too many questions left unanswered. Upon completing this book I was left with \`so what' feeling.

Was it a lapse of reason related to the abortion incident or something more significant?Great read though. highly reccomended - Azzopardi's first novel even better...."},{"Title":"Remember Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"By all accounts Trezza Azzopardi's REMEMBER ME is a dark gloomy novel set in England during the 1930's and 1940's. A box of keepsakes is stolen from a woman who is swatting in an abandoned house and she is determined to recover the goods - her only worldly possessions. Switching from the past and present the reader slowly uncovers the woman's secrets. The protagonist is a young girl with &quot;tell tale&quot; hair who is continuously abandoned, forgotten, and passed among the family after the death of her mother. Throughout her young life each caretaker gives her a new name but is emotionally absent to take care of her needs. She is essentially left to herself while growing up and is often taken advantage of. To make her life more complex she has a gift of seeing ghosts that interferes with her vision of reality. During her childhood she was convinced that the ghosts were responsible for taking away her mother, and later in adulthood her gift was used to capitalize on the grief of the war widows and others who have deceased loved ones. She routinely roams the streets resembling a homeless person with no real purpose or ambitions.The first half of REMEMBER ME is slow and daunting. Azzopardi's prose is described as &quot;spellbinding&quot; on the book's cover but I found it to be lackluster and opaque. I was more confused as the story progressed, and I admit that I was tempted to give up on several occasions. About halfway through the story dramatically picked up and some of the pieces started to come together, and I started enjoying it for the first time. But despite this my overall impressions of this book are jaded. There were simply too many questions left unanswered, or answered in an effective manner. I wanted to sympathize with the main character for her neglectful childhood but the book's eccentric strange tone prohibited me. It's too bad because the plot first appeared to be interesting and I was looking forward to enjoying this book."},{"Title":"Abrahams Battle: Novel Of Gettysburg A","review":"&amp;#65279;Abraham's Battle, by Sara Harrell Banks, is about the Civil War, more specifically, The Battle of Gettysburg. But that is only skin deep, it is a novel about equality, about hate, and about love. The story centers around a white northern girl, Ladybird, and a runaway slave man, Abraham, the best of friends, despite the time in which they are living, which may frown on such friendships. They are perfectly happy together, and enjoy walking with the mule, Charity. But their simple existence is complicated when a soldier for the south arrives at the farm, asking for food. Abraham, despite himself takes a liking to this homesick young man and is almost sorry when they part at the end of the day. Later on, Abraham saves his life. Throughout the entire book, Banks is constantly reinforcing the message that all men are created equally but in such delicate and subtle methods that the flow of the story is never once interrupted. For example: Ladysmith's friendship with Abraham, Abraham saving a man fighting on the opposite side in the war, and Abrahams conversation with the president that shares his name. Abraham's Battle is a flowing and poignant tale that is subtle and yet a still powerful narrative that should be enjoyed for generations to come."},{"Title":"Abrahams Battle: Novel Of Gettysburg A","review":"I am using this in 4th grade to teach growth in perspective.

The author's choice of words gives the reader vivid descriptions of life at the time of the Civil War. We come to understand the feelings of Abraham, a former slave now living in the North, and Lamar, a young, simple-hearted Confederate soldier. This book gave my 3rd-grade daughter the \\"human\\" side of the Civil War, while reinforcing the facts she had learned from her textbook. Although it is a short book, you really gain an appreciation of the suffering endured by both sides of the war as well as for the noble heart of Robert E. Lee and Abraham Lincoln. We loved how the author moved from the perspective of one character to that of another. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. For both children and adults."},{"Title":"Abrahams Battle: Novel Of Gettysburg A","review":"Abraham's Battle: A Novel of Gettysburg by Sara Harrell Banks told the story of a former slave, Abraham Small. He had escaped the South through the Underground Railroad and was living as a freedman in Gettysburg. The story opens in late June 1863 immediately before the Battle of Gettysburg. We discover that Abraham misses the South through his encounter with Lamar, a wandering Rebel whom he reminisces with after getting to know him. Lamar, a white, mountain man, apparently has never talked to a black man before and bears no prejudice toward him. This was a bit unbelievable.Abraham has a revelation prior to the battle that he should join the Union army as an ambulance driver. He does so and once again encounters Lamar, wounded on the field. He brings Lamar to a Yankee hospital, but Lamar subsequently dies of his wounds. At the end of the book Abraham receives a packet of okra seeds from Lamar posthumously through a convoluted channel of soldiers, sister, etc.Abraham also meets President Lincoln when he is in town for the Gettysburg memorial dedication. Lincoln hitches a ride to the battlefield with Abraham and his mule Charity. Some fairly incredible events occur out there. For example, President Lincoln stretches himself out on the ground and embraces it. In a historical novel like this, I expect most episodes to be based on fact. Perhaps this happened, but in my years as a genealogy/history librarian I never heard about it.This was, however, a very good introduction to the Battle of Gettysburg. The characters were sympathetic and believable, although Lamar might have been whitewashed. I did appreciate the author's attempt to present both Union and Confederate soldiers as human and compassionate. The descriptions of landscape and Southern memories were on target and well written. If this was a movie, Morgan Freeman would be perfect as Abraham. I would recommend this book to students wanting to know basic facts about Gettysburg."},{"Title":"Abrahams Battle: Novel Of Gettysburg A","review":"Hey, my name is Jeremiah Johnson.

Their young daughter, Ladysmith, loves Abraham and wants to spend all her time with him. One day, a young Confederate soldier by the name of Lamar Cooper walks up to the fence asking for food. He and Lamar become friends, even though they are complete opposites.When the Civil War began, Ladysmith's father had to go off to war. Abraham decided that it was the manly thing to do. He is black, so no one wants him in their regiment. He becomes an ambulance driver. An ambulance driver picks up wounded souldiers from the battlefield. One day, Abraham finds Lamar on the Union side. Abraham takes him to their makeshift hospital.When the war is over, Abraham Lincoln comes to Gettysburg and makes a speech. Lincoln uses Small's mule and gives him his hat. Abraham in honored and very happy.This is a good book, but it is only 88 pages and is made for kids.

Much more useful than most quick-fix books."},{"Title":"Do Lunch or Be Lunch: The Power of Predictability in Creating Your Future","review":"Howard Stevenson has identified one of the most powerful undercurrents of human relationships; predictability. I will admit that I read this book because I already knew him, but then found that the material pulled me in. As an entrepreneur, I had to convince many people to follow my ideas and plans. Although I prided myself on my sales skills, I was still sometimes humbled that people would trust me with hundreds of thousands or millions of their dollars. Do Lunch or Be Lunch helped me to understand how predictability impacted those decisions. It takes the lid off of one of the key ingredients to how people make decisions whether they relate to work, investments, love, or anything. Humans are constantly assessing and guessing their futures. If their future depends on you, it is wise to be honest, open, and easy to predict. By increasing your own predictability, you directly influence the comfort level of those around you. People will take on great hardships and difficulties when they know the risks. As a leader, you don't want to be one of them. This book should be read by managers, entrepreneurs, and anyone who needs to lead people.-A retired CEO and current Venture Capitalist"},{"Title":"Do Lunch or Be Lunch: The Power of Predictability in Creating Your Future","review":"The basic ideas of predictability and projectability as laid out in Do Lunch or Be Lunch are powerful ones. Stevenson makes a very good (and generally overlooked) point about why communities and corporations exist and what they are expected to provide in terms of framework and structure. There are many many companies today that could do with absorbing some of these home lessons. This book is aimed straight at the companies that are so busy maximizing share price that they forget the expectations of workers and customers alike.The book works best as a kind of system analysis and is least useful when it reaches its chapter on practical tips and models. While some of the models are good, they do not seem to follow as organically as the earlier chapters and felt less relevant than the earlier high level outline of ideas.The title is unfortunately misleading, leading many to think that this is a book about networking and not predictability. I was also irritated by the footnotes. The footnotes are arranged by chapter number but the header bar in the page only lists the chapter title, so I was forced into some irritating flipping back and forth to find the correct note.The interesting ideas and high quality writing would make it a book that I would recommend. I suspect that its appeal would be largest to managers, potential entrepeneurs, or strategy consultants."},{"Title":"Do Lunch or Be Lunch: The Power of Predictability in Creating Your Future","review":"The authors have a good idea, but they really only have an essay's worth of material.

However, the book as a whole is very light."},{"Title":"Do Lunch or Be Lunch: The Power of Predictability in Creating Your Future","review":"More entertaining than informative, the content does not live up to the catchy and appealing title. Surprisingly, there is only one reference in the index to risk, a subject at the heart of predictability. References to Nikita Khrushchev, Richard Nixon, Bob Dole and the Rolling Stones add limited substantive value to the book. Chapter One did wet my appetite, but the rest was disappointing. By far the best book on the history, role and need for predictability I have read to date is Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk by Peter Bernstein."},{"Title":"Do Lunch or Be Lunch: The Power of Predictability in Creating Your Future","review":"This book is full of fluff - lots of words that sound good, but don't really say anything.

Small businesses don't have the resources to hire this work done, nor can they afford the time to do a lot of self-learning. This practical guide should be effective in helping any small business to a good payoff in publicity.The book focuses on the basics: developing a promotional plan; implementing the plan to get the publicity; and doing the interviews and other publicity activities. Topics covered include writing press releases, media advisories, press kits, cover letters to the media, fact sheets, public service announcements, getting magazine placements, follow-up calls to the media, handling TV and radio interviews, and special events.The book has several strengths that make it a good resource. First, there are self-assessment tools here to help you understand what you are capable of doing for yourself. Second, there are examples of how to do each step of the publicity process so you have something to use as a guide. Third, there is an excellent list of suggested reading to get you more detailed information to expand your thinking after you have mastered the basics. Fourth, I found resources cited here that I had never heard of before despite having done a lot of self-publicity over the years. I'm sure this will save me lots of time on my next book tour!The author also indicates that the book is good for business managers, students taking public relations classes, and those managing communications for nonprofits. While that is true, I think that these audiences would find the book to be a little off target. So I would rate it as 3 stars because it is too simple for a larger business, 4 stars for a student as being a bit too limited, and as 3 stars for a nonprofit (not developing enough about the special issues of nonprofits).Good luck in overcoming the communications stalls that keep people from becoming customers of your enterprise!As a word of advice, I suggest you spend a fair amount of time thinking up what is unique about your small business that would make it newsworthy. That may mean actually changing your business. That could be the best payoff you could get from seeking publicity.Donald MitchellCoauthor of The Irresistible Growth Enterprise (available in August 2000) and The 2,000 Percent Solution(donmitch@fastforward400.com)"},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"This hilarious satire about the tiny Duchy of Grand Fenwick invading the U.S. and then instantly becoming the most important nation in the world is a quiet amusing story.

A very easy and fun read, A Mouse that Roared is an adventurous book to read."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"This is a very well handled story. The author has a number of humane, intelligent things to say, and he says them well... There are two main conflicts in this book, as I see it. First, the contrast between medieval, chivalric ideals of war, (or at least the [not really correct] popular stereotype of them), where everyone involved is constantly worrying about &quot;honor&quot;, vs. the modern war, where one bomb, in this case, can totally destroy the entire human race. This conflict is exemplified, in my view, by the hot-blooded, passionate, anachronistic young Grand Fenwickian Tully Bascomb, on the one hand, fighting against the ruthlessly efficient, modern American General Snippett on the other. Second, the conflict between two highly intelligent old men, the wise and humane Pierce Bascomb on the one hand, and the scientifically brilliant but morally myopic Dr. Kokintz on the other. There is a very interesting, and beautifully written, debate between these two men in about chapter 17 or so, (maybe 16 or 18, I forget) it's worth reading over a few times.Watch for the little things in this book -- there is a debate over whether birds that settle in the miniscule duchy of Grand Fenwick should be called by the name they are known as there, or if they should be called whatever the larger (if not, ultimately, more significant) world outside calls them. This argument seemed kind of dumb to me, but if you keep reading Mr. Wibberly gives it a nice little twist, and you can see why he included it.On a personal note, I wish more books about this kind of thing had more positive scientist characters. A lot of folks come to science, and love it, because it gives them a chance to experience wonder about the universe, and this wonder has a lot of value as a bulwark against excessive militarism -- we can unite in a sense of childlike wonder, as opposed to uniting against some enemy... It can be akin to having a love of &quot;peace through music&quot;, for me at least.Anyway, back to the book -- lest I forget to say so, let me come right out right now and say that it's very funny. If your sense of humor runs to &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, you'll definitely get a big kick out of this book, as well as being provoked by it."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"The Mouse that Roared, if it isn't already, should be one of the funniest books of all time.

After posting stamps and the usual things tiny countries do to earn money they turn to their only export. Their Grand Pinot Fenwick wine. Two political parties the Dilutionists (led by D. Benter) and Anti-Dilutionists (led by Count Mountjoy) argue over how to make their wine more profitable. Gloriana XII, the wise and very attractive ruler of the country decides to go to Tully Bascomb, the Chief Forest Ranger, to ask him to form a Communist party so that the United States will give them money. Tully convinces Gloriana that this wouldn't be honorable and he offers a suggestion which would save Grand Fenwick's national pride: to declare war on the United States. This hilarious book ends with Tully winning the war, the Duchy of Grand Fenwick becoming the most powerful nation in the world, and Tully and Gloriana becoming married.

But the message that it sends is inherently timeless, and nobody should be allowed to graduate from high school without having read it.

Years later, when I was preparing my \\"lesson\\" plan for a literature class I was to teach for advanced high school-aged students, I picked this as one of the novels to study. Unfortunately, at that time it was out of print, but we found enough copies for our class and had a great time learning and laughing with the book.Unfortunately, the topics are still as relevant today as they were in the 60's and 70's. America is still waging war. America is still a \\"super power\\" willingly flexing its collective muscles whenever and wherever. We're still seen as this huge corporation with no knowledge of or regard for the people we (often negatively) affect. It's like in the movie Hotel Rwanda, the hotel owner thanks the cameraman for filming the massacre and states a belief that it will cause an international outcry, and the cameraman states that he thinks people will see the images, say, \\"How horrible!\\" and go back to eating their dinner.Thankfully, Leonard Wibberly did not just say, \\"How horrible!\\" but chose to write about it in a humorous and entertaining way. Maybe someday, we'll heed the message :). Until then, I'm thrilled to see that the book is back in print and has found a new audience."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"The Mouse that Roared was an insightful novel.

It helps if you are at least 40 years old to enjoy it though, as it covers Cold War humor.Having said that, I think if you equate our war with Communism with our war on terrorism, you might still be able to enjoy it, as it really is a commentary on stereotypes, rhetoric, excessive romanticism, and other views we take for granted. Loaded with irony. Semi-slapstick, but not the someone trips on their shoelaces sort of way."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"What amazes me about this book is that every time I come across it on my bookshelf thinking I will read just a few lines, I end up reading it again cover to cover. What I find even more amazing is that even though I must have read this book at least 10 times by now, I still get something new out of it each time. If this doesn't qualify a book as a classic, I don't know what does.\\"The Mouse That Roared\\" is not just a great satire, it's a great story. Even though the premise might seem outlandish at first, the story never feels forced as in satires which use artificial plot devices to get their points across. In fact, the success of the satire owes much to the author's careful observations of the world and the people in it. His ability to capture seemingly small details seemed so spot-on and was quite funny (A typical line is: \\"Mrs. Reiner, however, had not spent fifty-five years living in Brooklyn to have her own aims and interest set aside or swallowed in a furor involving millions.\\" Another is when the founder of the fictional Duchy of Grand Fenwick says: \\"What is good enough for kings is good enough for dukes.\\") It is details such as these that make the incidents which add up to the highly improbable outcome feel entirely plausible - and I believe the book owes much of its humor to this. In addition, the plot and pacing are impeccable. The author's expert switching back and forth between scenes as he builds up the story makes it hard to put the book down.Another selling point for me are the characters, each of which on its own would have made the book worth reading for me. In too many satires, the characters are two-dimensional and only there to move the plot along, but not in this book. I really enjoyed that Leonard Wibberley was able to achieve movement in the story without vilifying any of the characters but rather portrayed them sympathetically and with a touch of gentle humor. For example, it may have been easy to depict Count Mountjoy, the aristocratic leader of the conservative party of the fictional Duchy, as an arrogant old man mired in tradition and much too willing to engage in political machinations. However, the character clearly believed in the importance of politics and that delicate maneuvering was needed to keep the world running smoothly. Politics was almost a form of art for him. Similarly, Dr. Kokintz, the great scientist engaged in cutting edge weapons work, is not portrayed as the stereotypically cold mad scientist lost in minute facts. Instead, he is endowed with a broader understanding that helps account for his scientific success, and the book delves into his predicament as a person. I particularly liked the author's playing up the tension between the characters' commitment to their principles and their need to be practical - while respecting both. The book also did a great job of presenting the pros and cons of a number of issues through the dilemmas of the characters.Sure, as other reviewers have pointed out, a lot has changed since this book was written. The US is probably no longer as assured of its military and economic superiority, and no longer as apologetic about it. The economy and terrorism are now no doubt a much greater concern than nuclear weapons, the main threat in this book. And the traditional newspapers and telephones which played a role in the book have lost some of their importance due to newer technologies. There were also a few statements in the text itself or coming from the mouths of the characters that seemed to be somewhat irrelevant expressions of the author's views and which might be viewed as archaic or even sentimental. However, the general issues raised in the book and the bigger picture that it painted of how world events unfold are as relevant as ever. A keen sense of observation and understanding of human nature combined with a great sense of plot never get old, and in my view, those make this book a timeless classic that can be enjoyed again and again."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"ever heard that old cliche' \\"The book is better than the movie?\\" It's true in this case. Except for the books ending the rest is in the film but it's the backstory and the biting wit that makes the novel better. And i would recommend this novel to anyone who loves their comedy a little dark, absurb and witty."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"Grand Fenwick is a little known country near France, a small duchy that has flourished for centuries because of their popular wine company. Recently, however, the wine business has failed to bring in enough money to live on. ' There are those who wish to dilute the wine, and others who are against this notion. Both parties continue to argue over the outcome until a grand scheme is devised: small, itty bitty Grand Fenwick will declare war on the U.S. - attack, lose, and then receive all sorts of benefits for their trouble, as they had seen happen to every nation who lost a war to the U.S.But of course, this isn't at all what happens. In fact, Grand Fenwick, the smallest nation in the world, wins this war. And becomes the most powerful nation in the world.'________________________________________My thoughts -'I looked forward to reading this book for nearly 9 months before I finally got to read it for school. It most definitely did not disappoint and I want to say right off the bat that everyone should give this a try! :)For one, this book is hilarious. Everything about it - the characters, story line, and dialogue - has some sort of humorous tinge to it. I laughed and giggled through the whole thing.Yet, at the same time, there is a strong sense of seriousness and peril, as well as great honor, throughout the entire story. I couldn't help but follow along to discover what would happen, knowing I wouldn't be disappointed.'Character notes -'I loved all the characters in this book. From the Duchess of Grand Fenwick to Tully Bascomb; from the President of the U.S. to the Russian Commissar. Even if they weren't the most in-depth characters in literature (because this story wasn't exactly meant to focus on character), they were fascinating and realistic all the same. I actually think the U.S. President is my favorite, with Gloriana (the Duchess) coming in at a close second. I respected them both and loved the way they handled the sticky situations they were put in.Story notes -This story really focuses a lot on politics - with a mixture of action, silliness, romance, and character history on the side. I was quite taken with the story line from the start of the book. I cared about Grand Fenwick and their financial struggles and wanted them to find the solution. Then, when they proposed war, the action started. Then more politics...then suspense...and so on. I loved the perfect trap the U.S. walked into, and the perfect set-up to win the war that the warriors of Grand Fenwick had. And neither side knew it. Quite a way to set up an unexpected ending to an already hilarious (and intriguing) story!One word/phrase to sum it up (final thoughts) -''Uproarious! I loved it all, even if it wasn't super deep or life-altering. A bit of silliness, romance, and war mixed in with political disagreements of all different kinds makes for a lovely story and enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"A very witty and heart-warming story about cold war politics. Despite being written many years ago (indeed before the fall of the wall), if you have read a bit of history about the 1st half of the 20th century and you want a bit of a break from the bleak outlook for a world with many Bombs (and the increasing likelihood of a rogue state or terrorist organisation obtaining fissile material) then this book will give you some much needed medicine :)Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"How can a tiny country, unknown and virtually ignored, suddenly become a force that even the United States of America must reckon? That story is held within the pages of \\"The Mouse that Roared\\".Allegorical but none-the-less delightful, this tale pits a minuscule country that has been sidelined by the powerful forces of trade until they discover a secret weapon. A weapon that can bring the mightiest nation on earth to its knees.A fast a delightful read, this book leaves behind some good lessons about self worth, determination, and pride that any person, young or old, will find appropriate. I highly recommend reading this book at least 2 times in your life, or this year anyway."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"This book deals with American foreign policy, particularly our loan system, in a funny way. This would be a good read for students as there is also a very good movie."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"Anyone who considers any of the MOUSE books dated should look again: Wibberley wields a gentle but very pointed stick at politics of all stripes in his still-hilarious story of the US at war with the smallest country in Europe -- and losing. The true absurdity comes after the war is \\"won\\", and the Grand Fenwickians try to figure out how they're supposed to handle the massive financial reparations the US will no doubt ask for.The enormous anti-left screed posted here as a review just underscores the brilliance of Wibberley's little fable, because he's an equal-opportunity skewer of both the right *and* the left (Read the parliamentary debate scene to see him doing so).Find a copy of this little marvel and read it."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It poked fun at several governments and cultures in a hilarious manner. I would recommend this book to people who find flaws in most modern governments (especially the United States), but are light-hearted enough to laugh about it! A very quick and easy read."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"This book is about a duchy only several square miles attempting to get involved in world politics. It decides that the best way for a country to get money is to lose a war with the U.S. It tries to lose a war with the U.S. ... but wins! The story is hillarious and the movie of it is nearly as funny. The Mouse on the Moon is the best of several sequals."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"This is a silly little book that mixes broad satire with broad humor. The end result is a story that runs out of steam long before its 180 pages have run their course.Wibberley has a lot of fun with the setup, which establishes a tiny fictional European country with fewer inhabitants than most small American towns. The country, just 15 square miles, has survived by a series of historical quirks that have allowed it to maintain independence from other sovereign nations. But the wine-based economy has collapsed, and so the government hits on a plan to scam America out of war restitution funds. The idea is that they will attack the US (with their army of 20 archers), be defeated in a heartbeat, and then collect a fat restitution check that will give them the wealth they need to survive. The plan goes wrong, of course, when a series of extreme coincidences allows them to mistakenly conquer the United States.The book is noteworthy in that it satirizes some very serious subjects without ever seeming to mean any harm to the target. Catch-22 sends up US foreign policy and military institutions with a keen, biting anger that has us laughing and crying at the same time. The Mouse That Roared, on the other hand, lampoons government, bureaucracy, and even nuclear warfare with a wink and a nudge.Since it is criticism that is never really critical, the book relies largely on its humor and gags, and they, sadly, have not aged very well. Some of the humor is topical, but the real problem is that the types of jokes have lost all of their punch over the years. What may have been cutting edge comedy back in the day is just groan-inducing today.The freshness and energy do give some fun and zing to the book in its early stages, but once we've acclimated to the goofy world in which the story takes place, there is very little to look forward to.I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're looking to relive the humor of the fifties."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"'Do you believe they'd really explode the bomb?' the President asked.'Mr. President,' the secretary countered, 'would you have believed they would invade the United States with twenty longbowmen,landing in Manhattan off a chartered sailing vessel?'-The Mouse That RoaredSadly Leonard Wibberley's hilarious satire, The Mouse that Roared seems to be making the slow sad transit from wildly popular bestseller and hitmovie in the 50s and 60s to cult classic in the 70s and 80s to largely forgotten in the 90s and 00s. The book, which was originally serialized in theSaturday Evening Post from December 1954 to January 1955 as The Day New York Was Invaded, is no longer in print--despite the fact that thetattered copy I'm holding is something like the 30th printing. And the film does not seem to have been transferred to DVD, though I did find a copyof the equally funny sequel, The Mouse on the Moon. Our growing amnesia is unfortunate, both because this is just a funny story, and also becausecurrent events reveal it to still be timely.The tale concerns the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, a tiny European nation which \\"lies in a precipitous fold of the northern Alps.\\" It was founded in1370 by British soldier of fortune Roger Fenwick, under not altogether honorable circumstances. Practically the only thing that is produced there,and the only reason anyone has ever heard of it, is a fine wine called Pinot Grand Fenwick. Other than this one export, the nation remains happilyisolated, a medieval remnant in the modern world, ruled over by Duchess Gloriana XII--\\"a pretty girl of twenty-two\\" in the book, a more matronlywoman in the film, so that Peter Sellers can play her--and her prime minister, the Count of Mountjoy (also played by Peter Sellers).As the story begins, crisis has descended upon the Grand Duchy in the form of revenue shortfalls. It is determined that the most effective way ofraising money is to declare war on the United States, the pretext for which is the introduction of a San Rafael, California winery of a wine calledPinot Grand Enwick, a provocation that can not be allowed to stand. As Gloriana explains the aims of the war :All in all, as I said before, there is no more profitable and sound step for a nation without money or credit to take, than declare waron the United States and suffer a total defeat.It's easy to see why the fortunes of this story changed over the years; written just a few years after the Marshall Plan, it resonated in an America thathad won WWII and rebuilt its enemies. But in the late 60s and early 70s, the Left determined that America was evil and that there was nothinghonorable nor humorous about the Cold War, Vietnam, or any of the other seemingly benign extensions of American power. Wibberley's wittyinsight must have seemed the stuff of delusions or insidious propaganda to folks who had convinced themselves that we were really an imperialistnation. But now that the \\"blame America first\\" crowd has been routed, you can read that speech above, or watch the movie, and hear the eerieechoes coming from Afghanistan. What might Mr. Wibberley have made of the absurd notion that at the same we were bombing the Taliban and AlQaeda we were bombing the rest of the Afghanis with food supplies? And the rest of the war has played out exactly as the Duchess Gloriana wouldhave predicted--the Taliban had no sooner been routed than we started pouring in money and rebuilding that broken nation. You could read throughthousands of pages of anti-American screeds by Noam Chomsky, Susan Sontag, Barbara Kingsolver, and their ilk, without increasing yourunderstanding of the world by one iota. But in that one speech, Leonard Wibberley basically explains the entire 20th (or American) Century.At any rate, Tully Bascombe, chief forest ranger of the Duchy (again played by Sellers in the film), and twenty longbowmen charter a boat andinvade Manhattan, intending to surrender as quickly as possible. But by happy coincidence, the whole city is underground for an air raid test, andwhen first Tully and his chain mail clad \\"army\\" are mistaken for aliens and then they capture a scientist, Dr. Kokintz, and his super-lethal quadium(or Q) bomb, Grand Fenwick ends up winning the war. Armed with the Q bomb, Fenwick forms a League of Little Nations and dictates its ownpeace terms and blackmails the U.S. and Russia into a general nuclear disarmament.Tully, hero of Fenwick's great victory, of course gets the girl--Dr. Kokintz's daughter in the film; the Duchess herself in the novel. This gives Mr.Wibberley one last opportunity for a very amusing, though thoroughly politically incorrect, observation, as Mountjoy tries to convince the Duchessthat she must take a husband :'I hope,' said Gloriana warily, 'that you are not going to suggest that I marry the American minister because I won't do it.I've been reading about the Americans in a women's magazine and they're all cruel to their wives,''Cruel to their wives?' echoed the count.'Precisely. They treat them as equals. They refuse to make any decisions without consulting them. They load them up withworries they should keep to themselves. And when there isn't enough money, they send them out to work instead of earningmore by their own efforts. Some of them even make their wives work so they can go to college. They are not men at all.They are men-women. And their wives are women-men. If I am to marry, I want a husband who will be a man and let mebe a woman. I'll be able to handle him better that way.'Of course, the ultimate truth of this sharp observation lies in the final line, Gloriana's certainty that theoretical \\"equality\\" is unnecessary for her toactually control a husband.Both book and movie are a great deal of fun. They are well worth seeking out. That their satire is once again applicable to the events of the dayshould be reason enough for a revival.GRADE : A"},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"The Mouse that Roared is the best political satire I have ever read. I read it thinking I would dislike it, like many novels read in the classroom, but I was wrong. Besides being hilariously funny, this novel criticizes modern day America and the policies of war in a way that is not boring to read. I was hooked from the first mention of the name Grand Fenwick and the explanation of its history. The characters are at once realistic and comical, and the ludicrous ideas of the old-fashioned duchy are actually not so impossible when one considers many Eastern cultures. Altogether a great book!"},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"Although this book is now a bit dated, and the cold war humor might be difficult for younger readers to grasp, it is still a tremendously funny read for those who remember or have studied the cold war days.In this book a tiny European country decides that the answer to its financial problems lies in going to war with the United States and loosing. After seeing how the US rebuilt its WWII adversaries it really seems the only sensible way out of their current economic crisis. Add to this a perfectly justifiable reason to make war on the United States in the form of an American company marketing a cheap clone of the nations staple wine label, and you have a unanimous decision for war in the great counsels of Grand Fenwick.The only problem is how to get the Americans to realize that they are at war. An official note declaring war was simply lost in the bureaucracy of the state department. At last they mount a mighty invasion of New York City (with an expeditionary force 20 longbowmen strong). The results are hilarious. Indeed not a chapter went by in which I did not laugh out loud at least a couple times. This was a fun book to read. I think this book is far better than the movie based on it. The only cold war comedy movie that was as good as this book was Dr. Strangelove (although the humor is of a very different verity)."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"We are spending part of the weekend at my brother's house. When I visit family and friends I like to spend a few minutes and look through their bookshelves. You can tell a lot about people by the kinds of books they read. I've been checking out my brother's books.Last night I happened across The Mouse That Roared by Leonard Wibberly in one of my brother's bookshelves. (Yes, he had a nice collection of books.) Years ago I had watched part of the movie version with Peter Sellers. It seemed like a pleasant movie, but for some reason I had never watched the whole movie. I started the book last night and finished today.The book takes place in the 1950s, during the height of the Cold War. The book creates a country named Grand Fenwick up in the Alps of Europe. It was founded 600 years ago by an Englishman. This small country is five by seven miles with 4,500 people. The country is suffering economically. An American company is illegally ce making the exact same wine that Grand Fenwick sells. Grand Fenwick tries to go through diplomatic channels for redress and is ignored. Finally they decide to declare war on the United States, with the expectation that they would lose, but that the United States would invest money into them. There was precedent for this, after World War II the United States spent billions helping Germany and Japan rebuild.Since this is fiction there is little surprise that Grand Fenwick wins the war about two thirds of the way through the book. The rest of the book is about how Grand Fenwick handles its unexpected victory.I enjoyed the book. It was fun and light hearted. I don't plan to track down the other four books. Maybe some day I'll happen across one of the sequels."},{"Title":"The Mouse That Roared","review":"'The Mouse that Roared' is a brilliant book filled with charm and wit.

When their only source of external revenue is threatened by company in the US, and their demands ignored, they go to war with the United States and win before the US realizes thay are at war! the Cold war humor is quite enjoyable, and the message this book presents is one of &quot;You can conquer anything if you have enough of the right intention&quot;. The ultimate 'underdog' and 'little guy becomes the hero' story if there ever was one. I cannot say enough about how wonderful this book is. It will make you roll you eyes at times, and cause you to squirm with embarrassment for the characters and also laugh aloud. In the end you will find yourself cheering. It is probably one of the most important books in political satire ever written, and should be required reading for all who seek positions of power in our modern society.

What happens is that the Duchy of Grand Fenwick (a very small unheard of country, that is about 500 years away from being modern) is going bankrupt. The main way and basically the only way the county makes money is selling its wine. The rising population of the country and several other things force the country to find ways to make more money. They first start to add water to the wine to make more of it. But when this isn't enough, they make up a plan to attack the US and lose so that US would give them money for suffering defeat. They then use this money to mordenize their country. But there is a horrible mistake, they win. You could probably find more information in other reviews, but I don't want to say anything else because it takes a while for all these things to happen.

In this book, Colette expands upon the friendship between Claudine and Annie, and shows what becomes of the latter's timid personality and what stepson Marcel has developed into. But Claudine is the same delightful Claudine, who writes of pain, of friendship, of personal relationships, of nature, of animals freely now, uninhibited by society. For how flowing and relaxing the book reads, there are some major changes to the plot, most noticably in the end.

The grammar explanations are clear but it has too many concepts in each chapter, it is definitely a book I would NOT use with beginner students, it doesn't provide for enough drills and practices. For beginners, it is very important to have just one type of exercises and a lot of drills until they start internatilizing the language. There is nothing wrong with the book, if the authors would state that it is only for students of a certain level. Also, for all book writers, please do not use American-APuerto Rican or American Cuban accents, we can't use those phony accent tapes in Latin America when we know that native speakers don't speak like that. The vosotros should be dropped and left as a marginal note. The model of the language that is still being used in the United States is the Spanish from Spain. Currently, Spanish from Mexico is the Spanish most widely heard and it has been chosen as the model Spanish for Latin MTV.

Someone in all those religions has to be wrong causing failure. Human failure which has reached unacceptable proportions. It doesn't take much of a genius to conclude how wrong, but what do you do about it when there are 911 related wrongs.I would say that this book was prompted by 911, even though Charles has for years devoted his time to the subject of religion causing problems, he is claiming 9 11 as a source of evidense not brought to this level of awareness before. I must comment, how much more evidense does one need when the perpetrator of this 911 attack (Osama) praised his god for it?I agree with Charles, it is time we concentrated our true humanity in the direction of what is more realistic, we have to at some point define a non crossable line in freedom of religion when it causes such humanitarin hinderence. A absolutely astounding book that goes much further than this and has proved success is SB 1 or God."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"The book was very disappointing because it is mostly the author's subjective opinion about the world's religions. The author is very protective of religion in general and does not really hold them responsible for the evil that they inflicted on the world when they misuse their power. Read the first 10 pages and then skip to page 90 and start reading, the author takes that long before he introduces any evidence that religions have ever done anything evil."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Dr Kimball is a professor in comparative religion. So in its best tradition, he recommends a politically-correct and pragmatic approach to everyday life; Live and let live. Sure we must, but its a cop out if in doing so we had to deny that there is anything near the Absolute Truth that only can be of God.His book diagnoses 5 warning signs \\"When RELIGION becomes evil\\", one of which is the absolute truth claim. Sad to say, the book would better be retitled \\"Blind religious zealots groping the Elephant\\" with Dr Kimball himself to claim \\"I can see that's what they are doing, and that's the Absolute Truth\\".If Jesus is not the incarnate Son of God who died for the sins of the world - to people all over the world i.e. both believers and non-believers, then Christianity is not even a partial truth but a lie and false. It would not be worth believing must less to live on.So any religion is already evil as long as it idolises any other personality other than worshipping God in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Would comparative religion based on a relativist humanism worldview or philosophy of multiple realities be the right place to adjudicate God? Surely this would end in futility.There are misguided and self-serving Christians and also those who misuse the name of the Lord. But even if there is just one Gandhi, who lived life in a Hindu culture and yet could see and believe in the truth of Jesus Christ, God is indeed bigger than religions. If in the name of tolerance and we pray to God to just leave people where they are, then the Devil will have the last laugh over our own stupidity.Have we become kinder by being vegetarian if our doing so is because we are afraid of mad cow disease? That seems to be the thesis of \\"When Religion Becomes Evil\\" as the disease with the 5 warning signs as the preventive prescription. My view is that the doctor diagnosed the disease wrong."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"This is a magnificent book. There are some typos and minor errors, such as the repeated misspelling of Hal Lindsey's name, but that is understandable for a first edition. There is quite a lot to ponder and savor within its relatively brief length (213 mid-sized pages) and it makes its points and justifies them while remaining easy-to-read. It explains the core tendencies that corrupt religion and provides a clarion call for more inclusive, honest, and dynamic religion in this new century.A valid criticism that was raised by another reader is Dr. Kimball's use of the term \\"authentic\\" (which means genuine, real, true, undoubted, unquestionable, factual, verifiable) for his sort of religion. That assumes that all religious expression that he disagrees with is \\"inauthentic.\\" One may argue that one type of religion is better than another in certain specific ways, as the author has, but that does not mean that bad religion is inauthentic. Bad religion is as real as good religion, just as bad politics are as real as good politics. Using the term authentic provides a temptation to use it as a copout. When someone criticizes the bad use of religion, an apologist could reply, \\"Well, that is not 'authentic' religion. Only good religion is true religion,\\" thus making criticism of religion impossible, because any ills will be brushed aside as \\"inauthentic\\" and not due to religion at all. I prefer Dr. Kimball's other adjectives for good religion: healthy, dynamic, honest, etc.A second valid criticism that was raised is, that while it is true that Jews, Christians, and Muslims all stem from the same root, Kimball goes overboard when he says on page 50 that \\"There is simply no ambiguity here. Jews, Christians, and Muslims are talking about the same deity.\\" That is an oversimplification. While clerics in these religions are fond of saying they worship the same Abrahamic God, their conceptions of that God are different.A third criticism that has been raised is that Kimball does not address the issue of the possibility that a religion's \\"authentic sources\\" themselves may contain moral and theological errors that encourage evils. I think this ommission is understandable given the focus of the book. Kimball's book is not a comprehensive discussion of religion, but rather a discussion of the corruptions of mainline religion.My only other wish is that Kimball had accompanied his five warning signs of \\"evil\\" religion with their counterparts that indicate more positive religion, which I attempt below...Charles Kimball's five warning signs of corruption in religion:1. Absolute truth claims2. Blind obedience3. Establishing the \\"ideal\\" time4. The end justifies any means5. Declaring holy warMy five signs of integrity and dynamism in religion:1. Dynamic and relational truth and ongoing learning2. Critical thinking and honest inquiry3. Making the best of every time and leaving the determination of the end time to heaven4. Both means and end are important and linked5. Declaring holy peace"},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"When the first airliner slammed into the World Trade Tower on that fateful September day in 2001 and I heard the news over the radio as I drove to work my first thought was not Saddam Hussein (as was the apparent first thought of at least one major world leader), but Osama bin Laden. Why did I think this? Because there had been an earlier attack on the towers by Islamic extremists and religious fanaticism is more likely to produce self-sacrificing violent deeds than simple greed and power hunger. Religious extremism allows a person to destroy themselves on the promise that they will wake up in paradise. None of the people around Saddam Hussein were that devoted to the admittedly evil dictator to sacrifice themselves in such a violent act.Charles Kimball's book, \\"When Religion Becomes Evil\\" addresses the problem of corrupted religion and how to recognize it. He uses five warning signs to define such corruption- claims of absolute truth, demands of blind obedience, establishment of the \\"ideal\\" time, justification of means by the end, and declaration of holy war. We certainly have enough examples, from the Branch Davidians of David Koresh, to Heaven's Gate and Jim Jones, on through to Osama bin Ladin. All of these were or are demonstrably pathological. They all led to death and destruction for their followers and often innocent bystanders. Others, while not so extreme, are dangerous enough to warrant observation. These include several organizations of the so-called religious right in this country who often advocate violence indirectly by condemning certain groups that are deemed unworthy or under the control of Satan. As Kimball (who is a Baptist academic) notes exclusionary literal religions can indeed be a danger to democracy and to the general welfare of the society.Is religion the problem? Kimball correctly, I think, answers yes and no. Religion is always going to be with us and there will always probably be those who take it to extremes or use it cynically for their own gain, often at the expense of the lives of others. However, religion may be a human need. This is not necessarily a seeking for God as some would have it, but a need for meaning in life. An atheist can be just as ethically good as the best believer and a devote believer can easily be as evil in their actions as the most evil non-believer. We have Schindlers and Gandhis, Communist dictators and inquisitors. People who saved Jews in Nazi- overrun Europe came from all sorts of belief systems, including atheists, but all had some sort of faith in a moral system. On the other hand, some people who considered themselves truly religious turned in Jews to their destroyers. It is belief in a basic morality, not in a specific doctrine, which makes life bearable.As Kimball points out religion at its best can be very good, while at its worst it reaches depths of depravity seldom seen in simple non-religious disputes. The current hatred between Palestinians and Israelis is a case in point. Both sides have lost moral authority and I find it difficult at present to have as much sympathy for either side as I would like.While I cannot exactly share Kimball's Christian faith I am impressed with his honest attempt to examine the evils of religious literalism and bigotry. I might add that I do not embrace atheism, but prefer a more ecumenical approach that includes all major religions and non-believers as well. However, whatever your beliefs, if you want to learn more about the problems of religious exclusivity and literalism associated with hatred and violence, you cannot go wrong by reading \\"When Religion Becomes Evil.\\" Whether you agree with Kimball or not, it will expand your understanding of the difficulties involved in too literal a belief system."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"According to Charles Kimball, religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth. Religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests, while at the same time, more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution. Using a comparative religious approach, Kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil.Kimball argues the word \`religion' is amorphous and difficult to define. As a result, the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary, one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions. Kimball, next, asks if religion is the cause of evil, and he answers both yes and no. A religion that is arrogant, condescending, and requires adherents to \\"disconnect their brain\\" is problematic. On the other hand, religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community. Kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil.The first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims. When conceptualizations of God are held with certainty and rigid doctrine, the propensity towards evil increases dramatically. Sacred texts, sources of wisdom and guidance, become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims. Christianity and Islam have missionary mandates, but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims. Kimball argues for a \\"human view of truth\\", one that is dynamic and relational, allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions.Another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience: when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities. When a charismatic leader demands total obedience, has unrestricted power, and has total control, religion is unhealthy. Uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy, as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection. Strict segregation from the larger society, combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous. Kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence.Every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth, while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future. When adherents believe they can speak for God and wish to usher in this time, the likelihood for disaster increases. Many Muslims embrace the hope for an all Islamic society, zealous Jewish settlers dream of a time when Israel will be returned to its divinely promised status, and the Christian Religious Right believe that America should be politically structured with Christian principles in mind. Kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are God's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous.Religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means: when one theological component gets elevated, thus becoming an end, and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end. All religions have notions of sacred space, but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space. Reinforcing or protecting group identity against an \`other', or protecting group identity from within the group, are also potentially dangerous signs. Institutional structures develop in all religious traditions, but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end. Kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends.The last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a \\"holy\\" war. Kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within Christianity, and he shows how each of these views were represented in the Gulf War of 1990-91. Islam is a peaceful religion, which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order. The word jihad means \\"struggling in the way of God,\\" but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the Christian just war theory. Because of socio-economic disparities, some Muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends, and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause. Kimball believes both that Christian and Muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy.With the knowledge of when religion becomes evil, religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis. Faith, hope, and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents, so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted. Against secularism, Kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards, and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity. With religious diversity Christians have three options, exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism, but Kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity. Finally, the Middle East represents a microcosm for the world community: if peaceable solutions are not found in the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflict, then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Religion. How is it that for the majority it is a way of worship, enlightenment, and ethical conduct, while for others, it becomes a weapon for destructiveness and the worst in human behavior? Dr. Kimball, who has a long list of some very impressive credentials, takes us on a short journey to witness how faiths that start out on their true paths, become susceptible to any of the five warning signs as it heads towards polluted waters.From the dark side of Christian \\"Love\\" through the ages to those who have bastardized Islam today, the book focuses on the five warning signs and are explored from cults, to mainstream religions, in different degrees and assorted times, and amongst various groups both ancient and modern.Ranging anywhere from exclusivism to outright religious anarchy, the author's writing shines as he focuses on religious corruption within the three Abrahamic teachings in the context of current social, economic, and political factors where communities fragmented by conflict, economic, or social inequities, and even political division, produce collective ideologies and zealots of all stripes.In the last chapter he writes that people of all faiths should be able to share their core beliefs while remembering that \\"one's own experience of God does not exhaust all possibilities.\\" He claims it is possible to embrace \\"religious pluralism\\" and still stay true to ones own faith. A couple of the reviewers seem to miss his point by arguing that he is trying to blur religious lines... I do not think so. What he IS saying, and the point I believe he is trying to make is that how people of different faiths relate to each other has never been more urgent then it is today. He himself (a Christian Baptist minister) admits \\"..in my study and experience, I have yet to discover truths that compel me to embrace another religious tradition as my own.\\" (p208) The author doesn't want you to abandon your religion, he wants you to embrace it yet at the same time build bridges to people of other faiths. Although I can't agree with everything in the book, it is still a welcome addition in contrast to those who simply stereotype or demonize other faiths."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"As a student of Dr. Kimball at Wake Forest University, I thought it important to submit a review of his most recent book from that perspective. I have read other works by Dr. Kimball, but this one is by far the best. It is timely in its publication, yet scholarly in its approach. Too many books have been published on terrorism since Spetember 11, 2001 that are nothing more than fluff, riding the wave of capitalism on the wallets of the ignorant. However, Dr. Kimball's work analyzes religion and the nature of faith when it becomes corrupt, explaining how the process works and the end results it has the potential to produce. Of all the books out there on this same subject, of which I have read many, Dr. Kimball's is numbered among the best. I have only two concerns about it, the first of which is minor; often Kimball cites himself, which comes off as pompous. The second concern is that he cites both John Esposito and Samuel B. Huntington as positive examples of other scholars who have written on the same subject. In conversation with many Arab Muslims recently, they have warned me of these two authors saying that their approach to Middle Eastern studies is far too Western and lacks real understanding of complex issues. I have not read Esposito, but I concur with this assessment of Huntington's work (Clash of Civilizations). However, Kimball's book is well written, erudite, concise, and above all, informative. In this day and age of uncertainty, books such as this serve to enlighten those of us who know little, but thirst for more."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"This is a very, very good book. It can be a quick read and unlike many other books in the genre of comparative religion is accessible to a broad audience. I think almost anyone can read this book and learn something of value. I know that I did. Even though the title has the word &quot;Evil&quot; in it, do not take that to mean it is a denigration of religion. The author himself is an ordained minister. I think it is rather a clear warning of behaviors that can cause people to forget the true meaning of their religion and ultimately corrupt the original purpose of the belief structure. At the forefront is the first warning sign of &quot;Absolute Truth Claims&quot; which I think leads to the the other 4 warning signs he covers. People should not seek the cover of their faith or beliefs to stunt the pursuit of greater knowledge. The author points out the common ground of many religions in the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; which if adhered to would prevent the corruption of religion in the name of other causes. The Author specialized in Islamic Studies while earning his Th.D. at Harvard, so I think his interpretations of Islam are quite valuable and instructive in understanding some of the issues we confront today in the world. Again, this is an excellent book and very easy to understand. It is only a couple hundred pages long. For many readers, I think the several hours you will invest into reading this book will be well worth it."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Kimball's WHEN RELIGION BECOMES EVIL argues that while true religion is all nice and good, it can sometimes get corrupted into forms that are violent and dangerous. One can tell when a religion has become corrupted by looking for these warning signs: (i) the religion claims to be the exclusive province of absolute truth; (ii) the religion demands blind obedience to a leader; (iii) the religion attempts to bring about the apocalypse in order to pave the way for utopia; (iv) the religion argues that the ends justifies any means; (v) the religion promotes holy war.While I believe these are all good indicators of trouble to come, and also believe Kimball did a good job of discussing and fitting case examples to them, I do not feel Kimball succeeded in establishing that forms of religion that display these indicators are \\"corruptions\\" of \\"true\\" religion. Instead, he appears virtually to assume that of course true religion is peaceful and progressive, so any deviation must be a corruption. But such an assumption is not obvious to me. For all I can tell from what Kimball has written, ultra-fundamentalists have just as much claim to be honoring \\"true\\" religion as do liberals, even though I appreciate the liberal position more. Perhaps I am wrong in this assessment, but either way, I would have liked to see Kimball offer far more argument for his contrary views."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Everyone concerned about destructive fanaticism manifesting itself in the world's major religions should read this important book, praised by Publisher's Weekly as \\"Top Religion Book of 2002.\\" Kimball, whose grandfather was Jewish, is an ordained Baptist minister, a committed religious liberal, and a Harvard-educated scholar of religious history, especially of the \\"Abrahamic\\" faiths, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. He loves all three of these faiths with a deep-rooted passion and is also an admirer of Buddhism and of Gandhi. For years he has served the cause of cross-cultural understanding and human rights as speaker, writer and National Council of Churches diplomat. Dr. Kimball was ideally situated to write a book clarifying the troubling issues raised by 9/11 and other recent events worldwide.The book's primary theme is to find out why certain followers of religion enslave themselves to doctrine, and why they dehumanize, even demonize, those who follow other paths. It begins with a head-on discussion of whether religion itself is the problem, concluding, as most of us would, that genuinely transcendent religious faith -- like Martin Luther King's and Gandhi's -- provides history's cutting edge for good, but that coerced religious practice is intrinsically evil. More than once he writes that \\"freedom from religion is a corollary to freedom of religion.\\" The chapters are broken into his choice of the five most dangerous tendencies of religious belief, which are listed below along with a few of the subtopics. In some ways this is a weak structure, since many of the topics and subtopics overlap, but sorting them into five broad areas aids the reader in focusing on important issues:Absolute truth claims -- misunderstanding and denigration of other faiths, idolatry of sacred texts and/or hierarchies, the difficulty of defining deep religious concepts in wordsBlind obedience -- requiring adherents to \\"disconnect their brain\\" (Kimball's phrase), not only within cults like Jonestown and Aum Shinrikyo, but also troubling manifestations within all the major world faithsEstablishing the \\"ideal\\" time -- Millennialism, Israel-Palestine, televangelism, the TalibanThe end justifies any means -- Hindu-Muslim conflicts, Bosnia, murder of abortionists, cover-ups of child-molesting priestsDeclaring holy war -- Christian crusades and inquisitions, Islamic and Jewish fanaticism, cynical use of religion for political ends, the real meaning of &quot;jihad.&quot;Although I've read the Qu'ran a couple of times, that was some years ago and I learned so much about the nobler aspects of Islam from Kimball's book that I intend to reread that faith's sacred text. Kimball's final chapter, on inclusive belief, is cautiously hopeful, and ends in a quote from the Qu'ran, Surah 5:48, which is more latitudinarian than anything I recall from either the Judaic or Christian scriptures: \\"If God had so willed He would have created you one community, but [instead] . . . compete with one another in good works.\\" As Kimball sees it, the sublimest aspect of religion is its vast and infinite diversity, providing all varieties of competition for good, which in time may overwhelm the evil tendencies of religious narrowness.Keep this impressive book on your shelf next to Eric Hoffer's classic on political fanaticism, The True Believer."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Why do practitioners of religions end up doing bad things?

It is written humbly, accessibly, engagingly, without attacking anyone's belief, but showing that representatives of all the world's religions have allowed cultural hatred to lead to bloodshed, in the name of religious faith. I especially commend it to anyone who fears Islam, thinking it an evil, violent faith. Kimball, an ordained Baptist minister with a Th.D. from Harvard University, specialized in Islamic studies, has been involved in high level conversations in the Mid-East. As he points out, \\"whether or not one is personally religious, it is imperative that we all try to understand and address . . . behavior in religion that threatens everyone.\\" His five warning signs are right on the mark, and will raise your awareness that we have a responsibility to speak out against evil, especially when under the guise of religious belief."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"I remember this author coming to my college to give a lecture not long after 9/11. It is not only an intelligent but earnest discourse but he is a professor and also an ordained Baptist minister and has traveled widely; so, he is speaking from education as well as experience. In this book he writes about the three desert/Abrahamic/monotheistic religions as being essentially of the same tradition and the potential for interfaith dialogue. He outlines their history and also talks about how the fundamentalism and terrorism that may occur in each one and also other religions such as Hinduism, though that does not negate or mitigate the necessity of scrutinizing and critiquing any one particular faith. In fact, this viewpoint offers hope for reform and progress in a modern context.My only point of contention is that these types of issues occur more frequently with religions that are organized (tax-exempt) and seek political power; the 3 Abrahamic faiths do not stand for all 'religion' in terms of becoming corrupt, and while dogma is distinctly an authoritative doctrine held by a religious OR political group as 'absolute truth,' religion does not always equal dogma. And here is the error: the desire for interfaith dialogue at the same time excludes dialogue with people who do not subscribe to the Abrahamic faith.With this and a more spiritual viewpoint in mind, I suggest reading Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"I received this book in proof edition from one of my Religion Editor friends. She has done me a great service. I found the thought process and information provided by Kimball to be most compelling. The book is well laid out and well written with concise expression of ideas. I have long believed that religion as we know it today has become corrupted by men (and I do mean men since the religions are mostly controlled by men, not women). But Kimball puts into eloquent words those ideas and concepts which I found I could only hold in my mind and not express.Like so many books in this genre, When Religion Becomes Evil was scheduled for publication on the one year anniversary of the 9/11/01 tragedies. It could not have been timed better or be more relevant and important. For it not only points out the five basic corruptions that manifest themselves in each of the major religious traditions, but it holds out hope that each of those religions has within it the wherewithal to root out and correct those flaws. Yet we must be willing to hold ourselves and our faith institutions accountable for the intolerance we practice.Kimball states that religion is arguably the most powerful and persuasive force on earth and that yes, it is the problem. It is the problem because each seems to hold that it alone has the absolute truth, demands blind obedience, and justifies the means used by the end goal (presumably salvation or \\"right living.\\") Somehow, Kimball has reinvigorated the often used argument that the basic teaching of the world faith traditions (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and Buddhist) have been used for corrupt ends, yet are in themselves the seeds for healing. \\"The complicity of religious persuasions in global conflicts today is undeniable, but understanding this complicity requires that we clearly grasp the difference between what we have called corrupt forms of religious commitment and the authentic forms that offer hope.\\"The message of this book, so eloquently and convincingly written, is one that all lay people should embrace. We must hold ourselves and our faith institutions accountable for our actions in the world.

GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Kimball has provided an important service by identifying the five \\"warning signs\\" of dangerous religion. However, he has compromised this contribution by making the specious distinction between \\"authentic\\" religion and \\"corrupted\\" religion. An \\"authentic\\" religion is one that only does nice, happy things for everybody? That never judges or condemns anyone? That never does any harm to anyone? Such a religion has never existed. Well, maybe Jainism, since it believes that all beings--human and otherwise--have senses and feel pain and can cause the harm-doer some spiritual consequences.What Kimball fails to appreciate is that all of the five warning signs he highlights are inherent features of virtually all religions! \\"Absolute truth claims\\"? Doesn't Christianity say that it is the one absolute truth? Doesn't it say that all non-believers--even of other religions--will go to hell? And \\"holy war\\"--what does he think a \\"crusade\\" is? No, by his own criteria, all religions are \\"corrupted\\" and therefore dangerous...and they are.Selengut's book is more sensible when he says that all religion is powerful and dangerous and that it is dangerous because it is powerful. Kimball's book is an attempt to whitewash religion--or the religion he likes--by distancing it from its own nature. That is impossible.Groothius' review below, which is also critical of Kimball, makes an allied mistake. One cannot talk of \\"moral errors\\" in a religion. First of all, who can say what a \\"moral error\\" is at all? What standard do you compare it to? If the Bible says to kill your disobedient sons--if Abraham was ordered to kill his son--is that a \\"moral error\\"? I don't know; if the authority of all morality says to do it, I guess it is moral. Second, since every religion provides its own moral context, how do youjudge the morality of its morality? Is Christian morality moral? To Christians, yes. To others, maybe not. This just proves that morality is relative and that all of us--Christians and non-Christians--have a morality that is higher than religion, by which we can judge religion. Kimball does it, Groothius does it, I do it, and you do it. But if religion is not the absolute ground of morality, nor the absolute ground of empirical fact, what good is it? Apparently, pretty good at making believers think they are right enough to impose it on the rest of us, even by force."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"I've seen this Dr. Kimball many times since the Gulf War on CNN and other news networks as a true expert on the middle East and particularly its religions and cultures.

While there is nothing new about this idea, the author's take is refreshing in that it is scholarly while at the same time accessable to the average reader.

His analysis includes Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and Hinduism, although his primary focus is on Christianity and Islam. I suspect that some deeply religious readers will be put off by the title, but any misgivings they have will likely disappear when and if they read the book. It is even-handed (though I would have preferred he spend a bit more time including examples from Judaism) and respectful of each of the religious traditions covered in the book.

I bought it and discovered that, although Dr. Kimball is an ordained Baptist minister, he is not a fundamentalist. In fact, fundamentalism is one of the main causes of religion turning bad. Dr. Kimball points out that religion is not bad, it is good. Unfortunately, religion is often perverted, causing it to become evil. It is the perversion of religion, not religion itself, that is evil. Although a Christian, Dr. Kimball examines Christian, as well as Muslim examples of evil, such as the Crusades.A major cause of religion turning evil is the belief that one's religion is the truth and other religions are false, ie, exclusivity. This is a problem among some Moslems and Christians, and to a much lesser extent, among some Jews. Other perversions of religion include a belief that an ideal time is upon us (remember the group that committed mass suicide when the Hale Bopp Comet arrived?) and a blind alegience to a leader. In all, Kimball sets forth five perversions of religion which are warning signs of possible evil.I have one concern with this otherwise excellent book. Dr. Kimball is a great theologian but not that good a politician. Therefore, as a good man of God, he attempts to take an evenhanded approach to the Mideast, blaming Israel for not extending its democratic institutions to Arabs and Palestinians. First of all, to a great extent, Dr. Kimball is wrong in that Israel does provide a great amount of feeedom to all citizens. Secondly, with constant terror attacks against it, Israel has no choice but to protect itself. Giving potential enemies, too much freedom is a prescription for terrorist attacks to continue unabated. Despite this serious flaw, I still give the book 4 stars since Dr. Kimball is not malicious, but rather acting as a theologian who seeks even handedness rather than dealing in \\"realpolitik.\\" In fact, through most of the book, he demonstrates attitudes that shows he is not at all anti semitic.

Can we tell when religions become \\"evil\\"? What are the central claims of religions? Religion professor Charles Kimball attempts to shed light on these questions in his wide-ranging, but ultimately, disappointing.Kimball believes the well-established religions should be respected, despite evils committed in their name, because they all \\"converge in teaching both an orientation toward God or the transcendent and compassionate, constructive relationships with others in this world\\" (p. 39). However, this does not imply that \\"all roads lead up the same mountain\\" (p. 25). Religions may defect from their \\"authentic sources\\" and thus even become evil in several ways. Remember, \\"evil\\" is a moral category not available to relativists.For example, religions may make \\"absolute truth claims,\\" require \\"blind obedience,\\" \\"establish an 'ideal time'\\" (attempt to set up a utopian theocracy), teach that \\"the end justifies the means\\" or \\"declare holy war.\\" Kimball addresses these matters in the context of various religions (ancient and modern), such as providing insights into the dynamics of doomsday groups such the Branch Davidians and the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo, which required total commitment to irrational beliefs that led to destructive behaviors. He also attempts to explore the religious motivations of Osama Bin Laden and his followers, but spends less time on this than expected.Kimball rightly observes that truth claims are foundational for religion. But, he claims that believers err when they hold their religious beliefs in a \\"rigid\\" or \\"absolute\\" manner. So, when some Christians criticize the Islamic view of God (Allah) as deficient, they reveal their ignorance and bigotry. Kimball asserts that, \\"there is simply no ambiguity here. Jews, Christians, and Muslims are taking about the same deity\\" (p. 50). This is because the Qur'an claims that Allah inspired the Hebrew prophets and Jesus. Moreover, the Arabic word \\"Allah\\" means \\"God.\\"Is this true? While Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are all monotheistic, they differ considerably in their conceptions of God. Islam denies the Trinity and the Incarnation, both of which are well-established Christian doctrines. But God cannot be both a Trinity (Christian) and not a Trinity (Islam). This is a matter of logic, not religious intolerance. Moreover, these religions' different concepts of God explain why Muslims and Christians try to convert each other. If mutual understanding is key to tolerance, then disagreements between religions should not be dismissed by deleting \\"absolute\\" truth claims from their \\"authentic sources.\\" It is certainly possible to tolerate someone who holds religious views quite contrary to one's own. America, at its best, excells at this.Kimball wants to soften biblical claims about the uniqueness and centrality of Jesus by saying that they should be taken as pious exaggerations (p. 68-70). However, such affirmations are plentiful in the New Testament (see John 14:1-6; Acts 4:12) and have historically been seen as objective descriptions, not embellishments. The major creeds of the Christian church makes this clear. Kimball seems to be calling for a revision of Christianity's \\"authentic sources,\\" not a return to them. Likewise, most Muslims would reject this kind of revision of the Qur'an. Muslims claim that Muhammad was the last and greatest of the prophets, not just one among many. Being \\"rigid\\" on this doctrine is necessary to Islam. Mortimer Adler's short but incisive study, \\"Truth in Religion\\" (1990), is a better guide on the issue of conflicting truth claims.In addition, Kimball never really faces the possibility that a religion's \\"authentic sources\\" themselves may contain moral and theological errors that encourage evils. He also tends to overemphasize the abuses of Christians--such as the Crusades--while underemphasizing similar abuses by Muslims, such as dhimmitude: an institution that places heavy restrictions on non-Muslims in Islamic nations (p. 201). On this, see the work of Bat Ye'or.Kimball's ambitious book highlights the need to make reasoned and well-informed judgments on religions and their ethical implications. However, we still await a book that adequately handles this controversial topic in the wage of September 11, 2001. A better book on the dynamics of religious pluralism globally is Vinoth Ramachandra, \\"Faiths In Conflict\\" (InterVarsity Press, 1999).Douglas Groothuis"},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Dr. Kimball is a committed Christian; an ordained Baptist minister who teaches in a Divinity school. Part of what he is committed to is the notion that religion should always be a force for good. In this book, Dr. Kimball discusses five recognizable symptoms of immanent or established corruption of religion, which can transform what was good into a force for evil. When one or more of these symptoms appear, corruption is very likely to follow. By recognizing these symptoms, people of good will may be able to take corrective action in time to prevent their religious institutions from turning bad, or, failing that, to turn them back around.The five symptoms are:1. Absolute Truth Claims. Especially dangerous are claims to be the \\"Only True Religion,\\" non-members of which are to be consigned to Hell, and the multiplicity of such claims makes it a certainty that most or all of them are false. Dr. Kimball has \\"always been puzzled and saddened by people who make clear that they couldn't be very happy in heaven unless hell was full to overflowing with people who disagree with their particular theology.\\" (p. 208). The notion that 'we' have a monopoly on the truth tends to lead to (in 'our' minds) dehumanizing 'them,' which becomes a (fallacious) justification for mistreating 'them.' (e.g. the systematic raping of Islamic women in Yugoslavia by 'Christian' men, 'in the name of Jesus,' clearly a gross distortion of Jesus' teachings, which Jesus would have most emphatically denounced.2. Blind Obedience. It is much easier for a religious leader to control the flock if no questions are raised. As my late friend John Metras said to one such, \\"If God didn't want me to think, why did He give me a brain?\\"3. Establishing the \\"Ideal\\" Time. This is virtually always a time far enough in the past that no living person has actually observed it first hand, so claims of its ideal nature will not be subject to eyewitness refutation.4. The End Justifies Any Means. Example: \\"At times, protecting the so-called honor of females and their families becomes truly absurd. Such was the case on March 11, 2002, when fire broke out at a school for girls in Mecca. Male firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene, only to be prevented from entering the building by religious police [because] some of the girls inside were not wearing clothing deemed appropriate in public. Fifteen girls perished in the fire.\\" (p. 141)5. Declaring Holy War. Those who claim a war to be a holy cause \\"distort the very heart of the religion they claim to be defending.\\" (p. 156) Christians call Jesus the Prince of Peace. Muslims justifiably make a similar claim for Muhammad, and Buddhists could reasonably make such a claim for Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha). \\"Healthy religion speaks not of war but the promise of peace with justice\\" (p. 183) Who would [Baha'ullah/Buddha/Jesus/Muhammad] bomb? No matter which prophet's name you choose from the list in [brackets], the truthful answer is the same: \\"Nobody.\\"Dr. Kimball has devoted much of his life to promoting peace, especially in the Middle East. This book is a significant contribution to that effort, and well worth reading.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"The publication of Charles Kimball's book comes a time when the world is on full alert and grappling with the phenomonon of terrorism. Though the current wave of fanaticism sweeping the Muslim world may be the motivating factor behind this latest publication, the premise of Kimball's book is far wider in its reach as he demonstrates how evil throughout the ages has been perpertrated in the name of God and religion.The Five Warning Signs he discusses at length are so basic and obvious they're almost commonsensical. Through much of it, you may even wonder why such a book needs to be written. To anyone who feels this way, my advice is to hang in there. Chapter 7 (&quot;An Inclusive Faith Rooted In A Tradition&quot;) alone is worth the price of the book. Kimball's treatise that all men follow their &quot;spiritual compass&quot; in their quest for God (or the Truth) is the nugget at the heart of the book. It is conceivable that some Christians may feel uncomfortable with Kimball's ecumenical conclusions, but that's too bad 'cos it's the only convincing way of making sense of our multireligious world.&quot;When Religion Becomes Evil : Five Warning Signs&quot; is an excellent book, well written and accessible, and one that deserves to find a wide readership."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"This book was written about religion generally. It goes through the signs of an oppressive or bad belief system. These are belief systems that can influence members to do things which are harmful to society as a whole. In general these groups are the fundamentalist religions. The five items are:1) Claims of Absolute truth2) Blind obedience3) Establish an ideal time (millennium, great cleansing, Armageddon)4) The end justifies the means5) Willingness to wage a \\"holy war\\"As a former Mormon I read the book with real interest and found that Mormonism is 5 for 5."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"When Religion Becomes Evil is an erudite and well written work. This book is a fast read. This is not a historical delineation such as something that Karen Armstrong would write (if you have never read one of her books, I highly recommend that you do). It contains some history but also asks and answers the question, How do we avoid corruption in religion? And, in general, I agree with the conclusion. However, I do take some exceptions with the conclusion.The major basis of religious problems and corruptions has been laid out by Mr. Kimball. But, I feel that there was some room for betterment in the work. For instance, there is little said about pious people's constant need to feel persecuted thereby fabricating martyrs within the faith. In my opinion, this is yet another reason that corruption of faith starts. I also find it a bit platitudinous to simplify the problem to getting back to the roots of the religion's foundation. When a religion is based on sacrament, as the three major conflicted religions are, and that sacrament claims itself as the infallible and singular word of god, a great many followers are going to become zealots. Until we escape the tradition and myth that is religion, this will always be the case. There is no hope for the Arm of God. And, just as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and local exclusionist pastors will always have a major hold over the flock, the Middle East is always going to see exclusionist and zealous leaders come to power who will have enough of a following that is willing to do the deeds of hate. That does not mean that the work of Kimball and others in the Middle East is futile. But, the oversimplified ideal of getting back to the roots is a far more complex and exhaustive effort than I believe is reasonably brought to fruition in any foreseeable future.With that said, this is a strong book that all should read. As one that no longer has any religious convictions (except that religion holds no empirical answers to the question of death), all I can really do is nod as I read his book. The people that really need this understanding are the most zealous religious advocates. Unfortunately, I can hear any pastor I ever studied under when I called myself a Christian preaching to his flock that Mr. Kimball's book is one that is heretical and not deserving of study. Interestingly, this reality is evidence of one of Mr. Kimball's postulated tenants of why religion becomes evil in the first place. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"\\"When Religion Becomes Evil,\\" is a collection of five essays that can help every religious believer recognize five warning signs that indicate that a religion, cult or sect has become demented. The more intolerant the religious teachings, the more exclusive the cultic claims, the more imperialistic a religion becomes, the higher probability that it is heading in the wrong direction; and soon, if unchecked, our world will feel the effects of its evil.Charles Kimball recalls the history of evil that deranged religion have brought to our world.His stories of suffering induced by religious fanatics bring home the importance of this book. Kimball shows how the Crusades of the Middle Ages, the 9-11 attack on the USA, the unabated killing in Israel and Palestine, the mass suicides and attacks on society by followers of cultic, charismatic leaders like, David Koresh, Jim Jones and Asahara Shoko are all integrals to religion(s) gone amuck. The recounting of these world events alone makes the book an engaging read.Kimball favors the major world religions, and especially those that are oriented toward the \\"golden rule\\" and seeking the transcendent. Christianity and Islam get the lion share of the writing, due to their size, world influence, monotheism and their history of conflicts and carnage.His writing is clear, straight foreword, and unencumbered by religious jargon. This is a helpful guide for study groups, for high school and college introductory classes, and for all of us trying to understand the dark side of the world in which we live."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Religion has done much good in many times and places, but it has also been the source and cause of horrible evils. As I write, the world just commemorated the tenth anniversary of the Rwandan genocide where Christian Hutus killed almost a million fellow Christian Tutsis. If you read your papers carefully enough you'll also know of the unfolding genocide in the Darfur region of western Sudan where government backed Muslims are killing fellow Muslims. In 1487 the Aztecs sacrificed 20,000 people in four days at the consecration of a temple. Widow burning, caste systems, female genital mutilation, witch hunts, ritual abuse, ethnic cleansing, suicide bombers, apartheid, murdering abortion doctors---all these evils and more have enlisted religion for its cause.A few years ago Mark Juergensmeyer published an important book entitled Terror in the Mind of God; The Global Rise of Religious Violence (2000). In it he devoted successive chapters to violence by Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, and Buddhists. Kimball revisits the same, disturbing and disheartening theme but takes a thematic approach. Alarms should go off when religion exhibits any of the five characteristics he identifies: fanatical claims of absolute truth, blind obedience to totalitarian, charismatic or authoritarian leaders, actively trying to usher in the end times, justifying religious ends by any means, and any and all forms of dehumanization. We might also add pressure tactics of coercion, deception and false advertisement, alienation and isolation from one's family or community, and any and all forms of exploitation (time, money, sex, etc.).Anne Lamott recounts how her therapist advised her that when God hates all the same people that you hate, then you can be confident that you have created Him in your own image.

Of course due to the topic there is no way he could exhaust this material. His five points are accurate, however I would add FEAR. Humans are inherently afraid. Afraid of the unknown. They crave, seek out religion and a deity to abate some fear.Spirituality is free. religion comes with a cost. a cost of freedom, monetary loss and a loss of indivdualized thinking. Kimball does a good job. Let us cut him slack on not getting it all down. Yes, I agree all religions and individuals who follow,\\"their\\" god are not talking about the same deity. how convenient it would be if that was true.Spirtiuality found me.

Thank God, pun intended, I lost my religion and stayed with my spirtuality.Dan Williams,author of, \\" Above His Shoulders.\\""},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"The author is a professor of religion, author of books on it, and has worked with the good and the bad elements of religions around the world. He's been involved in the process of negotiating with religious extremists that have taken hostages and the like, too. That is, the guy has had practical experiences to draw upon, and he shares them in some detail.He also does a good job of documenting good and evil acts in all the major religions and many offshoots and cults. Even the People's Temple of Jim Jones was shown to have many admirable characteristics. The book also breaks down \\"we\\" and \\"they,\\" giving a complex view of various religious groups, especially Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. (The author makes a case that these 3 are really the same religion.) To a lesser extent, he goes into other religions (and cults based on them), particularly Buddhism and Hinduism. He doesn't just deal with the various religions as monolithic wholes, but breaks them down even further into different traditions. Another thing he explores is how each of these religions has been interpreted in about an infinite amount of ways. People just can't really come up with anything new about these scriptures that someone else hasn't already done before. And the views can be incredibly different.Overall, he tries to maintain an objective stance. His view comes out, but he tries to show how other views come out and seem valid to others. One thing I noticed is that he also ignores certain verses. For example, he listed 2 Koranic verses that command a tolerance of Christians and Jews and even others. I went to the library and looked 'em up in the Koran. Sure enough, the verses say that. BUT when I kept on reading, there were conditions put on it, and it basically meant that they were to be tolerated as long as they lived in submission to Islamic law, however that was interpreted. There were many other verses that promoted violence against unbelievers and those who did not live by the Koran, too.He also goes on how Islam is a \\"religion of peace\\" and mentions the traditional, \\"Peace be unto you,\\" while not exploring that \\"peace\\" and \\"submission\\" pretty much mean the very same thing in the langauge it was originally done in. That is, it's also saying, \\"Slavery onto you that will bring you peace.\\"He does seem to think that no theocracy can maintain itself or be good. And while he lists himself as a Baptist, he sounded like a Unitarian Universalist to me.He also ended the book with a chapter on how to avoid becoming evil through religion. While it was like a nice editorial, it was based on what people SHOULD do. But if people did what they SHOULD do, then the problem wouldn't exist in the first place. But most people don't, and I don't see any reason why they'd start. For changing one's self, great, and I think this book can help understand the various religions and political forces involved with them (in America, the Taliban, in history, etc) a lot better with this book. But while the historical and contemporary manifestations of religious belief were just as hopeful as they are terrifying, I can't say his final chapter made me particularly hopeful. And I'd say it can be summed up real easy with \\"Join a Unitarian Universalist church.\\" (not that he mentioned the UUs.) Then all else he promoted would fall into place. (Technically, one can be Christian or Hindu or even agnostic and still go to a UU church. I should also point out that I'm NOT UU, btw, so I'm not hawking my religion here.)But I do highly recommend the book because I think it does a really good job of explaining the complex forces involved and the good and bad about religion, as well as the danger signs of religion becoming evil. But despite that, I think he has his own rose-colored glasses on, so take it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Charles Kimball cogently organized his symptoms of evil in religion, the five signs to \\"watch for\\". I agree with his analysis as far as it goes, but because of the nature of religion, no religious person would ever think that the standards to which he refers would apply to their practices.It's more important to remember that it is the very nature of religion to be evil, by definition.The only certainty about the nature of God that all religions share is that the material world, i.e. nature, and that would include our physical beings, is a manifestation of God, that God is the creator.As soon as we take one step away from that appreciation we distance ourselves from God. And when religion is based on dim and ancient memories of something that may or may not have happened a very long time ago, an established tradition not confirmed by the realities of God's creations that surround us daily, then we indulge in a very real evil. This happens all too often. A culture's selfish traditions become rooted in that culture's prevailing religion with an appalling inevitability because religion by definition means to \\"hold to\\" -- not to change and grow.Analyze your religion honestly. Just what percentage of it is actually spent in an attempt to experience God, through prayer or meditation? How much of it is social? How much of it is devoted to discussion of God -- and remember, that God can never be experienced through intellectual thought. And how many practices have devolved in your religion which actually do harm to God's earth, whether to other humans, through their death or exploitation, or through a willing destruction of the earth.All of Kimball's five warning signs certainly apply here, but he wields them a little too tenderly to be useful today. All religions need to be called on the carpet all the time."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"A very forthright account of the dangers of religion to the human condition. There are many fine examples by this person of faith (he is a Baptist minister) that illustrate how religion can corrode its members and the society around them. The points are so good that if you are a person of no faith you likely will remain that way.The author is convinced (as most of us are) that since 9/11 we must pay closer attention to what is happening in our religious communities. Unlike the author I am not convinced that religion can extricate humanity from the many problems it has within itself. I feel religion creates boundaries between people. To paraphrase from a book of Thomas Friedman (\`Longitudes and Attitudes') - \`I want to be tolerant, but do you'. I do not get a feeling of toleration when I am standing beside a Mennonite with a Jesus logo or a Muslim woman wearing a hajib. - I get a strong feeling of \`religious advertising'.The author is certainly not one for boundaries or walls - he wants an exchange of thoughts and ideas between all religions which is certainly a noble concept, but perhaps idealistic?Some concepts of religions create boundaries. All religions have a Heaven (Nirvana) and the opposing dichotomy of Hell. This becomes a selective process as to which individuals will enjoy one or the other environment. It is divisive.Also in the last 200-300 years society has had many scientific and social advances despite the resistance of religious institutions. Science and technology have enabled us to explore and travel the earth. Modern democratic countries have allowed and now encourage women to have a much more prominent role in society. But in organized religion, women have been denied any leadership role (except in a few Protestant sects). If religion wants to be considered just and fair it must overcome this grievous shortcoming.The author continually refers to \`sacred texts' - some of which have been used to justify abominable acts - like suicide and murder. Why are these texts considered sacred if they advocate abominations; or conversely; why is a text advocating an evil act considered sacred?I am glad that Mr. Kimball is for the secularization of government - he states repeatedly that theocratic government is a dangerous concept. In the U.S. there has been increasing infringement of religious groups in government. In the last two Presidential election campaigns candidates were repeatedly questioned on their religious beliefs (whether they believed the Bible). I vividly remember Hilary Clinton telling a CNN audience what she prayed for.If only all religious folk could be like Charles Kimball (or Jimmy Carter for that matter) religion would be far more tolerable. Mr. Kimball is most enlightened and searches for the good in all things - he is a pluralist."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"As a seeker of the truth you have to read and listen to everybody's arguments and sides. Reverend Charles Kimball has made an honest exposition trying to save religion from its dark and turbulent past. With all his knowledge and savvy he tried and tried very hard to no avail.Reverend Kimball acknowledges the following propositions:'Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, and others are right to lay out multiple ways religion as an institutional force has been and is now linked with violent, destructive behavior. They present a passionate case against the dangers of organized religion. They zero in on theocratic fundamentalists whose attitudes and behaviors are not too difficult to discern. Many of their key points are valid.''In the end Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins all offer their clear vision of the rational truth, which can set us all free from the collective madness and delusion from which they opine the vast majority of human beings continue to suffer.''As we have noted, authors like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens insist that whatever value the religious traditions may have provided in the past, they have outlived their usefulness. They argue vigorously that deep loyalty to particular religious traditions inevitably feeds a kind of tribalism that is at odds with global cooperation; it is kindling that fuels an impending conflagration as civilizations clash. Our investigation lends credence to these concerns if the dangerous and violence-prone corruptions of religion remain unchecked.''Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and others speak to and for a substantial minority when they reject virtually all traditional understandings about God and religion. And they offer compelling arguments that high moral and ethical standards do not require belief in God or a religious foundation. 'Based on his own writing there is no need for religion except that of pursuing tradition. On the other hand Reverend Kimball asserts that, 'Conversely, blind obedience is a sure sign of corrupt religion. Beware of any religious movement that seeks to limit the intellectual freedom and individual integrity of its adherents'' Well, if I recall Christianity ask us to have blind faith and blind obedience to Word of God, which is in The Bible. Therefore Reverend Kimball's position is a one of circular logic.After reading this excellent book I find a great writer joining the rank of the Apologetics in a newly form dimension. One of honest exposition of historic facts and other people's remark with a twisted interpretation trying to ignore the obvious reality of religion for the sake of tradition, 'A strong case can and should be made, however, for the continuing importance of the major religious traditions. These traditions have served millions of people extremely well throughout much of recorded history. They contain time-tested wisdom and provide the frameworks for ethical and legal systems. For the vast majority of people worldwide, their religious tradition'like their family, tribe, or nation'anchors them in the world. Religious traditions provide structure, discipline, and social participation in a community.'My questions for the readers and for Reverend Kimball are the following:How are we going to handle all the violence emanated from religion in the past, present and future?Are we willing to continue instilling ignorance in the World?Are we willing to let this fanatical ignorant people to cause more mayhem in the World?Don't we have bigger problems that can be handled by ethics and fairness in the world?Are you people willing to let socialism remerge in the World?Religion is a bad meme using good things such as fairness, integrity, honesty, human dignity, service, growth, patience, nurturance, and encouragement as bait and hook hiding its self feeding violence nature!I do not agree with Reverend Kimball's ideas. However, he wrote an excellent book that deserves to be read and analyzed."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"When Religion Becomes Evil makes a deep journey into the worlds different religions and the human attributes that corrupts them with lethal consequences. I found the first six chapters to be deeply enlightening and they contain important warnings about how a religion turns evil. In detail Kimball analyze the problems of Absolute Truth Claims, Blind Obedience, Establishing the \\"Ideal\\" Time, The End Justifies Any Means and Declaring Holy War. He put forth examples of how Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Hinduism all falls victims to these problems. These chapters are really important for every person living today to read, our future might be depending on it. In fact, some of these warning signs can be used when analyzing secular ideologies as well.Even if he claim to be a Christian, Charles Kimball have taken the step to discover and analyze all religions, especially Islam. He picks up phrases from each of the religions to strengthen why certain behavior is simply wrong based on that specific tradition. We need more people like that, people who are able to distance themselves from their religions to study other perspectives and focus on religion as a whole rather than seeing the world from a religious perspective.There are two major problems with the book however.In Chapter 2: \\"Absolute Truth Claims\\" Charles Kimball speaks out against using specific passages to make destructive points, yet Charles Kimball uses the SAME selective cherrypicking when he uses specific passages to speak out against violence and injustice. This might soften up fundamentalist who are locked on the destructive passages in each book, but it's not a solution. What this does is to place scriptual passages on a scale then trying to decide which passage is more supported by scripture. This is not a guarantee that the \\"good\\" passages will win. Everytime you tell someone to follow the words of scripture there's almost a 50%/50% chance they will pick the bad passages over the good.Finally the seventh chapter is alien after reading the first six. The seventh chapter is about sharpening the role of \\"autentic\\" religion. After reading to the first six this came out as a dissappointment. What this does is to strengthen the religious apartheid or tribalism that leads to the very consequences he warns about. Charles Kimball's own approach to religion is comparative religion, not Christian. When he urge people to authentic faith he suggests to NOT do what he have done; to compare religious traditions. Instead he urges people to keep true to whatever their current religion is as long as it's \\"autentic\\". As a result they will not learn anything beyond their own scripture. They will not spend the time learning about others, nor consider them part of the same family. They will believe they are the \\"autentic\\" ones and the rest are not.Faith is an almost magic word. Maybe we can say that we instead of having \\"faith\\" in God or scripture, we can have \\"faith\\" in humanity and the planet itself. Consider to have the world as your culture, mankind as your people, a library as your scripture and doing good as your religion? Should'nt we instead of making our own religious island \\"autentic\\", use the wisdom of both the Bible, the Quaran and all other important writings through history? Should'nt we give equal time to people like Mahatma Gandhi instead of prophets like Jesus who actually did say \\"Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword\\". Those passages wont go away. For every good passage in the bible and the quaran there are several bad ones that suggests the direct opposite.Here's my suggestion: Love humanity with all your heart, all of your soul and with all of your power. Your nation is the world, your group is humanity, your head is your church, human culture is your culture, human history is your history, human scripture is your scripture. Learn and listen. Your understanding of others is your moral compass."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"This is an excellent book... reviewing the dangers of Fundamentalism in the 3 monotheistic religions and a couple of others.

Earlier 2002 editions of Kimball's book remain online and even in some bookstores - but you definitely want this latest version. If you're planning a class and telling folks to go get this book - make sure you alert them to look for the 2008 edition.And, second, now that we've got this well-known crop of writers known by the short-hand phrase \\"new atheists\\" (writers like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens) - the title of Kimball's book might easily lead readers to lump it into that crop of strident anti-religion books. In fact, Kimball is trying to save us from the dangers of malignant religious groups - so the noblest and best in religion can continue to thrive. In this new version of his book, he even analyzes the new atheists' work and points out the dangers in their strident approach to these issues.What is this book? Well, after 9/11, Kimball was a very important voice, helping Americans to sort out the warning signs that lead people into extreme and, in some cases, deadly religious groups. And, no, he doesn't argue that any single faith is inherently evil. His examples circle the globe. He points out that almost any faith can be sidelined and reshaped in evil ways to serve as fuel for pent-up anger and violence.His \\"Five Warning Signs\\" are: Groups that push absolute claims to controlling \\"Truth;\\" groups that require blind obedience of followers; groups that claim to have special knowledge of an \\"Ideal Time;\\" groups that argue their \\"End\\" justifies the use of any means; and groups that actually call for various forms of \\"holy war.\\"Here's what's so valuable about this book: It's not ground-breaking research presented for scholars. It's a book for readers like you and me - people who urgently want to make sense of these dangerous forces in our world and who want to reclaim the healthy core of faith to make the world a better place. In fact, Kimball is building on a wealth of already existing scholarship in sorting out these principles that we can use to analyze groups that may be as close as our own communities - or may wind up in headlines from distant parts of the U.S. or the world.In addition to the overall revision of the text -- the new edition includes an interview with Kimball in the back of the book. It's interesting, although it's not a big revelation, in itself. In fact, I wish it actually had been an interview rather than a fairly formal Q and A written a little too carefully, I think. I would have preferred more of a \\"Kimball-Unplugged\\" approach to the Q and A.There's also a helpful Reader's Guide here. I wish the Guide had been structured differently to really help small-group leaders break the book up into weekly sessions. Instead, the Reader's Guide simply raises a series of questions-for-reflection about each chapter. That's helpful, but there are so many more creative things group leaders can do to bring this book to life. I think groups should plan to use the book over a two-month period in 8 or 9 sessions. You'll find plenty to talk about in these challenging issues raised by Kimball. Then, add weekly activities to the class. You could add a couple of documentaries to supplement the book. Or, for instance, you could invite your class to scan headlines during the week that might illustrate points you'll be discussing. That makes for a fascinating group study combining Kimball, scriptures and headlines - and you'll have trouble stopping the discussion each week.This is a terrific tool for everyday Americans to dig into these urgent issues and walk away with a helpful toolbox for assessing these forces that are all around us in the world today."},{"Title":"When Religion Becomes Evil: Five Warning Signs","review":"Kimball provides an excellent historical comparison of the major religions and the similarity that exists between them while recognizing the differences which set them apart.

I have just ordered a copy from one of the sellers, and even though I'm 33, I'm going to read it the second I get it!"},{"Title":"The Dragons of North Chittendon","review":"I really can't find my copy, but I suddenly got nostalgic and had to look for this book! This was my FAVORITE when I was a kid, and I have nothing except fond memories of Arthur and his experiences in this beautiful story. I recommend this book to any child who loves fantasy or just a really charming story. Out of all the books I've read (and there are a lot) in my life, this is the one I always come back to in my memory when someone asks me what my favorite book is.Edit (2009): FOUND MY COPY! After buying a replacement, too! I'm rereading it as soon as possible. It's still my favorite story from when I was little. I remember finding it in a secondhand bookstore and falling in love with it. I even did several book reports on it and forced my English teachers to read it, too.I don't agree with the critics' reviews. As an aspiring novelist, I see their points, but as a kid at heart, I see nothing wrong with the characterizations or setting. The story is written for children, and it is what it is, and fulfills what it sets out to do: it creates a wonderful story about dragons and humans in a quiet American setting, with some beautiful original mythology about the moon that has stuck with me over the years, and the characters (Mordechai!) are unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Dragons of North Chittendon","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend back in the 5th or 6th grade and have been looking for it for years now! I couldn't remember the authors name or the name of the book, only some of the details like the white queen, a dragon race, very few if any humans, moon dragons. Finally, I did a search on Amazon for books on dragons written prior to 1997 and it came up. Please do write a sequel, I'm going to order this book now."},{"Title":"The Dragons of North Chittendon","review":"It had adventure and was entertaining. I couldn't put the book down.

I gave the text two stars to at least acknowledge what information I did gather from it."},{"Title":"Underwater Navigation","review":"Although this book provides some very useful points in underwater navigation, I found it disappointingly sparse. I was expecting a more substantial study of marine topography and how to apply it to underwater navigation. Instead I got brief explanations of 'Eleven Keys to Natural under water Navigation' (Chapter 1) all of which my dive instructor covered during my open water certification. In all fairness to the authors and their expertise, this is a fine book as a general overview of underwater navigation and compass use, with tips for night and wreck diving. If you're looking for an in-depth manual, as I was, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Underwater Navigation","review":"I have been an avid diver for many years; it was a pleasure reading this navigational guild! The book covers all the basics of underwater navigation, plus it gives a more detailed description to the nuances of the underwater world of navigation. I highly recommend this book if you are at the least bit intimidated by scuba navigation!"},{"Title":"Underwater Navigation","review":"'Underwater Navigation' shows the Way By O. Annette MakinoIn November of 1997, International Marine Publications Systems published a handy little soft cover book called &quot;Underwater Navigation&quot; by C. Royer &amp; M. Scott. If getting lost while submerged is your thing, you should pick up a copy of this guide. Both authors, Royer and Scott, are experienced divers with Royer being the veteran with 32 active years in and under the water. To- gether, these two divers have published a most useful book for anyone wishing to orient them- selves in the field of underwater navigation. Divided into six chapters, the book starts out by offering &quot;Eleven Keys to Natural Underwater Navigation Among the &quot;keys&quot; are land marks. The authors claim that &quot;One of the most useful techniques in un-derwater navigation may be finding an underwater landmark.&quot; This should be comparatively simple, providing conditions are favorable wherein visual marking can be detected. However, this may not always be an option, they caution, since prob-lems such as low visibility caused by currents or rain- storms may impair the view. Another key cited is the &quot;Bottom Contour.&quot; This pertains to canyon arches and rocks which can be helpful in determining landmarks and such. Some dive locations may have a distinctive canyon with which you can readily identify. On the other hand, they suggest that one can also create their own landmarks. Among the ways this can be done, they suggest creating a pile of rocks to mark a location or using floating markers. Among the other keys mentioned are &quot;Reading the Bottom,&quot; &quot;Light&quot; and &quot;Phototropism,&quot; or the depth at which various plants are found. Experienced divers often note the time it has taken them to get from one point to another. Depth is another good indication of the direction you are going. Believing that even if you know where you are while underwater, ! it is no guarantee that you will know how to get back, the authors fully advise the use of a compass. In fact, they have devoted a complete section to it in Chapter 2. Even a novice should be able to get around while underwater. Among the cautions the authors offer is one, which certainly makes a lot of sense: In order to help keep your direction, simply descend facing in the direction you want to be traveling. Once on the bottom, they suggest that you check your compass to see if you are still facing the desired direction. In Chapter 3, they concentrate on &quot;Applying Navigational Skills&quot; starting off with &quot;Dive Patterns&quot;. As such they suggest the &quot;Square&quot; pattern, the &quot;Triangle&quot; and then, &quot;Out and Back,&quot; the latter being the easiest and often the most practical pattern to use. The other chapters cover &quot;Dive Planning&quot; and include areas such as &quot;Navigating at Night,&quot; &quot;Navigating Through Wrecks,&quot; and &quot;Navigation in Low Visibility.&quot; While covering the area of navigating through wrecks, they caution that once you go through a door or hatchway, you must make sure that the entrance stays open. They even suggest tying it off or wedging something into the space between the door and the jam just below the hinge. Of course, the best method is to simply remove the door. When diving in low visibility areas, they warn that since there are fewer references to guide your way, you should remember the technique for the proper use of a compass. In Chapter 5 called &quot;Applying Navigational Skills,&quot; they offer suggestions for retrieving lost items, even of your own that may have fallen off your dive boat. Search patterns are recommended such as &quot;U Patterns,&quot; the &quot;Expanding Square&quot; and a &quot;Circular,&quot; among others. If you've actually found an object Underwater, they suggest using the &quot;Triangulation&quot; search pattern, as it's a good technique to use in order to find tha! t item underwater again. The last chapter called &quot;Navigational Technologies&quot; delves into the high-tech future. It is here and now, they claim. Some of the high-tech devices include sonar and digital compasses. However, with the latter, you first have to know how to use a regulation compass. Once that is mastered, you can graduate to the digital which is more accurate. Enhanced with illustrations, charts and photos, divers who often end up lost and stymied underwater should certainly consider picking up a copy of this useful navigational guide."},{"Title":"Underwater Navigation","review":"What a wonder book! Even as an advanced diver I found this book to be insightful. Giving many clues to the sometimes allusive under water navigational realm.I think the authors have done a great job laying out, in layman terms the navigational map to underwater navigation. This book is a must have for diver of all levels of training."},{"Title":"The Banished City","review":"Character development! Remember the best thing about the first Star Wars' movies? You cared about each and every character, and the settings were so fresh, the plot explosive, interesting, and fun. The Banished City is sci-fi for the larger audience just like the original Star Wars. While reading, I kept trying to cast it without much success. The reason? A role from The Banished City, is meant to make a name for a new actor. The book is that good! Cast an unkown. No problem. This book, and hopefully future movie, carries itself, and any decent actor can sit back and enjoy the ride. Kristan Korns, hurry up with your next book."},{"Title":"The Banished City","review":"Korns has given us the ultimate in fantasty fiction with a complex plot and landscape inhabited by well-developed characters with subtly manifest yet dramatically effective powers eminating from an unusual source--a script, or system of writing. The implication here is profound for fans and writers of this genre alike--writing IS the empowering thing! I also appreciate the purity of this work in that it eliminates all cheesy, marginalizable gimics such as non-human or half-human Yoda-types and goes directly to the gods. As in Greek and other great mythology, it is MEN VS GODS that makes this such a rewarding read. Dense and fast-paced! Witty!"},{"Title":"The Banished City","review":"Somewhere between Pratchet and Tolkien is where you'll find Korns, although not alphabetically. He has given us a solid, likable main character, a well-defined world and a marvelously complicated plot. I liked the functional perspective on magic and practical gods. One memorable laugh comes near the end when the protagonist refused to take a message to the local deity because priesthood is a capitol crime. This book will take you on a great trip and not loose your luggage on the way."},{"Title":"The Banished City","review":"Imagine \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" but written in a high-fantasy version of cyber-punk. This book has it all: clever casino heists, Nazis chasing after magic artifacts, double-agents and double-dealing, and a cynical young hero with idealistic goals.Don't get me wrong: it's fantasy, through-and-through, with exotic locales, heroic escapades, gods, dagger-wielding assassins, and magic as thick as butter. But the heart of the novel is film noir. It's a mix I've never seen before, and Korns carries it off brilliantly. The writing is excellent, the plot moves briskly despite its byzantine complexity, and the characters are intelligent adults with mixed motivations and all-too-human flaws.If you like Lawerence Watt Evan's \\"Esthar\\" series, you'll love this story. The only thing wrong with this book is that it is languishing at Lulu instead of burning up the charts at Amazon."},{"Title":"Journey To Cherry Mansion","review":"I enjoyed Zeiss's first historic novel. His depiction of 'real people' and their struggles to perform a patriotic duty (General Will Wallace and Ann), as well as live a life that involves love, challenges, and a desire to fulfil a complete life brought home a message of who we should be and how we should carry on with strength and dignity. The description of each character enabled me to 'feel' the environment in which each participated...the strong and the weak."},{"Title":"Journey To Cherry Mansion","review":"Tony Zeiss is a friend, and &quot;Journey To Cherry Mansion&quot; is his first novel - after having written several interesting, inspirational and informative business related books. Not being a civil war enthusiast, I did intend to at least review the book for my friend, by scanning every other page or so. However, starting with page one, I read not only every page, but my eyes were glued to every word. I didn\`t want to miss a thing. This is one of the few books I found impossible to lay down.With this wonderful, exhilarating life story of Civil War hero, General Will Wallace, Tony Zeiss has found his niche in life. Tony compels the reader to anxiously move toward the next page, knowing that more dramatic excitement is just around the corner. His obvious attention to detail and research and his rebelling against the use of sex and violence to hold his reader (he used damn twice and dammit once), is most unusual among contemporary writers. But, the book is also one of intense and beautiful romance, a love story told in a way that grasps and holds the readers attention down to the last word on the last page. This book is indeed superior to many that attain the New York Times Best Seller List. I would love to have the movie rights. My wife and I bought 25 copies (she is as excited about &quot;Journey To Cherry Mansion&quot; as I am) to proudly give out to our friends. And I expect we will need 25 more before Christmas. If his very busy schedule will allow, and if he so desires, Tony Zeiss is destined to become known internationally among the top historic novelist. In summary, THIS GUY IS GOOD!"},{"Title":"So Rarely in Our Skins","review":"I happened to hear this poet read a couple of years ago in Prince Edward Island and I was so impressed I bought his book. The freshness of voice, the skill with which he casts idiosyncratic forms of feeling, and especially the humour I remembered from the reading are all present in these remarkable poems. The range of the work is really quite incredible, ranging from genuinely moving to the playful to the playfully obscure. These poems constitute a blast of fresh air through the stuffy classrooms in which most poets tend to ply their trade. The best poetry I've read (or heard) in ages. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity","review":"This chemistry text was easy to understand and well written.

Good clear explanations. In re one of the previous reviewers comments, I do agree that some answers were wrong. The problems given in the book were of average difficulty, perfect for an average chem student."},{"Title":"Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity","review":"Overall, I didn't especially like this book. I used it in high school AP chemistry for an entire year.First of all, the hardcover edition is very heavy and generally cumbersome to use, and i'd definately recommend buying the paperback edition. The book attempts to cover a huge amount of material, which is overwhelming, and it is too much to cover in the course of one academic year.The content of this book was of average quality, but at times confusing. Many of the explanations provided seem to require a background in chemistry--not a good thing if this is the first chem course you have ever taken. But if you've studied chmistry previously, this book should be fine, provided that you understand how to do basic calculations using conversion factors and mole ratios.I was sometimes confused by the more complicated topics. In some cases, the explanations of the topics were fine, but the examples problems went above and beyond the basics, which was confusing. Other times, the explanations were unclear but the examples were fine. Generally, I was able to understand the concept in the end, but at times it was frustrating.The thing that bothered me the most about this book was that some of the most basic formulas were not explicitly stated. The book would show you how to derive the formulas and do a number of complicated calculations, but the formulas themselves are not always right there, in bold print. I'd be sitting there trying to do my homework, and i'd have to go searching back through the text to find the formulas, which was annoying. I'd recommend writing the formulas out seperatly, of using one of those quick-study guide things that fits into a 3-ring binder.Also, beware, some of the answers in the back of the book are incorrect and/or don't match what's in the solutions manual."},{"Title":"Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity","review":"I never had interest in chemistry (and probably never will) but I found this book easier than most. By easier I do not mean that there is not much content, but the way of writing and the explainations are given in simple terms, making it better than most books. Many concepts which were greek to me were easily understood, and the excersises were designed to make a person think and apply knowledge. It is a good book, but then again, unless you're interested in chemistry this book won't magically pour knowledge of chemistry into your head. All this does is make you learn chem the way it should be learned, by understanding and applying knowledge. Among most of the chem books i've come across I'd rate this as one of the best."},{"Title":"Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity","review":"This is not a bad text chem book compare to Akin Matter and changes Chem text book. I have used both text books, and I have just completed Chemistry series courses. I have gone through from page 1 to the very last page 1125. Koz is much better at drawing VSEPR orbital than Akin. Chapter 11 on organic is not bad, but very unorganized. But, quite frankly most text books are so bad at explaining things. Them authors are just dancing around the topic without telling you the $1000 keyword that student needs so desperately. Yeah, you high school teachers go ahead and flame me. Let me just test you, given a weak base and titrate with strong acid dropwise. Can you do it ? Find pH in case you don't understand. Solve Zn/Zn2+ (.2M) // AgS, S anion(.2M) system. Can you do it? Solve for E? You should get atleast %90 correct repeatability with other similar problems because these kind of problems have 50/50 chance of getting correct.

She has found this to be enjoyable, but the absence of any danger in her life has left her bored and looking for a way out. Aslan offers an irrisistable chance to be a part of an academic envoy to Beluchad, where she is to foster trust and communication between the interdependant native species and the offworlder trade companies with her harping and singing. She quickly gets sucked into taking sides in the trade war that errupts between the Yakara an the Chave that has jepordized the existence of the native culture.Jo Clayton has always amazed me with the characters and worlds she creates. This book is no exception. I felt the same wonder as Shadow when she heard the Eolt sing. The references to past events and characters ties this story into the overarching context of Shadow's adventures. Shadow's ability to laugh at herself, and Jo Clayton's ability to spin that tale without getting preachy is what brings me back again and again to this particular character. I find it easy to relate to Shadow and frequently live through her eyes.

This anthology grew out of a conference bringing together both academics studying neopaganism and magic, and practitioners, and has an excellent balance of both in-depth scholarly analysis and an insider perspective - or several considering the diversity of the contributors.I know it will probably draw the ire of those who expect all pagan books to be dumbed down to a remedial-reading level - and it appears it already has, looking at at least one of the reviews already submitted - but for educated and literate pagans, works like this are a godsend, and I hope to see many more of them in the future."},{"Title":"Pagan Pathways, New Edition","review":"At the time this book was published in 1996, Graham Harvey and Charlotte Hardman were both lecturers in religious studies at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.

It is polytheistic, recognizing a plurality of divine beings... It sees the material world and its laws ... as a theophany, a manifestation of divinity... Finally, Pagan religions recognize the female face of divinity, called by modern Pagans the Goddess.\\" (Pg. 34)\\"Some modern Pagans even call their way the path of 'individually experienced religion.'\\" (Pg. 37)\\"...most modern Pagans claim Celtic origins for their tradition...\\" (Pg. 49)\\"Some other Heathen groups have expressed concern (and considerable opposition) to Edred Thorsson (at least partly) because of his status as a leading member of the Temple of Set, a 'Satanist' organization.\\" (Pg. 58)\\"The role of women is important in all modern Pagan traditions. Women are usually seen as essential in the priesthood.\\" (Pg. 84)\\"Paganism is not so much a set of beliefs as a way of relating to the world.\\" (Pg. 153)\\"Pagans tend to associate New Age with the marketing of spirituality but there is undoubtedly a commodification angle to the current pagan Celtic scene.\\" (Pg. 249)"},{"Title":"Pagan Pathways, New Edition","review":"The first thing you need to know is that this is a re-release of \\"Paganism Today\\", by Charlotte Hardman and Graham Harvey, that was originally released in 1996.

Then let us assume that it is in any organization's best interests to eliminate all limits to effective communication, cooperation, and collaboration. If you accept these two assumptions, then you will share my high regard for this volume in which Mankin and Cohen offer a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective four-phase \\"action framework\\" to achieve \\"collaboration [as well as communication and cooperation] across time, distance, organization, and culture.\\" To their credit, they concentrate almost entirely on explaining HOW to apply basic principles, citing benchmark examples which include the John Deere Construction & Forestry Technology Program, Radica Games Group, and Solectron Corporation.Obviously, all organizations have boundaries and many of them are essential to achieving success. For example, non-negotiable values to which everyone involved is held accountable. Without appropriate behavior, there would be chaos. Also, there are limits on available resources which means that priorities must be set and then served. No organization can afford to be everything to everyone associated with it. Boundaries are inevitable. That said, Mankin and Cohen assert -- and I wholly agree -- that there is an interdependence of structure and relationships which can enable any organization (regardless of size or nature) to collaborate effectively, and do so \\"across time, distance, organization, and culture.\\" The core concept of this book is a metaprinciple which is explained in Chapter One. With exquisite care, Mankin and Cohen use an especially apt metaphor -- jazz -- to illustrate how the metaprinciple provides the \\"theme\\" and the action framework (please see pages 5-8 and Chapters Seven and Eight) provides the \\"score.\\" Extending the metaphor, Mankin and Cohen urge their reader to use the theme to improvise on the framework and create collaboration within her or his own organization and such efforts will \\"transcend all boundaries to produce deeply fulfilling performances.\\"Not all of those who read this book will be willing and able to make and then sustain the commitment required. It may be helpful to recall Henry Ford's assertion that, whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.If you share my high regard for this book , please check out Arthur Rubinfeld and Collins Hemingway's Built for Growth: Expanding Your Business Around the Corner or Across the Globe, W.

These collaborative enterprises can be extremely complex. This book explores what these collaborations look like, the challenges they face, and how to make them work. Based on analysis of three case studies, the authors present an action framework to guide executives in building such collaborations. The challenge is to manage complexity so that it enhances and energizes the collaboration instead of destroying it. Success hinges upon the people and the nature and quality of their interrelationships and interactions, the key to which is structure: well-defined roles, expectations, responsibilities, decision-making processes, and the like. Structure offers a zone of stability within which complex collaborations can develop and successfully function. Three-quarters of the book presents and analyzes the cases, offing many insights. The action framework is formally presented in the last two chapters."},{"Title":"Business Without Boundaries: An Action Framework for Collaborating Across Time, Distance, Organization, and Culture","review":"There are plenty of general management advise titles on the market today, but a few stand out from the crowd as specific guides for working establishments - and Don Mankin and Susan G.

And that is one adaptation of Coyote stories, if a bit shallow. This is another adaptation. Coyote is in a way the eternal Id, similar in some ways to another Warner Brother's personification of the id: Daffy Duck. Stories have to touch emotional chords to survive. Stories are the software of a culture, perhaps its highest art forms. I used to see the Ramakrien danced, as a kid, overseas, one can see The Nutcracker danced at Christmastime, in the US in the same way. Coyote is Homer Simpson on steroids. He is a very entertaining teacher. Will Rogers used to say that some people learned by reading books, but not many; some by learning from the mistakes of others, but not many; and most people have to learn by peeing on the electric fence for themselves. In the stories, Coyote is the one with the electric fence, so to speak. Native American worldviews are radically different from White Man culture.Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony With Earth Mother, Book 1 (Bk.1)gives some idea of what that life is like.Whispers of the Ancients: Native Tales for Teaching and Healing in Our Timegives some idea of the radically different use of story by indigenous cultures.House of Shattering Light: Life as an American Indian Mysticgives another taste of how different stories are, for native peoples. This book is a safe sort of buffet offering of elements of a very different culture. It's worth it. I never knew Wile E. Coyote had such great depth of character.Coyote TalesCoyote: A Trickster Tale from the American SouthwestCoyote: A Trickster Tale from the American Southwestare others that flesh this out. Hearing Coyote tales from a Native American storyteller is great, too. I heard Dovie Thomasson tell a Coyote story, years ago, I think she is of Kiowa Apache lineage. Her group only tells Coyote stories in the Winter. When she was young, she tried to tell a story out of season; a white faced bumblebee stung her in the throat, and she had to stop. She later mentioned the story to an elder, who said oh yes, that story is protected by the white faced bumblebee, that is one you really don't want to tell out of season. I would not be telling Coyote stories out of season, myself. It is important to respect the culture that birthed a story. Tom Brown, Jr.,The Trackercalls himself a Coyote teacher. This is a different kind of teaching, one of giving just enough information to fascinate a child, so the child goes off to learn for him/herself, and them comes back for the next step. Sometimes children find better answers than the adult had. This is a Westernization, but a necessary Westernization, of teaching stories. Recall that the Br'er [Brother] Rabbit stories were all teaching stories. Br'er Rabbit and the Tar Baby is a story about the cycle of revenge, which happens out of consciousness. The story brings it into consciousness, so the cycle can be interrupted. This is a useful lesson. The Bible is full of similar metaphors, as Neville Goddard points out, but Western literalist exegesis ignores this. When you read the Coyote stories, look for the metaphor. If you need practice in this, google the story of Jumping Mouse, by Hyemoyohsts Storm, the metaphor is very easy to see in that story. Metaphor speaks to the deep mind. COyote stories are not easy to translate, just as Australian Aboriginal stories are not easily translatable. This book does rather well."},{"Title":"Coyote Tales from the Indian Pueblos","review":"This anthology of 15 cautionary tales for Pueblo children--of allages--focuses on the antics and exploits of a typical figure inthe American Southwest: Coyote. Native American Aesop, thisstory cycle depicts the protagonist as wily, greedy and vain--exhibitng the foibles so typical of human beings. His repeated downfalls and frequent failures are examples of what to avoid or how Not to handle various situations. In general it is his vanity to improve his appearance, or his greed for other folks'property or food which result in his deserved come-uppance.Like these animals' ability to regenerate themselves after fatal disasters, these tales are timeless and universal in their appeal. Whether variants of one tale or adopted from outside cultures, COYOTE TALES will entertain and enlighten those wise enough to recognize the moral behind the clowning.

Kurlansky is able to easily shift from the history of the Dutch settlement to oyster taxonomy and classification to recipes for oyster stew.

And to do so while telling a story that is consistently entertaining, often funny, and frequently surprising is an amazing talent.

That's exactly the problem. The book is overflowing with details. For the first time in many years I felt I was reading a history assignment - hence the title of this Review.I did glean many interesting facts, both big and small. Trouble is, the facts just keep coming. As other reviewers have indicated there are numerous recipes in the book but I would venture to say that most of them are for food historians, not chefs. One brief example is the following recipe: \\"To Roast a Leg of Lamb with Oysters. Take a Leg about two or three Days kill'd. Stuff it all over with Oysters and roast it. Garnish it with horse-raddish.\\" Yup! That's the whole, succinct recipe.I'll admit that the number old prints reproduced in this book are interesting. But unless you are of the scholarly type I'd save this book for a night when you have insomnia."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"BIG OYSTER is Kurlansky's latest food-themed history (following his previous COD and SALT). It differs from his previous books in several ways, but still serves up a tasty morsel.Although the title and cover suggest that the book is about oysters, it's actually a history of New York city--the choices and, in particular, the (hindsight-only) mistakes in handling the environment that transformed Manhattan island and its surroundings from pastoral beauty to modern Gotham. Today, New York is the very totem, the very image of \\"city\\". This is how it got that way--through the eyes of the oyster.As a book, it's an interesting read. Kurlansky's scholarship and research are excellent and we get telling anecdotes and solid detail throughout. The titular bivalve, though, sometimes goes missing from sections or has only a peripheral connection to much of the text. At the end the author notes that the book was adapted from Sunday supplement articles and it feels stretched. That's too bad, because it's still a good read and a pleasant diversion. (Don't think I'll try the 17th Century oyster recipes though...)"},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"Mark Kurlansky has a knack for writing about meaningful food histories (\\"Cod\\" and \\"Salt\\" precede his new book, \\"The Big Oyster\\") and much of his new work is as fun as the others. Kurlansky offers a somewhat zig-zagging tale of the forward march of the oyster, most of it revolving around the history of New York.Who would have thought that a writer could fill 280 pages of prose related to this delectable bivalve? Well, the answer is that while the author does tell much about the oyster there are many oysterless pages in evidence, somewhat stretched out by accompanying recipes. \\"The Big Oyster\\" is a book that is often in search of itself. It occasionally gets sidetracked in telling about the growth of New York, resulting in the unfortunate oyster sometimes getting pushed off to the side. However, Kurlansky is at his best when he gives reference to Oyster houses, floating wharves and markets and how the oyster became such a staple of both rich and poor. The demise of the New York City oyster beds (the last one closed in 1927) may be a depressing thought for most readers but Kurlansky heartens us by his providing readers with evidence that the waters around New York are cleaner now and that the oyster may one day return.Kurlansky is terrific at explaining the anatomy of an oyster and how it lives. I didn't know that the oyster is the only mollusk that doesn't move around.... once it attaches itself to an object it remains there for the rest of its life. He's also very good at tidbits of trivia. I hadn't realized that for most of the nineteenth century the Hudson River was know as the \\"North River\\". These small \\"eye-openers\\" give the book lots of color.\\"The Big Oyster\\", as well as its predecessors, are enjoyable books about subjects one might otherwise not think about reading. Had the author not jumped around so much and kept the focus on his bivalve, he would have had a more streamlined book. Still, \\"The Big Oyster\\" is worth the read. I wonder if Kurlansky is already dreaming up a book on the history of caviar...."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"I wish I could be more positive about a history of one of my favorite foods. I eat oysters on the half shell whenever I'm near a coast, I make oyster stew regularly, every Christmas my turkey gets oyster dressing ... So I'm partial to oysters. And I'm partial to Kurlansky, too. I thought both \\"Salt\\" and \\"Cod\\" were examples of great writing, not just great food writing; great because they took mundane subjects and turned them into interesting literature. \\"The Big Oyster\\" could have done the same thing for bivalves.Why doesn't it get more than three stars? Too many mistakes. Some are little, quibbling mistakes, like his claim that the word \\"ecology\\" was not in use in 1891; Ernst Haeckel coined the term in 1869, and it was in widespread scientific use by the end of the 19th C. Others are more significant mistakes, like attributing invention of the telegraph to \\"Samuel T. Morse,\\" and giving the same Morse credit for sending the first transatlantic telegram from Delmonico's in 1861. The telegraph, as most third-graders used to know, was invented by Samuel F. B. Morse. (Googling \\"Samuel T. Morse\\" produces only a reference to a 2001 lawsuit, filed in New Hampshire by the estate of one S.T. Morse, regarding some allegedly shoddy construction.) And the first transatlantic telegram was sent in 1858, not 1861, by Queen Victoria, not Samuel (F.B. or T.) Morse. The second, more successful transatlantic telegraph was constructed in 1866.The worst mistake, however, is using the phrase \\"it was only a theory\\" when writing about Pasteur's work. To say that an idea is \\"only a theory\\" raises all sorts of red flags to scientists, indicating that the writer's grasp of the scientific method is perhaps somewhat tenuous. By the 1880s the germ theory was just that: a well-tested, widely-accepted explanation of the cause of disease.\\"The Big Oyster\\" is, like Kurlansky's other works, well-written and easy to read. One might wish, however, that his research was a little better this time. It makes the observant reader wonder what other mistakes the book might contain."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"This book is absolutely captivating, with a perfect mix of New York historical references and oyster science. I'm from the Hudson Valley and like to eat oysters so this book was perfect for me. But don't think this is a stuffy history lesson. The author dishes up the history, the people, the oysters into a lively story that surprises the reader with word pictures of the times that seem so alive. He writes almost like a historical novelist. And the story itself is full of beauty, destruction, tintillating gossip and a sad ending. I'm not so sure I really want to eat oysters anymore, especially if they are from New York. I would read more from this author though."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"I'm not sure what kind of person would buy this book. It's not 100% history, not 100% science, not 100% recipe, it's a little of everything. After reading this book, I'd say this book is for someone who's not afraid to try something different, some who likes oysters and a little history to go with their oysters. So what is this book about?1) It's a little bit oysters. The science: such as scientific names, reproduction, anatomy, etc. Just a little, not too much to bore the casual reader, but not enough to interest the casual scientist. I tried to find more about oysters online but there's not a lot of info, I suppose I should go read a book on it.2) It's a lot about the early to mid-1800's history of New York City. As I like history, I really liked this part.3) It's a little about oyster recipes. Sprinkled throughout this book are recipes, many from old books and from famous cooks and restaurants. That's a gem. It must have take some effort to collect the recipes and whether you like them or not they are interesting, at least for their historical aspect.4) It's a little about the history of the oyster trade. This is a very good part of the book as I don't think you could find much written on it anywhere else.5) New York society in the old days. Talked about the who's who and where they would eat. Interesting reading.6) New York slums and the inhabitants, also interesting reading.So to summarize, this book is about oysters, the eating of oysters, the oyster trade and New York city. You can't pidgeonhole this book because it's not history, not gastronomy, but a little of everything. It's quite well written and very easy to read. I enjoyed reading it, a break from my regular diet of thrillers. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I'm going to get Cod and Salt, two other books by this author that got mixed reviews. But I think the author deserves my custom after this book."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"First off, I am a chef...so my five-star rating might be taken with a grain of sea salt. Also, I am a chef from New York City...who still opens a couple of hundred oysters a week.I learned bunches from Mark's book. I was able to justify a long held stance about storing oysters in the face of superstition from my twenty-something rock-star staff.I owned a restaurant in Telluride, Colorado back in the 70's. We dug around in the basement and found menus from the 1890's that featured fresh New York City oysters.....long before refrigeration. The book reveals how this worked, and consequently saved me a few hundred dollars every week. Five stars indeed1Meanwhile, Mark gives an in-depth sociological, geographic and gastronomical account of how the oyster affected life in New York and America. In many ways the oyster is the canary in the coal mine of our inland waterways. If the oyster is happy with the water....you are probably OK with the water. No oyster.....don't even think about jumping in. Oysters kept New York City harbor water clean for millenia....until overwhelmed by chemical pollution.Just this morning I picked up Mother Jones, and read an article about the largest oil spill in American history: in Newtown Creek between Queens and Brooklyn. Having read Mark's book....I already knew the history of Newtown Creek...once the source of millions of oysters and the support of an entire social structure.Oysters had started a comeback there in 1997. Ooops. Back to the drawing board.Buy the book. Learn something."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"As a practicing malacologist, I generally avoid reviewing books in my field on Amazon. However, The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell by Mark Kurlansky is less about oysters as invertebrates, but rather, it provides an oyster's-eye view of the evolution of modern New York City. The author makes a strong case for the importance of Crassostrea virginica in the sociological and economic development of the Big Apple: All the major events in the city's 350 year history can somehow be related to peoples' insatiable desire for oysters.The style of The Big Oyster is more typical of a travelogue, but instead of adventuring across space at a particular time, Kurlansky is moving along the time line of a particular place. (And, really, Relativity says that this contrast doesn't actually exist: Space... Time... What's the difference?) One could take any number of paths through the history of New York, and this book happens to follow oysters. The author, though, is adept at finding intersections with other topics, and besides covering oyster preparation (with lots of recipes), oyster harvest and the oyster market, such interesting but disparate topics as Native American relations, transportation, prostitution, pollution and Diamond Jim Brady all find a place in this tale.While I would not recommend The Big Oyster to students of invertebrate zoology on the basis of the book's biological merits, I found it to be an interesting and entertaining read. The Big Oyster left me craving both a plate of raw oysters on the half shell and more to read by Mark Kurlansky."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"At first it seems curious that Mark Kurlansky would want to write a history of a city and its residents whom he so thoroughly dislikes. Then it becomes clear that the protagonists are the oysters, not the city or the people, and those oysters would still be doing just fine if it weren't for the depredations of civilization. Eventually you get caught up in the saga, but it's a little thin, so the author adds copious amounts of non-oyster New York City history. This part will seem somewhat duplicative of \\"The Island at the Center of the World,\\" but it's almost as interesting the second time around. Then, just as you start taking him seriously as a historian, Kurlansky starts making the kind of egregious factual errors that throw his scholarship into question. On page 15, for instance he states that humans evolved 65 million years ago. Wow! The earliest hominid fossils date to about 2 million years ago. His disregard for science continues when he erroneously asserts that recapitulation is a \\"well established principal (sic) of evolutionary science.\\" Actually it's a captivating, but long-debunked theory. Errors like these make us much less receptive to the hundreds of casual facts strewn throughout the book.Here's a sincere tip for the prospective reader attracted to the book's subtitle, \\"History on the Half Shell.\\" The entire story of the history of the oyster in New York City is contained in chapters 6 and 8. Of course if you want to read all about the gangs of New York, or the biography of Diamond Jim Brady, by all means, read the entire book. But the problem with reading the entire book is the turgid march of one colorless sentence after another. Any single page of Henry Thoreau contains more entertaining prose than Kurlansky's entire book.Kurlansky repeatedly refers to New Yorkers' gluttony: \\"The two most common gastronomic observations made about nineteenth century New York were that the oysters were cheap and that the people ate enormous quantities not only of oysters, but of everything.\\" That is Kurlansky's typical characterization of a New Yorker. Yet not one of the old photographs or pen and ink drawings illustrating the book depict a single obese person.Overall, this is one of those badly written books about an interesting topic. If distilled to its essence, it might have made a good article in the Atlantic Monthly or The New Yorker. It will not make you thirst for Kurlansky's other books, \\"Salt,\\" and \\"Cod.\\""},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"I bought this book halfway as a joke for some oyster-loving friends, but it turned out the be a great page turner -- finished it in about 3 sittings.

Shall we be trotting home again?\\"But answer came there none-And this was scarcely odd,because They'd eaten every one.'Such was Tweedledum and Tweedledees discourse to Alice in Carrolls' well known work.They'd eaten every one, ah yes; a common lament of oyster lovers everywhere because the once abundant stock in New York waters are essentially gone forever.The Big Oyster, a work of enormity with regard to the tiny creatures history, and a good one at that, is fantastic.The greatness and economic well being,the essence of affordable sustenance for both the poor and the rich of early New York and also the world began with the bottom dwelling,succulent mollusc called by science, 'Crassostrea Virginica' the most popular variety it seems.Kurlansky has put together a comprehensive and at times a jumpy but focused history of a sometimes gritty New York as a city and its environs in relation to oysters as a leading core of its burgeoning greatness.From the first encounter by Henry Hudson to the local Delaware indians,the first New Yorkers by rights, thrived on them as evidenced by the enormous piles of shells found called middens, to the developing cultures that dominated for a time only to be replaced by yet another country and culture.These aspects right up to the revolutionary war and beyond is clearly examined and dissected.Millions,probably billions of oysters were there for the taking and we made sure we took and took and took some more, depleting a natural depository which spanned hundreds of thousands of years to develop.It seems that New York harbor and the surrounding waters were paradise for them to live,breed and provide us with an abundant, almost unlimited cheap resource.The downfall was man and his pollution,greed and population growth which unfortunately did away with this perfect food harvested in New York waters we now view as a delicacy.Everything you need to know about the oyster from its anatomy,harvesting preparation with an abundance of recipies I'd never try,shucking, promotion and distribution world wide and locally, as well as an enlightening,colorful and comprehensive history of New York is presented here.You will finish this book far more informed than you began and quite possibly know darn near everything there is to know about early New York and the Oyster that made it famous.You will be drooling for sure.I had recurring dreams of two dozen on the half shell which would not abate until I got them,wolfed them down with the pleasure only a fellow oyster eater would know after a prolonged absence from our little friends.I did have one little exception which was amusingly disturbing. Kurlansky states that George Washington's thirty four year old son Philip was placed in charge by him, to redistribute New Yorks' property following the end of the revolutionary war.George did no such thing and by that time both of Washington's adopted children were dead.He never even had a relative called Philip.What happened to the fact checking prior to publishing? Good lord, for a writer of history this could end a career as a reliable source. It can only lead to suspicion of all your other works and their accuracy. I don't have time to check other items as I hear there are other discrepancies as well.Please be carefull in the future Mark.However,aside from the above, I will still recommend this book for its novelty.It's a joy to read from an oyster lovers perspective. As a New Yorker, our city's history is also refreshingly enlightening.My home town of Staten Island is clearly represented and I can only hope that the abundance that once was will one day return to its sandy ground former glory.As a New Yorker reviewing this sometimes gritty and hardscrabble history, I'm not ashamed to say,pushed my thoughts toward the Oyster Bar and Grill for its variety and notoriety. But, to truly enjoy my treat closer to home I make a beeline to Lobster House Joe's where I can relax with a couple dozen on ice with horseradish and an ice cold beer.Nothing can match it.After reading The Big Oyster the compatriotism is quite evident and allows me to savor them even further.The book is quite thorough and worthy of purchase. If you live in New York, buy it to learn your city's history. If you like oysters, buy it to widen your knowledge. If your both, lucky you.This is just what you need after a long day at work.Keep the history alive and keep eating but not too much!To make extinct our local favorite, Bluepoints, would be too much to bear.

This book is a lively and engaging social history of \\"the greatest city in the world\\" and the oysters that in many ways made the city what it is but have since been forgotten."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"Mark Kurlansky blends two great histories: New York City and NYC's Oysters. In addition to in-depth research on both the city and oysters, maps show the New York City area, verbatim diaries, journal writings, book excerpts, and authentic oyster advertisements of the day. Even recipes for \\"oyster pie\\" and oyster soup and numerous other oyster dishes from those times are included. You will learn the evolutionary strengths and the anatomy of oysters.This Kurlansky's style brings the city residents, the eaters of oysters, workers who gathered them, and the restaurants and food stands that sold them. The reader can go back in the past and relive New York back in the days when the Dutch controlled it. The laws, taverns, population, and rural aspect of then-Manhattan come to life. And you learn than oysters are not only durable but pretty intelligent, considering that they are, well, bivalves.With the popularity of oysters and the harvesting came the necessary rules of who and when they could be harvested, and territorial areas were legally assigned by the local governments then. New York and New Jersey had to co-operate on who could harvest where as certain areas were disputable.*The Bronx borough was named after a Swedish-born sea captain named Bronck.*The Battle of Brooklyn was the largest land battle of the Revolutionary War.*In 1773 there were 396 Taverns in Manhattan*In 1750 NYC was the leading American city for oyster and alcohol consumption.*Gangs such as the \\"Swamp Angels, Dead Rabbits, and Daybreak Boys\\" fought lethal and violent battles against one another, and gang fights could involve 1,000 gang members in the fights.*The 1863 anti-draft riot involved 50-70,000 rioters with killings, torture, gangs, and burning.*Oysters can live without water for days, and even longer if sprinkled with oatmeal for food.*The word \\"cookies\\" comes from the Dutch word \\"koeckjes\\"As for lifestyle, Manhattan was not as austere as the Puritan areas to the north, thanks to the first controllers, the Dutch. Captain Kidd lived in Manhattan was a celebrity there. He went up to Boston where he was arrested, sent to England, and hanged. \\"Boston, was never New York.\\"Not only were oysters ubiquitous in the vast waterways of the entire New York region, but they were very affordable, provided protein and food for the poor. All classes frequently ate the oysters.The book ends at present day, and many of the oyster beds (and numerous fish species) have succumbed to the toxic chemicals and pollutants. Environmental groups in the latter 20th Century did take action against the most blatent offending companies polluting and even cited some of the oldest environmental laws on the book dating to the 17 and 1800s.A quick, upbeat, writing style supplanted with lots of research and stats. This informative, well written and enjoyable read by Mark Kulansky motivates me to read his other works."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"When you think of a place you've visited, do you think of the big sights? Or do you think of a memorable meal, or the smells, or the people with whom you sat, elbow to elbow, in a crowded neighborhood restaurant? In The Big Oyster, Mark Kurlansky looks at the history of New York City through the eyes (ahem) of the noble bivalve, and those who loved it -- perhaps a bit too much.From the beginning of the settlement on Manhattan Island (when oysters as big as dinner plates could be pulled from neighboring shores) through the Dutch colonial days, the growth of the city (and its appetites), marine commerce, and the pollution of the industrial age, Kurlansky demonstrates how a natural resource influences the character of a place. He also shows how the oyster's decline and renewal helped raise awareness of the city's effects on the marine environment.I liked this book because it evokes the atmosphere of rough-and-tumble New York in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Kurlansky describes what life was like for normal people at a time when oysters were a major food staple and commercial enterprise. The maps and drawings provide fascinating images from the oyster's heyday. Although this book is not an addictive read, the prose is informative and humorous, and the topic is well-researched."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"All kidding aside, this is one of the most interesting history books I've every read.

This book was a very pleasant surprise.This book covers the biological, economic, and regional historic aspects of the oyster.

It's mistakes like this that make me leary of all the other information in this book. Grant you it is an easy read, fast and entertaining but when he says things like Only MEN did the shopping at the NYC City markets it made me roll my eyes in digust. Sure they did. Sure. Where is the primary documentation on that and may other things he states as fact? If you look at all the references they are secondary sources. This is not a work of scholarship just a lot cute stories of NY thrown in with some half truth stories smartly told."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"New Yorkers laugh about the pollution in the East River and Hudson and seek to escape to the pure air and water of countryside -- oblivious that New York City sits on an estuary that at one time was one of the great natural wonders of the world. Kurlansky focuses on oysters -- especially plentiful off of Staten Island and where the East River meets the Long Island Sound. Until the early 20th century, New York boasted the best and most plentiful oysters in the world. But oysters live by filtering seawater and need unslimy rocks or other objects on which to attach -- so the pollution of the harbor just killed things.Oyster were also plentiful in the Great South Bay on the south shore of Long Island. At one time millions of clams were available there as well, and I can remember digging buckets-full of clams with my feet as late as the 1960s and mid 1970s. But that industry too died completely. The last time I saw the Bay not one clam boat was visible.This tendency to foul our own nests is chilling -- especially if we are doing the same thing on a global scale via air and water pollution.Kurlansky makes his point vividly and effectively. I could live without some of the trivia re oyster recipes. But the book reads well."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"Pizza's, weiners, and spagehtti, but seafood? Before reading this book I had no idea that anyone (except the indians, and we all know what happened to them)aite anything from the waters around New York. Between the street run off, the overflowing sewers and being well chummed by the remains of mafioso, it was inconceivable that the waters of NY were at one time one of the most productive estuaries (where fresh water mixes with salt water)in the world. But as soon as the New Yorkers realized it, they started in true New York fashion to destroy it. Seemingly as fast as they could. It only took them about 300 hundred years and did not let outbreaks of oyster related cholera and other diseases stop them. It is no wonder that most NY oysters were cooked. Only the brave, ignorant or suicidal would eat a sewage marinated NY oyster raw.These are only a few of the facinating facts that you can rake out of this interesting book. I found the segments of NY City history facinating too. Read this book then watch Scorsese's Gangs of New York again. It will give you new insight into a period of our nation's largest city."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I drove my co-workers crazy with numerous quotes from the book. As a New Jersey native (you know the wetern suburb of NYC) I really found the history amazing, we did not learn these things in school.I remember many many many years ago wandering in various parts of the neighborhood and digging/unearthing oyster shells... Collecting the unbroken smashed up ones and bringing my bounty home. Always wondering how sea shells, got there? Well, perhaps now, finally, after 50 years I have an idea.What I found most delightful about this writer, is his way to meander, at just the right pace; so as not to bore me, loose me, but guide me from one step to the other without a stark transition and a feeling of disruption in the calm, relaxation this book provided."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"This is an eye-opening book about the bounty that surrounded New York in the early years of the city, amazing for those of us who grew up locally in the pollution and grime of the late 20th century. For oyster lovers, the story is even more heartbreaking, as oysters used to be available for 10 cents each as opposed to being flown in from far-off lands for many times that. But, it is fun to consider all those oysters and the recipes contained in the book. I think I'll stop by the Oyster Bar the next time I'm in town!"},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"Who would have thought it possible that anyone could produce a great book on the humble oyster?

Americans are among the world's biggest producers and consumers of oysters, which played a huge role in the growth of New York city and the young republic.I found \\"The Big Oyster\\" so well written and enthralling that I read it cover to cover, and then went out and bought every book written by Mark Kurlansky. As a voracious consumer of books, it was a wise decision!I highly recommend this excellent book to anyone searching for a great read!"},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"Kurlansky's books, all three on food, Salt, Cod, Oyster are so full of pearls of knowledge one contantly asks through a read, 'who would have thought? and exclaims, 'why I didn't know that!' What a great way to spend one's time immersed in these seemingly obscure, yet ever present subjects. Highly recommended, entertaining and easy reading."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"The Big Oyster is an excellent history of New York City. Unlike many of Kurlansky's books, which always kept the spotlight on the subject (like cod and salt) and its role in history, The Big Oyster often strays far from the oyster. Many of the tales of NYC, from business and prostitution to transportation and development have nothing to do with the oyster. Had this book kept the focus on oysters it would have been much shorter.If you know what you are about to read ahead of time you might enjoy it immensely. This is more a book about New York than one of its early exports and favorite delicacy."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"For centuries New York was famous for its oysters which played a hue role in the city's economy and culinary fame. Oysters were the city's most celebrated export, a staple food, and more, and THE BIG OYSTER: HISTORY ON THE HALF SHELL celebrates this era, from food markets to the extinction of natural beds around the city as the decades passed. From cultivation techniques to recipes, THE BIG OYSTER weaves the story of oyster farming and dining into the greater history of New York to provide a lively culinary and cultural expose.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"I love oysters, and New York history, and was looking forward to this, but as other reviewers pointed out simply has too many mistakes to be taken seriously.I will add to the list:a. he claims Robert Fulton invented the submarine. False. There have been many variations of submarines hundreds of years before Fulton, and one of the first military uses was during the American revolution.b. He claims the New York delegation didn't sign the Declaration of Independence.That's what did me in. Anyone who let an error like that slip through shouldn't be writing history books, even about oysters. I hesitated to finish it because he lost all credibility with me and the last thing I want to do is read mis-information. I can't believe that someone published a book with so many sloppy mistakes...............He also tried to impose modern new york and his cosmopolitian outlook/multiculturalism on the past, which I found inaccurate and annoying. For example he points out Stuyvesant required chapel, banned alcohol and other measures, and goes out of his way to mention that how bad it was...he skips the fact Stuyvesant was effective in turning the colony around, precisely because he took such measures.It may offend our modern sensibilities, but reality is reality."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"This book is as entertaining and informative as Kurlansky's other tomes about food items.

This is normally the kind of book I eat up (pun intended). He has done his research, and if you love New York or oysters or both, you will find a few gems in this book. Unfortunately, Kurlansky's writing and story-telling skills are so lacking that the book reads like a middle school history text: this happened, then that happened, etc. In the hands of John McPhee, this would have been a fascinating read, illuminated with big characters and portentous actions. Instead, it's all shell and very little oyster."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"This is a fact filled book about New York and it's love of Oysters.

Mark Kurlansky makes the ancient city and state of New York, from Indian Oyster fishing grounds to the era of Diamond Jim come alive.Generally if you like one of his books you will like them all, but do be aware this one is a TINY bit more history and less \\"yum\\" than some... and intensely focused.

The Other two were &#34;Salt&#34; and &#34;Cod&#34;. If you like history from another perspective you'll love this view of New York's history from that of the Oyster, its rise and its downfall.The same meticulous detail exhibited in Salt and Cod are found here and Kurlansky is a great story teller. You'll love it."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"How in the world can a book about humble oysters be this interesting? Because \\"The Big Oyster\\" is not really about oysters so much as the history of New York City, where oysters were a food staple for hundreds of years. They sold for as little as a penny apiece and were enjoyed by rich and poor alike until the sewage and industrial runoff of the rapidly-growing metropolis finally poisoned the oyster beds.In telling this tale Kurlansky rolls out innumerable fascinating facts: New York was discovered and colonized because the Dutch East India Company sent Henry Hudson on a voyage to discover the mythical 'river to China.' Hudson sailed down the eastern seaboard until he saw the wide waterway that would later bear his name. Alas it ended a bit short of Shanghai.The island of Manhattan was commandeered by the British Navy during the Revolutionary War and used as their base of operations. The prosperous settlement was sacked and burned and reduced to a population of just 12,000. Many of those were escaped slaves who thought the Brits would set them free. That was not to be, and many Africans were shipped off to sugar cane plantations in the Caribbean.The French preferred their oysters raw. But in New York they were more likely to be stewed, pickled, fried, baked or smoked. And almost all the 19th Century recipes cited in \\"The Big Oyster\\" called for a liberal dose of nutmeg, the fashionable condiment of the time. Don't know about you but to me the pairing of oysters and nutmeg sounds absolutely nauseating.Oh, and one more thing. Did you know that a good fresh oyster is still alive when you eat it? Creepy but true.Kurlansky paints a grim picture of man's careless destruction of the oyster population. But, apparently, some of the beds have been restored. My wife and I just returned from NYC, ate raw local oysters every day and enjoyed the hell out of 'em."},{"Title":"The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell","review":"The history of New York City and the history of the oyster in our harbor, all tied together.A fascinating and fun read.

Apparently, I developed a little crush on the bivalves -- not in the gastronomical sense; I've never eaten one -- because when I saw The Big Oyster by Mark Kurlanksy in an airport bookstore, I snatched it up.It's an entirely fascinating account of the evolution of New York from under-populated backwater wilderness to the bustling world capital of today (easy Paris, it's just one of the many) as seen through the rise and fall of oysters -- both as source of commerce and item of (over)consumption.Kurlanksy also wrote1968: The Year That Rocked the World, which I liked, andSalt: A World History, which I loved, and it follows a similar pattern, using a quirky single subject to dissect history and bring it to life. In Salt, his scope was global, but in The Big Oyster, it was narrowly focused on New York -- with a few excursions in time (to ancient Greece) and place (London, Paris, etc.). The author has found a style that works for him and does a masterful job of weaving together an oyster-based narrative (how often can you use that qualifier?).I haven't spent too much time in New York, but even as a casual visitor I got a guilty thrill when a street name suddenly made sense or I recognized some historic figure -- like Dickens -- noshing oysters in a dimly lit oyster house cheek to jowl with rough necks and prostitutes.Ultimately, this book feels like a cautionary tale, tracing the degradation of habitat that ultimately destroyed the oyster beds -- along with a significant line of business -- and changed the eating habits of an entire city. I'm not sure even the best, most long-sighted urban planning could have preserved the pristine waters and farmlands of New York as it grew into a behemoth, filled with millions and spitting toxins and waste into the once clear, bio-diverse waters, but it's certainly fun to think about.The only criticism I have is the page space spent on historic recipes. It was interesting enough to see the changing writing and cooking styles from the earliest days of America to the present, but once or twice would have been fine. Since the scope was less culinary, I would rather have seen more of the historic details and his unique insights and less about the care and cooking of oysters. That's just me being greedy though.This is a fast-paced, engaging and rewarding read filled with \\"oh, that's why!\\" moments, so if you like oysters, or New York or history well-done, give this a try."},{"Title":"Gregg College Keyboarding & Document Processing (GDP), Take Home Version, Kit 1 for Word 2003 (Lessons 1-60)","review":"Part of the kit was missing and seller never answered my e-mails."},{"Title":"On the Brink: The Great Lakes in the 21st Century","review":"Dempsey's research is simply breathtaking and mind boggling. He presents the history of the Great Lakes from the opening of the book which takes place 50 years in the future, into thousands of years in the past. We learn about the explorers we only know today because they have cars named for them. We learn of the ordinary people who have helped preserve this resovoir of 1/5 of the worlds fresh water supply. We learn about the fragile life forms that hug these ancient and majestic shores. But the real excitement is found in the book itself that reads at times like a 'page-turner' of a novel. We see how political expediency wins time and time again against the pressures of modern day life and industry. We are made to understand the trust of stewardship that has been placed upon us to preserve these marvels of nature, and most importantly, why. Personally, I was left aghast at how quickly various species of fish and aquatic life could, and have, disappeared forever. Others that have gone to the brink and returned and others that still hang on balanced on the precarious beam of nature.

Summarizing a history of the Great Lakes' environmental exploitation and gradual recovery, and blending in thoughts on the poetry, folklore, inspiratioon derived from the Great Lakes as well as citizen action to preserve them, On The Brink brings true environmental history to life in an exciting manner that challenges the reader to get involved and join the fight to protect a national treasure."},{"Title":"On the Brink: The Great Lakes in the 21st Century","review":"Dave Dempsey's book, On the Brink: The Great Lakes in the 21st Century, is a comprehensive history of the environmental challenges the Great Lakes have faced since cities began to sprout on their shores in the early 1800's. Dempsey records an encyclopedic account of the unrelenting assaults on the land, water and wildlife of the region. I was alternately fascinated by the stories and repulsed by the effects of so much wanton exploitation.Of course, there are stories of hope as well as degradation. Stories of national parks created and environmental laws passed through the actions of responsible citizens. That, in the end, is Dempsey's message: challenges remain, the lakes are in peril, but hope endures as long as people are willing to take action.The book is so comprehensive that at times I found myself wishing it dealt more thoroughly with a topic. On the other hand, there are some obscure stories I've not seen elswhere that I would have hated to miss. At times it can be a challenging read, but overall it's an engaging tale, and well worth the effort."},{"Title":"On the Brink: The Great Lakes in the 21st Century","review":"As a sailor on Lake Ontario and a concerned parent and citizen this book gives you a great history and status of the condtion of the great lakes from an environmental viewpoint.

This book is not as misanthropic as what most contend, it is written in an amazing way, and to say the least is one of the most unstable books I have ever read.

The form -that is, the voice of the narrator- comes out forceful, original, scathingly funny; the story is nonexistent. One goes on reading while the narrator's absurd rantings and decision-making are enough to grab one's attention and interest, but there's a point when the reader has to say enough: where's the beef? If the writing is top quality, the way the soul and sick mind of the character gets poured into the pages of the book, there has to be a purpose, a plan, a plot of some kind, but there isn't. One wakes up to this reality at about the middle of the book, 200 pages through.So the author draws this punk from the 20's (who can easily be identified with any punk of anytime), who is sick of the mind, as he himself admits, and has him play his rants and jigs in very different kinds of scenarios: the 1st World War, the French African colonies, Detroit... and we readers watch and laugh while the dude acts up. And it works, as a 200 page divertimento, but then the dude comes back to France, finishes his medical studies, which seems to be one more of those incongruous things that happen so often in the story and which one lets pass if just for the sake of not spoiling the fun, and the dude then suddenly leaves the scenario as he introduces other characters. And the reader has to wonder: I have accompanied you all the way to this point because you were funny -stupid, but funny, even though there is no such thing close to a plot in your story, and now you intend that I keep reading while you slip off.The author writes with an ease that is astounding, but it cannot make up for the inconsistencies and feebleness of the story, at least not for 400 pages."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I still love this book, although today it is a bit harder for me to accept his message.

Celine is a world class thinker and writer and belongs in the Pantheon with Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe, et al.This book is nothing less than a seminal work of art. I agree with everyone who says Burroughs, Heller, Roth, Vonnegut, Bester, Kerouac, etc., owe a profound debt to Celine. Celine is Dostoyevski on pot. He has reason to be angry but one ends up appreciating his humor...And yet Celine is no misanthrope. He tries to understand what drives his characters to such depths.If I were asked about the genre, I would call it a picaresque novel. Think Voltaire's _Candide_, but this time throw him naked into the nationalistic darkness of World War I, European Imperialism and its greedy reach into the African Heart of Darkness, and Chaplin's assembly line satire \\"Modern Times.\\"Ouch!"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"when i try to come up with novels that i enjoyed more than &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot; only &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; by Marquez comes to mind. i can't help but think that a few others may slip past Celine as well but they do not come easily to mind ... so many books, so many years, etc. i will never understand the intensity of scorn that some feel towards this novel, though i can understand more easily the ill feelings some may have towards Celine the man. read the book, your public library and amazon.com are filled with gems ... this is one of them :)"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"\\"The plain truth, I may as well admit it, is that I've never been really right in the head.\\" This is perhaps the most authoritative truth, plain or otherwise, disclosed in this wending, scabrous, semi-autobiographical novel. For one thing, it's very funny, as a great deal of the first half of the novel is, because nobody is really quite \\"right in the head\\" in the hopscotch view of the world presented to us in these pages. It is a bit beyond me what is so terribly shocking or even captivating about this book, especially the second half, after narrator Ferdinand Bardamu returns from his gallivanting to France, settles down to become a doctor and carries on an odd sort of friendship with Robinson whom he met in the war. Really, this second half contains nothing \\"shocking\\" or literary, nothing that can't be found in a modern day soap opera, but our gracious author feels compelled to bang on about the same nihilism and pointlessness in life for two hundred very boring - Yes, boring! - pages. Is it really so great a revelation that men behave quite beastly to each other quite often, or that a great deal of our time is spent thinking about carnal acts, or that we all grow old and die? But, back to the first half of the book, and its splendid, alternately riotously hilarious and beautifully poetic prose. This section I would recommend to anyone. The section on the boat trip to the tropics alone is worth having to slog through the second half. And once our narrator arrives, he sparkles with observations:\\"It is hard to get a faithful look at people and things in the tropics because of the colours that emanate from them. In the tropics colours and things are in a turmoil. To the eye, a small sardine can lying on the side of the road at midday can take on the dimensions of an accident.\\"And, contrary to contentions that this book and its author are somehow the anti-Proust, this claim is only true on the most superficial of levels. All the deeper truths about life, all the philosophical and poetical asides that make the book half worth the reading of it are echoes of Proust. Reader, is the following passage from Celine or Proust?:\\"You can lose your way groping among the shadows of the past. It's frightening how many people and things there are in a man's past that have stopped moving. The living people we've lost in the crypts of time sleep so soundly side by side with the dead that the same darkness envelops them all. As we grow older, we no longer know whom to awaken, the living or the dead.\\"It's Celine of course, but any reader who has read Proust would have a very difficult time indeed discerning any difference. I could cite any number of other instances, but this one suffices as representative for this review.So, summing up, the great thing about Celine is his humour in the first half of the book. The rest is unoriginal and repetitive. There's a rather teenage locker room mentality about those who claim otherwise. \\"Ooh, he said that!\\" etc. are what their superficial plaudits amount to in the end. All one has to do is to look at the authors who claim him as an ancestor, such as the pretentious Will Self, to recognise this rather obvious don&eacute;e of the book and its admirers.\\"So the earth makes its way through the vastly menacing, silent night.\\"Or, as an American soap opera title puts it:\\"As the World Turns.\\""},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Voyage au bout de la Nuit is a haunting masterpiece. It is impossible to finish this opus without having its images prance through your mind- his first encounter with Robinson during the war, his time in the psychiatric center in Paris to be cured by &quot;patriotism&quot; (of all the cures out there), his amusing boat trip to Africa, his riverboat captain who remitted his earnings in the colony to his sick little niece in France whom he had never met and the spellinding denouement of the journey. The character studies that appear in this work are of the same high quality as Balazac- Celine's brilliant sarcastic sense of humor brings a ray of light to the darkness of the work. He seems to always make just the right observation in every scene. As bizarre a statement as it may be with respect to a work by Celine, there were moments where I could not help myself from laughing aloud. The recurrent themes of the night, travel and Robinson (I am still not sure if Robinson was real or a product of bardamu's delerium), provide a coherent structure that is internally consistent for a book that at first glance seems devoid of any structure. A number of the criticisms of this book on this site missed the mark. One reviewer complained the story lagged after the African part. I would agree that the most entertaining part of the book is the African section and World War I (Celine's descriptions of this war are even better than Remarque's), but the &quot;journey&quot; could not end there because Bardamu had yet to learn anything about life. It is not any single experience, including the finale, that taught him life lesson's, but by observing people and most importantly, following in the steps of Robinson. As for those who point to Celine's cynicism and utter pessimism, I think they read a different novel than I did, because Bardamu, in my estimation, wanted nothing more than to find more meaning in life than he did. I would strongly advise people who read French to read it in its original language, since word choice and style are so important for Celine. Journey to the End of the Night is a book that I will be able to pick up time and time again to reread even just a few pages at a time with a wry smile on my face."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I forced myself to finish this book just to burnish my coffee house credentials.I think it's a matter of personality. I can appreciate the book, but I'm simply too optimistic and well-adjusted a person to ever be able to say that the book's negativity genuinely reflects the way I think or feel. Celine is basically saying, with a certain amount of humor, \\"Look, everyone is a s***. Look what bastards they are. It's ridiculous.\\" And to a degree, \\"Poor me.\\" But I recognize that there is some wit and artistry to the book.Why is Celine so disappointed in his fellow man? I think the answer's obvious. It's a matter of expectations. Deep within his heart lies an unabashed love for nobility and aristocracy. A nobility he finds practically nowhere in real life. I'm not saying he's correct. But that is my explanation for his misanthropy. Rather than flee from the vulgarity, he embraces it and creates an artistic testament of it.I think that, artistically, a work this negative needs a certain amount of humor, sarcasm, farce, wit, whatever, to make it worth the reader's while and generate interest. In my opinion there is some of that here, but not enough. After a while this novel became a real chore to get through. Though I recognize that this might not be true for a reader of the work in French, since the inventiveness of Celine's writing style in French provides so much variety.Anyway, that's my justification for the book. But it's entirely possible that I am wrong, and that he was just a vulgar clown with a talent for wordplay.In my calculus, among French works of a similarly negative spirit,Rabelais > Celine > Camus."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"This piece of translated French literature is not easy to read. It asks lots of questions of the reader who has to work hard to decipher the text. But this is a reflection of the original. The French text is difficult to read, and requires input from the reader as well. Stick with it, because it is a literary masterpiece, unveiling a world that is not normally available to an English audience."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I am reading &quot;Journey&quot; for the third time, after it spent three years on my shelves. It still explodes with inimitable flames of sardonic humor. I am sending it to a friend who can appreciate the deadly verbal fusillades that Celine so deftly casts at the mediocities and selfishness of modern society."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"By far the greatest novel of the past 2000 years. Celine transcends his time and place by writing in simple, dynamic prose that does does more to bare the human condition than anything ever writen. The book can be summed (although you should read it, repeatedly) by one line from its riveting conclusion... It isn't (an obvious reading) a broadside against love; rather it a crystalization of Celine's hatred for the lies and eception that have come to constitue modern (post 1890s) life. In a nutshell, it is Celine's opening salvo against the comfort of illusion. This novel, if you give it a chance, will absolutely change your life. It is the most compassionate black comedy ever written (a genre occupied (untill &quot;Journey&quot;) only by the Bible!!!) Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine said of all the novels and writings he had done he would save his beloved 'Journey', and burn the rest...Journey is indeed a creative diamond of a work, distilled down from 1000's of pages of notes Celine wrote one of this centuries most powerful, inventive and inluential novels... Whether Celine's telegraphic style or his blackened pessimism will appeal to many readers is another matter. For those readers who find personal dislike of the author's tone or take offence at Celine's personal life ,Journey will seem to be merely the vulgar ramblings of an angry disillusioned drifter...these readers should look somewhere else. For those readers who willingly climb on board open minded and free of prejudice Celine offers up an often hillarious, sad, pathetic world ; his style moves from heights of beauty to stinging condemnations, verbal wit ,riotous colour and often overlooked subtlety saturated in pathos...What may seem impossible to some readers is that Celine's misanthropism is grounded in a tongue-in-cheek humanism, a saddened resignation in man's intolerance, vanities, and follies... in fact, more in line with Balzac and Stendhal than Miller or Bukowski... Celine's creations fit well into Oscar Wilde's definition of perfect art, where all critics and public violently disagree and invoke debate."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I'd recommend this book for anyone who's truly interested in 20th century literature precisely because it's so harsh. It's the greatest adolescent rant ever written, but there's more to it than that. It's an incredible antidote to nice middle class literature. If you want a &quot;nice&quot; story don't read it. I can understand the reluctance to accept an author known for his anti semitism and fascist sympathies. Nevertheless nasty people sometimes write great books and this is one of them."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"There is nothing like an amateur critic of literature to 'attempt' to debase one of the most important books of the 20th century. It is obvious that he is incapable of truly understanding what Celine was trying to state in his book. This book was not \\"revolutionary\\" in the sense that it wanted to eradicate modern society for a better social ideal, it was only revolutionary in the way it changed language, which by now, after having his ideas pilfeered again and again, seems so standard. He then goes on to state that there are \\"no commendable sentiments expressed\\", what exactly does that mean? I could go on and on but I suggest he stick with his prosaic Anne Rice novels."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"This book is analyzed a lot for two reasons: 1) its writing style which feels closer to life than previous styles of literature, 2) its narrator's personality,not your conventional hero. It is very readable and enjoyable and in fact contains one of the most interesting accounts of World War I, &quot;over our heads, two millimeters, maybe one millimeter from our temples, those long tempting lines of steel, that bullets make when they're out to kill you, were whistling through the hot summer air.&quot; Celine's character Bardamu is very funny and may remind some of Diderot's Rameau and perhaps he is a Rameau for the modern age. He calls a thing exactly as he sees it. The war chapters are my favorite for their strange blend of humor and absolute sobriety in the face of death , those bullets keep coming at Bardamu but he performs well and even becomes a corporal. It's not all fun and games for Bardamu of course, and there are moments of true humanity which stay with you as well as moments of real fear when under attack. The next phase of Bardamu's career takes him to Africa and there he spends what amounts to about 40 pages of time in a state of fever...hacking through jungle, jungle noises, butterflies, hacking through more jungle, riding in a dugout. Then to New York: 'we couldn't help laughing seeing it right there in front of us'. Bardamu roams the New York streets in awe, in his own special dream and eventually meets Molly, but soon he must go back to Paris and begin making a living of some kind. The parting scene with Molly is one of the more moving scenes in the book and there are quite a few. I suppose this kind of writing is called picaresque(episodic adventures of a roquish protagonist)but Bardamu is really very likable and very moved by much though he defends himself with humor and cynicism. The last part of the book in the slums of Paris is not as much fun as the earlier episodes but the writing is strong all the way through. Celine is smart and funny and irreverent toward everything, the language and humor and sometimes unexpected moments of compassion and feeling are exciting to read and all of it has a punch you won't forget as this is really good fiction that has lasted for good reason. You will enjoy following Bardamu on his adventures."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Most of the people I know who read &quot;serious&quot; literature are either terrified or contemptuous of Celine. They call him a fascist and an anti-semite. That he wrote such pamphlets (I wish he hadn't, but...), that he escaped to Germany at the end of WWII, though he hated no one more than Germans, while he insisted on living a life among the poor, the maligned, the degenerate, the petit bourgeois only adds to his bizarre background. He has been lauded both by left and right authors and jeered at--at the same time. Personally no book I've ever read, however, has more soul, more depth of feeling and is not out to bull**** me even though there is plenty of that in the book and in his writing. I thought that when I ended reading this that it would be the end of the journey. It wasn't. The journey continues along with the madness that this century has been. If anything &quot;Journey. . .&quot; written more than 60 years ago is a metaphor for this century. My only regret! is that I can't read it in French. But this translation is brilliant and suave without masking the crudity fundamental to Celine's writing. A thousand kisses!"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"\\"The whole of one's ridiculous past is actually so choked with absurdities and false values and gullibility, that one might be quite pleased to stop being young all of a sudden, to wait and let youth slip away from you, standing back and watching it outdistance you and run on and be lost, seeing how utterly vain it is, passing a hand through its emptinesss, taking one last look at it and then pushing off on one's own, sure of its really having disappeared, and calmly walking round by oneself to the other side of Time, to get a glimpse of what people and things really are like\\"This book, I call, the antithesis of Martha Stewart Living where everything is beautiful, in order and in perfectly coordinated colors and neatness. This book reminded me of Candide by Voltaire and Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller because of the raw, unadulterated chronicle of everything ugly about the journey, ultimately, to the end of the night. It is truly a journey through the world and the universal sufferings, injustice, hypocrisy and nefarious elements of human nature which, I am sure, any thinking/caring person is painfully aware of these days. Although this is a very candid, bold comentary, the writing style is fantastically refined and even beautiful, deeply moving and effective in generating strong reactions, both visceral and intellectual. This is not a book for good story lines since there really isn't much, but is for thought provoking subjects and writing to savour."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"The second funniest novel for me--after the incredible A Confederacy of Dunces by the late John Kennedy Toole.I'd say Henry Miller was influenced by Celine, as was Bukowski--and a few others.Get the Ralph Manheim translation.I have no idea why the publisher chose to include Vollman's afterword here, because it is not only idiotic, but absolutely unncessary."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Right from the start, this book unleashes some of the most funny, yet damning condemnations of what is wrong with human nature. I think the most intriguing portion of the book, although it was all great, was his time spent in the war, and the period after, his journey to Africa. The hypocrisy and insanity that he points out about courage and heroism in our world is pretty intense to read.After this, we go further into \\"the night\\", with his accomplice on that journey, a man named Robinson, whom he met during the war. They encounter many events together, sometimes absolutely hilarious, sometimes quite sad, always written very wittily and in a thought provoking manner by the author.It's a highly pessimistic book, but it speaks the truth about much of human nature and life in general in my opinion. Most of what is quite condemning, but he does acknowledge the good contained in certain individuals he comes across. Ultimately, they are few and far between though. It's a book i'll be reading again one day, I really found it to be one of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"\\"Journey,\\" as some of you will soon find out, is not for the faint of heart. Thru the eyes of Celine, the reader is (constantly) confronted by a parade of human debris, who, in turn, exhibit all that is wrong with humanity. It is dark, crude, even brutish at times, but if you can curb that feeling of nausea within, then you will discover one of the most amazing books, bar none, that has ever seen the light of day.Buy it, read it, experience it. But do buckle-up, because the one and only Celine all but guarantees that things will get a little bumpy around here, especially for the first time reader.Hey, you only live once, right? Enjoy."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Whodathought? Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I'd love this book. Celine has a weird reputation here, because I have never in all my years in university literature departments heard a good word about this fantastic writer. I have heard charges of anti-Semitism, which may be true, but Celine's at heart a humanist who may have simply fallen for a kind of conventional prejudice rather than the sort of brutalizing racism we connect with the 20th century. Celine is a brilliant stylist and perhaps a conventionally disgruntled WWI-generation crank. He writes a profanity-laced prose filled with zingers, witticisms, puns, word-play, and savage put-downs. Unlike some contemporaries, his anger is not an outgrowth of pretentious poses; his is the old-fashioned rage, of the sort one finds in Genet and Solzhenitsyn. This style has almost disappeared now, but it is common among intellectuals and artists of the early-20th century. Karl Krauss comes to mind as does Bertolt Brecht. Theirs is a bitter sarcasm, mercilessly witty, but poignant. Celine and the rest were brutalized during WWI and have a lot of anger toward to societies and governments that sought to justify the insanity and waste of that gruesome war."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"For the uninitiated, Journey to the End of the Night is a 450-page chronicle of anger, bitterness, hopelessness, despair, disillusionment, and resignation. It is one of the most pessimistic, negative books ever written. It addresses almost every base and negative aspect of the human experience: warfare, cowardice, lies, corruption, betrayal, slavery, manipulation, exploitation, perversion, persecution, cheating, greed, sickness, loneliness, madness, lust, gossip, abortion, disease, vengeance, and murder. In a book that explodes with adjectives, there is hardly a cheerful word to be found.But don't let that stop you from reading it. It is also a weird and wonderfully written mix of prose, philosophy, rant, and slang. At times it is hilarious. It is also sad, moving, and deeply insightful. Celine's voice is unique, and his dark vision changed the face of twentieth century literature.True to its title, the book is a metaphorical journey into the dark side of humanity. It doesn't really have a plot. In a nutshell, it follows Ferdinand Bardamu (who is telling the story), who joins the army on a whim, entering World War I. The fear and madness of his war experiences leave him shell-shocked. He spends the remainder of the war convalescing in a hospital, where he spends his time avoiding the front, laying nurses, and pulling himself together. After the war, he yearns to escape, so he travels to the French African colonies to run a trading post deep in the jungle. There, he contracts malaria and is sold into slavery by a Portuguese priest, only to be dumped in a quarantine facility in New York.He eventually winds up in Detroit, where he works a dead-end factory job at Ford and falls in love with a prostitute. Restless, he leaves his love behind and returns to France. There he completes his medical studies, and begins a practice in a Paris slum. After enduring abject poverty for several years, he leaves his practice in disgust; eventually he winds up working in a private mental hospital in Paris.Throughout the story, and at each major stop of his journey, Ferdinand encounters Robinson, a fellow traveler and nihilist. As the book progresses, Robinson lures the unwilling Ferdinand into a series of misadventures, taking him deeper and deeper \\"into the night.\\"I first read this book about 15 years go, in my mid-twenties. I had a stultifying corporate job, and I thought the next 40 years of my life were going to be nothing but empty and meaningless drudgery. In short, I thought my life was already over. So when I first read Journey, I was immediately hooked. It perfectly voiced all of the loathing and emptiness I was feeling. And sadly, it reinforced every dark, evil, vile thought I had about life and humanity. In retrospect, I realize it inspired and fueled my depression, which dogged me for another two and a half years.I finally scraped up the courage to make some changes in my life, and my own \\"night\\" faded into daylight. And for the most part, the darkness has stayed away. So years later, it is with very different eyes that I finished reading Journey for the second time.So how was it the second time around? How has this poisoned wine aged? It has aged beautifully. It is a tremendous book, and I still love it. Celine perfectly voices the world-weariness and despair that accompany hopelessness. And he captures the restless urge to escape when there is no meaning in your life. It wasn't as funny as I remembered, but it seemed more insightful, more devastating, and even more sweeping in it vast range of observations.I also found it slowly pulling me back into my own dark place--but only momentarily. With a bit of effort I was able to keep things in check. But it's good to look back now and again, to remember where you came from and how you've grown. Celine's world is a sad, bitter, and lonely place. But it's a place we all visit from time to time. Sadly, some are trapped there, never ending their grim journey. Read this book and enter their world."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine was a WWI veteran, sometimes discontented vagabond, and qualified but barely surviving Doctor/Physician who wrote one of the greatest novels of the 20th Western century. This is it. It's like a bomb hitting you on every page. The level of pessimism, cynicism, black humor, and its concomitant in the bargain--unflinching honesty--had never been equaled before in literature & few have matched it since. By his example, he inspired Henry Miller, Philip Roth, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jack Kerouac & many other luminaries to write in a similar no-holds-barred style. But as they say, the original is always the best & Celine was an original. No less a literary master and 'black satirist' than Nabokov himself has called Celine nothing but a second-rater; but even if you agree with that assesment of Celine's purely literary skills, you have to give credit to the guy for originating the no-nonsense style which made possible an artistically illuminating foray of unprecedented brutal honesty into the seedier aspects of life.During the second World War, Celine wrote and distributed anti-semitic pamphlets and was ardently pro-Nazi and pro-German occupation of France. A lot of people couldn't understand how such an indisputably important artist could also be a Fascist sympathizer. Fascism & art didn't go together in their minds (especially since most of the literati in France who had liked Celine's novels were either strong lefists and/or pro-USSR Communists). Celine had to live in exile for many years as a result of this war-time pro-fascist business, and never regained the scary perfection of form, the shattering style evident on every page of \\"Journey\\" (and its less impressive but still amazing follow-up \\"Death On the Installment Plan\\").There's very little in \\"Journey\\" that's scatologically trite & meandering, ... this is strong, even poetic stuff--some of the most original prose ever written. At this point in his career Celine's writing was an absolute revelation to most people who read it, and it was equally popular with low-brow and high-brow readers alike. Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir used to know entire passages of \\"JTTEOTN\\" by heart and quoted from it often to spice up conversations that were getting too uptight.Some people swear by the newer Mannheim translations as the absolute best, but I for one, found them a little too willing to please 'hip' American audiences by using certain more popular forms of speech, at the expense of a stronger but more restrictively high-brow literary quality. That's why I say, read the Manheim versions but don't ignore the older translations available in the libraries , some of them are brilliant and turn Celine into a much more refined writer than Manheim, even if the curse words are toned down and euphemised. Of course, most French people will tell you that it's absolutely ridiculous to read Celine in anything but French!"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I do not see Ralph Manheim's new translation of Celine's ''Journey to the End of the Night'' (New Directions) as an improvement over John H.P. Marks's fine 1934 version, I see it as more of a refinement of the times, read both of them if you can. It is good to see Celine being brought back to the public's attention. For all his paranoia and the questions raised by the anti-Semitic pamphlets he wrote at the time of World War II, Celine remains one of the great European novelists of the century, the only logical successor, one might say, to Dostoyevsky. This is a powerful book not for the weak at heart, it is damaging to all your senses and engulfs you in a wonderful passion for true, great literature.In 1932, with ''Journey to the End of the Night,'' Celine snatched French fiction from the manicured hands of Gide and Proust and gave it an elementary gusto, a savage bite it had hardly known since Rabelais. Four years later, with ''Death on the Installment Plan,'' he had already snarled and elbowed his way into the pantheon.''Journey'' is a picaresque novel whose protagonist fights in World War I, works in Africa, travels to the United States and returns to Paris to become a doctor. An impoverished doctor in a Paris slum like his antihero Ferdinand, Celine clearly announced his position when he wrote this fantastic book, he was &quot;against all&quot;. While Cervantes, the other great picaresque novelist, mourned the death of chivalry, Celine's subject was the death of civility. As a slum doctor, he had heard every kind of cry of pain, anger and dispair; you can find them all in his novels, mixed with his own archetypally French humor and transmogrified by a style of exalted disgust. Insisting on spoken rhythms, Celine said that he wanted to have his language ''throb more than reason&quot;, he called his style of writing the &quot;music in his head&quot;.There's a passage in Nietzsche's ''Beyond Good and Evil'' that could be the best summary of Celine's qualities. He writes that ''it might be possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he would have to be honored as a saint in the lower world in which he had sunk.'' And we can see Celine as the saint of all things forbidden and dark..."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"This book had been sitting on my bookshelf for years...somehow it had evaded me, but one night a few weeks ago I picked it up out of curiosity, bit into the first chapter and howled out loud laughing...the writing was hilarious and explosive, absurd, dark and vicious, a complicated, sometimes contradictory mixture that still feels contemporary in the 21st century. brilliant. I was immediately hooked on this book, it had waited patiently for me to discover it and now it strung out its treasures. Bardamu leads us on his journey, through terrible scenes of sadness and grotesque, suffocating comedy, occassionally opening his heart enough to reveal, despite all of his claims otherwise, a sensitive and suffering soul trying his hardest to find any meaning whatsover in his own life. Celine's prose eviscerates everything around him, as well as himself. The novel is brilliantly concluded; though the title can be interpreted as the metaphorical night that we all travel through in our lives, it's truly the end of the particularly horrific night that resides in the final pages of the book, full of nihilism and exhausted resignation, that we journey towards in reading it. And that's where Celine leaves us, alive for one more day, in the questionable dawn of the morning that swallows up the night."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Not to be a naysayer, because I know this translation has received quite a bit of critical acclaim, but Celine remains much more lucid and enjoyable in the original Marks translation, which you can probably pick up at any used book store.I looked at a few of my favorite scenes in both books and, while Marks doesn't quite capture Celine's frenetic style, he seems to have a better sense of comic timing, and has a wonderful sense of the rhythm of the book's language. While it may not be as faithful as the Manheim, all in all, it makes for a better read.The book itself is wonderful. I discovered this book by way of Catch-22, because Heller said this Celine was one of his major influences, and found that Journey to the End of the Night was actually a more rewarding read (if a little less funny) than Catch-22. It not only encapsulates most of Heller's ideas about sanity and war, but expands into much richer territory.Also, a little too much has been made of the constant pessimism of the book. It isn't as soul crushing as one might think, and isn't the sort of facile hipster cynicism that a lot of books settle for. Scratch the surface of a pessimist and you'll find a disillusioned optimist. There is a strong undercurrent of humanity in this book, which I didn't always find in Catch-22. I realized this as soon as I came across the character of Alcide, who is living his &quot;wretched life in this tropical monotony...for a little girl who was vaguely related to him, without conditions, without bargaining, with no interest except that of his own good heart.&quot;Although the bitterness in this book can sometimes be grating, it is never nasty, stupid, all-encompassing bitterness. The only problem is finding the pockets of hope.

And this just happens to be at the start of World War I. What is a cowardly young man who doesn't want to kill anyone do? He philosophizes on being cowardly and not wanting to kill anyone! Even as his incompetent superiors (aren't military superiors always incompetent in war?) send him and his fellow soldiers out on doomed missions without adequate intelligence, strategy, troops, or supplies. This seems all toO familiar to modern times. It's up to Bardamu to find an exit from the madness. But while the war sections of this novel are at turns comedic, absurd, bloody, and tragic, we also follow the main character to Africa, New York City, and finally as he tries feebly to start a medical practice in his native France.To me, this novel should stand right alongside the Holy Bible, Shakespeare, and the great Greek writers on the bookshelf next to your bed as a survival tool for the 21st century. It could have been written today. The insanity of war, the emptiness of modern life, the fleeting transport of love, all of these topics spoke to me as if Celine is still a living writer much in touch with current American life. The war scenes especially resonate, reflecting a leadership who at times has no clear objective as to why or how to fight a conflict which engulfed multiple countries. Celine is a divine writer, whose sentences are dictated from a higher source, wherever great wisdom comes from. This is a book for the ages!"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Ah, Celine, Celine, how can anyone read this book and not laugh out loud at this least 10 times a chapter? What lightning fast wit the narration possesses. Leave it to the french to spawn an inspiration that lasts thru the ages like this has. Great things to say about the hollowness of patriotism, everyday mundane existence, and even flea counting! The fact that it's so funny in the midst of all its pessimism is proof that Celine has his moments of true compassion. He understood exactly what was going on. And maybe after you're done reading this, you will, too.A rare, and all too knowing literary treat."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"&quot;Journey&quot; is generally considered to be the father of all black humor fiction. Celine's work flows onto the page not in a smooth and steady fashion, but chunky and uneven. Some of the situations the main character goes through are truly ridiculous (and semi-autobiographical)--and this is exactly what Celine was looking for.The story itself is interesting. It tells of the journeys of a single man through war and the world it puked up afterwards.I bought the book because so many authors noted it as one of their influences. This includes Joseph Heller, author of &quot;Catch-22&quot; and WWII soldier, as well as many others. Coming from a Jewish background, finding out that Celine was anti-Semitic did not change my views of the book itself. I found no hint of this in this piece of fiction.In many cases, Celine's words on the page seem as if they're screaming at you with emotion. It's this way of conveying feelings that was so new in his works and copied now so frequently. The less you notice it, the more modern books you've read using these techniques. It's definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I can't think of a more original , funny and yet saracastic book than this one. Just when you think that the author had exhausted his brilliant use of words to describe an aspect of human nature and French society, he comes up with something new within the next paragraph or page. This book is tilted towards describing more of the negative aspects of everything but there are enough positive books out there for any one to read. For something with passages that will literally make you laugh out loud and get you to rethink the extent of free creative writing during the early 20th century , read this book at once! If you're easily offended or constantly critiquing a work of art as you read it, then this one is not for you."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"This review refer to Spanish version - \\" Viaje al Fin de la Noche\\" / Maestros del Siglo XX- Editorial Oveja NegraI read this book in my early twenties, along a long list of nihilist, existentialist... the unavoidable Henry Miller.. I was captivated by the expressionisms of his own inner feeling as he travels here and there observing an absurd humanity.I'm just picking up the book and looking at the notes I made so long ago, not so clear...Definitely the book to read in the twenties, the book to review in your forties and I predict the book to quietly glimpse and flavor in your sixties.Human spirit is contradictory, the pen that accomplished this fine work was an anti-Semitic and pro-occupations of the Nazis.. as one preface of the book says, he avoided the death sentence by a miraculously act.. Being I an absolute anti-Nazi .. I can only judge the literary creation and not its creatorMy notes take me so far away.. I guess the notions of love and the uneasy feeling of trying to observe stoically the stupidly of nature, came in part from here... in those days my feelings of anti-Europeanism were forming from the study of its militaristic history and by the conviction that the last wars of humanity were going to start there.. all of that changed, of course, but the notion of how absurd the I WW was, came from the insight (I am not a translator so please forgive any fatal errors)\\".. No matter how hard I tried to look into my memory, I cannot recall of any harm I had done to the Germans. I always was nice and educated toward them. I knew the Germans a little, I even assisted to a schooling Germany when I was a younger in the surroundings of Hanover. I had spoken their language. Back then they were a noisy screaming mass of howling punks. After school we went to the surrounding woods to fondle the girls, we also shot with pistols and arches that we bought for four marks. We drank beer with sugar. But form that to be here killing each others without further explanations, here in the middle of the road, there seemed to be emptiness even an abyss. Just too much of a difference\\"Be ready to embark in a literary journey of fine XX century prose"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"If you havent read this book, I would reccomend it highly. I first read this on a long cross country bus trip thru America.. Its especially fun to read in crowded airports... Celine is a master of taking simple situations and griping the most trivial detail into the ground until there's nothing left but the bare essentials... Please treat yourself to a highly rewarding experience... Not just a scatching commentary about war but every folly really known to man. Should have been on the top one hundred best books of the century... say like maybe in the top 20... Yes, its that good."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Yeah, Celine-the-man had more than one squeleton in his closet but Celine-the-artist is one of the best natural writer you'll ever come across. Words flow from him effortlessly. His depiction of the atrocity of war is the best I have ever read. As a native French speaker, I read the book in French. I don' t know whether the translation does justice to the original prose (how do you translate &quot;On est puceau de la guerre comme on l' est de l' amour&quot;?)It's okay to love this book and it's okay to hate it but if it leave you indifferent then either my watch has stopped or you're dead!"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I heard of &quot;Journey to the end of the night&quot; from mentions of Celine in the works of Charles Bukowski.Not an easy to track down I eventually read the book and was not disappointed.The basic narritive covers twenty odd years,following Ferdinand Bardamu through encounters in World War one,a mental hospital,the Congo,the Untited states and back to Paris in Medical capacities.The book examines an anti hero who believes in nothing and more importantly despises anybody who does. The reaccouring charactor of Robinson acts as a sort catalyst for Ferdinand. From their meeting in the dark slaughter fields in the Flanders.Celine uses their friendship to let him(Bardamu)to act as the observer to the various anti-social escapades of Robinson.This drives the narrative through the book The book throughout is one of the most relentlessly pessimistic pieces I have ever read.People are seen constantly as boorish idiots ie brainless officers,all women,Native Africans,Parisian patients-the list is endless.However what comes across is that to succeed in life it helps to be like this. Cut off all emotion(espically false ones like love) and your decrepid,miserible fleash will have some moments of pleasure until you scrivil up and eventually die.So why read such an expression in unremitting nilism? For new readers in thie gender(note Bukowski,Knut Hamsum,Celine) prepare yourself for the extreme closeup of the degregation and uselessness of human life.However in this book what appealed to me was the humour.He takes his instances and examples of life so far that his inherent bile becomes quite farcical.A good example is his trip to the Congo by sea where gradually the ships contigient of &quot;war heros&quot; decide in unision to attack Bardamu.The building of paranoid tension on a contained environment becomes quite slapstick in its desperation. On one level its horrible yet all part of a human comedy that laudes human failing.Grahem Greens &quot;Comedians&quot; explains this notion better that I ever could.So Celine uses misery to poetray an array of expressions,one being comedy.Good examples in the book are,Robinsons attempts to kill an old lady,Bardamus descriptions of officers,his attempts to make human contact in New York,the brilliently realised wasting of the French in the congo.The attempts to train natives who use sticks for arms with utter enthuaism.False dreams and ignorance on display.Over exaggeration is the key. The actual writing style is fast and streamlined, in so as pages disappear in block linked paragraphs. The paradoxical nature of the novel is also a major part of Celine's style that should be noted.Anti war but caught up in jingoism,seeing indiviualism as vanity yet hating being a number in a factory, Failure as a Doctor, false ideals,waistful deaths of children---it go's on and on. However I'll leave with this,as time is short and I always have better things to be doing. Read this bookfor no other reasion than to boost a dark dreary Winter evening.So sit back and indulge in self pity. Know and accept that you are stuck in a world full of idiots.A little excorism can sometines improve your day(perhaps thats what Celine wanted---Who knows?------"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Louis-Ferdinand C&eacute;line, unfortunately unknown to most americans, is a celebrated 20th century French writer.A radical account and point of view of an honest human being who values life above all else; above nationalism and moral virtues... during WW1. This theme, verily present in Journey, is in some sense why Celine is associated with Nietzsche. Celine's second novel, Death on Credit, is part 2 of the story of Bardamu, the main character and the narrator of this book."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"If you want to know how the survivors of the first world war felt and thought, this is the book to read. It is possible to follow the thought processes that led many of these young men to later embraces the totalitarian ideologies.The anti-hero of the book survives the war, but bitter and cynical. He thought he had fought to save civilization, but everything is chaos and dissolution when he returns. Idiots rule. Everywhere he turns corruption and stupidity are rife.He tries to go to colonial Africa as a doctor.Celine has a unique writing style; a sentence (the length of a breath) followed by three dots. It is a difficult way to write, but he carries it off. Celine is truly hailed as one of the finest stylists of the twentieth century, but he is also infamous for serving as a minister in the Vichy regime in second world war France."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"As far as I can see, this book has given birth to all sort of favorable and unfavorable comments. From my point of view I think there are a couple of things it must be given credit for.The first one is language. There is a major problem with the language used throughout the novel: it is extremely difficult to translate since it is a colloquial sort of speech. The taste the reader may find in this kind of literature relies too much on the original language it was written in. He may have the sensation that the author does not write: he directly speaks in the reader's ear. Celine succeeds in producing a rhythmic, almost musical flow of words and ideas that is hard to keep pure when translated. And this is one of the most appealing traits Journey possesses.The other is the approach to subjects like war, capitalist exploitation, science, society and mankind disappointment. Although I don't agree with the general view of the world Celine depicts along this novel I must admit that his description of war scenes are really moving and the sarcasm he pours here and there regarding human nature is fairly placed."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Every lit major in America should read this wholly original and hilariously mad novel from Celine.

It is amazing how, after reading this book, other authors have tried to express the same hallucinatory and exhilarating view of our times, failing by years-light, of course. Reading this book is one of the most painful, most terrible experiences any reader must endure. C&eacute;line's view of the world makes no concessions. And despite that, he makes us laugh loudly in every page. He showed us just that the complete insanity in which we live can only be tolerated if seen with the eyes of delirium. C&eacute;line's book(s) make all the serious discourses on the suffering and seriousness of human life look just ridiculous. How can anyone write anything after that (except Bukowski)?"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine once said he wrote to make other writers unreadable. While this may strikes as a strange project, I would agree, with many others, that it was largely fulfilled. Throughout his life, Celine evolved a very personal, &quot;jubilatoire&quot; (sorry, my first language is French) style that does make most of modern French authors look like zombies.&quot;Journey&quot;, Celine's first book, includes unexpected borrowings form colloquial, spoken French. A look to further works, however, shows that these borrowings were only a starting point for a unique work on the French language.From the night of his personal experience, Celine reaches through language to ultimate elegance, light and lightness - a transfiguration arguably difficult to translate into English.Jacques P.

The sun burns my skin, their volume burns my mind, I drink to not hear them.The fact that my hatred for all of you has been written already in such a poetic and beautiful manner justifies every night I have buried my face in my blankets and screamed, my booze-soaked breath stinking up the sheets as the wife wonders what it's all about.It's all been said, it's all been done.

JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT was his first exploration of the dark and rancid side of humanity. Bardamu's experiences are expressionistic renderings of events in Celine's life.From the battlefields of WWI, to the African jungle, to Detroit, and back to France, it's a journey into mankind's heart of darkness that the reader will not soon forget. Was Celine the world's greatest misanthrope? The deepest pessimist? I'm not sure, because he does find good human qualities here, although they are as rare as rain in the desert.

In each instance, the culture de jour is analyzed, reconfigured, and often trashed. Celine says what he means... And if these dots mean anything to you... You'll know you're hooked, too!...

That defines largely what i like to read. A nephew handed me Celine because I said I had heard/seen the books, but not picked them up. He loved it. It was not his age, it was the fact that his life has helf for him certain experiences and trials. I would not have liked the book at his age because I had a different life. not to bring up the news, but--Just like the kids in Littleton had very different perspectives on the same school and social text. Being young comes with a certain set of experiences, but most can and do differ widely. Would a black teen living inthe inner city read Celine? No. Would a perky cheerleader enjoy the text ?

Fifty years after publication, it still has the power to shock. From the battlefields of WW1 to the dehumanising factories of America. Not a book to be read while depressed, it revolutionised writing by its irreverance to institutions, religions and humanity itself. In later works Celine was accused of racism (he had some very questionable views) but this book treats all of us black or white, christian, jew etc...with an equal distain, relieved periodically by hilarious observations. This is the kind of book that can change you life utterly."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"This writer changed literature. From his writings, Journey and Death on Credit are ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS for the canon that is contemporary literature. Without Celine, we would have no basis on which to rest Kerouac, we would be missing, dare I say, Kurt Vonnegut as we know him. This writer influenced them all. You can not help but hate him in his manifest destiny of dismal sadness. Nothing is good enough for him, he is cynical, sees life as ultimately humiliating. He does have moments of joy. Moments of immense pleasure. But he undoubtedly is so honest, in such a breathtaking cacophony of seriously detailed life-description, that he just blew the lid off the whole prim, proper experience that was \\"literature\\".

You will find a delightfully subtle potrait of this experience in the history of poor Bardamu, first tossed in a war as \\"cannon meat\\", then in colonial africa as a corporate slave, then in the consumistic, maddening, squallid american society and finally involved in the every-day miseries of his own french society. In his cynical voyage he shows you the bestiality of war, the obtusity of the myriads of men that let themselves besent to death for the wealth of of a few privileged ones, the savage exploitation of colonial africa, the obscene vulgarity and mechanization of american society and the horrors that hide behind the calm facade of burgeois society and yet under it all you can sense a subtle vein of gentle idealism and regret.From youth to old age, look at life of a potentially good man, whose good nature and quest for a meaning in life have been thwarted by our disgustig \\"human society\\". And all in the words of a true master of the language. I strongly recommend it to young people, as an true eye-opener and to \\"prepare them for life\\". As for who considers it dated...even a cursory look at central africa today, or at at the Iraq war will quickly prove how terrible actuality of this book."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"This is absolutely the best and truest book I have ever read. Shatters all the pathetic, stupid and widely held illusions most of us hold dear. Puts politicians, militarists, religionists and capitalists in their place. Offers amazing insight into the life of the poor and working class and the murderous passions lurking in so many families. Couldn't be more vivid and funny. Pulls away the masks we wear to justify exploiting and killing each other. Anyone who reads this book will find it more difficult to believe in anyone or anything.I'm surprised that none of the reviewers noticed that this book is a long riff on Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, which ends with the anguished, \\"The horror, the horror\\". Celine's book gets moving when Bermadiu realizes one can be virgin to horror as one is a horror to sex, and then he proceeds to describe the horror on a much wider canvass than Conrad did. The painting analogy is an apt one--JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT is Hieronomys Bosch in words. Most horrible of all and what is most contemptuous about human beings is how easily and stupidly most conform and the disastrous consequences:\\"All the world's a stage,\\" he writes, \\"and you had better take a part or get off..\\""},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Surely, the great novel of the century (with Ulysses and 100 Years of Solitude). Anger and poetry -- no one touched it again (maybe Jackson Pollock?) until John Lydon screamed. How does one respond to the butchery in the trenches of W. W. I? Polite novels about the social mores of the bourgeoisie? &quot;Then it will be over and that will be all right with me.&quot;"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Some readers will no doubt disparage Celine's Journey to the End of the Night for its pessimistic and misanthropic leanings. Nonetheless, I found that beneath the stark, unsettling realism of its prose lies a keen insight to all things human. Celine's brand of compassion (like Nietzsche's, Bukowski's and Vonnegut's) is difficult for many people to stomach: amoral, apolitical, and undeniably, but necessarily, outrageous. It is the outrageousness of Celine's ideas, embodied in the novel's anti-hero, Bardamu, that I find most valuable. His incessant rantings and ravings, his unfaltering nihilism, his petulance, and his self-induced, overall miserableness excel in rocking us out of our boredom and complacency. This extremism forces us to revaluate our own morality, and reminds us of the importance of keeping life, death, and everything else, in perspective."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"In South America there is a tribe of Indians that designate who is to be a shaman or medicine man upon birth. The child is removed from its parents and taken high up the mountain to live with an old and wise shaman, who will be his teacher and guide. For the first 18 years of the child's life he is not permitted to leave the hut during the day or look upon the daylight. The child only observes the world vieled in darkness and illuminated the the stars and moon. On his 18th birthday, the shaman throws open the door at dawn, as the sun is casting its first glorious rays upon the jungle, and guides the child into the light. He turns to the child and says, &quot;Now you see the world for what it truly is.&quot;For me, reading Celine was like the child's journey to wisdom. I have read a lot of books and authors, including Russian, German, French, American, English, Central American, and South American, but nothing as profound and moving as this work. Other authors I would recommend are Rimbaud, Henry Miller, Bukowski, and Henrich Boll."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":".This is a unique book. I found Ferdinand Celine very subjective in that I could be him, taking road trips, living on the edge, scraping the bare necessities, surviving and living inside life, suffering through it and enjoying it not as a spectator but participant.You can say from this book, that is what eventually brought forth the &quot;Beat Generation,&quot; which was to occur twenty some odd years later over in the States. And you can see that Celine's style runs all throughout Jack Kerouac's writings. Although Kerouac journeyed much farther into Proustian tangents of descriptive remembrances to the point of walking down long windy alleyways. It's this style of Celine, the somewhat self mystical observances, the internal perceptions of the ordinary, with pessimism, and life from the view of a single, poorer male whose taken quite a few road trips. A few crazy experiences, a few dangerous ones, a [prostitute]or two, problem personalities and an obnoxious friend perhaps. Hey, Cassidy was way cooler than Robinson. Celine tells the Beat Generation from a French experience.Now I find it's when Celine talks to himself he writes the best quotes, rather then telling the straight story. A few observations of Celine:&quot; A madman's thoughts are just the usual ideas of a human being, except that they're hermetically sealed inside his head. The world never gets into his head, and that's they way he wants it. A sealed head is like a lake without an outlet, standing, stagnant.&quot; p. 357&quot; There are simple lunatics and there are others, tortured by obsession with civilization. p. 361&quot; What with stretching ourselves thin, with sublimating ourselves and torturing out minds, we'll end up on the far side of intelligence, the infernal side, that there's no coming back from! . . . And the fact is, what with masturbating their intelligence day and night, those ultra super wise men seem even now to have shut themselves up in the dungeons of the damned&quot;&quot; I say day and night, because you know, Ferdinand, they fornicate themselves all night in their dreams . . Need I say more! . . . They dig at their minds! They dilate them! They tyrannized them! All around them there's nothing left but a foul sublimating of organic debris, a marmalade of madness and symptoms that drip and oozed from every part of them. p. 365&quot; Death after all is only a matter of a few hours, a few minutes, but a pension is like poverty, it lasts a whole lifetime. Rich people are drunk in a different way, they can't understand this frenzy about security. Being rich is another kind of drunkenness, the forgetful kind. That, in fact, is the whole point of getting rich: to forget.&quot; p. 288&quot; Maybe it's treacherous old age coming on, threatening the worst. Not much music left inside us for life to dance to. Our youth has gone to the ends of the earth to die in the silence of the truth. and where, I ask you, can a man escape to, when he hasn't enough madness left inside him? The truth is an endless death agony. The truth is death. You have to choose: death or lies. I've never been able to kill myself. pp. 172-173&quot; Study changes a man, puts pride into him. You need it to get to the bottom of life. Without it you just skim the surface. You think you're in the know, but trifles throw you off. You dream too much. You content yourself with words instead of going deeper. That's not what you wanted. Intentions, appearances, no more. A man of character can't content himself with that. Medicine, even if I wasn't very gifted, had brought me a good deal closer to people, to animals, everything. Now all I had to do was plunge straight into the heart of things. Death is chasing you, you've got to hurry, and while you're looking you've got to eat, and keep away from wars. That's a lot of things to do. It's no picnic.&quot;. p. 207&quot; There's no tyrant like the brain!&quot; p. 207&quot; A room changes in a few months, even if you don't move anything. Old and rundown as things may be, they still find the strength, the Lord knows where, to get older. Everything had changed around us. Not that anything had moved, no, of course not, the things themselves had actually changed, in depth. Things are different when you go back to them, they seem to have more power to enter into us more sadly, more deeply, more gently than before, to merge with the death which is slowly, pleasantly, sneakily growing inside us, and which we train ourselves to resist a little less each day. From moment to moment, we see life languishing, shriveling inside us, and with it the things and people who may have been commonplace or precious or imposing when we last left them. Fear of the end has marked all that with its wrinkles, while we were chasing around town in search of pleasure or bread.&quot; pp. 321-322&quot; Life hides everything from people. Their own noise prevents them from hearing anything else. They couldn't care less. The bigger and taller the city, the less they care. Take it from me. I've tried. It's a waste of time.&quot; p. 180&quot; Why kid ourselves, people have nothing to say to one another, they all talk about their own troubles and nothing else. Each man for himself, the earth for us all. They try to unload their unhappiness on someone else when making love, they do their damnedest, but it doesn't work, they deep it all, and then they start all over again, trying to find a place for it. &quot;You're pretty Mademoiselle,&quot; they say. And life takes hold of them again until the next time, and then they try the same little gimmick, &quot;You're very pretty, Mademoiselle . . . &quot;&quot; And in between they boast that they've succeeded in getting rid of their unhappiness, but everyone knows it's not true and they've simply kept it all to themselves. Since at that little game you get uglier and more repulsive as you grow older, you can't hope to hide your unhappiness, your bankruptcy, any longer. In the end your features are marked with that hideous grimace that takes twenty, thirty years or more to climb from your belly to your face. That's all a man is good for, that and no more, a grimace that he takes a whole lifetime to compose. The grimace a man would need to express his true soul without losing any of it is so heavy and complicated that he doesn't always succeed in completing it.&quot; p. 252"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"As soon as I'd put down &quot;Journey&quot; for the first time twenty years ago, I made a vow to learn French for the single purpose of reading Celine in his own language. I never kept that vow, but I've returned to Manheim's translation of &quot;Journey&quot; twice since that time, and I haven't had my fill yet. Celine's hallucinatory masterpiece still shocks, still inspires that thrill that comes in the presence of a great and lasting work of literature. Celine was and still remains wholly original; it is as if the man conceived the idea of writing a novel without ever having read one. No book you have ever read will prepare you for &quot;Journey&quot;, yet it is no mere exercise in literary experimentation; it is a riveting and tremendously readable picaresque novel for our century and the one to come. Celine rages and rants, but curmudgeon and nihilist he's not. Bardamu, Celine's antihero, is no more a true nihilist than Celine himself, the doctor who tended Paris' poor. Without the weight of Celine's conscience, this would have been nothing more than a prolongued tirade. Once you've devoured &quot;Journey&quot;, there is Frederic Vitoux's recent biography of Celine, a powerful and completely non-apologetic insight into one of the century's great writers."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"If you like your misanthropy razor-sharp, finely-tuned and right on target then do not hesitate. Get this book under your belt. The laugh out loud gallows humor provides a potent kick as the novel starts, propelling you almost giddily into Celine's world where you are left to ferment and writhe as the humor turns to acid and there are no more smiles to be had. By the end of the book all you are left with is a filthy reflection of what awaits you outside your door but, like in any battle, the guy who suffers with you becomes a friend for life. Such is the case with Celine. This book is the diary of your friendship."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine being translated into English changed everything, if not everyone. I first read Celine on the insistence of Kerouac's ghost and was severely blown away. Vonnegut owes a debt to him. Burroughs owes him as well. It seems that every turn modern literature has taken owes a strange and unspoken debt to all that Celine has done. Despite his political misgivings or failings, his Christ-like gift to prose and the modern novel has been (since Vonnnegut) unparalleled."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I first read the journey when serving the army back in Yugoslavia. Everything around me didn't make much sense, even though others seemed to think so. Then I read the journey and felt like I was the one really understanding.

Only Fante, Hamsun, Kafka and sometimes Buk can reach up to Celine."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I came to this book from a review in the TLS, which described it as &#34;one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century,&#34; John Banville's words. It is not a book for everybody. The author is in the line of Villon and Rabelais, was a notorious anti-semite, but an honest man who had gone through very difficult experiences in the first part of the last century, including and especially the World War.

Its that simple. Here is a man who does nothing more than offer his bleak commentary on what he sees, feels, and believes to be true. It is enlightening and compulsory, but a great ride into the mind of a strange French doctor who writes about the time he ran away from battle and why it was the right thing to do.People often ask me for books to read that will surprise them and be memorable.

At times awkard, at times smooth, the writing is always exciting. If you like the icy heat of Robbe-Grillet, Charles Bukowski, Henry Miller, William S.

Translation does not render fully the beauty and uniqueness of C&eacute;line's colorful language so if you speak French, I would recommend going for the French version.If you don't, this book is simply monumental and an absolute must-read anyhow.It is dark in its vision of human nature: certainly not an uplifting read.But this book is a true masterpiece. Five stars (simply because six are not possible)."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Exerts from my review of Celine's Journey to the End of the Night......Well, what about Celine? Celine, and his Journey. The subject, here...Buk and Fante, they were great writers. But Celine got it. He captured it. And put it there, on the page, like some angry magician; what they were all after. As close to, something, as it can get. Some little piece - valuable, but dangerous; that no one since Dostoevsky had fiddled with. A story about a war. About love, rejection. The crummy soul of man. And the things, out there, that no one else wanted to talk about. The loneliness. The quietness of the night. The stuff that Shakespeare molded over, into a beautiful story. Like massaging a turd. No, Bill! Something's not right. Life is... ya know. Life is that goblin that was hiding underneath your bed the whole time, as a kid. And here Celine takes the flashlight to it. Sure, it's horrifying; but it's still there. Just the same. Might as well invite it up for coffee, or tea. Become acquainted. Before it jumps upon you....Other days, I'll pick it up. Read a couple of lines, here or there. Sometimes giggling. Sometimes stunned. Celine's writing is a style unlike most. Each paragraph sits there, on the page, reading like the dying gasps of a heart attack victim. The book is somewhat auto-biographical. Written through the cynical imagination of his character, Bardamu. A medical doctor, of sort. Celine doesn't use chapter numbers. And the crawl through the night undergoes a number of stark scenery shifts. Starting in that cafe terrace, speaking with his friend. All the way through the Congo, the Ford factories in Detroit, before landing back in France. In that miserably described Rancy.I would never call it a challenging read. But one that is challenging, for some. In another way. Ya really got be able to cut the fluff, to give it a fulfilling attempt. You gotta give thought, that we may just be walking and crapping things. Which is hard, for some.But, despite popular opinion pronouncing his evilness, Celine turned out to be a pretty funny guy. Which ok's him in my book. World War II was his joke, back at the world. \\"Fine world, you want me to become something, after all of my fussing. Squirming. And pointing out of your absurdity? Fine. How is this? I will become an anti-Semitic, Nazi enthusiast. How's that?\\"A great writer. But a better book.Caught up in some of the darker moments of Mankind. One of the deadliest times, for their games. During a time when, no one was capable of judging another. Until it passed over them. And a winner declared.At the end of the night, survival only waits.Now go read it."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"What a bizarre, hilarious and sometimes depressing journey. Celine's main character is truly the scum of the earth. An army deserter, a med school drop out, a sex addict and a lazy bum wishing a disease would land him in an infirmary so he could just hang out and stare at the trees all day. The language in this book is flawless. I've never had to reference a dictionary like I had to with this book. It's wonderful for writers or anyone interested in the art. You'll learn words you've never even thought existed. This book is a great precursor to authors and books such as CAMUS & A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Anyone interested in DYSTOPIAN or the ABSURD will love this book. My only problem was I found it slightly non visceral--a critique I reckon had more to do with my own pace of the book than with the text itself. The language is absolutely amazing, and it is really really funny--in a sort of sad, perverted type of way. Given the books date of publishing (1932) young readers will be glad to hear it is very modern in it's execution and humor. Light years ahead of it's time."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I first heard about Celine through the many times his name was invoked by Bukowski, which may be true for a lot of American readers. While the two writers are actually very different, they both presented unremittingly bleak looks at humanity that were both lightened by unexpected humor. The pure tragicomic absurdity of life is laid bare in this memoir, and I can only wonder how much (or how little) is fictional. Some readers will probably dislike the heavy use of ellipses but I got used to it and stopped noticing after awhile. It may be some time before I tackle the follow-up to this book, \\"Death on the Installment Plan\\" but I'm sure I'll read it at some point."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"This disturbing novel almost won the Prix Goncourt Prize for fiction, the most notable award at the time for French fiction. It deserves to win all the literary awards going.But why read it now? It's because the desperate, existential character of the novel, Ferdinand Bardamu, L-F Celine's alter ego in his fiction, draws you into his story from his personal first person perspective. It's no surprise that, in the 1930s, the novel caused such a storm, because of its frank, explicit depiction of the troubles and turmoils of working class French (and other) life. You become captive, in the hands of a true narrator/story teller: Bardamu, expressing his human condition (a raison detre of existential fiction), has nothing to embellish, he's at the bottom of the working class French such that, he can't even imagine anything else beyond a good meal and wine. If he gets these things, he's often lucky or fortuitous.At the same time, you are reading through Bardamu's experience, living it, such that you feel trapped, suffocated, despairing, nihilistic, overwhelmed, annihilated, when he does. Yet he continues, through the dire madness and desperation of WW1, through to the equal nuttiness of French Colonial Africa, to the monster of the machine that is the Ford factory in Detroit, back to France, and Bardamu's desperate living as a doctor among the damned (the absolutely impoverished of France, with no hope, no legislation to defend them, no money, no succour, no opportunity to go beyond their desperate lives).In other words: to read this novel is to experience, painfully and truthfully, the destitution, pain and annihilation of not only WW1 and its devastating economic aftermath but also, most especially, the psychological and environmental problems that impacted so greatly upon the poor. It is an incredible read; it is uncompromising, desperately true, always sincere, painfully hopeful, but destitute of opportunity that goes beyond the life of fhs working classes and impacts negatively on society overall in terms of its values, morals and attitudes."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I finished it and still wonder why I bothered."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"One of the problems with reading revolutionary books long after their initial publication is that they often don't seem so, well... revolutionary. Such is the case with C&eacute;line's semi-autobiographical masterpiece-a 440 page behemoth that despite lively scenes here and there is very often tedious and boring. I gather that much of the controversy around it at the time was with regards to its use of &quot;naturalistic&quot; and &quot;vulgar&quot; language and slang (perhaps akin to the love/hate critical reaction to Scottish authors like James Kelman and Irvine Welsh in the late part of the century). While it may have represented a profound stick in the eye of literary conventions back in 1932, it certainly hasn't retained any capacity to shock or surprise in that regard. If you're a fan of the dark side of 20th century popular literature as represented by those such as Henry Miller, Bukowski, Kerouac, Burroughs, Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, et al (notice that you'll find no women on this list), you find it an interesting read just to see where they got some of their sensibilities, but otherwise it gets old fast.The problem with the book is not that there aren't commendable sentiments expressed at times. The opening section where the hero Bardamu enlists in WWI provides many ripe target for C&eacute;line to skewer. Similarly, the subsequent section on his adventures in colonial Africa are tailor-made to set up long bouts of righteous ranting and farcical satire (Although everything is based on his own experiences, at times one gets the feeling C&eacute;line read Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; a few too many times). Throughout the adventures, the hero Bardamu rants continuously about howeveryone is engaged in selling themselves and being false in order to prosper-that modern life is a lie, underneath it all, it's disgusting, that people are disgusting. It should be noted that the only two characters who aren't subject to Bardamu's withering scorn are the two truly selfless ones: the prostitute in Detroit who tries desperately to help him, and the guy at the end who does everything to send money to an orphaned niece. C&eacute;line acknowledges that these people exist (barely), but seems unable to know what to do with them-other than not sneer at them.Yes it's a dark, black read that holds nothing sacred. Is it life-changing? Certainly not for me, and I'd be hard pressed to understand how it could be for any reasonably intelligent, critically thinking person today. In the 1930s maybe, but today? In the end the book reminded me of nothing so much as The Catcher in the Rye, another book I find dated and overrated to the extreme."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"\\"Every poor man's desire is punishable by law.\\"I just thought I would mention that the main character's name, Bardamu, is almost an exact anagram for 'Rimbaud', the French poet that lived a generation before Celine. I wonder if this is intentional or not? you decide"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine seems like the attempt here was to write 'the' great coming of age/teen angst novel, but instead, published the stuff from his wastebasket. This is as poor of a storyline as this 'book' ever develops. It's impulsive and boring at the same time, timid and defiant against only the reader. Unless you are buying this for the sheer challenge of completing a miserably confused and malleable author's diary, I recommend ANY OTHER BOOK."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine belongs to the school of such literary dynamitards as Lautremont and Henry Miller. &quot;Journey Into the End of the Night&quot;, which has been acclaimed as one of the most subversive and radical books of the twentieth century, however, fails to match either Lautremont or Miller in terms of content or style. Though it's fuelled by the same spirit of discontent and loathing of humanity, Celine's effort is an unmistakably drab and plodding in comparison. His writing fails to exude the aroma of malice so potently diffused by the &quot;Chants du Maldoror&quot;; nor does it measure up to the pyrotechnic displays of imagery that characterise Miller's &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. Those who expect the same of Celine will be sorely disappointed. The wearisome plot involves the reflections and tribulations of an insipid hero as he progresses from being a corporal in the First World War, onto his experiences in French colonial Africa and his poverty in Europe and America. All this is told in the driest prose, through 400+ pages that duly tax the reader's attention. Celine's descriptions of war, greed, folly and degradation sound as those of a man of the left, though he was eventually to become a vehement right-winger (like so many men of his generation) and an apologist of Nazism. Not only does his writing not reach the scale and quality of Miller, his descriptions of disease and atrocity in the tropics are even surpassed by the likes of such pro-Establishment birds as Joseph Conrad in his &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;; similarly, his account of poverty is far inferior to George Orwell's &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;. It is mystifying how such an incorrigibly poor writer could have risen to a position of such importance among lterary critics and connossieurs."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine is one of the 20th century's great writers? Hardly. Granted, I read the book in English, but I have to imagine that the translator served his author well. A good part of my dissatisfaction with Celine's wearing and wearying jeremiad against society is due to my age. If I were 20 (the time when one is most susceptible to his sort of French anomie), I probably would have loved it. Now that I'm 43, I think Celine is full of merde. I remember reading in a biography of Allen Ginsberg that he and William Burroughs (I think it was Burroughs) once visited Celine to pay him homage. If I had visited Celine, it would have been to belt him in the mouth. Celine rants incessantly against human cruelty, yet was a notorious Nazi collaborator. That aside, 400-plus pages of the snide whinings of a reprehensible, morally insolvent jerk really taxed my patience. Celine also stretched my credulity; I found it hard to believe his narrator was a doctor (which Celine was, too). Working my way to the end of this book was a chore I never want to repeat. I give the book one star because I thought the scenes in Africa were fairly interesting. Overall, though, Journey to the End of the Night is one of the worst novels I've ever read. Getting through it chapter by chapter was definitely Death on the Installment Plan."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine has a knack for making esoteric pseudo-philosophical observations about his own life and trying to apply them to everyone's life. The topics of these observations can be quite banal and only serve to distract, quite purposefully I assume, from the hollow plot. The introduction of the deus ex machina, Robinson, halfway through the book is when the descent to atrocity is reached. It's as if Celine ran out of ideas and was forced to contrive the last half of the book."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I have to admit that after reading this book and its follow on &quot;I am a masochist.&quot; From the start, it is almost impossible to describe the levels of self debasement Celine puts his character through.

In most cases they don't start on a very high plane.I don't believe for a minute that the scenarios pulled screaming from Celines mind are something the reader will carry with him / her after having have thrown the book down in disgust. The general feeling, yes, anything else, no.The writing style, at least as translated, is a slow go.As to why I finished it, the first sentence is my confession and excuse. There was something that held me. The friend who recommended kept asking, &quot;weren't they funny?&quot; To that I can state, for me a resounding &quot;NO&quot;. He asked, &quot;Were they good?&quot; The answer to that is given above."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I worry about the poor lost souls who rave on about how good this book is. I can only imagine these are the same people listen to the Doors endlessly, thinking Jim Morrison was a &quot;poet&quot; (HA!) and own every book Bukowski ever churned out. (Bukowski was one of the worst, most hypocritical writers of the century. His work is also shockingly brainless.) So-called &quot;artists&quot; like Celine, Morrison, and Bukowski will forever be the refuge for those poor souls too impatient and unintelligent to read true writers like Dos Passos and Byron. These so-called &quot;artists&quot; are also the most hypocritical of any I have known. Especially Celine. He raves on about how no known understands compassion any more and how he's suffering so much (Bukowski did this as well) and then casually laughs as someone beside him is blown away, and says &quot;good-riddance&quot;.

Not that this would spoil it for anyone interested in what has the feel, frankly, of David Sedaris/Kurt Vonnegut if either was German: it's all about the laffs, the laffs that bring up a little bile...if you are angry enough to read this book, why not go all the way and read Nietzsche's Zarathustra?

The older translation drops words and entire phrases that may be offensive or overly explicit -- a strange choice, since anyone capable of reading Celine from beginning to end probably is not easily offended to begin with. It is also rather at odds with the novel's ethic: a physician's unflinching clinical eye exposing the ugly things in the dark.As a general rule, all explicit references to anatomy are censored. Some examples. P. 214: \\"au boud de mon organe\\" becomes \\"in its proper place.\\" P. 261: \\"on ne pouvait rien voir de son vagin\\" becomes \\"I couldn't examine her properly.\\"Explicit references to sexuality are toned down. Examples: p. 260, \\"sa maniere de se faire baiser a des profondeurs inoubliables et de jouir comme un continent\\" becomes \\"her gift for tremendous delights, for enjoyment to her innermost depths.\\" P. 211: \\"vin du pas cher, de la masturbation, du cinema\\" becomes \\"the cheapest wine, the movie, anything.\\" P. 199, the \\"...\\" indicates another excision: \\"Meme a se masturber\\"Even relatively innocuous language gets toned down: \\"merde\\" is usually translated as \\"filth,\\" \\"salaud\\" as \\"bloody.\\"By themselves, these little changes aren't a big deal, but they're so consistent that it does change the overall tone -- above all, it makes the book lose its clinical severity, its unblemished, open-eyed quality, substituting more euphemistic and tactful language for frankness. That misses the personality of the book.Overall it's a decent translation, but I'd be curious to know if the new translation avoids these problems. If it does, you might be better off reading Manheim's version.***AddendumAs I've gotten further into the book, I've found much more egregious cases of censorship in the older translation, so I strongly recommend people try this new translation. For example, some passages COMPLETELY EXCISED (the first for blasphemy, apparently, the second one for scatological humor):p.363 in the English translation is missing:\\"Par example a present c'est facile de nous raconter des choses a propos de Jesus-Christ. Est-ce qu'il allait aux cabinets devant tout le monde Jesus-Christ? J'ai l'idee que ca n'aurait pas dure longtemps son truc s'il avait fait caca en public. Tres peu de presence, tout est la, surtout pour l'amour.\\"p.382 (mostly excised, not completely):\\"Elle faisait a presents 'des vents en allant a la selle, que c'etait comme un vrai feu d'artifice...Qu'a cause de ses nouvelles selles, toutes tres formees, tres resistantes, il lui fallait redoubler de precautions...elle etait obligee de se mettre de la vaseline alors avant d'aller aux cabinets.\\"p.384 (\\"after a moment of friendliness...\\")\\"je me suis tortille autour de son ventre comme un vrai asticot d'amour.

What possible excuse can there be?Celine is, as Camus would have it, a 'judge-penitent' - passing on his story in apparent innocence, so that you too may share the awful weight of his vision.

No one notices."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"This novel, despite the blurb on its cover touting its \\"scabrous nihilism,\\" actually winds up also affirming our struggle to keep such nihilism at bay. As we read on pg. 189: \\"What with being chucked out of everywhere, you're sure to find whatever it is that scares all those bastards so. It must be the end of the night, and that's why they're so dead set against going to the end of the night.\\" The start reminds me of the post-WWI antiwar novel by Remarque, \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" or the later Dalton Trumbo screed \\"Johnny Got His Gun.\\" The African section energizes a Conradian \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by bringing in more recognizably human characters rather than archetypes. Sergeant Alcide and the family bringing their rubber to trade at the store both leap off the page, and what Chinua Achebe has labored for many chapters to convey here becomes conveyed dramatically, ironically, and memorably in much fewer paragraphs.The American episodes recalled for me Kafka's \\"Amerika\\" with their mix of comedy and confusion amidst industrial and urban freneticism. Celine anticipates Orwell's \\"Down and Out in Paris and London,\\" which Eric Blair was exploring at the same time, roughly, as the latter part of Celine's epic. The return to France, not even halfway through the book, and the subsequent medical pursuits, arrive at not even the halfway point of the book, and you wonder how the plot (such as it is) will continue.The humanism does reoccur, if sporadically, and every page contains aphoristic wisdom, often wittily if no less honestly uttered by Ferdinand. I'd like to find out, after reading this, how much \\"really\\" happened to Celine and how much was invented or revamped. I suppose, more than most authors, that the ties between reality and imagination on the page are drawn tighter than usual, in the style of \\"autobiographical fiction\\" like Francis Stuart's \\"Black List, Section H,\\" by another author who found himself pursuing for the sake of artistic integrity less than popular stances during WWII. No surprise, as I'm reading Anthony Cronin's Beckett bio, that Sam was influenced by Celine, too. As such a work of uneasy inspiration from a raucous mind, Celine's craft might fall short of the formal perfection expected from the highest caliber of \\"classic\\" authors, but he errs for honesty's sake. He castigates modernism and transcends it. Instead, he pioneers existentialist 20c statements that challenge the primacy or the substitution of art for God.I understand that Celine's later works fall much more into this darker zone between self-justification and self-release by prose. This novel was worth every long moment it took. It flows rapidly, yet demands close attention, curiously. You cannot enter into the mind of Ferdinand without being shaken up, and the author's narrative voice demands your full engagement. A bracing and novel, to use the French and the English terms, experience. In the end, you remember the moving moments of generosity, courage, and defiance amidst the grime and gloom."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Intense compression of ideas, events, locale makes this the rare novel without any filler -- by turns harrowing and laugh-out-loud funny. Although I consider it the best case cowardice has ever made for itself, this is paradoxically a book for the brave: those with the courage, confronted with life's endless horror and hypocrisy, not to look the other way.

It ranks with me the most significant piece of literature ever written."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"When most of us think of the great writers of the centuries, most people can agree on a few of them. Dostoyevski, Cervantes, Swift, Proust, Joyce, but the name Celine usually brings about either extreme contempt or quiet ignorance, neither of which are deserved. None of his books prove that more than &quot;Voyage Au But De Las Nuis&quot;, a virtual mass of hallucinations and distortions that have proven more real than the realities that provoked them. No, there aren't the ellipses, the fragmented thoughts (or &quot;my three dots...my supposed original style...real writers will tell you what they think&quot; as he mockingly said) that became his trademark technique, but both the blackness and the humour have never been in better form. Yes, I have read all of his works, and yes I will always scream that his books should be taught to schoolkids all over, and I know that ideas like that would only be seen as the &quot;degredation of our youth&quot;, if you want to see where 20th Century Literature REALLY sprang from (go ahead, look it up...most of the greatest authors of this century from Henry Miller on have claimed Celine, and, especially, this book, as the springboard for their artistic triumphs. Miller, Gunter Grass, Kerouac, Burroughs, Bukowski, Joseph Heller, Kurt Vonnegut, Norman Mailer, Kenzabura Oe, Nin, and the list can keep going), &quot;Journey&quot;s definately the place to start.

As a man who has experienced war, a voyage to Africa, a brief stay in America, and finally becomes a Doctor in a suburb of Paris, Louis travels the gamut of his own soul.In his trek to the end of the night, he entertains the reader with his sarcasm, and insight into human nature. He sees the pig in all people.However, I found myself lost in translation at times. Louis can become quite abstract in his thoughts. Ramblings change the scenery quickly. Suddenly you find yourself in New York city, when only pages ago you were reading about fevers in Africa.

Bardamu is a man without illusions about life, without any hopes. He lives the senselesness of life with clear conscience, like Camus's \\"homme absurde\\". But this conscience doesn't make him desperate. Curiosity is his recipe against desperation. He knows that life, even if void of sense, is nonetheless interesting. So he puts himself in infinite different situations, he always searches new experiences. Not to draw any rational knowledge from this experiences. He's a perfect \\"phenomenologist\\", he just wants to experience.This man without hopes, ideals or expectations has a peculiar \\"candeur\\". He tries to be objective about life. Mostly he looks at things and formulates negative opinions, but he's also able to recognize the few cases of real goodness he meets (I'm thinking of Molly and Alcide). I'd say that his behaviour is \\"cynical\\", in the original meaning of the term: without feelings. This allows him to be more objective than other people are...This book is maybe the best of the last 50 I read. I thought to have found THE MAN! So i was really disappointed from his other books. They are very desperate: no more objectivity, no more \\"candeur\\", only a crusade against life!"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Louis-Ferdinand Destouches (Celine was a pseudonym) was, like Steiner's Hitler, certainly an inspired man of his time, perhaps terrifyingly so. Born in 1894 to a lowly Parisian family, he had a brutal childhood. Poor, dysfunctional, but recklessly ambitious, he longed to escape all that constrained him. He eventually found a release of sorts through the study of medicine and, after patriotically enlisting, in the trenches of the western front. He was seriously wounded and later decorated.Celine's revulsion against his wartime experiences infused his debut, Journey to the End of Night (1934), perhaps the greatest work of nihilism, as well as one of the finest novels, of the century. The first hundred pages or so contain descriptions of the absurd carnage of war that few works, not even Erich Maria Remarque's, All Quiet on the Western Front, have matched. After the war, Celine qualified as a physician and traveled in French and Belgian colonial Africa before returning to work as a doctor among the urban poor of Paris.Celine draws freely from his bank of experiences in Journey to the End of Night; the adventures of the hero-narrator, Fedinand Bardamu, mimic exactly those of the author himself. He travel from the \\"fiery furnace\\" of the western front to the screaming jungles of central Africa, and from New York to the slums of Paris. The engine of Celine's disgust is an irrational misanthropy. It is irrational because it is contradictory: those he scourges, he later pities; those he helps, he comes to despise.In Ferdinand's despair at what industrialization and incipient democracy have done to the contemporary soul, we are reminded of the anguish of Nietzsche's raging free spirit, Zarathustra. Like Zarathustra, Fedinand rails against the instincts of mass man and of the \\"herd,\\" then crowns himself with laughter. For without laughter he knows he is nothing. \\"Death is chasing you, you've always got to hurry, and while you're looking you've got to eat, and keep away from wars. That's a lot of things to do. It's no picnic.\\"In this astonishing book, Celine immerses the reader in a torrential flow of language--fragmented, coarse, street poetic, blackly comic and full of neologisms and ellipses. For this reason, one can only reap the full impact of Celine when he is read in the original French. He writes of suffering, debased lives and poverty with reckless abandon. His vision of humanity in thrall to its own weakness is utterly cynical. He leads his characters--Robinson, a romantic wanderer, conscripted soldiers, abused prostitutes--to the edge of the abyss, the pushes them over. As they fall we hear only the sad echo of their voices--and Celine's wild and raucous laughter."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"The most common reaction of people who don't like this book is &quot;Why does he have to be so negative?&quot; I've read it twice and have to say that in spite of what appears to be the scathing cynicism of the book, nonetheless the searching, idealistic, intelligent vitality of Bardamu comes through loud and clear. From his descriptions of the darker sides of humanity, the lighter side is brought into view, especially in Bardamu himself. He is driven by a desire that many people are deprived of while still young: to figure himself and life out to the best of his abilities. Wanderlust, restlessness and travel are his main tools of self-discovery. He moves from World War I France, to the depths of colonial Africa, to New York (described as a &quot;fully erect city&quot;) and Detroit, and back to France again. Along the way he describes his loves, hopes and losses with hilarious sarcasm and real poetry.Another reviewer seems to take exception to Bardamu's self-avowed cowardice in the face of artillery fire in the war. To this I would respond 1) we can't all be heroes, 2) there are virtues other than courage, 3) he did enlist on his own at least before deciding getting killed wasn't such a great idea. Also, in real life Celine was wounded seriously in battle and was considered a hero in France, at least until he wrote this unconventional novel. So Bardamu's vices may be a bit of a comic exaggeration. But this is all beside the point.Anyone who is looking for a ready-made homily-ridden feel-good book should perhaps avoid this one. Anyone who is willing to look for the beauty despite the filth of life should point, click and buy. It is immensely rewarding, sad, and extremely funny. Above all it is tremendously vital and reads like a galloping horse of a book."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"I first read this book during my freshman year in college. That was in 1990 - I have read it at least once a year since. I am a voracious reader, ingesting well over a hundred books each year and have not yet found another book that resonates with so much energy, grit, and beauty."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Journey to the End of the Night seems like a mixture of several novels. The first part - the one that concerns the war - echoes Voltaire's Candide, the part concerning Africa resembles Heart of Darkness, and the rest sounds like a bunch of loosely connected diary entries. The best and most cohesive part, say I, is the first, in which Celine skewers patriotism, heroism, nationalism and the like in the most corrosive way imaginable. The rest are iffy. True, there are some outright hilarious parts, but here's the thing: all the humour is told in much the same fashion and involves much the same topics. Thus, after awhile it seems repetitive and ceases to really work. The same goes for Bardamu's nihilism - after awhile, it's just...tiring. Thus, I found the best parts of the book to be the ones where Celine actually treats certain people with kindness. There are very few of these, but you'll know them when you see them. For instance, the conclusion to the chapter about the prostitute Molly is oddly extremely poignant, made all the more so by the oppressive characterizations of the rest of the book. Later, Celine spends a lot of time about one Robinson and his connection to the Henrouille family - an amount of time I found to be entirely disproportionate to the value of this subject. From that point, the book doesn't really pick up. The focus on Robinson, I must say, completely mystified me; he is suddenly presented as Bardamu's constant travelling companion and best friend, even though his status as such is never established anywhere in the book. By contrast, Bardamu's misadventures in America are, with the exceptions of his encounter with his ex-girlfriend Lola and his meeting Molly, largely glossed over. Thus, I can only describe Journey to the End of the Night as &quot;uneven.&quot; You should still probably read it, though."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Long live Celine! &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot; is as raucous, intimate and disturbingly human as any book written in the last hundred years. Imbued with a biting wit and a matchless diabolical mirth, Celine invites comparison with Nietzsche, H.L. Mencken and Ambrose Bierce. Yes, he will--like all artists of the first rank--offend lesser individuals: Weak-minded, right-thinking junior college-educated halfwits who can't wait to sound off on their BORROWED opinions and State-sanctioned Politically Correct ideals. . . . And for this, I can't thanks Celine enough! Vive l'art!"},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"The book in question is a triumph in every sense of the word. If you aren't taken in from the first couple of pages then do yourself a favor and kill yourself immediately. What Celine is able to do here is not only to paint a portrait of a character, or of a type, but in the end the whole of humanity. Much of the humanity in question is not pleasant, nor are the situations they force the poor, but resourceful and essentially strong, protaganist into. If you've ever found yourself in a foreign country with little idea of what is expected from you, then you can relate. If you have had family members or girlfriends encourage you to go die in a useless foreign war, then you can relate. If moments of tenderness wash over you and then crash against the shores of existential absurdity, then you can relate. If have not only a heart, but an eye, and a head to perceive the world by then you can relate to this great work of art. Celine is called cynical, but his cynicism is the kind of a failed romantic, not of a mysanthrope. If you can see past the bitter veneer what you'll find is a person who always expects alittle more from his fellow human beings than he usually gets, and despite his protests he usually gives despite himself. This might be a bit harsh- but I don't think so- if you read this book and don't get it, don't see the humor and absurdity, or the love that runs beneath it, than you are a worthless mass of flesh and bone and should find a way to save the rest of the world from your continued prescence. This book is a litmus test of humanity."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Celine is often lumped together with Henry Miller (who admired him), but Celine is the better writer, at least in Journey to the End of the Night. (And in Ralph Manheim's translation.) Like Miller, Celine writes about Paris and his relations with women.

Help!&quot; I shouted, just to see if it would have any effect on them. None whatsoever. Those people were pushing life and night and day in front of them. Life hides everything from people. Their own noise prevents them from hearing anything else. They couldn't care less. The bigger and taller the city, the less they care. Take it from me. I've tried. It's a waste of time. --from Journey to the End of the NightJourney is very much what it sounds like -- a loosely autobiographical wandering that starts with the author enlisting almost by accident to fight in WWI. He doesn't waste time describing the war as being a giant, immoral waste of everyone's time and life, really, with the soldier's main mission of the day being little more than looking for a place to eat without getting his head shot off. And to treat it as anything more than that, Celine suggests, is something of a waste of time: What's more important to any discussion of war than its inherent stupidity? The same, it seems, goes for the rest of the story -- the basic undercurrent of the story is the world's core idiocity and how you deal with it (if you choose to). Bardamu, Celine's alter ego, heads for the USA and back, into the slums of Paris and the Congo, and never manages to escape the stupidity and brutality of the men around him. It's not a story of escape, but understanding, you do what you can with what you have. Soon the only way to keep the rest of the world at bay is to use the terror tactics of those around you in reverse... and of course, it's only a matter of time before that backfires as well..."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"A French novel written in the 1930s showcasing a bitter and misanthropic narrator who engages in increasingly depressing misadventures while dispensing cynical nuggets of philosophy regarding the world that he lives in? Sign me up!That said, I had some idea of what I was in for. Through some quirk of queuing, I wound up reading the nominal sequel to this (thematic sequel at least) \\"Death on the Installment Plan\\", which takes the style that was laid down in this story and somehow makes it even more raw and savage, with copious usage of ellipses to make every sentence seem like it was splattered down on the page by someone who only knows how to express themselves by making a cut and seeing how the blood hits the page.This novel, by comparison, is bleak but stylistically not as brutal, coming across as a fairly normal novel with some unusual subject matter. The tale here is semi-autobiographical, following a narrator named Ferdinand as he rambles his way across life, starting with his experiences in WWI, followed by a trip to America and then back to France to open up a medical practice in the slums of Paris. Along the way he keeps encountering Robinson, a fellow with perhaps an even bleaker view of life than his (or at least a more opportunistic view) and a habit of getting things done that eventually won't end well for him.It's pretty unrelenting stuff, as Ferdinand moves from one abject scene of human misery to another, whether it's the war or Africa or the slums . . . no matter where he goes things are going wrong and he's there to record it all in his unflinching voice. Celine's voice here is one of the most unique in all literature because it never blinks and it never stops. The novel is filled with the internal chatter of Ferdinand, cataloging and recording and analyzing and trying to make sense of what he's seeing, even as he understands that there really is no sense. Life is inherently unfair and not just as bad as you might think, but worse. People are going to suffer and die and there's not much rhyme or reason for it. People are going to be petty and selfish (this includes him, as he engages in more than a few acts that don't exactly benefit those around him) as they move forward through a life that is meaningless and painful and over too soon, even if that ending comes as somewhat of a relief. Ferdinand definitely believes there's no point to anything and the sooner that everyone realizes that, the better. Not that life will be better, but at least the truth will be out there. It's a rather brutal book in its tone.And yet, it's a beautiful book all the same. Written in a style that sounds like it was pulled directly from the streets, Ferdinand spits and rants and once in a while engages in a horrified whisper across the pages, describing every sight in a style that is both plain and lyrical, maintaining a grittiness while also attempting to scale poetical heights almost by accident . . . he spends a lot of time just musing over life in general, both in extended monologue and general rapid-fire asides, putting forward a pessimistic philosophy where nothing matters, achieving insights as the world collapses in slow-motion around him, staring at a apocalypse that no one else sees because it's happening all the time. People looking for a plot are missing the point entirely, much like life itself it's not about what happens as much as the journey it takes you to get there and every event, every incident, every time Ferdinand witnesses a situation of stunning despair or treats someone like absolute crap simply because he can, you get a quotable line on nearly every page, one that makes you want to go back and read it again, so carefully composed is the insight. Even as the insight itself threatens to drag the book, and you, further into the dark.Yet, with all that said, I don't want to turn people off from how FUNNY this book can be. Granted, it's gallows humor at best, a flippant joke said right before the train runs you over, or the bemused resignation of the elderly man who realizes he has more days behind him than ahead, but Ferdinand not only has a sharp eye for what's wrong with the world, but a keen sense of where the humor is in it. It's not knee-slapping slapstick humor, but it certainly isn't four hundred pages of a Fugazi album either. Ferdinand rants and despairs, but he's alive and no matter what happens in the book, he seems to have no desire not to be alive. At times he sees no point to living, but he's going to live as long as he can manage. The book itself is alive, the prose crackling with the words of a man who refused to look away, who refused to become all artsy and pretentious to bring what he saw to us. It swaggers and screams and scratches at a dark wall that it can't scale and can't break through or see around, but it never stops. Because stopping would giving up, and when you've got something to say, even if you're just spitting angry sparks out into the ether, you keep doing it. Because you never know who might still be listening, even today."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"The other one being Joyce's Ulysses. Celine is not well known among the anglophones as he should be. I cannot read French myself and am grateful for this translation. The novel is possibly the finest description of the human condition at the start of the XX century and well applies for the rest of it. After witnessing the mechanized horror of WWI in which old Europe arguably died, the Author became a physician among the Paris poor where he quickly gained notoriety for refusing to charge for his services. Goes on to show that most of the people do not recognize a blessing when it hits them straight into face. Stylistically this novel is not the lavish wordplay that Joyce's is but most will appreciate hard clear prose on it's own merits.Celine is considered by many critics to be the highlight of non positivist view of the humanity's achievements with Ernst Junger being his German counterpart.Oh yes, this is the novel read by one of the scheming teenagers (Neve Campbell's character) in the movie Wild Things for the more pop minded among you."},{"Title":"Journey to the End of the Night","review":"Although i am sure i am not as elequent and informed on the author as some of the reviewers for this work, I have to say that i love this book.

On the topic of communion bread, the book says, \\"Our communion bread is homemade by different families in our church.\\" The loaves shown are obviously leavened. Any ingredients other than wheat flour and water in communion bread used in the Latin rite would make it illicit. If more than a certain proportion of the ingredients are anything but wheaten flour and water (honey, shortening, leaven, etc.) the communion would become invalid.

For instance, it has a nice index in the back, naming different items used in the Mass. It also has a section explaining the vestments worn by the priest, using the names of each. I think that is good for children to learn, so they know the proper terms. It also explains the Tue Presence of Jesus in the bread and wine, which is the most important thing that takes place inside a Catholic Church. It explains what the holy water is used to remind us of every time we use it as we enter the church. And the illustrations are certainly colorful and would be engaging to most any child who picked up the book.The problems I had with this book: First, the layout of the church building itself was unlike most Catholic churches in the area where I live (Georgia). For instance, some of the pews are actually positioned behind the altar, which is strange (to me - maybe not in CA, which is where the authors/illustrator are said to live in the info on the back flap). Also, the tabernacle is in a side chapel rather than behind the altar, where Jesus has his place as the center of the Mass. Then the text mentions seeing the church members (such as the lectors) in the procession along with the priest. I don't know that that is licit, and we don't see it in our own church or the other churches in the South that we have visited. The biggest problem I see is the section in which it talks about how different families in the parish take turns making the bread used for communion in their own kitchens. I don't believe this is licit either, particularly since the illustrations show the bread to be fluffy, as if yeast were used (which is certainly not licit). However, the index in the back does a good job explaining that the bread must be unleavened, so there is some confusion here as there is a conflict in what is presented in the story vs, what is written in the index.I do realize the book has an Imprimatur, but I know that parts of this book would be confusing to my daughters, so I am glad that I have pre-read it myself. It is too bad because of the good information contained in this book, but that can all be found elsewhere without the confusion of the homemade communion bread and such.As a side note, there were a few random things in the illustrations which I couldn't make sense of: a woman walking a harnessed pig down the street, and two nuns in the back seat of a pink 50's style convertible... where were they going, and who was driving, and why? The carnival theme on the cover is bright and appealing, but it too seems a little random."},{"Title":"A Peek into My Church","review":"Perfect for my first grade religous education class.

Amusing coincidence that just grabbing the first author alphabetically on the list gave me a story set in and around my home town of Nowra. Several enjoyable local references - almost enough to be a mere selling gimmick - but not profound insights into the soul of the area.The plot meanders along OK, with events racing to a standard sensational climax with virtually no falling action. Bedford overuses the same techniques to remind us how she defines cool: her heroine is constantly enjoying European food and wine, and has an absurd amount of baths. There's also a fairly unsubtle pushing of values - a mandatory casual sex encounter, ticking boxes about aborigines and the environment, and a pretty outrageous italicised instruction to the reader about how to judge a lesbian relationship, 'Good, they make a fine couple those two.' As if that wasn't enough, Bedford ladles it on with the plot: Lesbians are the sort of people who lovingly look after the mentally disabled - whereas constructionalists are nazis who want to kill them, gottit?The characters aren't quite wafer thin - but I suspect we're getting a reflection of a fairly shallow perception of the author. While the heroine at one point states something like, 'If I learned one thing in my business, people are always more complex than a first impression can tell you,' the book totally negates it. People never surprise us and are rigidly classed as goodies and baddies. And the political correctness is pretty stifling: we're very clearly told, for example, what to think about constructionalists and environmentalists.So, no, I haven't found another Perez-Reverte, and would probably only have enjoyed it if my smug view of the world corresponded more closely to that of Bedford."},{"Title":"Author and Agent: Eudora Welty and Diarmuid Russell","review":"This is a knockout of a book.

Charley, a young, benevolent, middle-class Englishman goes on holiday to Paris at Christmas-time. There, with a sardonic childhood friend, he undergoes a rite of passage common to youths of earlier eras: a visit to a brothel, here an expensive one (the S&egrave;rail) where he meets Lydia, a Russian prostitute who works there ostensibly to help her convict husband, but, she confesses to him, where she is actually expiating the sin of murder committed by her husband through selling her body to despised and despising men. She has had a difficult life: impoverished childhood, early marriage to a charming youth who hides his criminal activities from her until committing a murder for which he is sentenced to Cayenne. Lydia, aware of his malevolent side, nonetheless has always loved and always will love this man and here Maugham convincingly portrays the irrationality, pain, and depth of love. After spending several days dining, dancing, visiting the Louvre, sharing a bedroom but never bed, Charley and Lydia part, he to his comfortable home and job in England, she back to the S&egrave;rail. Yet after returning to familiar surroundings he notices that all is not as it was: he has been changed by this &quot;holiday&quot; and, as he reflects, the bottom has dropped out of his world.Maugham was deprecated, perhaps due to jealousy of his success, by some literati of his day. Yet he did have a good control of language, solid descriptive skills, and a definite talent for narrative, all evident in &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot;, making it a book that rings true and remains with one afterward."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"Although this may not be the masterpiece of 20th literature, I have to admit that it was a very absorbing read. As we follow Charly, the well-bred perfect English gentlemen, through his week long vacation in Paris, we become ensnared in the life story of the prostitute he befriends and her web of friends and acquaintances. The story itself is interesting in its own right, but what really makes the narrative flow is how Maugham lets us peer into the psyches of various characters, all from different social strata. My personal favorite was Berger, Lydia's husband who despite his rogue behavior was one of the more memorable (and even likable) characters. Simon, Charly's friend was drawn perhaps a bit too extremely, but Maugham does use that to some effect. In any case, a fun read and a good story."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"Maughm has the unusual talent of baring truths about human nature in a most simplified fashion.

Maughm writes with a fluidity that cannot be matched by any other writer. He is simply the best at his art - storytelling."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"I've read most of Somerset Maugham's major novels, and many of his short stories. He is one of my favorite English authors, mostly because of the skill with which he so easily marries place, time, and scenery into the drama at hand. The motivations and actions of his characters are generally believable and in tune with their characterization. Christmas Holiday is no exception, although in my book it's far behind his three best novels, \\"Of Human Bondage\\", \\"The Razor's Edge\\", and \\"The Moon and Sixpence\\". I like the story, but after two readings continue to find it less memorable than the novels just mentioned, or many of his South Pacific short stories.Charley Mason, a middle class college student from England is given a holiday in Paris by his Babbit-esque father during Christmas-time. He gladly accepts, and there, looks up his philosophically engrossed friend, Simon. Simon has been living a spartan lifestyle, filling his head with fascist political idealogy. No matter how friendly Charley tries to be, Simon pushes him away in a misguided attempt to make himself \\"hard\\" and impervious. The interactions between Simon and Charley remind me of those between Anthony Beavis, Helen Amberley, and Mark Staithes in Aldous Huxley's, \\"Eyeless in Gaza\\". Both novels, which were written in the late 1930's, portray the tense build-up to WWII, and the brewing hostility of zealous fascists. Maugham certainly came across people seduced by fascist ideaology at this time, and Simon is the fictional incarnation of these uncompromising dogmatists.The bulk of the story evolves around Charley's lengthy discussions with a young Russian prostitute named Lydia, introduced to him by Simon. Lydia is really the main focus of the novel, and it's her wild, and dramatic life-story which captivates and eventually opens Charley's naive and sleepy eyes to the complexities of the world, and especially women. Instead of using her for pleasure, as Simon had intended, Charley be-friends her (in accord with his gentlemanly nature) and spends his vacation time getting to know her. The best parts about the novel to me are Maugham's descriptions of the Parisian background. Unlike Huxley, Maugham has a play-write's acute sensibility to atmosphere, and is very comfortable describing and utilizing scenery: Charley's comfortable English home, Simon's spartan studio, Charley's pleasant hotel room, the streets of Montparnasse, the smoky cafes, bars, and restaurants, the Louvre, St. Eustache, French Guyanna, etc. are all vividly drawn. Each significant conversation between the characters takes place in a location which enhances and compliments the larger story. At the Louvre when Lydia shows Charley her favorite painting, a simple picture of bread and wine by Chardin, and tells him what it means to her, Charley, who had been reminiscing and searching for all the \\"significant\\" paintings his art-snob mother had so eloquently spoken to him of, is visably affected.The contrast between Charley and all that he represents, with Lydia and her tragic world, is the heart of the novel. The main drawbacks to me are Robert Berger's (Lydia's imprisoned husband)overly-consuming story, and the seemingly sleight handling of Charley throughout. The Robert Berger mystery is interesting in itself, but sometimes didn't jibe well with the \\"Charley Mason explores and comes of age in Paris\\" storyline. And Maugham sometimes seems ambiguous about likable characters like Charley (or, Larry in \\"The Razor's Edge\\"). I think this reflects Maugham's increasing bitterness in old age, ala Lord Henry Wotton (\\"Dorian Gray\\"). As always with Maugham, there has to be drama, and I think Maugham's self-described status as \\"the best of the second-raters\\" is never more apropos than in Christmas Holiday."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"Christmas Holiday is probably Somerset Maugham's forth most important novel after &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;,&quot;The Moon and Sixpense&quot; and &quot;The Razors Edge.&quot; At the time of its publication, &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; was considered to be his most well written book, but it has not withstood the test of time. It is also about writers, and writers writing about writers is lazy self-centered writing. Holiday in the European language is also a vacation, and this is a story of a young man on a five day trip to Paris. Instead of exclusively Maxim's, The Moulon Rouge, and sight seeing he falls inside the seamy side of life. The story takes us from Paris to French Guinea and Devil's Island prison colony. The young man returns to London a changed man, but not the way his parents intended. On another level Maugham was making a statement on the self complacency of the British and their reluctance to fight Fascism {i.e. Jack London's &quot;The Iron Heal&quot;} in 1937, about the time Maugham started the book. The book was recieved with bad reviews from Graham Greene and glowing reviews from many others, including Glenway Wescott who included it in a Somerset Maugham anthology he put together in book form. This is not to be confused with great literature but it is a good story and very readable, like all of Maugham. It is also for anyone interested in Paris before the War. I have recommended it to three of my well-read friends and they all thanked me for it."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"\\"Christmas Holiday\\" takes place in a period of interlude between the two world wars in England and France when the worst in world affairs was not over but yet to come. For Charley Mason, the young Englishman the gift of 5 days in Paris his parents have given him turns out to be less the anticipated celebration and more of an unsettling interlude in his own life. It develops for him into a revelatory journey that blemishes his happy heart and privileged home life. He reunites in Paris with a troubled boyhood friend Simon now a news reporter who he hasn't seen for two years. Charley is bewildered and tries to gain perspective on Simon's seeming metamorphosis into a self-confessed misanthropist and insensitive manipulator. It is Simon who lays out all the sores of humanity for Charley's tender sensibilities to collide with. At the S&eacute;rail, a cabaret where bare breasted dancing girls glitter in harem pants and turbans and can be taken upstairs for a price, Simon pairs Charley with \\"Princess Olga\\" the working name of an enigmatic Russian girl named Lydia. Charley is ensnared by Lydia's anguished life story, her orphaned state, her poverty and unreasonable devotion to a convict husband whose imprisonment and guilt she feels she must share through her own continued suffering. For a brief time the reality of Charley 's respectable, comfortable and secure existence becomes entwined with those whom fate has not so similarly blessed. His\\"Holiday\\" changes him forever.Here again Maugham's gift for telling a story is evident. He uses words with a facility that brings a narrative to life in a way that engages the imagination and enables the reader to vividly picture the characters and events. A recommended read."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"It has been said that the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature is adverse to mass-market success, which may explain in part why W. Somerset Maugham never received its honor. During the 1930s, a period of economic collapse and social turmoil, Maugham was the world's highest-paid author and lived a comfortable life at his house on the French Riviera. The Englishman was a household name amongst readers and is widely known today, but his success during a bleak period caused resentment in the literary set.A second disadvantage, perhaps even more glaring, was Maugham's use of an obsolete writing style. Though considered a modernist, his fiction is cast in a simplified Victorian language that at times seems out of place with the subject matter. Even through the 1940s, Maugham's approach went practically unchanged while a younger generation of writers broke new ground. When Maugham, for instance, published his incomparable 'The Razor's Edge' in 1944, George Orwell had just completed 'Animal Farm' and Samuel Beckett had published his short story cycle 'More Pricks Than Kicks' ten years before.'Christmas Holiday,' first published in 1939, is a later Maugham novel that receives no favors from his archaic, straightlaced prose. Though effective at times, his storytelling doesn't fit the era it is depicting and reads like a 1930s social commentary through the eyes of Anthony Trollope. Published just before the outbreak of World War II, it is an unbalanced, often neurotic tale in which Maugham seems to be fighting against developments that endangered western tradition. It is difficult for an author of Maugham's talent to write a 'bad' novel, but he was extremely close with 'Christmas Holiday' to achieving the feat.Set in 1930s Paris, 'Christmas Holiday' is divided into ten lengthy chapters. The focal character is Charley Mason, a 23-year-old Cambridge graduate and descendant of a property-owning family who is vacationing alone on Christmas week. Most of his dealings are with Simon Fenimore, a boyhood friend now working as a journalist, and Lydia, a Russian prostitute to whom Simon introduces him. As a sensitive, artistic young man who acts out of pity for her sordid lifestyle, Charley travels through the city and shares a depressing hotel room with Lydia for nearly his entire visit.Charley's trip becomes something of an underground odyssey. Lydia is the wife of Robert Berger, a thief who was sent to French Guiana for murdering a horse racing bookie. We learn through her recollections and those of Simon, who covered Berger's trial, about a love affair with tragic results. These accounts, told in flashback style, carry a high amount of suspense and are made quite interesting by the fact that Simon, a devoted nihilist, was amused by Berger's personality. Charley also encounters the Russian refugee community and two survivors of Guiana who further build up his perspective on life.Maugham, who was 65 at the time of Christmas Holiday's publication, seems to be rehashing a great deal of his earlier novels. Charley's initial dilemma of becoming an artist and earning decent income is akin to Charles Strickland in 'The Moon and Sixpence,' while his dealings with Lydia and her sexual ambivalence mirror Philip Carey with Mildred Rogers in 'Of Human Bondage.' The deceit and violence of Robert Berger can also be found in several of Maugham's writings, especially his short story 'The Letter.' For those acquainted with his fiction, Maugham seems to be walking old territory and desperate to understand the social landscape where tradition and values were falling apart.Aside from subject matter, 'Christmas Holiday' is sloppy in execution and in need of a rewrite. Maugham's characters sometimes break from their personality for no reason at all (Lydia suddenly jumps into a well-turned argument on politics) and the use of flashback and story-within-story cuts into the novel's pace as a whole. The book seems to lag and never really catches fire the way it should. 'Christmas Holiday' manages to be engaging, but it ranks far below classics like 'Razor,' 'Of Human Bondage,' and 'The Painted Veil.' I would only recommend it to Maugham completists and those with an appreciation of Paris during the Great Depression.Maugham's novels are available in softcover from Vintage Classics, while I have on my bookshelf (but not for long) a hardback copy of its 1939 printing from P. F. Collier & Son. Released in 2000, the Vintage edition appears to reuse Collier's original type, which is large and clear. All of Maugham's fiction, however, is worth reading."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"Charley Mason is off to spend his Christmas week in Paris and the young respectable middle-class life he knows is suddenly thrown into sharp relief as he comes into contact with a world-weary russian prostitute who's life story becomes the real center of this novel.Lydia works in a brothel and when Charlie's ascetic living friend Simon takes him there to show him a good time, Charlie befriends her instead and is drawn temporarily into her world.Maugham draws on his intimate knowledge of both cultures to draw vivid characters and in describing varied settings from the Louvre to the backstreet cafes and brothels of pre-war Paris. The tale related to Charlie by his new acquaintance is the heart of the story and quite a story it turns out to be.I recently read that this was not considered by Maugham to be one of his better novels but it is still highly entertaining, enlightening and a fine read."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"Without doubt, Maugham must be one of the most underrated authors in the English language. \\"Christmas Holiday\\" is perhaps not one of his best known novels, but it is certainly has interesting themes and characters and will give you much to think about. Written in 1939, it concerns a young man called Charley Mason, expectant and excited about a visit to Paris. The trip is a reward for Charley working with his father for a year and he intends to meet up with his old friend Simon Fenimore, who spent a lot of time with his family as a boy in school holidays, being on his own in the world. Although he filled Charley's mother with a sense of unease, Charley considers him his closest friend and looks forward to spending time with him; but when he arrives in Paris he finds Simon much changed.Charley, open hearted and unsuspicious, is hoping for an uncomplicated visit - seeing some pictures, visiting with his friend, getting out and about on the town. Instead he finds Simon less eager to see him than he hoped and then his old friend mischieviously links him up with Princess Olga in a high class bordello. Her real name is Lydia and Maugham uses Charley to unfold her story - a refugee from the revolution who falls in love with a murderer. Although war as such is never mentioned, there is a real sense of unease and despair about the book. Charley and his family are clinging to a way of life which, we are aware, will soon end forever and politics are clearly on the mind of everyone. Before long, Charley's attitudes are being challenged and his holiday is to test his comfortable beliefs.Many books with the word \\"Christmas\\" in them are either saccharine sweet or overly sentimental. Many of them are, frankly, pretty awful. If you, or your reading group, are looking for something darker, edgier, with more to discuss, this may be a good choice for you. It is not a traditional Christmas read, but unlike many on the market, you will certainly want to keep this one to read again."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"It will be a sad day for me when I run out of Somerset Maugham novels to read. Christmas Holiday is not one of his best-known books, but it is on par with the best.At the heart of the novel is a plot-driver frequently taken up by Maugham: the protagonist falls in love with someone who does not by any measure deserve him or her. Indeed, in one of the characters' own words here: '...I can't imagine anything more heart-rending than to love with all your soul someone that you know is worthless' (page 239). Such is also the premise of The Painted Veil, Theatre, The Magician, and of course of the masterpiece, Of Human Bondage. But it is given a new twist here in that the story is told from the perspective of a third party, a young Englishman on a visit to Paris.Thus the book begins with Charley Mason's decision to spend a few days in the French capital over Christmas, on a visit to a childhood friend with a foreign correspondent's posting. But the mischievous Simon has planned something else for Charley than a romp about town. Charley Mason is soon drawn to the sad tale of Lydia, Russian exile, wife of a convicted murderer, and now prostitute in a classy brothel. The focus shifts to Lydia's luckless life. Smart, sensitive, she is our sufferer of hopeless love: for the worthless Robert Berger, the small-time crook who once married her, turned killer, and is now imprisoned in Guyana. Mason is confronted with lives wasted in solitude, danger, destitution. Maugham lets us peer at the 1930s Paris underworld and the abject condition of its shipwrecked Russians. But the novel's strength draws from the contrast with Mason's own respectable and moneyed, English background. Thus Mason takes Lydia to the Louvre, only to see her play havoc with the preconceptions cherished by his family of amateur artistic patrons. And his Christmas Holiday becomes the prompt for a re-evaluation of Mason's charmed but futile-looking existence back in London.This is a rich and vividly written novel, though gloomy and perhaps not best read over a Christmas holiday itself. One of the worthiest Maughams."},{"Title":"Christmas Holiday","review":"The first thing you need to know about W. Somerset Maugham's Christmas Holiday is that it has nothing to do with Christmas.The book was written in 1939 when Maugham was 63. It is one of his last major pieces.Christmas Holiday tells the story of Charley Mason, a comfortably-born 24-year old, who spends a week-long holiday in Paris. (Yes, it is at Christmas.)Charley's father has given him the vacation and is expecting him to sow his oats a bit but this does not happen. The story that unfolds is like a set of Russian matryoshka dolls. First there's Charley, then Charley's cynical friend Simon, then the Russian woman he meets through Simon, Lydia, and finally Lydia's imprisoned husband Robert Berger, who we never meet but know a fair amount about.These people are all without the advantages Charley has in life and live an opportunistic, amoral, but passionate existence. Charley's life, on the other hand is calculated, detached, and formulaic.The book seems to have heavy autobiographical influences with Maugham representing himself in Charley. Charley, like Maugham is comfortably born, both have spent time in Paris, and both were encouraged into a profession that did not suit them. In Maugham's case is was medicine, in Charley's case it was accounting. At one point Maugham describes Charley as \\"taking to it as a duck to water\\" which is how he described his own transition from doctor to novelist.Maugham was a homosexual and Charley never has sex with Lydia, even though they spent a week in the same hotel room and she is in the profession.At a broader level, Charley (the Englishman) in the book is disabused of the protected nave life he lives, well-ordered, controlled and unemotional. When it is all over and Charley returns home to England things seem just as they were a week earlier, but Charley has changed forever.Maugham may have been making a broader characterization about the British in general. Published in 1939, the British were nave about Hitler and what was happening on the continent.

Where literature deals with ideas, fantasies and the human condition, poetry deals with the emotions, the spirit; the very qualities that raise us above the lower animals (no comments from PETA, Please!).Poetry reaches into each of us and touches that elemental being that many of us deny exists. The Legend of Light by Bob Hicok reaches in and not only touches but pokes, prods and grabs. This, his second book, is the result of winning the Felix Pollack Prize in Poetry administered by the University of Wisconsin.His writing style is deceptively simple. He does not try to fry your brain cells with polysyllabic words or convoluted conceptual phrasings or make you tap a rythym. Instead he speaks to you using common vocabulary but painting such vivid imagery that your hackles rise and you shake to settle your fur.Much of his work has a dark side or, rather, addresses the dark side we would rather ignore. Some poems are equipped with claws that dig into your heart and squeeze till tears come, tears not of pain but of empathy, of compassion. I could not finish his poem Visiting the Wall until the third attempt, his descriptive phrasing affecting me the same as if I had been there. I don't think Mr. Hicok was old enough to be a brother of mine from the 'Nam but he let me once again cry.Another favorite of mine (actually, all but about two are favorites) is Surgery. If memory serves, this was written after his own surgery. If you have ever been undrer hte knife, you can feel as he speaks.&quot;Masked, they cut you, peel backyour skin for the legend of lightto enter your body. In this momentthey love you.......&quot;In AIDS, Mr. Hicok manages to convey nothing of being a homosexual, a drug addict or a maligned lover; He does not rail at the injustice of it all. What he does very well is impart the feeling of loss, the joy of love, of needing and being needed. His poetry deals with the frustration of not being able to communicate these things, of being blocked out and locked in. In the end, as the narrator leaves home, his last thought wasBut all I can think ofis that you love as you have toand die the best you can.In the end, that's all that any of us can hope for.This slim volume (79 pages) has affected me more than most books I've read in the past year. Much of the work, as I said earlier, deals with the dark. The dark in us, the dark around us. From Neighbor, about a man living under the bridge to Dogfish Mother all are guaranteed to open the your spirit-eyes and make you feel again.It has taken me most of a year to read, re-read digest and accept what he was trying to tell me. I understood and felt everything but I also had to accept it. I have at last and encourage all of you to do the same.Thank you for joining me.Joe Zucatti"},{"Title":"The Legend of Light (Felix Pollak Prize in Poetry)","review":"The book arrived in excellent condition within scheduled delivery time.Thank you,Francine Keehnel"},{"Title":"Dinners and Nightmares","review":"I'm a huge di Prima fan, and this is an awesome book. The More or Less Love Poems are some of my favorite of all her poetry."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I know that many people do not like the idea of the Dune prequels, and I do understand this sentiment. However, I still think that this trilogy has many excellent aspects. House Corrino was no exception. While it was obviousely the weekest of the three(I'll get to that later.) it still did a great job bringing the story together and was worth the read and the money. I did feel that Brian and Kevin were running out of ideas by the time they arrived at this book. They would start and end a new plot scheme in a little over 10 pages, and the idea would have very little relevence to the rest of the story(the Caladan Invasion...). I gave the book 4 stars because the series as a whole does not deserve less in that it has incredibly ingenious ways of going into further detail about many of the minor details of Dune that were not fully explored by Frank Herbert's origional story. I would not buy the book if I didn't like the first two prequels, but for any Dune fan it should be a must have."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I am a huge fan of the original Dune series. I lost count of how many times I read Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\". Besides, I read all six of the prequels written by this duo.The Buttlerian Jihad ones are a workable space opera, where you can imagine that there were more \\"modern\\" times than the ones in the original Dune. Even though the Harkonen-Atreides conflict is really squeezed in the last few chapters.This trilogy tries to present the dark, almost gothic, feudal times of the Empire almost contemporary with the action in \\"Dune\\" as a modern day society, some with elected heads of state! And imagine that there are some planets out there without any troops defending them!!But the worst scene of all is one presenting some fremens atacking the harkonnens on some kind of \\"desert slides\\" and happily firing their laser guns. This is ludicrous. In the original \\"Dune\\" book some fremen characters express their disdain for the harkonens' usage of laser guns. And they state that they used some traps with holtzman shields to teach them \\"how to fight like men\\".Save your money."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I've said this before, and I don't intend to stop saying it, at least not until it becomes not-so-true: the only reason Brian Herbert became so well-renowned as a writer is because of his father. Which makes his attempt at improving a classic even more preposterous: at least George Lucas was the designer (at least, part-designer) of the original Star Wars.Why am I referring to Star Wars? If you've seen the prequels, you'd know already: Dune and Star Wars are both classic Sci-Fi (some say fantasy) stories. They were both told in the form of trilogies, at least at first. They both began to tell their tale part-way through. And, in creating a prequel, they both failed, in nearly the exact same way.There's another trilogy that forms a cornerstone of Sci-Fi literature. That trilogy is Foundation. Like Dune, it had stories later written to follow and precede it. However, Isaac Asimov wrote all those stories himself. Unlike in the case of Star Wars, he never had a co-writer when he made the original. And luckily, he was smart enough to write papers condoning authors stupid enough to write another writer's tale. That's why Foundation isn't in this miserable little comparison.There was something wonderful about the original Dune. Maybe it was that it didn't feel exactly like the future. It was deeply rooted in medieval times, with swordplay and feudalistic empires. You really felt like you knew the characters, and not just love them blindly: you knew their strengths, their weaknesses... the death of Duke Leto affected (and still affects) everybody who reads the original, even though you see it coming from the start.Prequel To Dune misses that feel. It sticks us in a cookie-cutter future that utterly fails to deliver. The great futuristic intregues, the wonderfully thought-out techno-thrilling plot... it not only shoots for the moon and misses, it falls back to the Earth with a resounding thud. Why can't you authors see? It's a classic because of its style. You can't improve on it, you can only produce more of the same... WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED ALL ALONG.I'm digressing from the review a bit here, but this is why the original Dune trumped the Lord of the Rings trilogy (in my opinion). LOTR was great, but now, it is seen as the ultimate cliche, even though it really isn't. Even today, however, there is nothing about Dune that is childish and predictable, at least the first time through. In the back to Dune: House Atreides, Brian brags vainly about how he successfully made his own wheels-within-wheels plot. Please, Brian. Spare us. The Prequels televise their punches even to those of us who haven't read the originals.Next similarity to Star Wars: the mysterious feel. Dune gives you a sense of wonder, even as you are told that all these things happen because of rational thought. Star Wars had the greatest concept of all time: the Force. The prequel to Star Wars, however, had midichlorians and other high-tech descriptions of this wonder, ruining the idea overall. Prequel to Dune removes the mystery. People can't be explained, Brian. Not even if you write nearly two thousand pages about them, like you did here.Final comparison: in Dune and Star Wars alike, the characters are complex, Dune even more so than Star Wars. In the prequels to each, the dialogue is horrible and the characters even more so. I LIKED Shaddam, Baron Harkonnen, Piter de Vries... because you feel what they feel, all the way through. They aren't classic villains by any sense. You get the feeling that Shaddam is a great Emperor, Harkonnen is a clever politician (more so that Leto), and that Piter, though evil through and through, is playing at games too complex even for him. Now? Every single one of them is the exact same: a soulless monster that cares about nobody but himself, and that delights in killing. I won't even mention Gaius Mohaim's character here: Bene Gesserit is a mysterious group. DON'T MAKE THEM NORMAL PEOPLE. And Fenring? I won't even tell how how sickened I was.Why did I give this two stars instead of one? One reason: you didn't butcher Paul in your series. He is still as awesome as he was before.I have blasted Brian Herbert throughout this review, but not Kevin J. Anderson. Why? Because I LIKE his stuff. I read most of his Sci-Fi, and also Frankenstein, along with Dean Koontz. I have reached a conclusion about him: alone, he's pretty awesome, though not classics-awesome. With another author, however, he just amplifies what is already there. You can't blame him for taking the chance to make Dune. You blame the greedy, not-so-talented son, who tries to usurp his father's throne.Finally, a message to Brian Herbert, wherever you are: be a good author. We're buying your stuff no matter what, because it has your father's mark on it. You can just churn out this crud all day long, or you can write what your readers want. It will take longer, sure, and we'll buy it even if it's crap. But you want to please readers, not just make money. Think about it. No matter what you daddy did to you, it's not worth ruining his series's reputation over.Oh, and on July 10, in San Francisco, there's a convention where they teach new writers to make their stories their own, original and memorable. You might want to check it out. Doubtless, George Lucas is already there.FINAL GRADE: D+"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The latest installment from Herbert Jr. and Anderson leaves a lot to be desired. House Atreides and House Harkonnen attempted to open the Dune universe to a larger audience with a more light-hearted style and an easier to follow plot. The entire trilogy makes an effort to fill some of the holes left in the original Dune novels, but the new books are not on the level Dune readers have come to expect.House Corrino was not the way I expected the trilogy to conclude. The movements of the characters seem childish and less &quot;thought-out.&quot; There is more action, yes, but it doesn't flow as well as the previous two novels, considering that this book is supposed to bridge the gap between the trilogy and the first Dune novel. Fans of the Dune universe will no doubt read this book with much anticipation, but I think the outcome they encounter will not mesh well with their expectations.This book containted far too many irrelevant subplots, the style left much to be desired, and it didn't conclude in a fashion consistent with its place in the series."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"While the second book of the first Dune prequel trilogy trudged along trying to build up suspense, the first book set the stage and was far better. The third book, though inferiour to the first, concludes the set up and end the trilogy's side stories. While interesting, it still suffer from what all prequels suffer from. We know what happens.I enjoyed the sub plots, the fact that each characters actions will have huge ramifications later on."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This picks up right where House Harkonnen left off and I would have to say its a better written story. Its almost as good as House Attreides. Book 9 expands upon the Emporer's plans to manufacture synthetic spice, and House Attreides attempts to restore Prince Rhombur back to power on Ix. When House Corrino's rulers are executed and Ix invaded and occupied by Harkonnens, House Attreides makes an effort to put Prince Rhombur, the only surviving heir to House Corrino, back into power. Meanwhile, the Emporer has plans to destroy Dune so that he can corner the spice market with his synthetic melange, 'amal.' The story climaxes when Gurney Halleck runs a Harkonnen blockade setup around planet Ix to get 'medical supplies' to House Corrino.

What a fresh change!"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The downfall of this book--as with the other Herbert/Anderson Dune prequels--is the ridiculously short chapter length. By failing to focus on individual characters or plotlines for more than a few moments at a time, they fail to provide depth of character, emotion or story.The average chapter length is three pages, which is hardly enough to give readers a taste of their characters. And instead of this style giving their work a sense of tension, the &quot;quick cut&quot; chapters only left this eager reader deeply unsatisfied.One of the many strengths of Frank Herbert's writing was the depth with which he explored his characters and settings, giving even his most imaginative creations a strong sense of reality.By contrast, the Dune prequels including House Corrino, spend too little time on any one character or plot for anything to &quot;stick&quot; in a reader's mind. This vapid style might work for MTV, but fans of the original Dune novels will be disappointed by the lack of substance."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I own all 3 books of the Dune prequel and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all.

The characters herein are handled superbly, ultimately making me love those that also appear in Frank Herbert\`s books even more than I did before. The standard of writing is very high, too.

Before you know it, it\`s 3am and you just know you\`re going to be tired as hell when you get to work.There\`s so much packed into these three books, including some moments that will stay with you long after you finish reading.I can\`t recommend them highly enough.

Shaddam may be a maniac, but his plot is rather simplistic yet with a high probability of success. To achieve his goal, he has researchers using slave labor to invent and subsequently produce Amal, a synthetic spice to replace that found on Dune.Duke Atreides has his own agenda for Ix. He plans to free the planet's population so as to thwart the plan of the Emperor though how remains a mystery. On the other hand, Duke Harkonnen of Dune has his own concept for Ix in which he becomes the great dictator. As the three forces come closer to a final confrontation, a universe hangs in the balance.The third Dune novel based on the notes of the late Frank Herbert is an entertaining tale that the diehard fans of the series will enjoy. The story line is action packed and filled with political, social, and military confrontations. At times DUNE: HOUSE CORRINO seems forced as if the authors Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson had to remind the audience (or themselves) that this is a Dune tale. Still, the plot draws to a satisfying conclusion the threads left from the previous two novels (see DUNE: HOUSE ATREIDES and DUNE: HOUSE HARKONNEN).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The original six books were masterfully written. Sir Arthur C. Clarke, probably the most honored science fiction author in history, famously said of Frank Herbert's Dune, \\"I know nothing comparable to it except Lord of the Rings.\\"THIS book, on the other hand, is pathetic. It is undeserving of the word \\"Dune\\" appearing anywhere in connection with this book. Not only House Corrino, but also all the others besides the original six.I read several of these Brian Herbert / Kevin J. Anderson prequel/sequel efforts, and every one of them is just a sorry excuse for a novel, LET ALONE a Dune novel. It is, at best, a misguided and failed attempt to honor his father, and at worst, a greedy attempt to capitalize on his father's talent as much as possible. Either way, consider yourself warned.Frank Herbert dealt with important topics (including sex, violence, politics, commerce, religion, etc.) with grace and eloquence. These Brian Herbert books, on the other hand, are a cesspool of gratuitous sex and violence, very poorly written, and a disgrace to Frank Herbert's legacy."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The 3rd book in the Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson Dune Prequal trilogy, the book picks up immediately after the end of Dune House Harkonnen with Lady Jessica pregnant or almost 16 years before the start of Dune.Whereas, at least time moves fairly briskly in the prior books, the book covers just the 9 months leading to the birth of Paul.On Dune, Chani is mentioned as being 9 months old at the start of the book and 18 months old at the end. One of the few revelations (the exact age discrepancy between Chani in Paul isn't discussed in any of the Dune books) in a book filled with contradictions in the original.In House Corrino the Amal spice substitute program reaches its peak. The Atreides scheme to take over Ix from the Teilaxu. The Sisterhood anxiously await the Atreides daughter. While the Baron does little than more than hoard spice and the Fremen do little more destroy it. Yawn times a million.The birth of Paul is well established in Dune, wasting pages of the Sisterhood protecting Jessica is pointless, especially since book never discusses why the Sisterhood just didn't take control of Paul and control their Kumkwatz Haagen Das a generation early.The Atreides take over of Ix is stupid. The authors go out of their way to establish what a great guy Duke Leto is yet, why would he risk his entire planet on a military mission that even if successful would give him nothing in return (Leto plans to just hand over Ix to Rhombur), leave him vulnerable to this enemies, and kill his political standing among his people at home? Leto would have been stupid not to keep the planet for himself. He could have put Rhombur in as governor. It's not as though Rhombur had any bargaining chips.Certainly Leto would have had a tough time justifying this act to his people, when casualties would have had to been very high and the cost enormous. And don't give me this garbage about Ix repaying the Atreides. You can't repay human lives. So there's no way that Leto survives the turmoil at home.Afterall, the people of Caladan seemed to do just fine after their Dune packs his back 15 years later and moves to Dune, without leaving any family members to rule behind.Just as stupid are all the pages devoted to the spice substitute Amal. The reader knows this project doesn't work, because in Dune, the planet is the only source of spice. In later novels the Teilaxu are successful in their quest to create a spice substitute, and apparently they were able to build it without invading Ix.I'm not going to bore readers with the list of contradictions between this book and the original series.However, I did email the authors about numerous discrepancies between this book and the original series. Kevin Anderson responded to me, blaming the discrepancies on material taken from notes left by Frank Herbert. My question is, if so much of the material was taken from Frank Herbert, wouldn't they have put his name on the cover?

I am not a fanatic who reaches for my crysknife at every inconsistency, but I miss Frank Herbert's world. The elder Herbert had the ability to make readers despise heroes, while House Corrino's characters...all the heroes are magnificent and flawless, the villains are blockheads.Many sections of the book made me laugh (although sometimes this was when the book was supposed to be deep and meaningful), but other sections were remarkably dull. I found myself skipping whole chapters to follow the plotlines I thought were interesting, and forcing myself to go back and read. In fact, most of the early part of the book was read out of duty.I thought the earlier prequels in the trilogy more interesting.

The characters are still not very beleivable, sometimes a bit cartoonish. You'll be left wondering how Shaddam or the Baron ever survived their first years, let alone came to positions of power after reading about their latest blunders, but hey, it is entertaining, albeit mildly irritating sometimes.My advice: don't take these books too seriously, just enjoy taking a look at an alternate Dune universe."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I have to admit I definitely enjoyed this book. However, that is mainly because I love the Dune universe itself. Taken as a work of science fiction literature, I found this wanting on several levels. Most of the characters became extremely flat, especially Shaddam IV and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. The pacing was off, too - in a prequel series, you can't threaten to destroy the universe to build suspense near the end. There has to be something or someone we actually care about in serious danger. All the good suspense scenes thus came early, such as the beginnings of the &quot;Great Spice War&quot; and whether Amal would succeed in any fashion.Still, though, we get to see more of the Landsraad, the noble houses, and the characters we've come to enjoy."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Dune House Corrino continues the storylines that these two authors created in the first two novels. Perhaps the best part of this book, is that it ties up some loose ends, and takes you to within fourteen years of the original Dune novel. Following the completion of this series, I found that Dune was MUCH easier to read, and a lot better the second time around.Dune House Corrino will show how the empire is totally dependant on spice, and it will show how the importance of the Guild surmonts even the Emperor himself. This novel centers around the Spice War that the Emperor has created. It is an enjoyable read, and easy to get through.Again, this novel follows the similar paths of writing style as the previous two prequels. The book is rather enjoyable and easy to follow. But it lacks the complexity of the original Dune novel. Perhaps the greatest reason to enjoy this book, is to find out what mentioned in the Dune series, but not elaborated about. These two authors did a tremendous job in trying to bring these prequels to the level of Dune, but they did not reach the pinnacle in this series. After reading this novel, it is important to pick up Dune and read it, whether that be for the first or tenth time. This novel will help ease the complexity of Dune. I recommend this novel and the previous two in order to partake in the full Dune experience."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"After waiting about a year since the last prequel I ordered this book from the UK site just so I could read it a month earlier than the US publishing date. The book certainly lives up to its expectations. It is consistent in style and content with the last two installments and it seems most likely we will be seeing a fourth as hinted at in the book. Most interesting are the additional detail of little discussed topics from the original Dune series. I found it especially interesting to see the history of the &quot;No-Ship&quot; unveiled. Learning more about the Tleilaxu race and Ixians makes the book worth reading alone for explanetory purposes. Foreshadowing, as when the Guild Highliner is stranded in foldspace, is used with tremendous force. I only wish this trajectory in the story was explained more in depth but I imagine that will come. I have some problems with inconsistencies such as in the original Dune series the Ghola Tanks were much more of a mystery and it now seems that Shaddam Corrino and Leto Atreides had evidence of their workings and origin from an early stage. I also still do not understand why the Spacing Guild does not claim absolute power over the universe. As seen from the book they can do what they wish and are hardly accountable to the Emperor or Fremen. It is still difficult to understand their motivation in life. Characters such as Guerney, Thuffir and Duncan are fleshed out with effectiveness.

I do not compare this with Dune.In it's own light this is possibly the best of the trilogy and the last.What I do feel though is that Brian and Kevin do not have a grasp of the size of the empire that they trying to describe. There are relatively few main characters and all bump into each other and realise that they were old school buddies.This is supposed to be set in an empire consisting of 'many' planets each with a 'many' millions of people.The best example is the storming of IX, which reads like a SWAT team takinhg back an embassy held to ransom by terrorists. \\"What, you rode over in a vehicle that was driven by my brother .. what a coincidence?\\"Similarly, the aborted raid on Caladan was a joke. We know that Rabban is stupid, but so stupid that he aborts his mission because there are 'boats' (yes water vessels) with BIG guns on them and all we have are spaceships.Ignore what we know about the characters from Dune and it makes a decent read."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"After I read Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune, I decided to take a break from the original series and read the prelude series. House Atreides was a good grade A novel I'd say, followed by House Harkonnen which I'd give an A-. Overall those two were great. But House Corrino kind of took a turn into the wrong direction. It got a lot less captivating than the previous 2 novels. I ended up having to force myself to finish it just so I could feel accomplished that I read all 3. Now there were a few parts that I really liked, but the lame scenes outweighed the good ones by too much. First of all, I didn't like how practically every other chapter is about Bene Gesserits. It's all bene gesserit this, bene gesserit that. I don't care! It's all about these hypocritical witches with no personalities who think they know everything. By the novel's end, I really wished they all would get killed off somehow. It was nice to see lady anirul get killed, but sadly she didn't suffer much. And then the mega b**** mohiam has to kill one of my favorite characters, Piter. That made me so angry! When I read that, I was like NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!And then what's this about Paul being born on Kaitain? Doesn't Dune specify that he was born on Caladan? Hey wait... isn't that like one of the first lines of the original novel, Dune? \\"Do not be deceived by the fact that (Paul) was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there.\\" WHY DID THEY CHANGE IT???!!!!! I know, it's such a small little change, but continuity like that is just careless and I hate it.The whole retaking of Ix was pretty cool. But, It seemed almost like just too much action was happening. Like there was a lot of unnecessary action to the extent where I would have rather preferred reading more dialog. Kind of ironic how when I read Dune, one of my only criticisms was the lack of action, and after reading House Corrino, I found there to be too much of it. And then there's the whole Ecaz and Moritani war going on. I had never heard of either of those houses and they're stuffed into the novel as if to make it more eventful or something? I also found the part where the harkonnens and the grummans try to attack caladan to be just more stuffing for the novel. More empty calories. It was like there's enough stuff going on already, yet they try to make it SUPER SUSPENSFUL with another unnecessary side plot. I found myself skimming through all these action scenes... reading them thoroughly would have been a waste of time. You don't learn anything from explosions and lasguns being fired for a whole chapter. In Herbert's originals, taking the time to read the scenes that were just dialog were interesting enough. That shows just how great a writer he was, to where he could keep you captivated with a little action and a lot of talking/descriptions. When action happened in Frank Herbert's Dune, it was short and sweet, a succulent little bit that's given to you in just the right portions as to not make you sick of it. But in House Corrino, it's like too much candy and it makes you sick. I think that's a good way of describing it...There was a funny little scene that I really liked. At the end of the novel, Piter gets killed and his body is sent to the Baron. And there's this line that I just found so funny for some reason. As the Baron looks at the body of de Vries, he says \\"PITER! How could you be so clumsy, so stupid as to get yourself killed?!\\" and the next line is the narrator, \\"The corpse did not answer\\". Yeah, I don't know.Just my opinion."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I have been a passionate fan of Dune, I've bought the books as soon as they were published and devoured them on the spot.Somehow \\"House Corrino\\" did not grab me like the others. There were many instances where thoughts from previous chapters were repeated (just to remind us that THIS is where we left off :-) The writing did not seem to be as fluid as the other Dune novels.

Overall the oily villians we came to know in the classic DUNE are introduced in retrospect, and we are given an insight into just how manipulative and surrepticious these characters are. Shaddam IV seems inept in almost everything but court politics. He displays a Nixon-like trust in the wrong people. Enjoyable, informative, but not classic. Even though packed with what it takes, Its kind of like I already knew. A lot of &quot;ahh...I thought so(s)&quot;"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I'll try to be brief.House Corrino is a much better book than the previous two in the trilogy (House Atreides and House Harkonnen). These too books, most probably, had to be written to introduce characters and plots for the interesting developments in House Corrino.My advise: keep going with the Atreides and Harkonnen and be happy when you arrive to Corrino.Lots of plots are non-important and could probably have been omitted. My opinion is that B. Herbert and K. J. Anderson tried to fill the pages they had already sold to the publisher. Anyway, they make the books more lively and clearly clear the way for The Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune.You should not fool yourself in ever thinking they are as good as the original F.

After plodding through the 2nd, it was clear that these men aren't the masterful, deep story tellers that Frank Herbert was. Having finished this 3rd, hopefully last, installment, I'm glad that my strange addictionn can now be turned to other books.These books are repleat with lack of character and plot development. Characters are \\"built up\\" in a tedious series of un-thought-provoking passages throughout the books and it seems that, at some point, the authors looked at each other with startled expressions and said, \\"WAIT! These people are supposed to die! What to do?!?!\\"... their answer is to, with no ceremony or pomp, dispatch them, never to be revisited or thoguht about again. Just... POOF. They're dead. Move on.The original Dune was filled with complex plot twists, deep sociological observations (even if they had no basis in our reality), and brilliant characters. I felt wholly uninspired by these characters, though some were the same characters I was deeply intrigued by in the original. The though processes of this series characters was juvenile, stagnant, and dismally shallow.It's worth a read just to have done with it... there are some tidbits of entertainment here. Ultimately, I seriously feel their editors should have sent them back to the drawing board, and not relied on Dune's fame to sell these books."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Fans of Frank Herbert's original 'Dune' series will find that the prequels lack any of the emotional resonance and innovative writing style of Herbert senior, but the prequel books are entertaining none the less. Dont expect, well developed characters, exceptional prose or an indepth storyline however, this is Science Fiction 'fluff', fun to read but ultimately mediocre literature. Fans will be satisfied as it does contain all the classic elements of the original series (ie. the Bene Gesserit, melange, Arakkis etc.), but ultimately the Dune prequels represent a disturbing trend in Science Fiction and Fantasy today. That is to say, simply rehashing the same old tired concepts to make a quick buck (the Star Wars novels instantly spring to mind). I am giving this novel 4 stars simply based on the fact that it is a fun, entertaining novel, that to a certain extent recaptures the overall 'feel' of Frank Herberts universe. Anyone looking for indepth, science fiction 'literature' however would do well to re-read the original series or look elsewhere."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Just finished HOUSE CORRINO this morning. Final Assessment: Original DUNE: A+; HOUSE CORRINO: B; HOUSE HARKONNEN: C+; HOUSE ATTREIDES: B+HOUSE CORRINO moved pretty quickly -- a lot of interesting turns and twists. It was better written than HOUSE HARKONNEN. Unfortunately, HOUSE CORRINO ends about a month after Paul is born. So there is STILL a 15 year gap between the end of HOUSE CORRINO and DUNE. Gosh -- do you think there will be yet ANOTHER trilogy?! (sarcasm). I'm unhappy about this -- I wanted the package tied up. The question of how the Harkonnens loose the Arrakis fief to the Atreides (right before DUNE starts) is not even touched on.In a way, it was hard to read these books. Having read the original series by Herbert, I know ahead of time which characters are going to live and which are going to have to die to prevent them from revealing things which don't get revealed until later in the DUNE timeline. All in all, I think Brian Herbert and his buddy did a sub-par job on these prequels. I liked them -- but a little more effort could have resulted in a far superior read."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson come close to wrapping up the Dune prequel series with a climactic edition in &quot;Dune: House Corrino&quot;. This story takes place in less than a year's time, beginning after the conception of Paul Atreides, and finishing just after his birth. The book starts off a little slow; it takes the authors a while to build up the suspense, but the last 150 pages of this work are well worth the wait. The details regarding the Corrino famliy are also enjoyable.The authors set the stage in the two previous prequel stories (&quot;House Atreides&quot; and &quot;House Harkonnen&quot;) and really didn't need to build up interest over such a long novel. FYI, both previous works are musts for devoted Dune fans. However, this is the best book out of the three editions. New readers will find the style smoother and more modern than the original Frank Herbert series, but not quite as creative. These stories fill in the many gaps in Frank Herbert's background, almost as if reading historical fiction.The final third of the book is excellent, even difficult to put down as the action reaches a crescendo. Though every fan knows what is going to happen, we have been shielded from the truth all this time. You almost feel as if the story were new. However, there is one last story to tell here. Prepare to see &quot;Dune: Bene Gesserit&quot; bridging the birth of Paul Atreides to the relocation of his family to Planet Arrakis.I have read every book in both Dune series and rate this book 3.80 out of 5.00 stars, rounded up to 4.00 stars, with points for writing style and for nicely wrapping up a lot of pre-history. Still want to read about more workings behind the scenes of the Sisterhood though."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"It's not perfect. But what is? Herbert and Anderson are obviously adrenalin junkies, tempered by our modern age of impatience and information overkill. Brian's father, Frank was of a different generation. A generation where it was more common for artists to lock themselves away from the world in order to study it better. Brian and Kevin come from a world of speed and excess, video games and nano-technology in the palm of their hands. Their world - our world - was only conceivable in the imaginations of past generations; Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clark, Frank Herbert, etc.What am I getting at?I didn't read the Prelude to Dune novels hoping for Frank's insights and inventiveness. I read them not only hoping to see what Brian and Kevin had salvaged of his unwritten work, but also to escape into one of the grandest space opera's ever conceived.Yes, there are problems as other reviewers have pointed out. Personally, I think collaborative work on this scale is seldom as successful as it could have been if left for one author to anguish over. The best books, and Frank Herbert was well-known for this, offer insights; other ways of seeing the world so that we may be able to see our own world more clearly.But I couldn't put it down. The short chapters were like so many tasty morsels of finger-food. 600 pages in five days. I amazed myself. When I got to the last 20 or 30 pages, my head spun with all that was about to happen. House Corrino is like a spider web covered in tiny spiders all vying for their place in the scheme of things.My conclusion is that if you paid to watch any of the Star Wars movies, then happily pay the man and read yourself this book."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I really wanted to like this book (and the whole trilogy) a lot more than I did. There were even a few times where I found myself caught up in the action and unable to put them down. But in the end, certain inaccuracies and contradictions between the prequels and the original text caused me to become a bit distanced from these otherwise interesting books. Granted, most of the problems with the prequels are a bit nit-picky, but considering the classic status of the originals, it is a bit grating and frustrating to find out how little effort apparently went into researching certain aspects of the books. I've also read many reviews (both online and in print) praising Brian Herbert's writing style as &quot;on par&quot; with his father's...I personally found it more imitative than equal to. I recently began reading Dune again and I'm noticing even more errors with the prequels than I originally thought. I think for hard-core Dune fans, the prequels should be taken with a grain of salt and possibly even looked at as something wholly separate from the original Dune storyline...there are just too many contradictions for me to take the prequels as &quot;factual&quot; presentations of Dune history."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"House Corrino was an entertaining book that very neatly sewed up the trilogy. The writing style is easily read compared to Frank Herbert's Dune. Even though Dune is my all time favorite novel, I enjoyed the hisory of the Dune characters and found the story a little trite perhaps, but very satisfying. All of the prequels are written with scientific and observational flair compared to Dune which purposely left difficult to explain details somewhat vague to inspire mystique.Brian Herbert tells the prehistory of Dune from a different viewpoint than his father. Even though the style is distinctly different the story has definite merits of it's own. I enjoyed learning about the Baron Harkonen and how he became so large. I also enjoyed learning more about the navigators and how they accomplished space travel. Brian Herbert does an excellent job of explaining these mysteries.There were some negative points in this novel, however. Brian Herbert spent too much time with several characters receiving various forms of punishment. He missed the point, if he thought by over-emphasizing the continual harsh treatment of the stories heros' were either entertaining or inspired fierce sympathy for these characters. The treament of Gurney Halleck for instance, became monotonous and a little embarassing.I found it difficult to put this book down because it was light reading, very entertaining and fast paced, compared to Dune which I was forced to put down to absorb what I had read.If you are the type of reader that loves Dune and only enjoys reading fine literature, or you are a Frank Herbert purist you would be better off re-reading Dune. If you enjoy thoughtful, light sci-fi and can deal with the fact that the author is not Frank Herbert you will very much enjoy this book."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"As I mentioned in my review of House Atreides, it took me a while to muster-up the courage to attempt this 'prelude' series as I was concerned that it would harm the Dune franchise. I decided to read the series straight through (all nine books). I can safely say that the prelude series ADDS something that was missing from the original series.&quot;Dune&quot; is, unequivocally, the greatest science fiction novel of all time. And now that we have a thorough backstory, it has only become greater. &quot;Dune&quot; begins with a 15 year old Paul Atreides who quickly becomes Duke Paul Atreides (amongst other titles). In the beginning of Herbert's six novel series Paul's father Leto is portrayed as a great man, but we don't know why. We also know that there are flaws in the ruling house - Corrino, ie Emperor Shaddam IV, but we are not given any details.This is the reason why the prelude series is worthwhile. We find out the recent history that shapes the events in the novel &quot;Dune&quot;. That is, we get first-hand knowledge of the relationship between Fenring and Shaddam and a greater feeling for their characters and motives. We understand now the threat that Leto posed for the throne which led to the Atreides move to Arrakis. We also get a greater appreciation of Ix and revilement of the Tleilaxu. The inclusion of these events into the saga gives the reader a greater understanding of the Dune universe.I definitely recommend the prelude series to any 'Dune' fan who is prepared to take it for what it is - a well written backstory."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Dune: House Corrino, the last novel of the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson, is the final chance these two writers have to wrap up the storylines that immediately precede Dune. In this respect, the results are mixed. We are treated to some great moments in House Corrino, including an entertaining final battle on Ix and the important birth of Paul Atreides. I will let readers realize the endings for themselves. The book's greatest failing is its inability to properly capture the depth of the brilliant scheming of Emperor Shaddam IV. His dimwittedness is unintentionally comical and is reminiscent of a futuristic version of the 1970's The Bad News Bears baseball comedies. We see our Bad News Corrinos blunder around the galaxy in ridiculous ways that are hardly consistent with the House that out-schemed and destroyed Duke Leto Atreides and his legendary mentat, Thufir Hawat. It is surprising that Emperor Shaddam IV is allowed to stay Emperor at the end of this book. It is even more comical that Count Fenring voices similar comments to Shaddam IV. With respect to the Emperor, the authors seem to confuse ruthlessness with brilliant planning. It is difficult to imagine anyone who attempts what Shaddam endeavors and still remain Emperor! Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's blunder with respect to the Emperor is not surprising considering the ridiculousness of parts of the previous book, House Harkonnen, as Baron Harkonnen storms Wallach IX without his anti-Voice ear plugs introduced in the first book, House Atreides, that magically makes one immune to the controlling Voice employed by the Bene Gesserit.Another failing of the book is the ridiculous yet surprising climax that revolves around Harkonnen mentat, Piter. It not only seems foolish, but it makes this reader wonder about the poor security of the Emperor's homeplanet, Kaitan. The ending is indeed surprising and may affect the way Dune fans think of twisted mentats.There is hardly any mention though of Yueh's wife, and there is certainly no hint of Piter's plan for her in Leto's downfall. This may disappoint some fans of Dune. It disappointed me.A strength of House Corrino is the introduction of a new character associated with Emperor Shaddam IV. There is an exciting scene involving a play reminiscent of Hamlet's Mouse Trap. The problem though is that the characters seem to be very much aware of Shakespeare's Hamlet and the use of a play within a play. I had always assumed that ancient earth was only known or remembered by those with Other Memories. Apparently every poor surf on every backwater planet of the known universe is aware of William Shakespeare! In addition this part of the storyline is rushed to an early conclusion as is many of the better storylines of the Prelude trilogy.Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's Prelude to Dune trilogy is a mixed bag of excitement, inconsistencies, and at times poor preparation. It seems they were not altogether familiar with many of the plots or main characters of Dune; smaller characters such as Count Hasimir Fenring were fleshed out wonderfully at times and add much to the Dune legacy, but they also confound the reader by having the Count utter the exact letter for letter eccentric spoken mannerism without any variation, which is highly annoying; more care should have been taken with his dialogue. The next book by Herbert and Anderson is due in October of 2002 as the first of a Butlerian Jihad Trilogy. It is almost guaranteed that the authors will have less trouble by tackling a time period several millennia prior to Frank Herbert's Dune, the first book of the series. In their Prelude trilogy they seemed to be bogged down in details, which leaves the reader with the impression of reading a rushed outline of a novel. It is a shame that they did not make their outline public for Dune fans to critique so that obvious inconsistencies could be corrected and their better ideas fleshed out and fully realized. Although it is impossibly difficult to fully satisfy any long time fan of the Dune chronicles with respect to characters they feel they know, the glaring inconsistencies of the Prelude trilogy leaves this humble fan of Dune sad that he is refering the writers of the new Dune novels as The Bad News Authors."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Reading this book made me want to get out a red pen and mark it up. Everything you learned not to do in high school writing classes, they do in this book. Chapters are short and choppy, on average 3 pages long. Very little descriptive prose is used -- you feel like you are reading the Cliff notes, not the actual book. Not a single character evolves from beginning to end. Almost every chapter has at least one ellipse... some as many as three or four. Ellipses which to me meant - the author ran out of words to describe the situation so reader, fill in your own blanks. I don't mind using my imagination every once in awhile, but the whole book? Especially when there are hardly any words to describe the scenery, the setting or the characters' true inner most thoughts. And telegraphing - the practice of giving away the plot or actions before they occur - there's lots of it. You know what people are going to say or do before they do it. In many cases the story does not unfold naturally, because they try to tell each scene in ten paragraphs or less. And so many people get killed in this book -- main characters, not so main characters -- I felt like I was watching back-to-back reruns of Miami Vice.You can read other comments on the plot inconsistencies between the prequel and the original, which I find shameful given that there were 4 editors (Mike, Carolyn, Pat and Anne Lesley should share in the responsibility).If you have not read the original Dune Series, please do so (all six) before you read any of the prequels. The prequels give away a lot of secrets that take away from the mystery of the original books. Then wait at least 12 months before you attempt the prequels -- the writing styles are so different it will be difficult to digest. I enjoyed reading House Atreides and House Harkonnen, but after re-reading the originals immediately prior to picking up Corrino, I realized the vast difference between the vision in the books of Frank Herbert vs. the plain story-telling of the prequels. The original Dune series is a difficult read. Every book, especially the last three, has lessons and morals that are sometimes difficult to discern, even after you re-read them a few times. After reading each original Dune book I feel like I grow as a person. I just finished reading House Corrino and I feel like taking a bath."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"There is never engough written about the Dune universe to satiate my hungry mind. I was going to wait for the paperback edition of Dune: House Corrino to come out before I read it, but after reading House Harkonnen, I knew I couldn't sleep well until I had finished the series of prequels.House Corrino nearly finishes off the time from House Atreides to the first original Dune book, leaving only about a decade and a half interim. This gap is disappointing, but all of the plot lines closed up nicely once the end was reached, at least.There were a few things that could be viewed as weaknesses in this book. For instance, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is one-dimensionally cruel, violent, ruthless, and single-minded. Emperor Shaddam IV reeks of incompetance, stubbornness, and rebellion. The Bene Gesserit are, as always, cool, cruel, and uncaring of many winds in the universe. Despite all this, though, one has to realize that in real life, there are two-dimensional people. People just as predictably vile, ruthless, stubborn, and cruel. In addition, the development of the characters of Duke Leto Atreides, Prince Rhombur Vernius, Jessica, and even Count Glossu Rabban is evident. Leto shows his soft side and his hard side through his time with Jessica, and his ruthless attacks on offending people. Rhombur, after facing some rather strong physical setbacks, emerges more mentally strong than ever. Jessica, ever the Bene Gesserit loyalist, defies the Sisterhood, bearing Leto a son. Rabban shows actual restraint in a near-attack on the Atreides. The wife of the Emperor, Kwisatz Mother Anirul, faces a flurry of Other Memory voices which nearly drive her mad. The character development really isn't lacking in this book.The plot flows rather well, each chapter occuring at the right time, and finally coming together to some extent near the end. The sheer number of plotlines is enough to drive one batty, though. Reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, as soon as something interesting is happening in one plotline, the authors whisk you away to another. Temporarily frustrating, but as it does all come together eventually, we can cope.So all in all, a great read for me, and hopefully for all Dune enthusiasts. I suggest reading the other two House books before picking up this one, as it would be supremely confusing if one didn't. And though I'm disappointed in the lack of another prequel following this, it ends up working out anyway."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I have read the first two books of this series and I find this one to be the most ridiculous of them all. Going in to reading this book, I made a conscious effort to not compare it to the original series by Frank Herbert. However, try as I might, I still find this book seriously lacking. This book is incredibly fast paced. There are several chapters that are only 2 pages long. The longest chapter is probably only 10 pages long (if even that!). Due to the storylines changing so frequently (of which there are several) one never gets really entrenched in the novel. And, since the authors make such outrageous problems in the book, the solutions to them are even more preposterous. I don't want to give anything away, but Thufir Hawat defending Caladan from Beast Rabban with a fleet of fishing boats?!? I was also very disappointed with the writing style. The writing in the first two books was marginal, but in this one it is even worse. It's as if the writers can't make their own sentences. They copy cliches from the original Dune and make a sentence entirely out of them. If I read &quot;golden lion throne&quot; ever again, I will scream. While it was fairly interesting to see how the dangling plots were brought together in this book, the execution was rather poor.Supposedly, these prequels were based on notes from Frank Herbert. I can see certain storylines fitting in, but the rest are just pure extrapolations that don't fit the mood of the Dune series at all. If you have read the original Dune series, please don't read these cheap imitations. I personally hope that Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson don't write anymore Dune books."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Let's just get something out of the way before I write the rest of this review: These three prequel novels do not hold a candle to the works of Frank Herbert, and I consider all of the prequel novels to be strictly non-canonical with respect to the Duniverse.Now, that having been said, I really enjoyed this book. Brian Herbert and Kevin Andersen have done a nice job of weaving a complex storyline over the three prequel novels, and manage to tie all of the loose ends up in this book. The story is quite intricate and weaves no less than 8 separate plots together to tell the narrative, with some storylines getting more space than others. The book is very fast-paced (thanks mostly to the very brief chapter lengths) and I enjoyed the fact that the authors tried to incorporate some minor charactors from the real Dune books into the plot and to flesh them out as was feasible within the confines of the story. The use of such charactors as Piter, Thufir, and Count Fenring is very well done and helps to anchor the book (and the reader) in the settings and time we have come to know and love. Some major charactors, most notably Shaddam and Leto, are portrayed fairly one-dimensionally, which was a disappointment as they are really the focus of the book.The book bogs down in the middle after a nice start, but really winds up well with a very exciting last 100 or so pages.I also appreciated the maps of Kaitain and Geidi Prime.Overall, worth reading for anyone who enjoyed the Dune series."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"While the second book of the first Dune prequel trilogy trudged along trying to build up suspense, the first book set the stage and was far better. The third book, though inferiour to the first, concludes the set up and end the trilogy's side stories. While interesting, it still suffer from what all prequels suffer from. We know what happens.I enjoyed the sub plots, the fact that each characters actions will have huge ramifications later on."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"All in all, I thought this was a marvelous book to end a fantastic trilogy, concluding the drama that was initiated in House Atreides and House Harkonnen respectively. It fell in line with the aformentioned two, giving more background information and interesting history on the Dune series. With a great plot and much suspense as well though, it is not simply to be read as a history lesson for future and current Dune fans. My only qualm with this book was with how Count Hasimir Fenring's character was treated near the end. Without giving away too much, I found his showdown with a certain Sword Master to be very anti-climactic, and against how he was portrayed in the prequels to this and in the first Dune book. The authors went for the easy kill, having everything come out for the good guys in the end, Fenring definitely deserved better, as I feel that he is one of the strongest characters in the story line, and from a disection of Dune, the original, it seemed as if Frank Herbert fealt this way as well. Mr. Brian Herbert must forge his own path though, so oh well. I'm sure he won't see this, but how about a rematch?"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I will keep it simple. Great Action. If you enjoy Dune, you should enjoy this book. I enjoyed the other 2 books in this series too, but I enjoyed this one the best. For me, it was hard to stop once I got going."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is the best of the three prequels, with the caveat (of course) that Frank Herbert is gone, and no one will ever live up to his quality of writing. For Dune fans this is a great book. I wanted to address some of the bizarre/negative comments made in the other reviews.The authors do not contradict Frank Herbert's work -- everything is properly explained. For example, one reviewer wrote that the secret of the axlotl tanks is given away when invading Atreides forces see them. However, the tanks are actually destroyed before anyone can get into the lab so they are not seen by any Atreides soldiers, and Fenring makes a mental note to not tell his Bene Gesserit wife. Another reviewer complained about no-ships not coming into existence until the last two Dune books (10,000 years into the future from the original Dune). Those no-ships were of Ixian design, and the one in these prequels is of Richesian design -- and the inventor is murdered, leaving the technology &quot;lost&quot; until some future time when it is again discovered/invented on Ix.The pace of the story is very good. The characters are better developed. This book is just more interesting than the other two prequels. I do wish I had had the chance to do a final review myself, however, before &quot;Dune: House Corrino&quot; was published (I'm a HUGE Dune fan). Unfortunately, it does sometimes feel like two different people wrote it -- which is, in fact, the case. However, there are little annoying things that could have been fixed before its release. For example, I lost count of how many times the phrase &quot;in the half handshake of the imperium&quot; was used. We get it. &quot;Handshake&quot; would have been good enough after the first several times."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I just finished reading the prelude to Dune and have to admit that I enjoyed them - it had been years since I read the original series. I then came up with a novel idea - why not re-read the original series? That's when I found out the disturbing truth: either Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson never read the original series, didn't conducted adequate research on the originals, or they decided to write novels \\"based on\\" the original Dune series. You know, like when you watch a movie, \\"based on a true story.\\" Usually one or two characters in the story really existed, maybe they were actually in the place depicted in the movie, but after that, all basis in fact is thrown to the winds and the writers take over and create entertainment for the masses. As long as you realize that the movie is fiction and based (somewhat loosely) on a factual event, I guess there is no harm in viewing it for entertainment. You can treat the House series in the same way - the characters, places, and plot are based on the original series, but the writers have developed an alternative that is entertaining, but not true to the original."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"It shames me to say that I finished the entire book. That's the only reason I gave 2 stars. It was only out of curiosity to see how this shameless son of Frank Herbert would further defile the great Dune legacy. It's truely amazing how little original thought went into this book. The only story lines are filling in details that Frank Herbert intentionally left vague or following one-dimensional characters down one-dimensional plots. I'm drawing the line here. I'm not going to buy the Butlerian series and give more money to these sick so-called authors.There are only 6 Dune books, however much we might wish for more."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I did not feel that i was reading a Dune novel as i read this. like its predecesors, it was poor writing. Very amateurish in style, and not worthy of Frank Herbert's title. You often wonder if the authors actually read Frank Herbert's awesome works."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Even doing my best at not comparing the Dune prequels to Frank Herbert's saga, these books are still a dismal piece of fluff. They read like one of Anderson's utterly awful \\"Young Jedi Knights\\" books, with TV-style pacing, two- (or sometimes one-) dimensional characters, and lots of filler.This one is the worst of the bunch, trying to resolve a situation that couldn't possibly have come from Frank's notes (where the hell did this friendship and bond of honor between House Atreides and Ixians go to in the 16 years between _Dune: House Corrino_ and _Dune_?) in a ridiculous climax and a de rigueur happy ending."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I found Dune Corrino to be the most interesting of the three prequels. The writing has jelled. The story arcs reach their peak and come to a conclusions. Too many dangling arcs in the first two volumes.At the same time this volume suffers the defects of the first two. The writing is superficial, i.e. you'e read it once, you've read it all. Papa's books had a lot of texture. I find new things re-reading the original Dune for the fifth time, but not Brian's book.Overall it is enjoyable but wont be a classic."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I love Dune and the three prequels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are entertaining and an interesting look at the characters. I have Anderson's Star Wars books and like his writing style - but it is vastly different from Frank Herbert's. If you are looking for the dense prose of the elder Herbert, you will not be pleased with these books. If you are looking for a continuation of the stories simply for entertainment, enjoy."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"In this prequel series, authors Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson have succeeded in capturing the mood and tone of the fantastic Dune universe. Both House Atreides and House Harkonnen were fine additions to this most illustrious sci-fi series.In House Corrino which, as with the other two books, doesn't focus on any particular house despite the title, the authors have drawn out a satisfying conclusion that leads in to the original Dune. Sort of. A lot is left unsaid, and I'm almost thinking there's going to be another book stuck in between. Simple logic would seem to refute this, as there are really no more important houses left to title another book.In addition to the sense of incompleteness, there is a rather serious lack of any inventive plot in House Corrino. House Atreides presented a fantastic 'wheels-within-wheels' scheme, and House Harkonnen expanded on this. Though it wraps up the main storyline quite well, the last installation doesn't do anything you wouldn't expect. This isn't helped by the fact that you already know who will survive and die if you've read Dune.I'm not saying that House Corrino was a poorly written title. Quite the contrary, I rather enjoyed it. The problem is, it reads more like Star Wars than Dune, which breaks the flavor of the Frank Herbert franchise."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This book completes the Dune prequel. It's not bad until you consider it in comparison to Frank Herbert's work against which it pales. As the story wound down, I kept wondering how the storyline was going to be reconciled with &quot;Dune&quot;. The result was unsatisfying in the same way that a TV show resolves a cliffhanger with one of those scenes where it all gets explained away.Frank Herbert was one of those science fiction writers who explored the intersection of politics and technology with a savage intelligence. Dune is just one example, The Jesus Incident or The Dosadi Experiment are others. The prequel lacks the imagination of any of these books. As I said, on one level it's not bad. The story moves along and the characters are sympathetic or despicable as called for by the plot line. But &quot;Dune&quot; it ain't."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This, the contractual-obligation volume of the Dune prequel trilogy, is really pretty tedious until about two thirds of the way through. An endless succession of three-(even two- !)page chapters in which absolutely nothing happens pads out fully half of the book. It gets pretty easy to spot which chapters are filler in the first page of each (blas&eacute; and banal opening 'quote', Reverend Mother blah blah blah, D'murr inhaled more spice gas blah blah blah, etc.), and I ended up skipping many of them. After all that (and some gratuitously revolting Harkonnen antics) things finally start to pick up, and things are resolved fairly well, albeit with few real surprises. Finishing it was a relief, frankly, and not because the plot tension got relieved.I will give it this, though: what gives it an extra star is that it made me really, really want to read the original _Dune_ again, and I plan to ASAP. I have a feeling I'd have a renewed appreciation for it."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This new Dune series has a lot wanting. The original series, by the original Herbert, was a complex interweaving of politics, religion, and philosophy. This series is nothing more than an adventure story. Also, the characters are all cardboard cut-out stereotypes. Leto is totally good, and the Harkonnens totally bad. There is also much too much filler material, making what could have been one book into three. So many details are given that nothing is left to the imagination. Another problem is that there are inconsistancies between this and the original series, for example, it was Duncan's sister who was killed by the Harkonnens, not Gurney's. Anyway, if you love Dune and would like to return to that world, this story is interesting enough to check out, even though it turns Dune into a new Star Wars. At least it's better than the New Foundation series."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Dune: House Corrino is a satisfying ending to the Dune prequel series. My main complaint would be that there is so much plot going on that you don't really get a chance to go deep into the characters thoughts. But the plot is interesting and fast paced. The things I looked forward to most about this book was how Jessica's birth of a son instead of a daughter would be seen by the Bene Gesserit and the Battle for Ix, as Prince Rhombur is a favorite character of mine. It was great watching him mature and do what needed to be doing.Shaddam could have been done a little better. He seemed to want nothing more than blow planets up and to kill a bunch of people. Still, his scene with Duke Leto was pretty good. As was the showdown between Duncan and Count Fenring. Two great fighters going after each other with the tension thick.All in all, the authors did a great job of bringing the story to a conclusion while leaving the plot holes and mysteries open that will lead to the original Dune."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I rated this book with 4 stars and that is only because I found it rather annoying that the most of the chapters in the book were about two pages long. Other then that, this is a rather well written book. I found it as strong as the two previous books. The book explains the premble end to Shadam's reign and the rise of House Atriedes. The book included the birth of Chani and Paul. If you liked the two previous prequel books you will find that this book has the strengths of the other two books. You will end the book with the feeling of &quot;Happilly ever after...or is it.&quot;"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"After the very long House Harkonnen, this succinct finale leaves one ready to delve back into the original series and experience once again the wonders of Dune. House Corrino succeeds in weaving some rather intricate plots together without burdening the reader. I have yet to refresh myself with the original DUNE since completing this book, but am eager to do so. I cannot account for any discrepancies at the moment and therefore found the book a rather fascinating read (only if you've read ALL of the other DUNE books)."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"A nice finish to the Dune prequel trilogy begun in Dune: House Atreides, and Dune: House Harkonnen.I agree with previous reviewers that this book takes a bit long to get going, especially since anyone reading it will have read the previous two books.

But Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson do a darn fine job. Perhaps not as complex as Frank Herbert's work, but compelling nonetheless.Being an avid Dune fan they met and exceeded my expectations. This series is full of intrigue, surprising events, and action. A welcome change after some of the hubbub and boredom of the later Dune books. Write on gentlemen..."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The NY Times bestseller \\"House Corrino\\" is a neat tying up of the threads left dangling by \\"House Atreides\\" and \\"House Harkonnen.\\" The diverse plotlines merge smoothly into a powerful conclusion that precedes the rise of Paul Atreides (Muad'Dib) in Frank Herbert's classic \\"Dune.\\" (Paul puts in only a cameo appearance, as a baby, in \\"House Corrino.\\")Certainly you should read the two preceding volumes before reading this one. You do not, however, need to read any other Dune books, including \\"Dune\\" itself.Including the Legends of Dune trilogy and the House Trilogy, I've read six Dune books by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. I haven't read anything else by Brian Herbert, but I have read a couple of Kevin J. Anderson's X-Files books. If you have any appreciation at all for wholesome science fiction adventure, you will do yourself a disservice by not reading these two Dune trilogies. They are epic science fiction sagas, and unlike Anderson's X-Files stories, they ARE something special.Some \\"Dune\\" fans put Frank Herbert's classic on a top shelf, and they feel that no other book deserves its company. Therefore, as part of this ritual of fetish-worship, maybe this is why they give Brian and Kevin's books low ratings. I am now reading Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" for the third time (as part of my marathon reading of all 16 Dune novels in chronological order). Though \\"Dune\\" is a good solid novel and I do not begrudge its classic status, I think the six novels by Brian and Kevin are just as good. I think these learned gentlemen put their hearts into these books. They have good writing skills, they have respectable scientific knowledge, and after studying the six Dune books by Frank Herbert, they planted their superb stories into Frank Herbert's universe.Trust me, these books are GOOD fiction."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Corrino is the third book in the Brian Herbert Dune prequels but don't let that fool you. You can easily pick up this book and begin reading without having ever read *any* of the Dune books at all. At a basic minimum, you should have at least read Frank Herbert's Dune book that started it all.I'm about half way through this title at the moment and I'm finding that a lot of the material feels like deja vu. I haven't read either of the prequels but I have read the first Dune novel and Corrino is eerily remniscent of those storylines.All in all I like Corrino bc I'm a Dune fan and fully intend on reading Atreides & Harkonnen but the intricate storylines and creativity that made Frank Herbert a legend are qualities that are strangely missing in son Brian. I suppose that's what happens when you try to improve on someone else's literary masterpiece. Hey Brian, how about developing your *own* universe instead of borrowing from your father's."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"After years of reading the Dune books over and over again, I have happily consumed the three prequil books. House Corrino at times seems somewhat forced after expanding plots lines and then having to contract them back to the original Dune. But it is quiet enjoyable and interesting to see how get back to the beginning.I eagerly awaiting for a four prequil with the Bene Gesserit to bring us the beginning of Dune. And I can image a series dealing with the beginnings of the Great Houses, Guild, Gesserits and the Buterian Jihad. Its a rich universe and moving backward 10,000 years would be great."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"A Quote from Dune, by Frank Herbert: \\"...And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: The planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan...\\" Even before the first chapter begins in the original Dune novel, we are told that Paul was born on Caladan. How could these two writers miss that fact and instead have him born on Kaitain? The quoted lines above are Irulan's words, and according to this duo, Irulan was very much present and aware at the birth of Duke Leto's son. She was a scholar and would not make such an error in her writing of the \\"Manual of Muad'Dib\\" some dozens of years later.Ok, let's preface this review by saying that my first attempt through House Corrino was by reading the first paragraphs of a chapter and the last ones. Essentially I am hypothesizing that 75% of the words in these books by Brian Herbert/Kevin Anderson are unnecessary. The following review will represent my discoveries:A couple of tedious days later...(I couldn't commit to a straight run of it...)Yes, I learned everything I needed to know from reading the first 4 or 5 paragraphs of each chapter and then the last 1/2 page or so. With their tendency toward extra-short chapters, I was sometimes reading more than half of a chapter with this method. Some of the chapters were longer than was typical of the first two books in this series...actually some of the longest chapters were really two, three, or four of their other smaller chapters squished together without the typically banal \\"Herbert thoughtful quote\\" attempt at the beginning of each section...they were just trying to fool us into thinking they were writing longer chapters!Most of their chapters say the same thing in the first 5 paragraphs and the last 5 paragraphs. Sometimes nearly word-for-word. I learned from my second read that if it was not repeated in the beginning or end of the same chapter, it was repeated in another. Most of the words in these novels are just....fluff....A couple of tedious weeks later as I sporadically bear through it a second time... (I really couldn't get enthused about reading anything in this book again...)Ok, so the big question here revolves around this Amal, fake spice stuff: The Guild can examine its chemical structure and discover that it is not the same as the real stuff, but no one else in the universe has the ability to do that, not even the people making it, the Tlielaxu? So, the Guild has special scientific tools that no one else does? Hmmm, but the Bene Gesserit are able to learn about Amal without scientific tools? Doesn't the Guild have prescient ability, the ability to see the future? If so, why wouldn't they use that to discover the origins of the tainted spice? Herbert Junior and Anderson lead us to believe the Guild are bumbling oafs who make some short sighted conclusions that lead them to think that the Baron Harkonnen has the tainted spice. They use their prescience to guide interstellar transport, they use it later to learn about the disturbance of Paul Atreides and the move of House Atreides from Caladan to Arrakis (see Dune, by Frank Herbert), and they use it throughout Dune Messiah to try to track Paul's movements and predict what he will do next. So, the Guild loses two ships in this book and doesn't even consider using its prescience to track down the origin? And are they not feeling, in the slightest way, any waves of prescient ripples that center around the birth of Paul Atreides on Caladan? Oops, sorry..Kaitian... Nope. The Guild are buffoons.Ok, so I'll believe the Guild is dense for a moment. But I also have to believe that the Guild has been using spice for their navigation of spaceships for 10,000 years and they don't even test any of it? They just assume everyone has good will toward them and no one would consider a terrorist attack? They never had any trouble in the past with varying levels of spice versus impurities? The spice has always been pure? No one thought to build spice detection devices into the Heighliners, not even in 10,000 years? No one has thought to build any sort of checks and balances into the process at all? And, there is no backup supply of spice on a Heighliner? Let's put all of our eggs into one basket, repeatedly for 10,000 years, and expect that nothing will ever go wrong, ever? How much spice does it take to make one fold space trip? Now, how many trips would a typical Heighliner make before returning to Junction for refueling? Did these \\"authors\\" ever think of that?Here's the tough question of the bunch: How did this Heighliner manage to get to Caladan with a full load of tainted spice, without a secondary or backup supply of spice, how did it make the foldspace trip to Caladan without causing all hell to break loose? So I am to be led to believe that all the good spice was used to get them to Caladan, and all the tainted spice was to be used on their roundabout journey throughout the Imperium for the next several months leading our commando force to Ix as secretly as possible? Why do I feel like I have wasted my time reading these three books only to find this gaping pit that they call a plot?What a waste of money and a waste of my time. Can I give it zero stars?"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"\\"House Corrino\\" is the third and final book in the \\"Prelude to Dune\\" trilogy, otherwise known as the \\"House\\" trilogy. To understand this story, it is necessary to have first read \\"House Atreides\\" and \\"House Harkonnen\\" because the plot lines that started in the first book build to a climax in \\"House Corrino\\".By the time that we get to this novel the former rulers of Ix, House Vernius, had long since been deposed with the last scion of the ruling family living under the protection of his friend, Duke Leto Atreides. Leto and Rhombur (the last of the Vernius family) are working together to finally reclaim Ix from the Tlielaxu and return Rhombur to power. Leto's mistress, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica is pregnant with his child. Leto wants a son, but the Bene Gesserit need a daughter from Jessica and Leto for their breeding program which is only one generation away from completion.Meanwhile, Shaddam IV, the Emperor of a Million worlds is seeking an alternative to the Spice that runs the Imperium. Spice is native only to the planet Arrakis and Shaddam wants an artificial source of Spice that he controls. Shaddam is playing both sides of the game, working to control Arrakis through the planet's overlord Vladimir Harkonnen as well as trying acquire a synthetic spice from the Tlielaxu on Ix.If this sounds complicated, the reason is simple: it is complicated. Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are weaving multiple storylines together to build a whole that is far grander than any of the parts. Brian is the son of the creator of the original 6 book Dune series and he has taken on an ambitious project: to write a prequel series that can complement the original books, expand the universe that Frank Herbert crated, and stand on its own merits. While different in style and theme than Frank's work, the \\"Prelude to Dune\\" novels are fully a part of the greater \\"Dune\\" universe and are worthy additions to the series.What makes the challenge of writing these novels even tougher is that as a prequel trilogy with characters that we will meet in Frank Herbert's classic (in every sense of the word) novel \\"Dune\\", the authors have to create a story that fits within the continuity of \\"Dune\\" yet is compelling enough of a story to stand alone. Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are to be commended for their success. This trilogy fits both requirement and has surely led more readers to discover Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\".-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Artificial spice, Paul's birth, the battle for Ix...

A must read for all true sci-fi fans!!!"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Dune: House Corrino concludes the prequel trilogy of the epic Dune saga. But it doesn't complete the beginning story.We see the continuing story that begins in the years before Dune. The Atreides family, rocked with tragedy, begins a desperate plan to retake the planet of Ix, while Jessica is pregnant with a forbidden son, Paul. The Harkonnens still seethe and stew their evil plots from Geidi Prime. And most of all, the decadent emperor Shaddam IV, greedy for more power, is close to unleashing his secret amal on the universe, regardless of the consequences.The writing style and depth have improved considerably from the beginning in House Atreides. The vivid details make it easy to imagine the majesty of Kaitain, the desolation of Dune, and the depravity of Geidi Prime. Herbert and Anderson also show more confidence in developing intricate plots and subplots. And still, they manage a little humor, like the Baron's etiquette lessons.But, like other reviewers have pointed out, the prequel isn't finished yet. There needs to be a fourth book, to seal the gap, the empty 15 years between House Corrino and Dune. I know Herbert and Anderson are up to the task."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is the third of the Dune: House books, which as a group make up a major 'prequel' to where the action starts in the original classic Dune. Readers who have not read the original should definitely read that first, else much of this book and its two predecessors will either not make sense or lose their emotional freighting due to absence of knowledge of what happens later to the main characters.The prime focus of this book is the Emperor Shaddam Corrino, flexing his ambitious, if not greatly intellectual, muscle, in an attempt to become the sole ruler of the empire, without the limitations imposed by the noble houses, the Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the CHOAM regulation of the spice flow. Opposing him in this complex weave of multiple story lines are the Baron Harkonnen, with his own desires on power; Duke Leto, finding his ground as leader and a man of honor; Prince Rhombur Vernius, finally finding his courage and attempting to take back his home world; a world occupied by the Tleilaxu, who are trying to develop a synthetic form of spice. And it is Corrino's dependence on the success of the synthetic spice project that gives him the confidence to take action to consolidate his power.In terms of sheer complexity of story line, this book is as rich as the original. But as the goal of the major character is power for its own sake, without grounding in any higher 'human' goals, without the rich interplay between philosophy, ecology, politics and action of the original, it cannot achieve the so easily scaled original's heights. Instead what we end up with is a very good action/adventure story, that does a decent job of filling in the some of the historical and character background for the main story line of Dune, but does no more. In sheer complexity, its very short chapters, and constant point-of-view shifts, it is very similar to some of A. E. van Vogt's better re-complicated stories.Characterization is reasonably well done, but none of the characters is explored in extreme depth, a pity in the case of Duke Leto, as his character is only briefly sketched in Dune, and yet he obviously had a great influence in molding Paul's character, and knowing him in much greater detail than shown here would have been very nice.This is the best of the three 'prequel' books, a definite page turner (which is hard to achieve when you start off already knowing what the eventual outcome will be), and makes a nice addition to the Dune universe. A must for Dune addicts, others can keep this one for a rainy afternoon's entertainment."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is by far the worst of the three prequel books. It seems rushed and Herbert feels the need to remind the reader of what happened in the other two books at every turn, like a nagging teacher reminding a child what they learned yesterday in class. Of all three books this is the one that most feels like Herbert is just trying to cash in on the work his father did. Perhaps he was tiring of the series by the time he started writing this book because there is no imagination here. There are no surprises in this book and you know everything that is going to happen before you open the book. Everything works out in the end, but seemingly more by chance than by anything any of the characters or Brian Herbert do. The book actually becomes more painful to read the farther along you go and towards the end of the book one just wants it to end. The book is very shallow, and Herbert's characters actually become more one dimensional than they were in the other two books. If you've read the other two prequel books like me you are probably going to feel compelled to buy this book. My advice is to have second book on the nightstand to read when you get bored. One plus is the chapters are very short so you don't feel compelled to read any more than you can stand in one night.Now I must go read Frank Herbert's Dune in order to purge my soul."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The original Dune is one of my favorite books. Frank Herbert created a world that was beautifully and convincingly imagined, where high technology had reduced warfare to a matter of swords and knives and where an exotic drug both prolonged life and made interstellar travel possible. However, the later sequels to Dune degenerated into characterless strategy books. His son, unfortunately, goes in the opposite direction in his prequels (this is the third) and produces character studies with a bare minimum of plot.The younger Herbert is a competent author, but his story is stretched paper thin in an attempt to include all the major characters from Dune without any dramatic action that would contradict the older book. There is practically no reason, for instance, to have included the Fremen in this series, and very little reason to have included the Harkonens. All in all, this book and the series to which it belongs are unsatisfying and unnecessary. The subtle games of politics and nuance practiced in the world of the origninal Dune universe are completely missing, which robs the characters of much of their fascination. Reading this book on it's own without having read Dune, the entire concept of Galactic Empire seems silly and outdated. It's a measure of the writing skill of Frank Herbert that he was able to make it so convincing in his orginal work."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I have to wonder if the authors ever read the original Dune books because of the way they've hacked and slashed at major plot points. Without that butchery I could have dealt with the lesser quality of writing, but I found all the Dune prequels to be literary insults to Frank Herbert.Did these guys not like Dune? Did they decide they could do a better job? I'd prefer to think they just didn't pay attention. I get the feeling it was more the latter, given how blatantly the universe was twisted and the basic facts of the story as illustrated by Frank Herbert were discarded outright.I didn't disagree with everything they did. The treatment of Bene Gesserit characters was poor, at best. The sisters clearly made great strides in intelligence, perceptiveness and adaptability in the 15 years between the end of Dune: House Corrino and Dune. Had they been that good during Corrino, a lot of things wouldn't have happened. Oh, wait. Maybe that was the point.I remain extremely disappointed, as if some child with a brush and some latex semi-gloss had decided to embellish a Rembrandt."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This was a most dramatic conclusion for this prequel set of books, preceding the Frank Herbert series. All loose ends came interwoven into several plots that worked their way into a grand finale. Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are to be commended for bringing us, once again, into a universe that seems forever all-encompassing and on an epic scale, yet they have retained all the subtlty, energy, and depth that the characters of Dune deserve.

I have read and re-read the book many times and with each reading, find new levels of meaning. The world which Mr Herbert created in Dune is a fascinating one which raises far more questions than answers. Although I have read all the progency of Dune, they have always left me feeling unsatisfied. I think the reason is that the sequels abandon the original world of Dune in favor of the new universe created by Paul Atreides. This prequel trilogy goes back to the original world of Dune and fills in the gaps very imaginatively. It provides fascinating answers to the question of what is a Ginaz Swordmaster and how did Baron Harkonnen get so fat. Even better, it gives far more information about two of my favorite characters in Dune who did not survive much beyond the first third of the book: Duke Leto and Duncan Idaho. This is a nice effort which should appeal to true Dune lovers."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Emperor Shaddam Corrino is firmly entrenched on the Imperial thrown during his spice war (i.e. rooting out illegal stockpiles of melange from various houses and worlds in unsavory ways). His assistant, Count Fenring, is devilishly clever as he manipulates the Emperor and thus is basically the power behind the thrown. Of course, the spice wars don't go exactly as planned since the Emperor's project Amal (a synthetic form of spice) falls apart...in part thanks to Duke Leto Atreides.Liet becomes the Naib of all the sietches on Dune and helps further humiliate the opposing Harkonnens on the planet. The ending Fremen chapter in the book is exceptionally prophetic since those who've read the original Dune novel (by Frank Herbert) know the reason why the worms act the way they do toward the end of this novel (House Corrino).The Bene Geserit continue on in their quest for the Kwizatz Haderach but get thrown a curve when Jessica delivers Paul, a son, rather than a daughter that their breeding program requires.Duke Leto, Prince Rhombur, Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho mount an offensive to take back the world of Ix for the renegade Vernius family, thus aiding in the destruction of project Amal (which was taking place on Ix) and saving Dune from destruction by Imperial forces (the Emperor planned to attack and Char Dune to a crisp so that he would have the only form of spice: Amal).There are weaknesses in the story, however. Most notably is the introduction and demise of Mephistis Cru, an 'etiquette' advisor for the Baron Harkonnen who's storyline does not advance the history of Dune in the slightest (or any of the parallel stories as far as I can tell).The entrance of Rhombur into a navigators enclosure. From my understanding, no one was allowed to see a navigator except those who are within the guild itself.And the discovery of the Atoxl tanks by the invading Atreides forces and others (including Fenring) who'd seen the tanks. According to Dune, no one ever saw these tanks or a Tleilaxu female...ever! Except for the Tleilaxu specialists themselves. This seemed inconsistent with Frank Herbert's vision.But even with these problems, the book moves along at a good clip (sometimes overly simplistically so for a Dune book). From about page 300 on I was thoroughly engrossed in the novel and had trouble putting it down (I have the British version which is typeset differently than the American hardback).A fun jaunt through the Dune universe for those out there with an interest in Science Fiction and those fascinated by the history of the Dune characters that Frank Herbert conjured up out of his incredible mind.

Anderson and Herbert write a plot with much of the subtlety, literacy, and character depth that the great Frank Herbert was known for. Although it is nigh-impossible to match the feat of such a great author, I think this duo hits it right on the mark, or at least not far off. I hope they write more serieses or individual novels in the Dune universe and maintain their high level of quality."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Kevin Anderson and Brian Herbert have pulled off a impossible feat: They have taken Brian's late father epic vision of the future and expanded the mythology surrounding the dune universe.This gripping conclusion concerns the House Corrino and in particular, The Emperor Shaddam IV who's lust to obtain absolute power will threatening the known universe!He and his chief henchman, the deadly count Fenring are hatching a plot with the sinister Tleilaxu to create a synthetic spice so he can control it's output and break the monopoly that the Guild has on the it. You will watch as mysterious Bene Gesserit Sisterhood will take Jessica away from Duke Leto who child she carries because the child is the subject of the Sisterhood's centuries old plot to create a superbeing.This novel has scenes of machivellian intrigues of the noble houses and spectacular battle scenes.

Dune fans, if you want to spend some more time in the Dune universe - or something like it -, get ready to &quot;ignore&quot; the screw-ups.As a better alternative, however, make up your own stories and write them down. You'll probably do better than House Corrino..."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson spin an interesting tale in this prequel trilogy to the Dune series. Many have blasted this series for not being up to the same level as Frank Herbert's original writing. An easy argument to make, however who can really imitate any particularly incredible writing style? Brian and Kevin do write a page-turning tale in this trilogy. I would argue that although not as deep or clever as Frank's writing it is written in a manner that keeps the reader going. I would argue that these books are much more action-oriented than the original Dune series and the trade off is depth for action. It does seem to have the feel of fan fiction; however, it is well-written fan fiction. There are minor points that are inconsistent with the original Dune and might cause hard-core fans distress but otherwise it is quite readable. My harshest criticism would be that the authors clearly do not have the life experience and depth of knowledge that made Frank such a wonderful writer. Frank was clearly influenced by his study of Arabic and other languages, mythology and the theory of myth, and a depth of understanding of several fields of study that shape our world - politics, economics, ecology. Brian/Kevin are more influenced by pop culture - especially David Lunch's film interpretation of Dune. It is amusing to note that Brian takes more from David Lunch's movie than his fathers own writing. Clearly, he was not interested in retracing the in-depth research his father had done in preparation of writing the original trilogy. It is also important to point out that it took Frank around 17 years to complete the original trilogy, whereas Brian cranked his out in 3 years. The result is the difference between a fine artisan versus someone who just needs to bang out a book every year.Having said all that however, the books are quite readable and page turners (probably Anderson's influence). They do have some absurd moments that do smack of not having been thought through (turtle jousting - need I say more). The characters are quite simple for the most part and descriptors are used to the point of abuse - weasel-faced Fenrig. Some phrases are also used to the point of abuse (as if they were copied and pasted systematically throughout with little thought of context). Be warned, a phrase that was eminently clever in Frank's writing will be repeated ad nauseum in the Brian/Kevin trilogy. This trilogy was clearly formulated to appeal to Sci-Fi's largest target audience - young males 11 to 17 years old. It does its job well. Unfortunately, those of us who enjoyed Frank's exploration of myth, messiah, and religion will be utterly disappointed. The more tangible topics such as politics, economics, and ecology are given some depth. The depth inevitably is shattered however by radically unlikely confluences of events. Whereas Frank demonstrated a 'domino-effect' of change, Brian is more familiar with the 'massive set of synchronous coincidences' resulting in change.Based on this trilogy, do not expect compelling depth from the Butlerian Jihad trilogy; however, a rip-roaring roller coaster ride of action and intrigue is more likely. If you go to Kevin and Brian's website, you will also notice they are speculating on the creation of a trilogy bridging the Leto to Paul years (early Paul). Note that they assume they need a trilogy. Ugh. The mantra-hobgoblin of many authors these days - Produce! Produce! Produce! Also, note that somewhere along the line they intend to complete Frank's unfinished novel tentatively the unnamed 'Dune 7'. If Brian and Kevin are reading this, please heed my request - Do NOT write a trilogy on the 'early Paul' years (Leto II only got two books - really guys). Also, please take a very deep, introspective look at what you want out of Dune 7. Frank spent enormous amounts of time learning about language, myth, and history. Do his memory justice and do the same before you set out on what should be a requiem for him. Quality over quantity, depth over distraction."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I am a \\"Dunetic\\". There is no escaping that fact. I have read everything I can get a hold of, including Herbert Jr.'s prequals. I've made my own observations of these books. Let me share them with you.Let's look at the negative...1. No, these books were not written by Frank Herbert. We all know that. No one should walk into them believing that they were. They lack Frank Herbert's grace and his beautifully written prose and poetry. Period.2. These books conflict with many of the facts layed out in the Dune series WRITTEN by Frank Herbert. (I do not mention the Dune Encyclopedia as it is a well known fact that the author contrived a great deal of the information without clearing it with Herbert Sr.) It is my belief that when an author has died, \\"discovered\\" notes or not, the written and published works are to be the ONLY source. They should be the only \\"bible\\" of any fan writer or relative completing unfinished works. Discovered notes or outlines can be used so long as they correspond with the published works. Frank Herbert MAY have written the scene where Jessica and Leto meet (as written in House Harkonnen) however, for whatever reasons he had, he chose NOT to use that version in the original Dune. Brian Herbert should have respected that. He needs to take notes from Christopher Tolkien.OK. Now the positive...1. Are they fun to read? Yes. For someone craving more Dune stories, they were entertaining. They weren't the philosophical pieces of mastery his father left, but they were FUN.2. Take with them what you want and leave the rest behind. I enjoyed the little storylines that DID fit into the Duniverse as depicted by Frank Herbert.3. If you must, believe that the official Imperial records were tainted and changed by whichever organization you wish for whatever political reasons that they believed necessary to hide whatever secrets they were hording. Be it Guild, CHOAM, House Corrino, the Fremen, or the Bene Gesserit.4. Just enjoy them for what they are. If you can seperate the different mediums, you might have fun reading them."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"House Corrino is a solid finish to the prequel trilogy to the Dune series. It is a vast improvement to the deeply flawed House Harkonnen.This prequel series has a problem familiar to prequels, you know certain characters are going to survive. This series actually manages to get around that, although clues were given as to the ability for this character to be killed, and yet still be present in the book \\"Dune\\". But in most cases, the reader is aware that the characters who are placed in danger are going to survive.HH was a mess because it told a story set across years, resulting in changes to characters' personalities without proper development.House Corrino, fortunately, doesn't suffer from that problem, taking place over a much shorter period of time. It's a lot of fun exploring the Universe of Dune, and explore it we do.This book takes up where HH ended, Leto still inmourning over the death of his son, Victor, killed in an assination attempt upon himself by his son's mother, Leto's concubine Kailea, an exiled noblewoman from Ix, driven against the Duke by an undiscovered Harkonnen agent.Prince Rhombur, his body virtually destroyed, and now turned into a cyborg, is determined to free Ix from those who stole his world years earlier, and he and Leto get serious about planning to take back the world.Emperor Shaddam is continuing with his plan to gain control of spice by having control of a synthetic form of melange, known as amal.And the Bene Gesserit are rejoicing in the upcoming birth of a special child: the daughter of Jessica, the new concubine of Duke Leto. The problem is, the Sisterhood doesn't know that Jessica is pregnant with a boy, not a girl.House Harkonnen is up to no good...imagine that? We follow Freman, freedom fighters on Ix, Guild Navigators, Swordmasters, Spies, Actors and others as plots twist within plots.This series is fun, but there should be no doubt: these three additions to the Dune novels don't hold a candle to the original works."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Let me start by saying it's better than the first two. Let me continue by saying that when I got to the end of this third book, I was thinking the story could have been told (and told better) in just one book by discarding the fluffy nonsense and keeping just the meat of the story.Bad writing. It's still there, and it hasn't gotten any better. Just one example of the completely ridiculous phrases is on page 552, \\"hold on to the gossamer strands of her sanity.\\" On its own, that phrase is already ludicrous; what makes it even more so is the fact that the authors had already overused (and misused) the word \\"gossamer\\" a dozen times.Unbelievable actions. Literally millions of innocent civilians are murdered without justification, and without repercussions. A universe where governments behaved this way would not survive the reign of one emperor, let alone 10,000 years.Hectic ending. The last 150 pages are unnecessarily hectic as the authors try to wrap up the many threads initiated by the unbelievable actions previously mentioned. House Moritani, House Harkonnen, House Atreides and Emperor Corrino are all undertaking major military operations. Furthermore, Jessica is in labor and the amal project is reaching its culmination. As if all of this weren't enough, the authors throw in an additional plot line involving the twisted Mentat Peter DeVries. The motivation for his actions in particular has gone beyond the realm of the unlikely into the neighborhood of mind-boggling-ly (is that a word?) stupid. Usually, when authors have a character do something uncharacteristic it's because of a need to move the plot forward, but this plot already had too much going on without this. This unnecessary and absurd thread seriously detracted from the ending.Inattention to detail. I have previously mentioned that the authors sometimes appear not to have read the original Dune Chronicles series. Well, now I wonder if they've read their own work. On page 49, they write \\"A few years ago, distracted by a document he'd been studying, Leto had accidentally crushed the insect.\\" But that's not actually what happened in House Harkonnen; what actually happened is that Leto was distracted FROM the document BY a guard and the document fell on the insect.Freedom. Why do \\"the good guys\\" keep using the word \\"free\\"? Leto and Rhombur might be good enlightened leaders, but that doesn't make them any less than complete autocrats or make their peoples any more free than they would be under the Tleilaxu or Harkonnens or Corrinos. This could have provided a fruitful line of discussion had the authors been trying to paint their characters as unaware of their own failings in this regard, but Herbert & Anderson don't seem to have given this a second thought (despite their excessive use of the word \\"free\\") and never manage to move beyond their nave notion of good versus evil to explore this idea.Overall, I would rate it slightly higher than the first two books in the series, somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. Still no masterpiece."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I was quite intrigued by the idea of a Dune prequel, and very excited to see that it was Herbert's son Brian co-authoring the work, but having completed the series, I wish it hadn't been written. Another reviewer called this &quot;Dune lite&quot;, and hit the nail on the head. While it certainly is a complex tale, it was complex for the sake of complexity, not because it was integral to the story.Like the Star Wars prequels so far, there is little insight into Frank Herbert's world, vague attempts at developing the characters, which wholly failed, and the stories are not bad in theory, but rather pointless in practice. To me, this series was an attempt to cash in on a genius' work, just as the Star Wars prequels were great for putting another few hundred million dollars in George Lucas' pockets, while not being worthy of 12-year-olds.Herbert's original Dune works were absolutely brilliant, with intriguing characters and events, and deeply interesting, even for those reading them for the nth time. I would have preferred them left alone, rather than brought down to this poor level by people who will never come near Frank Herbert's one-in-a-million talent."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"House Corrino is a worthy ending to the prequel trilogy to the great novel \\"Dune.\\" I thoroughly enjoyed it. In this novel, the Emperor Shaddam Corrino tries to conclude his plan to remake the Galactic Imperium through his secret artificial spice project. House Atreides secures its position as Duke Leto gains experience as the Duke of Caladan. Overall, this is a very interesting storyline that holds the reader's interest and leads up to the original Dune novel theme. A book that can do all that is not unimpressive.In fact, House Corrino does a fair job of explaining the inner workings of the Galactic Imperium--better than Dune itself did. The reader learns a great deal about House-to-House warfare, the strictures of kanly, and other elements of the Dune universe which the original Dune novel really only just touched upon. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, similarly, springs to life in this novel.I went back and forth between three stars and four, but ultimately went with four stars because this book passed one of my major tests: I enjoyed reading it the second time as much as the first. This is a genuine story of political intrigue that is internally consistent, features decent character development (perhaps even better than Frank Herbert achieved in Dune; character development was never one of Frank Herbert's major strengths.)Overall this is an engaging novel that Dune enthusiasts won't want to pass up. I thought it was clearly better than the sequels to Dune that Frank Herbert himself wrote."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The original Dune was the 1966 Hugo Award winning novel. If it wasn't for that fact I may not have given it as much leeway when I first read it however. With a completely different language and universe, I found it hard at the beginning to get into the mind set of the book, and to associate with that world. Of course once I did, it became one of the best books I've ever read. Several other people I've known over the years had similar troubles starting the novel, and I was saddened to learn that they never completed it.After reading the three prequals which Frank Herbert's son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson have put together, House Corrino being the last, I can't help wondering if things would have been different for these people if these novels were the first books in the series that they had read. They are all well written, enough so to keep a reader coming back for more on their own weight. They are true to the original story, enough so that they have added some great insight which you do not get from the original. Also, I believe, they are an easier read. Which may attract more readers to this wonderful series which otherwise may have been a little intimidated. These prequels set up the original perfectly. I highly recommend these books."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"&quot;Dune: House Corrino&quot; was a rush job. Written in sophomoric prose, it totally lacks the complex, mind-bending, intrigue that characterized Frank Herbert's best Dune books.Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's opening prequel (&quot;Dune: House Atreides&quot;) was a good-enough extrapolation of the Herbert Senior's series, in the style of his &quot;least good&quot; books. (I use the stilted phrase here because even F.H.'s worst books were very good).The second (&quot;Dune: House Harkonnen&quot;) book's style dropped a notch, the characters became wooden and the plot linear.The third prequel descended into the pits of bad writing. The style is flat, confusing and simplistic, the characters paper-thin and the plot one-dimensional.What really rankles me is the obvious fact that the authors really don't *know* the Dune universe. (E.g.: BH&amp;KA's fremen are diurnal.)To tell the truth, I slogged through the book as a good Bad SF Example. I'm starting to write SF, and examining all the book's weaknesses seemed like a good way of identifying what I shouldn't do in the future.I think I'll go back and reread the whole FH Dune series just to get rid of the bad taste in my mouth that reading this book left me."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I had the highest hopes for the new Dune Trilogy. I was deeply saddened that Herbert and Anderson came so far from delivering. In House Corrino, Herbert and Anderson take characters and ideas inherited from Mr. Herbert's father and drain them of complexity and interest. The nuanced figures of the Red Duke, the conniving Count Fenrig and the Padisha Emperor are turned into good guy, bad guy and inhuman caricature of evil respectively. The mystical Saddukar are turned into common thugs. The eerie and subtle powers of the original Bene Geserit are made the parlor tricks of silly women. The first Dune's delicate play of power between the Spacing Guild, the CHOAM and the BG was mocked by the one dimensional and monolithic rule of the nearly mad Shadam. Maudlin writing and worse plotting makes this one of the least enjoyable books I've read all year.

However I found the final third of the book to be a rush of bring-up-issue, resolve, repeat.Also disappointing is that the richness of the characters was neither exploited nor acknowledged. Characters folded into single dimensional entities that acted and re-acted to situations in a way that was simply expedient to move the story along to its conclusion rather than with the greater depth and complexity that Dune readers would expect.If you have read the preceeding two books of this trilogy then you'll definitely want to read this book to wrap up the series. I would not recommend this as a standalone read, but as a cap it is quite adequate. If you're a die-hard Dune fan, then I expect you'll still enjoy this prequel that leads directly to the original \\"Dune\\" book. Personally I found the \\"Legends of Dune\\" trilogy vastly more epic and entertaining than the \\"House Trilogy\\".My recommendation?

The third book in the prequel series tries hard to paint a vivid and striking portrait of Kaitan life and the political intrigues behind the throne, I found the story stilted and a little flawed (especially after the taut construction of HA and HH.A few things really bothered me, especially when you think that the story occurs in 10,000 AD (or thereabouts, can't quite be sure):1) People run around and say stuff like &quot;Vermillion Hells!&quot; way too much for my liking.2) People do an awful lot of unnecessary travel in this book.3) Given the far-reaching date, mankind seems to have REgressed instead of PROgressed (an especially endearing part of the original DUNE series is that sense of familiar yet alien that was brought about because of the remoteness of the date).4) The authors pay an incredible amount of attention to what the characters are wearing, giving me the impression I was watching/reading &quot;Fashion File: What To Wear To Ix&quot; or the fashion section of the Kaitan Weekly.5) Baron Harkonnen in this book is a total wimp without half the viciousness expressed in the original book or in House Harkonnen.6) The Bene Gesserit are totally devoid of mystery and intrigue. Whereas the final three books in the original series made them human and totally mysterious, the prequel books give them the air of being nothing more than bickering nuns who can't even hypnotize anyone properly. Shabby way to deal with such a vital part of the Dune Mystique.So, bottom line: could have been so much more but decided to go the &quot;Space Opera&quot; route instead.

Phrases such as 'wheel-within-wheels' and many others, which have been used to describe or review Frank Herbert's work, are actually used here as part of the story!The opening text at the beginning of each chapter in the Dune series served to enhance that chapter and create a sense of depth but in the prequels, it seemed forced and at times laughable.It seems to this reader that even Dune Revenant, the fan fiction posted on various sites, despite being a first draft, captured the complexity, politics, theology and the heart of Frank Herbert's creation more successfully than the authors of the prequels."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is by far the most sophisticated storytelling of all the three books in the prequel trilogy.

While the story took certain forgivable liberties with the original Frank Herbert premise, I found it to be within a very acceptable framework.While it would be a mistake to say that this trilogy is just as good as the one written by Frank Herbert, standing on its own merit, Dune House trilogy proves to be pretty entertaining and well told. In all three books, various plot lines were easy followed and they intermixed very nicely within the plot.House Corrino, in my opinion, is probably the weakest of the three books simply because its too pat. The authors have to tied all the loose ends to a fitting conculsion and they probably short changed the plot to make it work. Thus they resorted in changing the premise of the continued story to make everything fit together. For example, I mean, its bit silly that the Bene Gesserit didn't know that the child of Jessica will be a boy. A group that looked into the human species as an exact science should have known such an information of such importance to them far before the birth. After all, we can do that even now!!! In using this case as an example, it shows how the authors artifically created an unrealistic premises within the Dune universe to create a format where they can tied couple of loose ends together. Thus, lies the weakness of the book. (And why the reader of this review should considered my 4 stars to be 3.5).But overall, the book was enjoyable reading and it should satisfied anyone who enjoyed the universe of Frank Herbert....as long as they don't expect the writing and the style to be that of Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This volume is the concluding volume of the Prelude to the Dune series. It is a marvellous concluding volume. The Herberts, and probably more the father than the son because the father designed the whole series, are against politics in many ways. Politics, when it falls in the hands of greedy people, violent people, immoral people, becomes a real plague to humanity. But deeper than that we can question what limits are missing for these to become such a plague. Greed is the result of a certain economic system that considers profit as being the utmost value in life. It forgets progress is only progress when it is shared by all. Violence is the result of the possibility for some to do what they want because there is no democratic control of their actions. It negates democracy that states that an action has to be approved by all. Immorality is the result of personal or collective creeds that one or a group can do what they please because they have some justification on their sides, be it a twisted religion, or a contorted ideology, or a perverted psychology. It rejects sharing and togetherness that imply that pleasure is only acceptable when it is the pleasure of all. But at the same time the book shows how some can act along a code of honor and a rule of love and that honor and love impose some duties on all : the duty to respect others, to help the weak, to support the poor, to work for the happiness of all. And this attitude becomes the troublemaker for the greedy, the violent and the immoral. The book is optimistic when it states that in the end the good always succeed. Maybe the good in a transhistorical approach, but how many good men, women and children may have died and perished before the good win ? There is also in the book, like in all the books of the series, direct allusions to some of our references : the Catholic Bible for example. The supreme merchants (the Guild and the CHOAM, who have the absolute monopoly on transportation) are also the supreme rulers and no one can do anything without their ultimate support, which means that they will do nothing against some evil as long as their immediate economic interest is not at stake. They are like referees who only see evil when it steps on their toes, and they often accept bribes to close their eyes to some evil in the making. It then appears that there cannot be any peace if it is not based on some balance of terror or fear. In other words peace is nothing but some equilibrium among worlds that may be as evil as the devil himself but who are kept in place by some deterring power that has to be well shared. And that is the only shared element in this world : the fear of some possible terror. Peace can only exist within a constant cold war. Until some new disruption appears from inside or outside. There is no hope in this world, in this vision. But the book is tremendously fascinating as a mirror of our shortcomings, and it is entertaining.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The authors continue to portray 1 dimensional characters that in any realistic scenario would be complete incompetents.There is no subtleness/realism/intelligence built into any of the characters."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Dune: House Corrino will make for an enjoyable return to the universe created by Frank Herbert, and kept alive by his son and Kevin Anderson. Every Dune fan I know has curiosity about the history and politics in the Dune universe. DHC ties together the events of the earlier two books in this trilogy, laying the groundwork for a very plausible beginning to the original Dune novel. Anderson and the younger Herbert lack some of Frank's deftness with presenting exceptionally unique characters, and Prince Vernius in DHC could be considered by some to be a little &quot;over the top.&quot; However, these flaws are minor and will not detract from your enjoyment. Old fans: shake off the dust and embrace the new- pick it up and read it. Newbies: I recommend starting either with the original &quot;Dune&quot; or with &quot;Dune: House Atriedes.&quot;"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I must admit, I'm a little surprised by the mediocre rating this book has on Amazon. While it's to be expected that it would not receive the same glowing reviews as Frank Herbert's original Dune novels, I found House Corrino (as well as the first two Prelude to Dune novels) to be a rock-solid 4-star outing.It's a fair criticism to knock Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson for not matching the literary quality of Frank Herbert's Dune and its five original sequels. Dune is, after all, considered by many to be the best science-fiction novel ever written. (If you're reading this, the odds are you've read at least Dune and need no convincing of that.) While the Herbert/Anderson novels sacrifice some of the depth of the originals, though, they do make up for it in a faster pacing and remarkable plotting. Even if there are a few inconsistencies between these prequels and the originals, it's nothing compared with the problems you see in the Star Wars prequels, and those were made by the original creator - so that should give a hint as to just how much of a challenge it is to work with a fictional universe like this.Step back from the criticisms of the obsessives and those who simply can't bear other authors treading on the sacred ground Frank Herbert created, and you get my perspective: A science-fiction fan, a fan of the Dune series and of well-plotted novels in general. For me, these novels triumph - big time. The curse of the prequel is that in the end you wind up right back where you started (in this case, not long before the original Dune begins). The Prelude to Dune novels manage to make it all interesting and compelling. There is plenty of room for surprises in these books, and quite a bit of suspense. One example is Paul's birth. Of course he will survive, and so will Jessica - yet the birth sequence is so tense I felt like I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.The Herbert/Anderson novels expertly set up the plot-points like a set of dominoes, positioning the many characters just-so, piece by piece, and when the dominoes start to fall, I find it tremendously satisfying. So, no, it's not a Frank Herbert book, but it's a great conclusion to a remarkable trilogy.I was shocked to read an on-line review of this book by someone who hadn't read the first two House books, so I'll conclude with this: If you've read the original Dune novels and enjoyed House Atreides, I think you'll enjoy following up with House Harkonnen and House Corrino. If you didn't like House Atreides, you will probably want to steer clear of the other Herbert/Anderson novels. Above all, you definitely should not read House Corrino until you've read House Atreides and House Harkonnen."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Brian Herbert is the son of Frank Herbert creator of Dune Saga and a sci-fi writer himself. Kevin Anderson is also a successful sci-fi writer and Dune's Saga fan.Brian and Kevin start with this trilogy a difficult mission: revisit Dune's universe describing the events immediately preceding Dune, the first & unforgettable volume of the famous saga.Did they succeed? Well, yes and... no. Yes because they deliver an interesting first step with all the elements of this fascinating universe; and no because the stories are not as gripping as the original Dune.Nevertheless Dune's fans (as me) should not be too disappointed because even Frank Herbert wasn't at the same height when writing Dune Messiah, Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune and he will recover allure only with the two last books of the series.So let us hope the same will happen with Brian & Kevin efforts in next trilogies!The variety of themes touched by the original series is still present in this trilogy: ecology, political-religious interaction, genetic manipulation, longevity drugs and secret sisterhoods and brotherhoods.The story is as follows.The Scenery.There is a Galactic Empire ruled by the Emperor. There are powerful Noble Houses that rule different planetary systems and confront each other in endless struggle, yet subject to strict rules. There is a Guild of interstellar Pilots. There is the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood following their eugenic plans and playing in backstage as advisors to all powers. Computers & AI are forbidden and replaced by human-computers called Mentat. Arrakis is Desert Planet producer of a unique substance: the Spice and it is inhabited by mysterious desert dwellers: the Fremen.The Argument.Consist of several threads that are mingled and interact thru the whole triad.A Duke Leto Atreides is decided to establish his House in a dominant position at the same time Lady Jessica his concubine is pregnant.The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood following their eugenic plans is anxiously waiting for Jessica's child certain that will be the expected girl.Baron Vladimir head of Noble House Harkonnen, Atreides' ancestral enemy, continue staging plot after plot against the Atreides.The Emperor Shaddam is certain that his secret plan to obtain synthetic Spice is nearing success and start launching imprudent political and military blows without the counsel of his intimate supporter Count Fenring.The Bene Tleilax main investigator is planning to profit from \\"his\\" Spice and let down Emperor's hopes.This book is the best of the trilogy and all threads are neatly tied at its conclusion.I recommend this book to sci-fi lovers and general public too.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This section of the the pre-dune set really ties things together well and keeps you involved in everything leading up to Frank's original book. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"House of Corrino was a well done book, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the 1st 2 book of the trilogy, but what I like about it was that it tied everything in. Made everything fall into place. I'm currently on the 2nd Dune book by Frank Herbert and I think that his son Brian certainly is following in his dad's footsteps!"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I won't say the Dune &quot;Prequel&quot; Trilogy is entirely without merit. Any of the three books is an entertaining read for a cross-country train trip or a trans-Atlantic flight, like a Tom Clancy novel would be. But most people who know and love the &quot;Dune&quot; chronicles cannot help but be disappointed, even angry, at these pale imitations of the originals. The most striking lesson to be gleaned from these new Dune books is the difference between a truly gifted writer and a hack; between a serious work of imagination and literary skill, and airport lounge pulp fiction.I won't detail all of the failings of the narrative - the inconsistencies with the original series, the sometimes absurd plot development, the gaping holes and internal inconsistencies in the story. Other reviewers have dealt with these at some length.My biggest beef with these three books - all of them - is how poorly written they are (especially &quot;House Corinno&quot;). One would have hoped that more of Frank Herbert's literary ability would have found its way into his son's genes than apparently did. (Call the Bene Gesserit, quick! We need a new breeding program here!) The dialogue is often stilted, the character development shallow, and the structure fragmented, episodic and jerky. In contrast to Frank Herbert's elegant, even serene construction, Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have unfortunately adopted the hyperactive &quot;jump-around&quot; style so beloved of today's writers of second-rate entertainment fiction.Most disappointing to me was the shallowness of these new books. Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; books were books of IDEAS more than books about events and action. A great deal of their narrative was occupied with people's THOUGHTS, at least as much as with their actions. Brian Herbert's &amp; Kevin Anderson's books, by contrast, are almost entirely devoid of thought, ideas or philosophy and are entirely preoccupied with who is doing what. At best, this makes their books entertaining, something with which to while away the hours. But they are simply not in the same league with the original Dune books. For the newcomer to the world of Dune, moving from &quot;House Corinno&quot; to &quot;Dune&quot; will be like moving from Harold Robbins to Steinbeck or Hemmingway.Reading my way through these three books, I frequently found myself wishing that one of the Tleilaxu had been around when Frank Herbert died, to grow a Ghola Herbert in their axolotl tanks. These prequels might have really been something in the hands of a gifted writer."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I am HUGE Dune and Herbert fan-Frank that is-but I enjoyed House Atreides and House Harkonnen. They were not as well written as the original Dune novels, but they were a chance to live in the universe. I loved that Mohiam was Jessicas mom, that she gave Baron H his disease. I liked the info about the Spacing Guild Navigator training, The Sword Master School-for Duncan Idaho, info about the BG training academy on Wallach IX, and the time spent in the Sietch with the Fremen.However, there are glaring discrpancies which really bothered me. Slight though they are, they take away from the spirit of the original Dune novels. I hate that Gurnery Halleck is not actually saved by Duke Leto Atreides-but is a stow away in a shipment of that he ordered-Much is made of Hallecks devotion to Leto because he saved him which makes no sense at all if he was a stow away-which had little to do with Leto helping him at all. I also disliked the telling about the ghola tanks-that was just wrong. I did not like that Paul was born not on Caladan which is stated like the first page of the original Dune novel. Stuff like that ruined the series for me. I could have more easily handled the weakening of key characters-most notably Count Fenrig-if the novels had stayed truer to the facts established in the other novels. Maybe if it had been written further from Dune begins it would have been easier to stomach. I do not know, but I found House Corrino the weakest of the novels because I felt it did a poor job tying into Dune.I would read the prequel novels, they are an easier read for those who felt Dune ovberwhelming and not be missed for fans of the series."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Yes House Harkonnen was not as good as the first novel but what hapened here? It's almost as though they kept the downward spiral going as each book progressively gets worse. I liked Atredies and enjoyed Harkonnen but this edition was pitiful. The first half is boring and simple. Never really gets to anything especially since I thought the second book set it up to be exciting. Then the second half, while picking up the pace, it seems as though the authors were bored and couldn't wait to start the butlerian Jihad trilogy. They just kind of hurry things along and wrap up the story with no real compelling conclusions. The last few chapters are so simple I felt cheated. If you have started the series you have to pick this book up to finish it off but don't expect to have an real compelling ending."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"It's appaling what the due Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have done to the incredibly complex universe created by the late Frank Herbert. What was formerly the stage of speculations in ecology, political science, military strategy, religion, biological sciences, etc., was trivialized into the most blatant form of space opera.The Dune prequels are anything but science fiction. Sometimes they read like Days of our Lives in the distant future. So, why three stars, you would ask? Because if you're a Dune fan, you may still enjoy them. House Corrino is not the worst of the three, though it's not the best either. It neatly ties off the several subplots started in the first two books and establishes connections to the real Dune books. That means, all in all, it may be worth a read. I enjoyed them somewhat, but not nearly as much as I enjoyed Frank Herbert's books."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"House Corrino is the third volume in the House trilogy -- a compendium of books that tell the story of Duke Leto Atreides and the events that preceeded Herbert's epic novel Dune. I've already posted reviews for the first two and the same theme runs through this one -- it's a good book, definitely worth the time of Dune fans but probably not for the casual reader.Corrino is the best of the three books -- wrapping up most (but not all) of the threads from the previous two books into a thrilling conclusion. The best parts deal with the attempt to create a substitute for the spice melange. We finally see the horrible method of the Tleilaxu. Also very strong is the portrayal of Leto Atreides -- who has grown from an uncertain teenaged ruler to a brilliant politician -- by the end of the book you'll wish HE were Emperor instead of reckless Shaddam IV.Still, the book is not perfect. The style is still a little torpid and irrelevant plot threads are still present. However, both problems are reduced compared to previous books and the relevance of seemingly useless plot threads in the previous two books is explained. Still, I could have done without Baron Harkonnen's attempt to learn polish and protocol.If you've liked the first two books, you'll be very happy with this one. It won't haunt you like Dune. But it will entertain you for a few hours."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I read 'DUNE' when I was 14 years old. The book opened a new world for me, named: Arrakis. After reading the whole epiloge, I had a lot of questions that weren't awnsered.Some people don't want to know the awnsers and leave DUNE as it ended with Frank Herbert. Other people (including myself) want to keep DUNE alive and read these books from Brian Herbert.If you want the awnsers: Go and read the Dune trilogy by Brian Herbert. (including 'the Butlerian Jihad')His writing style is differend as his father's, but it still drags me into that world of DUNE and makes a brilliant story even better."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Readers of the previous Dune prequels (Atreides and Harkonnen) already know that the prequels fail to live up to original series in terms of complexity and quality. What is most surprising is that Dune: House Corrino fails to live up to the already limited expectations that we have of the prequels.House Corrino is inconsistent with the original series. Key plot elements, such as the melange project and the existence of no-globes, still violate the original series tenets. Of more concern is the reliance on blood-thristy mass destruction in this new book. Atomic and laser-based warfare enter this book with glee, thus destroying the new martial framework that F. Herbert invented and that B. Herbert and Anderson continued in the first 2 prequels.Not only is this book inconsistent with the original, it is inconsistent with the other prequels. If you read this book, you will find that the Ressert, Rhombur, and Idaho characters cannot maintain their identity that was established in House Harkonnen. You will also find that this book fails to adopt the multi-year, intricate plotting that Herbert &amp; Anderson tried to draw on before. This book takes only 1 year and attempts to stuff it so full of action and excitement that it reads like a book written after a movie.More disturbing is the blatant piracy of key scenes from the Star Wars movies. The use of weaponry, the resolution of certain characters, and the chaste romance will remind you more of Luke Skywalker and the crew than they will of any character from the Dune universe.In short, this book seems to be written in Anderson's Star Wars style with only minimal intervention by Herbert. Brian Herbert is a quality writer, as his efforts in _Man of Two Worlds_ shows. Anderson's reliance on gimmicks, weaponry, and Manichean illustrations come through in this book and make it an unworthy addition to the Dune universe in general and the Herbert/Anderson prequels in particular."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I had a hard time getting through \\"House Corrino,\\" Book 3 of the \\"Dune: House Trilogy\\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. On the one hand, the brevity of most of the sections was nice, because I could easily read a section or two at any and all opportunities. But, more importantly, the book has an inherent problem in that the sense of suspense is extremely limited. Is Emperor Shaddam IV going to succeed in his secret program to create a synthetic substitute for melange? No. Will someone succeed in stopping the Lady Jessica from bearing a son for her beloved Duke Leto? No. Is Gurney Halleck going to be stuck forever on a lost highliner? No. The reason I know all these answers is not because I am giving away spoilers to the book but because we know all the answers from having read Frank Hebert's original epic novel \\"Dune.\\" So the surprises here are few and minor, and there is no real sense of suspense. This may be a problem inherent to most prequels, as George Lucas is certainly proving over and over again on the big screen.Towards the end, as the various scenarios played out to their conclusions, things did got a bit more interesting. This was where Herbert and Anderson were able to fill in some gaps in the \\"Dune\\" backstory; my favorite would probably be the whole bit with the Bene Gesserit breeding program for producing the Kwisatz Haderach and the continuing ecological plan of Leit-Kynes for Arakkis (although less so with the latter than in previous volumes). I was even rethinking the rating I was planning on giving this book, but then Duke Leto announced the middle name for his son Paul and I went directly to my \\"Give me a break\\" mantra: how do you think the Lady Jessica would feel about Paul having that middle name? Especially when you take into account how Leto feels about his own mother. Then again, clearly the goal here is to show what Frank Herbert's giant cast of characters were doing before the events of \\"Dune.\\"Obviously, your decision to read \\"House Corrino\\" should already have been made. No one is going to read the third volume in a trilogy if they have not read the first two volumes. My general observation about the entire trilogy would be the closer the trilogy gets to the events of \\"Dune,\\" the weaker the narrative; the converse would apply as well. I certainly enjoyed \\"House Atreides\\" the best of the three, but I think \\"House Harkonnen\\" and \\"House Corrino\\" are a toss-up down on the next level. Of the trio of titular characters the authors do the most fleshing out with Shaddam, who is certainly a lesser figure in Dune than Duke Leto or the Baron Harkonnen. I was reading the \\"Dune: House Trilogy\\" as background work for teaching \\"Dune\\" in a Science Fiction course this semester and I will interested to see as I reread the original novel how well this trilogy fills in the book's massive backstory. For fans of the Dune series this is something you should probably read once, but my prediction (done without the use of melagne) is that you will not be going back and rereading it again."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I thought that Dune:House Corrino was a good conclusion to the Herbert/Anderson series. I think that because It filled in a lot of the gaps about the characters and their experiances. The discription of the settings and characters was pretty well done, in my opinion. But I think at the begining of chapters insead of having a little leaf symbol there should be a chapter number. That would make it a lot easier know what chapter you are on. But I think the quotes are a nice addition to the book, they make you see things in the book differently. This book probably wouldn't make much sense to you if you havn't read House Atreidies or House Harkonnen. but over all I think this is a valuable addition to Frank Herbert's colection and is well written. So enjoy this one and I hope the next book will be even beter!"},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Say what you will about the writing skills of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, their story makes for incredibly gripping listening.Especially with the superb vocalizations of reader Tim Curry.As I've noted in my reviews of the previous two readings (Dune: House Atriedes and Dune: House Harkonnen), Curry handles the reading duties with exceptional wit, zest and obvious enjoyment. His vocal renderings of the characters are nothing short of perfect.I bought this cassette edition the week it came out and I've been listening every day since. There are times when I simply don't want to get out of my car because I'm right in the middle of an action sequence and I want to discover how it turns out.The tapes begin with a bang -- Fremen attacking and easily verpowering sloppy, slumbering and drunken Harkonnen soldiers who are guarding an illegal stockpile of melange. From there, the story line jumps from the shortsighted, self-centered schemes of Emperor Shaddam Corrino to the synthetic spice research and manufacturing on IX to the relationship between Duke Leto Atreides and his concubine Lady Jessica to Prince Rhombur Vernius' attempts to return to his captured planet to...Let's just say there are so many plot threads and jumps to another world, another character, another violent plot from either Baron Harkonnen or Shaddam Corrino that you won't get bored. Not even slightly. Even though I know how the story eventually turns out (because of Frank Herbert's Dune book), I'm still caught up in the drama of it all -- relishing each plot unfolding.I haven't finished the tapes yet. But I can tell you I'm hanging on every word and I will, truly, be sad to see the story end.If you want to be highly entertained with a darn good story, and you have drive time to and from work or various locales, please don't hesitate to pick up this cassette series.That goes double if you've already spent time with the Dune world as seen through the eyes of Brian Herbert and Kevin J.

These books have told the story of the political maneuverings that led up to the Atreides arrival on Arrakis/Dune that sets in motion the ascent of Paul to the throne and to messiah status.All of these books deal with the feud between the Harkonnens and the Atreides. But these books add extremely interesting layers regarding the personalities of the emperor, the Ixians, the Tleilaxu and many others throughout the galaxy. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and the various characters seem to be similar to how Frank Herbert would have imagined them, although, of course, not nearly as textured as Frank would have made them.The writers are good storytellers and the universe that Frank Herbert imagined makes it very easy to spin a good yarn. The authors are clearly not deep thinkers like Frank Herbert was. This can be seen by the fact that the authors begin each chapter with a saying, a quote from an imagined book or something similar. While I always looked forward to the next quote by Frank Herbert, I am hard-pressed not to skip the quotes in these books. They are often little more than fortune cookie sayings.The books continue to contain little editing problems. At the beginning, for instance, Liet-Kynes goes to Kaitan to meet with the emperor and is introduced as Liet-Kynes. In Dune, it is clear that no non-Fremen know that the planetologist Kynes is also the Fremen Liet. There is also a problem with what happens to de Vries in this book because in Dune, the Baron tells de Vries that he wrongly predicted that Jessica would bear a daughter, which would have been impossible if events occurred as they do in House Corrino.But overall, I don't fault the authors much for these mistakes. Frank Herbert created a hugely complex world and I am sure I would have made at least equally glaring mistakes (and that editors would not have caught them) if I had written this book.I now look forward to reading the prequel to the prequels that has just come out on the Butlerian Jihad."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I picked this up yesterday and read the whole thing on the train from NYC to DC. I've read the previous two (House Harkonnen and House Atriedes), and this pretty much solidifies my opinion of B. Herbert and Anderson's collaborations:They're awful.If you're a big fan of the multilayered intricacies of politics, economics, and social phenomena that characterize the late Frank Herbert's works, pass on Brian's books. In comparison and on their own, they're shallow, naive, poorly-articulated, lacking in subtlety and layer... and inconsistent with many of the fundamentals of the Dune universe set out in the original series.On the other hand, if you're a VERY young sci-fi reader more interested in general story outlines and not bored with unsophisticated dialogue and shallow character development, go ahead and check it out at your local library.I can't even describe these novels as Dune Lite. Or even Dune Ultralite. They're more like AirDune -- made to look like the original, but leaving behind a taste of sawdust and a reader wondering why she bothered."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I don't know if its because I re-read the original series while waiting for this book, or if it really is so much worse than the previous 2 books in the series, but I am very disappointed.The writing in this book is pedestrian at best and space opera at worst. the plot flow is linear, sudden abilities helpfully appear (like the Bene Gesserit capability to alter memory), the dialog is written like a poor screenplay, and everything is spelled out in painful clarity rather than by inferrence. The only bits that appealed to me were the litte quotes in the chapter headings :-)If like me you HAVE to read the book to see what happens in the series... and hopefully allow for a finale to &quot;Chapter House&quot; to be written then buy the paperback, borrow a copy, or visit a library.I'm just hoping the next Dune book is worthy of the series because, for me, this one wasn't."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"There are contradictions and retcons abound in this book. Originally, Elrood had ruled for 34 years, not 138 as this trilogy claimed. Ix was ruled by a group, not House Vernius.If Frank Herbert had decided to write a precursor to Dune, he could easily have done so in one book, not three. The drama between Leto, Kailea, their son (not Paul! Gasp!), and Rhombur was unnecessary filler, and the Baron is portrayed in this book as a rabid woman-hating man where in Dune he had been hinted at being gay, and his attitude towards women wasn't as misogynistic. Many, many original characters clutter up this trilogy and the canon characters are rather different, for a rather unsatisfying read.This trilogy really is nothing more than fan-fiction, freely abound with retcons and mistakes that would make anyone else ashamed, but apparently Brian and Kevin simply don't care about anything but the money these books generate.Any true Dune fan should never consider anything by that pair as more than poorly-written fanfiction."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I have to laugh. I read the previous review of House Corrino before I actually read the novel and everytime someone said &quot;Vermilion Hells!&quot; I snickered. It's true, that phrase seems to be used over and over in the book. I should have kept a running total of how many times that phrase is used. The authors also seem it necessary to remind us that Gurney Halleck has an &quot;inkvine&quot; scar on his face every time he shows up. Thanks, I got it!All in all it's an enjoyable read. If you go into it expecting these books (all 3 House books) to be on par with the original series you'll be in for a letdown. Standing on their own, they're fun to read and move along at a nice pace. I don't mind some of the inconsistencies that seem to drive some Dune fanatics mad. The fact that Paul Atreides is said to be born on Kaitan in &quot;House Corrino&quot; as opposed to Caladan is fine. The account of him being born on Caladan was written by Princess Irulan who could have deliberately changed his birthplace to try and suggest he wasn't of &quot;noble&quot; blood. When you take into account that memories are fading you can explain away alot of the inconsistencies.So don't expect the original series...just enjoy some good tales with decent writing."},{"Title":"House Corrino (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"If one compares the Dune prequels to the original novels, it is easy to find them lacking, but this seems a bit invidious. After all, most novels are not that great compared to Dune. But this of course, purports to be an extension of the original books. It is not. While there are the same settings and characters, House Corrino is unlike Dune in style. It is based more on action and the explication of &quot;wheels within wheels&quot; plans than the much more ponderous and philosophical Dune. In the first two books of the House trilogy, the author's tried to imitate Herbert's unique style, and quite frankly did not succeed. While the result was not altogether bad, it was a bit lifeless. With House Corrino, the authors have markedly broken away from trying to imitate Herbert's style, and rather use their own. It is less faithful to Dune, but it is more faithful to the readers and the authors themselves.So what do we have, if not a book that can be accurately compared to the original Dune novels? It is a story of intrigue and plot twists, and the tying-up of loose ends at a breakneck pace. The ending is, however, by no means contrived, though one might feel disappointed that all the tension that began to build up from the start of House Atreides is released. The book does not really segway into Dune, it merely lays the foundation. Nonetheless it is a compelling read when taken from the right perspective."},{"Title":"Credit-Card Carole","review":"This is one good book people. It's kind of like soap opera.

It has three plots roled into one novel. It is hard to say whether Carole her friend Jim or her friend Monique has a more exciting life.

I reccomend this book to everyone in anyh situation"},{"Title":"Flora and Tiger","review":"When I taught an autobiographies unit for my fifth grade writers, they were particularly drawn to this collection of autobiographical stories by Eric Carle. We are teaching our students how to make personal connections to readings, and there were many here...such as Carle's special walks with his father...his curiosity with nature...his incredible observation skills which led to his success as an artist and writer. The children loved this work and wanted to read all the stories.

She writes with love and admiration about many people who have touched her life both in big and small ways. It is not hard to see why Jackie became the woman and athlete that she is.

It starts out telling about her parents' lives before she was born and goes on to describe the hardships she had to overcome as a child to be the success she is today. She tells about growing up in a lower-class community in East St Louis. She tells of how she had to run on an odd-shaped track, through the halls of her school, and around the neighborgood instead of training an a real track. This book covers everything from her first track team tryouts all the way through her many victories in the Olympic Games.This book could easily be used as a motivational tool.

Whereas Chaucer writes to entertain and incidentally edify, Langland's writing aims squarely at the reform of society: his poetic genius is ever bent on conveying his message in the most effective ways it can devise. That those ways are diverse, and that the poem entwines itself around the reader's mind with a fine webbing of delicate strands, makes a first acquaintance with this work for the student of Middle English a potent, provocative, but somewhat overpowering experience. Help is needed. Goodridge's translation into modern English beautifully renders the sense of the poem in a direct and lyrical way. This may be contrasted with most verse translations that tend to be glosses rather than translations. Consider one fragment from the prologue: &quot;Ac of the cardinales atte courte that caught of that name / And power presumed in hem a pope to make, / To han that power that Peter hadde inpugnen I nelle: / For in loue and letterure the eleccioun bilongeth -- / Forthi I can and can naught of courte speke more.&quot; What are we to make of &quot;can and can naught&quot;? A verse translation by Donaldson renders this as follows: &quot;But as for the cardinals at court that thus acquired their name / And presumed they had power to appoint a pope / Who should have the power that Peter had -- well I'll not impugn them. / For the election belongs to love and to learning: / Therefore I can and cannot speak of court further.&quot; No doubt this has merit as poetry, but of what value is it as a translation? Any student could replace the Middle English words with the modern equivalent, and be no better off in understanding the sense of the piece. Consider, on the other hand, Goodridge's prose translation: &quot;But as to those other cardinals at Rome who have assumed the same name, taking upon themselves the appointment of a Pope to posses the power of St. Peter, I will not call them in question. The election of a pope requires both love and learning. There is much more I could say about the Papal Court, but it is not for me to say it.&quot; While one may disagree with Goodridge's interpretations, one is never in doubt as to what they are. His prose is perfectly lucid, and often poetic. This is a wonderful introduction to Piers Plowman, and the notes and commentary that accompany the translation further enhance the value of this book, and serve even more as a key to unlocking the gates to this magical poem."},{"Title":"Piers the Ploughman (The Penguin classics)","review":"The poem of 'Piers the Ploughman' is often considered to be anonymously composed, as the name William Langland was less an authorial designation as it was an inscription on the back of a manuscript - it would be as if I would be assigned the authorship of the O.E.D. because, in some future time, the only remaining copy was missing the title pages, but still had the hard-cover with my 'ex libris' impression on it. Be that as it may, Langland is considered at least as likely an author as any other, and becomes a sort of stand-in, an 'everyman' for his time period. A few details of this Langland are known - he was a wanderer, a constant reviser (the poem goes through several revisions that scholars have designated as texts A, B, and C (and some argue for Z). This is not a spiritual autobiography, as J.F. Goodridge states in his introduction, but there are no doubt autobiographical elements in the text. That the lead character is named 'Will' helps in this identification.This poem stands alongside Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' as one of the great products of Middle English; this also has the character of being a different sort of Middle English than Chaucer's more courtly, continental influenced variety. Thus, it gives breadth to the history of the English language. Goodridge ranks Langland as a great English poet on a par with Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth and Yeats, as representative of his age both in topics as well as language facility.This epic poem deals with themes familiar for the time - like Dante and Milton, Langland deals with the grand ideas of the meaning of life and the destiny of humankind. However, unlike Dante and Milton, Will and Piers the Ploughman do not go through a mystical, otherworldly adventure or journey, but rather stays rooted to the earth. These are dream sequences, but these too need not be otherworldly - they are things that can happen to every person. The ideas of the seven deadly sins, the virtues, the church, and the images of heaven and hell are very much rooted to regular society images of the same. The discussion of the allegorical characters, aptly named Do-Well, Do-Better, and Do-Best, does much for the moral teaching of this poem, which would have been of primary concern to the author.Langland's text is often more Old English than Chaucerian in ways. It is far more alliterative, a strong component taken from Old English. Also, it is less metrical in rhythm than Chaucer - there is a pause in each line akin to older English poetry, but the metre is less secure.There is much to dispute in Goodridge's introductory essay and notes, because this is that kind of text that invites such disputation. There are over 50 non-related texts of the poem that have survived the Middle Ages, that vary from minor to major changes throughout. Reconciling these is rather like attempting to reconcile the gospels of the Bible, and then adding to that task the discovery of other non-canonical gospels. It leads to rich discussion, but less agreement.Goodridge does a good job at introducing the text and translating the text into a prose style. The one drawback of this is that the sense of the poem is lost. However, as an introduction and student/study version of the epic, it is a good text. The notes are generous and useful.This is one of the classics of English literature, perhaps the least known among them."},{"Title":"Piers the Ploughman (The Penguin classics)","review":"Items were in excellent condition however, they didn't arrive when needed....snail mail was the only option and requests to pay for expedite mail unanswered.

He wrote books that perhaps were not literary masterpieces but contained a certain kind of fear that seems to be lacking in todays crime books.This is his most mainstream book and it takes some getting used to as it is a bit slow at places but it really does pick up at points throughout the book and contains the quiet horror of people making mistakes that change their lives forever.Worth a read."},{"Title":"Heed the Thunder (The Armchair Detective Library)","review":"Heed the Thunder takes place in rural Nebraska over a period of several years starting somewhere around 1910. Civil War veteran Lincoln Fargo presides over his extended family with the help of his God fearing wife, Pearl. As the story begins, their daughter Edie Dillon and her young son Robert arrive from Oklahoma to live with them. It seems that Edie's husband has deserted her and Robert, leaving the two of them in dire financial straits. Readers familiar with Thompson's early life will recognize the autobiographical underpinnings of this book. Young Robert Dillon is a stand-in for the author and Edie is a dead ringer for Thompson's mother, Birdie.First published in 1946, Heed the Thunder predates the many dark, disturbing, noirish paperbacks that would secure Jim Thompson his status as a cult hero. Because it is billed as \\"perhaps the most mainstream of Thompson's novels\\", I was expecting it to lack the tough edginess one usually associates with Thompson's work. I was wrong. Here are just three of the many examples of brutality and depravity to be found in this book:A dishonest preacher is unceremoniously tarred and feathered.A misbehaving schoolboy receives a harsh beating and is permanently disfigured.There's an incestuous affair between cousins. As shocking then as it would be now.Heed the Thunder has a large cast of very interesting and richly drawn characters and several intriguing subplots that unfold as the narrative progresses. There is much humor of the kind that will remind readers of Mark Twain. Like when an impoverished lawyer makes a name for himself by bringing a lawsuit against God. And there's plenty of social criticism, especially when it comes to the subject of inhumane working conditions.In fact, there's so much material here, Thompson could easily have written Heed the Thunder as a 600+ page epic. Instead, he wisely opted to keep the length down to half that.This novel gives an intriguing account of life on the plains of Nebraska in the early years of the 20th century. The hardscrabble lives lived by most of the characters are presented in an unvarnished manner. The humiliating poverty, the appalling ignorance and the inescapable cruelty which pervaded everyday existence are all unapologetically exposed. All in all, this is an intriguing and substantive book which forshadows the frighteningly disturbing, brutally stark type of novel which would soon become Jim Thompson's trademark."},{"Title":"Heed the Thunder (The Armchair Detective Library)","review":"This is a noir classic. The whole town of Verdon in Nebraska is filled with conflicts, and everyone has a vendetta.This book is also horrific as well, as Thompson at times tries his hand at horrifying the reader. I don't believe this novel is for everyone, but as the back cover suggests, everyone who enters this town should carry a .45."},{"Title":"Heed the Thunder (The Armchair Detective Library)","review":"I disagree with these other reviewers. Yes, this book has slow parts, but the good parts are so good, so unique, so ridiculously awesome that it easily earns 5 stars. The horror elements will scare you for the rest of your life, and to hear the characters muse about war and environmentalism you will realize how way ahead of his time Thompson was.

Using her background in biology, Nancy dispels the terror that the word cancer engenders - a terror that needn't be, now that over 85 percent of children with leukemia are cured -- by describing medical terms and procedures in lay terms, and offering practical methods for coping with pain, boredom, depression and uncertainty, as well as childhood development after cancer. This book is organized so that one can read and assimilate only what's meaningful and absorbable at a given stage, yet its comprehensive scope insures that this will be the book you check first to find the answers you need. Nancy pays special attention to the emotional aspects of coping with childhood cancer, merging many first-person accounts from parents who have found unique ways to handle each obstacle that has arisen.

The other reviews led me to believe that this would be a good resource. However, there is very little scientific information and I found the personal accounts to be very anecdotal and for the most part not to apply to our experience. One area that I was particularly interested in finding out more about was the long term side-affects of the drugs commonly used in chemotherapy such as learning disabilities and heart damage and this book didn't touch those issues in very much depth. Also, the section which discussed dealing with the death of a child was not the best thing for me to read when my daughter was newly diagnosed. It is my opinion that something like that cannot be addressed with in a relatively short chapter and would be best dealt with in its own book.All that said, I gave this book 3 stars because I do think many people would find emotional support reading about other people's experience dealing with childhood leukemia.

Not only do you learn what leukemia is all about and how chemotherapy treatments will go, but you also learn how to deal psychologically with everything happening. The whole world seems to change when you or your family is impacted with such a terminal illness and a lot of people may not know how to deal or what to expect. This book HELPS - IT REALLY HELPS. I reccommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to know more about childhood leukemia, any family who is directly impacted and any caretakers, teachers, counselors who may encounter those experiencing this illness.... THIS BOOK IS WORTH EVERY PENNY and MORE."},{"Title":"Childhood Leukemia: A Guide for Families, Friends and Caregivers (3rd Edition)","review":"My daughter was diagnosed with leukemia in June of 2007. This book was given to me in the hospital, shortly after her diagnosis. It took a few months for the initial shock of diagnosis to wear off, before I felt able to read and process the information in this book. But once I started reading it, the book became a great reference for me. The section on the different medications, their uses and side effects was especially helpful and I referred to it many times.I enjoyed reading what other parents and children had to say about this disease. Their thoughts were interspersed throughout the book and I always found them informative. As I began looking for other books on the subject, I realized that this is the best and most complete reference book out there for childhood leukemia. Nancy Keene has done a great job in gathering together information and presenting it in a readable and understandable way. Four years later, my daughter is still in treatment, and I still refer to this book. I have recently purchased Ms. Keene's bookChildhood Cancer Survivors: A Practical Guide to Your Future (Childhood Cancer Guides)to help us navigate the years ahead.This review refers to the 3rd edition of the book."},{"Title":"Childhood Leukemia: A Guide for Families, Friends and Caregivers (3rd Edition)","review":"The book is very informative but simple enough for the common joe. Tells what to expect, what to prepare for and how to respond to different phases of the sickness and treatment, as well as different situations that may happen. And it helps keep you optimistic while still being realistic about your child's prognosis. It shares parent's reactions, the pain, and the determination to save their child... things which you will be able to relate to and will remind you that your child and you are not the only ones facing this situation."},{"Title":"Childhood Leukemia: A Guide for Families, Friends and Caregivers (3rd Edition)","review":"I bought this for friends when their daughter was dx with Leukemia.

I lament that our medical team didn't hand it to us on the day our 3 year old was diagnosed with ALL. I found it later and have bought several copies which I hand out to those whom have just been diagnosed. And now that we are almost done with treatment (3.5 years later), I can say that this book has been essential to our journey. Far more so than any other reference (even the internet).A few things I really like about this book:1) I love having all the drug information organized and easy to read2) I love the personal quotes throughout from parents who have been through what we are going through3) I love the hints and tips about how to make hospitalization easier including who makes up our medical team. As well as, what to expect while in the hospital.4) I covers complications to treatment, insurance hints, and sections none of us want to visit (BMT, relapse and death and dying)5) The importance of finding support for the whole familyThis is a MUST have book for everyone who has a children diagnosed with ALL. MUST HAVE!! It is well organized and readable. Buy it. You wont regret it. It has been a great support to our family."},{"Title":"Childhood Leukemia: A Guide for Families, Friends and Caregivers (3rd Edition)","review":"This is an excellent reference book, but if you are a mom like me who wants to know what likely 'caused' this disease, I highly recommend you read 'Currents of Death' by Paul Brodeur.

He went throught treatment until Dec. 1996. In 1997 he relapsed. Since then, I have joined an online support group and had many questions. Nancy's book was recommended to me. This book has explainations on what leukemia is, how the blood works in the body, and things to expect from your child as a cancer patient.

It provides easy to understand definitions and explanations of the medical terms. She goes beyond the provision of definitions though and allows those who have been there to share their knowledge with the reader. This should be the first book that a family picks up after their child is diagnosed with leukemia. It would also be a good resource for medical personnel, providing a glimpse of the experience from a parent's viewpoint."},{"Title":"Childhood Leukemia: A Guide for Families, Friends and Caregivers (3rd Edition)","review":"As parents of a recently diagnosed A.L.L. child, we found ourselves standing at the book store looking for current information about our child's condition.

I also wanted to understandhow drum beats are put together in various styles to help \\"compose\\" rhythm tracks with a drum machine.The book is in the form of lessons and begins with the most basic time keeping and quickly demonstrates authentic-sounding drum parts in a variety of styles including rock, funk, swingand blues. You're not going to learn how to play solos here, but you will learn the essence of feel and groove.This might sound nuts, but just playing \\"air drums\\" with the exercises in this book taught me a lot of about time and the body's relationship to it. I'm sure drummersknow this stuff instinctively but for this string player it's been an enjoyable eye-opener.The recording contains tracks with and without drums to demonstrate the lessons and function as a play along."},{"Title":"Callas: Images of a Legend","review":"A book that includes a bright text about Callas's personal life and about her roles, with pages and pages of big and beautiful pictures of the Diva in quality paper.

These are stories from Chekhov's so-called \\"middle period,\\" the years after Chekhov had finished his medical studies and began writing and publishing the longer, more serious psychological studies whose characteristics became a universal ascription for short stories of that sort: \\"Chekhovian.\\" As Harold Bloom has written, \\"the formal delicacy and somber reflectiveness [of Chekhov's stories] make him the indispensable artist of the unlived life, and the major influence upon all story-writers after him.\\"Every one of the stories in this volume is a remarkable example of Chekhov's ability to write in simple, straightforward fashion, while, all the time, illuminating with almost microscopic precision the internalized, psychological lives of his characters. As one commentary on Chehov's writing during this period has noted, apropos of the stories in this volume (and in contrast to Chekhov's early humorous stories): \\"Characters are no longer perceived satirically, as social archetypes, but seen from within. And the inner life revealed is often an unhappy one, the characters' 'real life' being in sharp contrast with their 'world of desire,' reached only through memory or fantasy.\\"The stories range from long to short, each a near-perfect model of the short story, worthy of enjoyment and careful study. The longest of the stories, \\"A Woman's Kingdom,\\" tells of Anna Akimovna, the daughter of a factory owner who, as a young girl, mingled with the working classes, only to find herself the lonely, single, middle-aged heiress and proprietor of those same factories later in life. It is a remarkable exploration of Anna's loneliness and of her yearning to return to the life of her childhood, as well as of the separation between owner and worker in an industrialized Russia. As Anna says, longingly: \\"Yes, I'll go and get married. I will marry in the simplest, most ordinary way and be radiant with happiness. And, would you believe it, I will marry some plain working man, some mechanic or draughtsman.\\"In the title story, \\"The Party,\\" Chekhov brilliantly probes the mind, the thoughts, the silent unhappiness and dissatisfaction of Olga Mihalovna, a pregnant, married woman who clearly does not like her philandering, brash husband or her social obligations. In a passage that strikingly illustrates both the luster of Chekhov's art and the deep-seated discontent of the character of his story, Olga stands watching her guests, the partygoers of the story's title, glide by in boats:\\"Olga Mihalovna looked at the other boats, and there, too, she saw only uninteresting, queer creatures, affected or stupid people. She thought of all the people she knew in the district, and could not remember one person of whom one could say or think anything good. They all seemed to her mediocre, insipid, unintelligent, narrow, false, heartless; they all said what they did not think, and did what they did not want to. Dreariness and despair were stifling her; she longed to leave off smiling, to leap up and cry out, 'I am sick of you,' and then jump out and swim to the bank.\\"These are just two of the stories. The volume also contains \\"The Kiss,\\" a story that no less a literary arbiter than Bloom considers the best of Chekhov's early stories (written in 1887, when Chekhov was 27 years old). And the rest are equally good, demonstrating why Chekhov is considered among the greatest practitioners of the story-writer's art.If you can, find this volume and the others in The Ecco Press's wonderful edition of Chekhov and read them all.

I started using this after having used the one-year bible and one year new testament for several years each, and wanted something that didn't cut off passages in midstream....I especially wanted more of the Psalms, since the prayers of others are a wonderful way to hear God's voice speaking to your own life.The bonus was, I found some wonderful passages in Proverbs that seem to be written just for me.Each day, you read 5 Psalms, and a chapter of Proverbs.

I have looked again recently and see that it is available again. I am going to get a few copies for Christmas gifts!This small book, is made up entirely of the Psalms and Proverbs. No one else's comments, just the word. The first day has Psalms 1, 31, 61, 91, and 121, with Proverbs 1. Day two has Psalms 2, 32, 62, 92, 122 with Proverbs 2. And so it goes for 31 days so that you get through all of the Psalms and Proverbs in one month.When I don't have time to read anything else, I can always go to this format, see what the Psalms are for that day and at least spend some precious time with the Lord through the pslamist!Lately, I have been using this to memorize my favorite verses and even entire psalms...going slow, but at least trying!You will not regret buying this book.

It would be the ideal bedside book were the correspondence not so addictive. I couldn't resist taking it up to fill any free moment. One could do far worse than eavesdrop on this charming friendship. In fact, to read even just this selection is to form a lasting friendship with the correspondents--who will recommend many worthwhile reads.Warning: I expect that, like me, you will be compelled to purchase the original volumes (available with slight difficulty from Academy Chicago Publishers). In all, a delicious read."},{"Title":"Lyttelton Hart-Davies Letters 1955-1962: A Selection","review":"I have to confess I am only half way through, and it is late at night, but I cannot go to bed without telling **someone** how wonderful this book is. I think it rather like developing a perversion in old age: such a passion is a bit odd, but you no longer care what others think of you, and you're thrilled out of your knickers to have such a new delight so late in life.I'm actually galloping through the book, the sooner to start back at the beginning with some afternoons to myself and a fast connection to the internet, the better to google each and every reference, to look up every unknown word, and to learn more about my old friends Johnson and Tennyson and Homer and Blunden and Duff Cooper (and on and on) plus getting to know a whole host of new friends.Every page holds an outloud laugh, an \\"I must tell X about this one\\", an \\"oh, let me email that to my brother\\", a new association, and a bit of bitter sweetness. Even if there is nothing on the page bitter sweet, you feel it anyway that these fine men are gone, and never the chance to rub elbows with them. Alas, I am not as clever as they, and cannot find the words to convey all the merry ups and downs the letters take you on.And best of all, I have the full volumes to look forward to and collect."},{"Title":"Lyttelton Hart-Davies Letters 1955-1962: A Selection","review":"Entertaining correspondence between publisher and literary biographer, Rupert Hart-Davis, and his old Eton English master, George Lyttelton. This is a selection of letters between the two men from the originally published six volumes in the 1970s. At that time, the correspondence was hailed as a great civilized work, but this was probably heaping too much praise on it. The work was later spoofed in Craig Brown's Marsh Marlowe Letters. Many of the letters contain interesting comments on writers which reflected their great love of literature. The letters also contain gossip about friends and comments about famous figures.

I found that the first half of the material was recycled from previous tapes. The second half had a few new tidbits and restatements of concepts already presented in other books, tapes and videos.

The total length is less than 300 minutes, on 6 cassettes. To get it over 300 minutes, Wayne has to add a 9+ minute introduction to the book.

Because of that, I had difficulty knowing where to start and let's face it--there are only so many hours in the day and I was eager to dive in for a listen that was shorter than all the other CD's.The chemistry between these two speakers is delightful--warm, humorous and gently teasing. That genuine affection gives a friendly feel to these lectures and puts the listener into a receptive mood. Wayne's content is historical, philosophical and Deepak's topic addresses the human physiology and finding our inner voice. I'm grateful to have found this set of CD's and encourage others who don't know where to start with the materials--to start here and enjoy."},{"Title":"Creating Your World","review":"This CD series is great.

Kennedy; the myth and the man","review":"This bio is extremely biased against RFK and the Kennedy family. The author Victor Lasky is a right wing columnist. Lasky's most controversial book was It Didn't Start With Watergate published in 1977. He argued that the scandal that drove Richard Nixon from office was little more than a media event.In this book he presents every event in the most negative light possible from the Kennedy point of view. For example, the effort by the Kennedy's to confront Catholic bigotry, he completely discounts as manufactured by the Kennedy's to get votes. The funny thing is that the book is still fairly readable and if you know enough about RFK from other sources you can discount the negative spin and there are lots of entertaining anecdotes and the author is a decent writer.

Could a young girl raise a family of nine children on her own with no resources? Could a woman, forgive and even come to love a man that raped her and ruined her life, who's family took her illegitimate child away from her? Would a man sacrifice himself in a loveless marriage to provide for a fallen woman? Many of the characters changed their basic natures: the wife, who went from being kind and generous to being insanely jealous, the hero who was cruel and abusive to his mother and wife, and finally, the cowardly rapist becoming the savior.

This book also offers an inexpensive and easy procedure, food aversion learning, for the nonlethal control of this amazingly adaptable animal and all other animals that are threatened."},{"Title":"Living with Coyotes: Managing Predators Humanely Using Food Aversion Conditioning","review":"\\"Writing frankly as an advocate of this effective and humane method of controlling coyotes, he asks, 'Why are we mired in the use of archaic, inefficient, unsophisticated, and barbaric methods of wildlife management in this age of reason and high technology? This question must be addressed while there is still a wildlife to manage.'\\" - from publisher reviewWhat does Ellins mean, \\"while there is still wildlife to manage\\"? Advocate a technique that is not approved by EPA nor most states? I thought FIFRA regulated pesticides, and food aversion conditioning chemicals for coyotes are not registered.\\"Actually, our project in the Antelope Valley continued for two more years, and the struggle continues to this day throughout much of the United States. Predator management has emerged as a highly controversial and emotion-laden contemporary issue, the extreme camps consisting of those livestock growers who view all predators as vermin that are a constant threat to their economic well-being, and conservationists who advocate the protection of predators at all costs as important components in the balance of nature. With the demise of many other predators in North America, and essentially all other large predators in the United States, the outcome of this controversy now weighs heavily on the survival of the coyote. The challenge is to devise management procedures that can adequately protect the agricultural community from the economic losses caused by free-ranging coyotes, while at the same time creating conditions that will ensure the future of this icon of American independence and adaptability.\\" - from Chapter 1Look, current coyote management strategies are not perfect. But asking people to give them up for one with a very poor track record in the scientific and management literature borders on unethical. Food Aversion Conditioning - flavor avoidance learning - is a real phenomenon. Legions of psychology students demonstrate it in labs every school year.However, it has not been shown to work with stopping coyote predation on sheep, goats, calves, watermelon, irrigation lines, cats, endangered birds, or people.\\"... it became readily apparent that the practice of management by death, at least in the war against coyotes, is unjustifiable on biological, economic, and moral grounds.\\" -- from chapter 2The book summarizes a great deal of interesting coyote behavior, particularly related to foraging. There is little original data. For the most part, this is a book telling why people who kill coyotes are wrong. It is not a techniques book on \\"Managing Predators Humanely Using Food Aversion Conditioning.\\""},{"Title":"Practice Of Gods Presence (7 In 1 Anthology)","review":"This book has, and still continues to change my life!

He distills to bare essences the way to a Holy life in Christ, but his prescriptions are not easy. If you want fluff, Murray is not the man to read. As with his other books, he holds True Believers to the standards Jesus Himself holds them to. As any Christian knows, this is NOT the easy Way.Better still, Murray asks the same questions we ask, then, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, gives the answers. His book, &quot;The Holiest of Holies&quot; is the best book on the New Testament book of Hebrews I've ever read and is the basis for the perfect Bible study.

Next to reading and studying the bible, this book should be read above all others.In Andrew Murray's time, they didn't have all the distractions that we have, so they studied more than we do. I love the fact we can gleam from them. How blessed are we at this time and in our world as it is, we can even have a far deeper understanding of God the Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. They truly are the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. Since they are all one, we seem to neglect the Holy Spirit and a deeper understanding of Him.

He's really taken me and shown me who He REALY is, and that in turn has made me want to know Him even more intimately. The first book I ever read of Andrew Murray's was \\"Abide in Christ\\" (Possibly Andrew's best book), and it changed my life forever. God has continued to call me in deeper, and has given me such a burning passion and closeness with Himself that I didn't know was posssible to have.I pray that God's Spirit would open the eyes of your heart and make every word a living reality in your life. That you would know Him, in the truest sense of the word, and that He would captivate you by His ferocious Love. May He bring you to the sweet surrender of heart and life, the beauty of His holiness (for it is surely yours to have), and Love everlasting. Grace to you and peace from Christ above.

It is scriputrally sound and based upon his experience with God. Though the writing is from a different generation it is still immenently understandable.

As such, this will not be a comprehensive review, even as effusive as I could be in praising these writings! Please allow me, rather, to make up for a lack that was noticeable to me in the other reviews - namely -What Seven In One am I actually getting if I buy this book?Book One: The Power of the Blood of JesusBook Two: HumilityBook Three: Absolute SurrenderBook Four: The Secret of Spiritual StrengthBook Five: Experiencing the Holy SpiritBook Six: Daily Experience with GodBook Seven: The Blessings of ObedienceAt the time of this writing, my church is currently going through a series on the power of the blood of Jesus - and Andrew Murray is a huge resource for understanding this biblical truth which will, dare I say?, radically improve your appropriating the scope of exactly what Jesus did when (as we Christians say) \\"Jesus died for you!\\" ... which to the uninitiated may sound quite strange and, perhaps, barbaric. The first of the seven books in this set is Murray's teaching on this.Please don't be put off by the fact this is a 19th century preacher. He is VERY easy to read. If you find him difficult at all, just read it \\"out loud\\" to yourself (after all, most of his texts were delivered as sermons), and you'll find the rhythm is very quick to catch.The treasures of Murray's insights really do unlock Scripture and the INTIMACY with God for which we were made. (We can know Him, He is not far off!) If you buy only one book to help with your Christian walk this year, make it THIS one, get Seven in One, and savor every page.

CM NEW JERSEY"},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"This is one of those magical books that takes one back to a time almost forgotten with all the hardships and good times mingled. Not only does the author involve you in the lives of a family struggling for existence in near impossible circumstances, he has an art of putting one in the place of each of the characters alloiwng you to see and feel as they do no matter what the age of the character.Reminders of the way of society surrounding rural 1950 abound. One can feel the emotions of the characters as they deal with events within the constraints of the times; one can see the landscape and architure surrounding the story; one can smell the odors and fragrances of a time gone by.This book is a real page-turner. I could not put it down and have begun another book by the same author.Mr. Saunders is hardworking in his writing and a very pleasant man to speak with."},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"The novel, \\"Tommytown\\", was one book where I didn't want the story to come to an end. The characters, especially the two brothers, Barry and Noah and the mother, Helen came to life and walked right into my heart.This novel is an exceptional, exciting read for mothers and young adults. It's very educational but at the same time the author, Saunders provides a style that you enjoy with a touch of humor to keep the subject of living in poverty a light-hearted read.I thoroughly enjoyed it and I recommend \\"Tommytown\\" to all readers, young and older."},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"I read this novel with a book club and found the story heartwarming, however the style distracted from the story from the beginning. I found myself noting that words were missing that were essential to the meaning of the some sentences. The author frequently over used words so that they were repeated within a sentence or two when other vocabulary would have made the style more interesting. By the end of the book I was skimming descriptions just to be able to follow the story to it's conclulslion. The book has worth for it's insight into a poverty stricken family in the 1950's."},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"Author Saunders has written a heart-warming account of a struggling family. He lifts motherhood to the highest level. The reader has to assume that the author has lived through some of his story; otherwise, he has a very real knowledge of life in the 50's in rural America. I look forward to reading his sequel. As an author (Project 314) I commend Saunders for his work. Tommytown holds your attention from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"I found this book very enjoyable. I really felt that I was right there watching everything taking place.

The father is not in the story to much. I liked the 11 year old boy Barry and his brother Noah. They dream up all kinds of neat games to play like taking a ride on a real horse even though they have never been on a horse before. The horse throws them off, but Barry gets right back on again and guess what...yep he get throw off again. I laughed. They play cowboys and indians with there neighbor boys and lasso them while they are riding there bikes. There are a lot of other great things that the boys do. Their sister, Karen is always picking on them, but sisters always do that.I thought the story was super and I read it all in 3 days!!!"},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"This book is about a family that lives in Tommytown during the 1950s. The story is true and the brothers and sisters did actually live in this poor house. Barry is 11 years old and his brother Noah is 9. Barry has two sister, Karen and Maggie and they are older than he is. Barry's oldest brother, Bunky is 16. Bunky watches out for his younger brother and even when he got his first car, well it wasn't really a car but a van, he taught Barry how to drive. Barry didn't do very good in fact he ran it into a cornfield. I liked this part of the story where the brothers, made big letters in the cornfield by running over the stalks with the van. They got in trouble with their mother and they had to work two days for the farmer to pay for the damage they did to his cornfield. Barry, Bunky and Noah tried to tell their mother that they made the letters for her, but she wouldn't listen to them. Later she found out what the letters spelled and she was a little sorry that she didn't listen to them.I won't tell you what they spelled in that cornfield because you have to read the story for yourself. To anyone who likes to read this is a great book and you just have to read it. You won't be sorry.

Plus the stories are based on real people. I kept reading and reading these books. I'm glad my mother got me started on them, because they were just great."},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"Tommytown is a truly refreshing departure the typical best sellers that are out there today. The author's passion and honesty drawn from his own childhood experiences are transposed into this captivating tale. Actually I found it hard to believe that the author was able to sit down and relive his horrible experiences of living in sheer poverty and constant fear of a father that showed no compassion or concern for the welfare of his wife and children. This family was dirt poor and the author made no effort to give me the impression that I would not be paying a visit to the home of the Beaver Cleaver's family. Still, I was glad the author sprinkled a bit of humor here and there because it kept the story from being so depressing.The novels takes the reader back to the 1950's where Helen Forman, the mother makes another lonely decision to keep her 7 children fed, clothed and sheltered. The buck stops with Helen, her husband fails to support her. In \\"Tommytown\\", Mr. Saunders reveals the thinking of the 11 year old Barry, 9 year old Noah and 13 year old Karen and crates a story that is entertaining and well written. In summary, this is a warm, wonderful story that I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"I started reading this book and kept on reading for 2 or 3 days. It really kept my interest and the boys in the book seem so real. I really liked the horseback riding chapter. It was exciting but also very funny. A great book. Please read it. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"Tommytown is very interesting and teaches how the brothers get along and watch out for one another. Barry is 12 years old and he is always dreaming up these new games. The boys don't have any toys, so they must make up their games, like Cowboys and Indians, Hide and Seek and other games. I like the part when Barry wants to build a camp out of Paw Paw trees and he talks his brothers, Noah, Chris, Petey and Andy into helping him.Tommytown is a great book and it has a lot of funny parts in it. I would recommend Tommytown to young teens looking for a good book. Girls and boys alike will enjoy the story and its characters."},{"Title":"Tommytown","review":"A member of my bookclub recommended this novel to me and this was the book that got me hooked onto the author's writing style. I read the story of Helen, the mother and her struggles to raise 7 children with little or no help from her husband. I have to admit that I kept forgetting that this story takes place in the 1950's when women rights were practically non existent. Anyway, the author wove such a wonderful story that you didn't feel depressed. He sprinkled humor and wit at the right time with the boys Barry and Noah and their playful antics with their neighbor boys. They reminded me of two Dennis the Menace's running loose in this small hamlet of Tommytown. Still, the author's focus was the mother, Helen.Overall, the story was not only a joy to read but very educational. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Insights for the Journey: Navigating to Thrive, Enjoy, and Prosper in Senior Management","review":"Note for John Lucht:Good morning, John, and I must say that this first insight hit me like a ton of bricks! For most of my career, I have been identified as a high potential person, the ideal change agent, the first one to take a development assignment, the first one to start a new division, etc. While that very often has brought me success, tho at a high cost and high risk, when I have taken a fall, it was for exactly the reason you cited, and by that point, curiously lacking in the support of the very senior fellow who had spent months coaching me to stir the pot. In fact in those unsuccessful cases, the senior guy was asking me to do the things he had been unsuccessful in doing or had simply been afraid to do.I so appreciate your insight as I continue to pursue my current job search targets.With best regards, Barb Chilson in Ossining."},{"Title":"Insights for the Journey: Navigating to Thrive, Enjoy, and Prosper in Senior Management","review":"Overall, I found the book fascinating.

But just to read the book is to miss its true value--much as to drink wine without savoring the flavor and bouquet is to miss the pleasure of the endeavor. No, the true value of John Lucht's book will not come in it's first read or even second, but in a lifetime of revisiting the passages of Insights to discover yet one more hidden truth or clever approach to solving a challenge in business...or in life. And that's why you'll find my copy of Insights right next to Harvey Penick's &quot;Little Red Book&quot; on my executive desk.

In any case, when assuming a new position where actions are expected, do not make rash decisions, take tim to feel and assess corporate culture, before any decisions are made. This at least would buy a year in a positon. Be honest, plan succession carefully, take vacation and recycle technology when appropriate while being ready to accept the new one at any moment.

Great book!)I took auto shop in high school, and this was our textbook for the subject. It really is a terrific book to have. You may have a Haynes manual for your vehicle, but that only tells you how to remove and replace objects. This tells you WHAT every object is, where's it located, and how it functions.Absolutely Invaluable. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book. So do my parents. Over the years we have done just about everything there is to do on our vehicle, and we wouldn't of been able to do that without the complete understanding of what makes an engine tick in a certain area.This book was made and designed to teach 14 yr. olds the basics of auto-mechanics; and this book does just that. It's very, very easy to comprehend. You'll be amazed at the ease of learning such a \\" complicated \\" subject. You'll know more about how an engine works than you thought possible. If you think you're dumbstruck when it comes to this subject, think again. Very easy to learn. Plus the subjects are like that in a haynes manual: they're under categories for easy access.The ONLY complaint I have about this book is that there aren't page numbers on every page. They'll be a page number, then 25 pages later another page number. A little exasperating, but I just took 5 minutes of my time and put the page numbers on myself...no big deal. At the very least = worth the effort.Anyways, I just had to share how AWESOME this book is. It really is a Must-Have item. I hope this review was helpful.

While the author does provide a brief introduction in order to give us context for each vignette, he let's us learn about the events and times directly from those who lived them.While the next to the last chapter discusses the Church leaving Kirtland, the last chapter gives us helpful and inspiring information about the Church returning to Kirtland in the 1950s and the growth of the Church since that time. If you visit the city now you can not only enjoy the rebuilt historical sites and visitors' center, you can also note the beautiful church buildings the local residents use for worship and other meetings throughout the week.It is a delightful book to read and is designed mainly for members of the Church and others who are interested in the Church during the early 1830s. It is not meant to be a critical history or to strike up controversy and I am thankful for that.Mr. Anderson also provides us with illustrations, tables, and the inside covers have a map of the city from those times (well, town). There are also endnotes and a helpful index."},{"Title":"A Survivor's Guide to Living in Ireland","review":"A friend got this for me, since I'm moving to the midlands next year. And I'm glad of it, because it's an intelligent and helpful book. I like Tom, he seems a swell fellow. Since I've been five years dating an Irishwoman who wants to move home, and since I've spent some amount of time over there, some of it was elementary to me. But even the of-course stuff is entertaining, and would be essential for newbies with clovers in their eyes. There's a lot here, much to learn and ruminate on, much of it anecdotal. It's really a guidebook autobiography (new genre?); we learn a lot about Tom and his family. It was fascinating to me to hear from another American who's gone and accomplished the insane project I'm about to attempt. I should also add that Mr Richards betrays a thinly disguised bias against recent American political policies that I personally applaud. And although as a so-jaded New Yorker I'm weary of 9/11 eulogizing, his chapter on that event and its repercussions nearly brought tears to my eyes. I note that on the US Amazon this title is unavailable -- too bad, it's a good book."},{"Title":"A Survivor's Guide to Living in Ireland","review":"Interesting book that gives great prospective into what to expect in many areas of Irish relocation.

A Survivor's Guide to Living in Ireland is not a tourist guide per se, and doesn't have the many maps, hotel and restaurant recommendations, etc. that guides meant for vacationers do. Instead, A Survivor's Guide to Living in Ireland is a text-heavy account of how to purchase a place to live in Ireland, how to seek a career or become an entrepreneur, how to live frugally, an introduction to Irish holidays, a short dictionary of Irish slang and phrases (English and Gaelic are both official languages of Ireland, and nearly everyone there speaks English, so the language barrier is less of a problem for an expatriate), and plenty of sensible advice such as \\"Despite Everything You'll be Criticized [by both Americans and Irish!] So Get Used to It\\". An absolute \\"must-have\\" for everyone considering living abroad in Ireland."},{"Title":"A Survivor's Guide to Living in Ireland","review":"This book has been marked up in price considerably.

You can truly crochet or knit any sweater with any yarn in any gauge successfully with this book. A real bonus book for those 'yarn-aholics' out there who love to collect yarns, then decide they need to make something out of all that yarn. :-)"},{"Title":"All Sweaters in Every Gauge","review":"This would get 5 stars, but I couldn't see where to change the stitch to make a different sweater type. You have one stitch to work with (Single Crochet for crocheters). I suppose if you do that one stitch the first time with a particular style, you could change it fairly easy with some modifications to work with that stitch. Since I've been crocheting forever and can adapt, that's what I'm doing (without doing the first sweater in SC).So if you like one stitch sweaters and want a lot of different styles, this is the book for you. Or if you can adapt stitches to different patterns and styles (with increases and decreases to make the sweater fit), this is the book for you.I do like that there are different styles of sweaters. Some are out of style and some in (as of today). But the styles change, so it's a nice book to have.There aren't a lot of instructions to guide you step by step, so if you want step by step and hand holding, this isn't the book for you. Also, you refer back to the first sweater for most of the patterns (at least for the back) with modifcations for each style.There are lots of pictures (mostly black and white) to show crochet and knit sweaters for women and men."},{"Title":"All Sweaters in Every Gauge","review":"This book is for every person who has spent hours knitting swatches, trying to match your gauge with those of the directions, or, disregarding that frustrating step, knit away and ended up with too long sleeves, too tight body, and a neck opening your head won't fit through: this book lets your gauge match the pattern! A unique system of inserting stiches into patterns based on your gauge, it is a book we frustrated knitters have longed for.Any size needles, any type of yarn, make ONE swatch: select the style sweater, follow the chart provided(fully explained)and start knitting."},{"Title":"Sexual Life of Savages","review":"&quot;The Sexual Life of Savages in ...Melanesia&quot; is a book along the lines of Margaret Mead's 'Coming of Age in Samoa'. But Malinowski concentrates on the sex life alone. Of course, in the modern world, the sexual life of Western society may rival those of Melanesians, but the freedom of young unmarried people to enjoy sex without social disapproval was not common when Malinowski wrote the book. One of the strangest things in the book was that the Melanesians did not connect sex with pregnancy, according to the author. I wonder if they were just taking him for a ride. The pictures are great.

I'm in shock, so I feel compelled to write my first review. Now, I wouldn't say it was absolutely terrible, but it definitely wasn't good. There's some decent dialogue and one character in particular is funny, but mostly it's not believable - at all - and dull. None of the characters are particularly likable. I found myself finishing it only because I knew it wouldn't take way too long, and I'd already started. My advice: don't start it."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"I was feeling miserable one rainy day over new year and found this on the Kindle store. It instantly grabbed me, made me smile and had me hooked for a few hours of escapism. Just what I needed!This type of novel is not my usual preference but I found the characters engaging, the plot fun and interesting and the romance was lovely. Just the ticket for when you're feeling a bit blue. Thanks Julie."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"I stumbled across this series recently for a penny a piece except for this first one, so I grabbed if up off here so I could start at the beginning. My expectations weren't great because although I adore Ms.Kenner's most recent works (Ghouls series and Demon's series), I found her earlier book 'Cat's Fancy' pretty sub-standard fare. I will say that this one far surpassed that one in both plot and writing style. Still Julie Kenner's writing style has continued to grow and flourish. The start of this story felt stilted, to the point where I almost considered this a lost cause. The plot seemed fabulous and original...a librarian who was really half SuperHero? Awesome! Zoe is the daugher of a superhero father and a human mother. She has until her 25th birthday, which is drawing near, to admit to her mother she has superhero powers and prove her superskills so that she can be accepted into the superhero elite, the Council. If she fails at either one, she can choose to be an Outcast of the council or a mortal. Zoe runs into all kinds of action and romance along the way. She falls for a mortal who may or may not be alright with her powers and duty to mankind. And she still has to fight for her place on the Council. After about the first 75 pages I couldn't stop reading. I found Zoe likeable and loved reading about the other quirky characters. Zoe's mother's story felt very real to me to along the way. After finishing the 1st in this Aphrodite series, I can say not only do I plan to read the next books, but I also think here we can see a nice glimpse of what is to come in the future from Julie Kenner."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Julie Kenner has done it again. She has just earned herself a place on my &quot;purchase this authors work ASAP&quot; file.Aphrodite's Kiss is a fast paced, extremely funny story about a soon to be superhero. Zoe is getting ready to turn 25 and she has to make the choice of whether she wants to join the Protection League or turn human without her powers. But first she must tell her mother that she is a superhero. Add a broke private detective who sees her as a goddess the first second he sees her, and we have a match. Zoe's brother's ferret is hillarious. He has opinions about everything and he wants things his way or no way. Deena is Zoe's friend, she is the sister of the hero of The Cats Fancy. (I guess being eccentric has a tendency to attract eccentrics.)I have gone on long enough, but purchase this book. It is the best thing I have read since The Cat's Fancy. And when my kids asked what I was laughing about, I told them that this book was written by the same person as Cats Fancy, they all said &quot;OOOOOH!&quot; and nodded their heads.I guess it not only made an impression on me but on my family as well. Great Job JULIE KENNER"},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"This book is a delighful mix of zany characters, humor and an innovative plot. The hero, George, isn't just hunky and romantic, he's human, and that contrasts beautifully with Zoe's problems/powers as a superhero. I found myself laughing out loud and not wanting this book to end. I don't think I'll ever look at a chocolate bar or a ferret the same again. Aphrodite's Kiss is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Aphrodite's Kiss is a joy. Orignial, funny, and heartwarming. Julie Kenner's talent for witty romance has reached new heights with the story of a woman perched between two worlds -- mortals and superheros. Yes, Superheros. With a deft pen, Kenner, takes the reader to a world of halflings, undercover superguys and ferretts with a yen for acting. The story delights with every turn. From the George Taylor's car, Frank Capra, to Zoe Smith's highly developed sense of feel... This book is a wonderful roller coaster ride. A bright new star on the romance horizon, Ms. Kenner has done it again!!!!"},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"An excellent book based both in reality and fantasy. I loved the melding of both worlds and, especially, the secondary characters. I hope to see Hale in his own book falling for a &quot;mortal&quot;! I highly recommed this book. A good, fun read."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Being a half-breed should have some merit, but elementary school librarian Zoe Smith realizes that with all that comes responsibility as outlined by the Venerate Council of Protectors. Apparently half of her heritage is from a Protector while the rest comes from a mortal requiring Zoe to either register as an outcast or forfeit her superpower heritage. Zoe chooses to save the world with her powers.Meanwhile private detective George Taylor seeks a missing magical stone for a client. His investigation leads to Zoe, who seems eerily seems to be the center of weirdness on the planet. While George vows to learn the truth, Zoe needs no powers except her heart to tell her he is the one for her. As they fall in love, they team up to take on a malevolent attempt for world domination.APHRODITE'S KISS is an amusing fantasy romance along the line of &quot;Mom and Dad save the World.&quot; The story line is fun as Zoe behaves as if she is the Greatest American Hero except that she knows George is her other half. The romance adds spice to a fabulous tale that shows Julie Kenner saves readers who enjoy uniqueness in their novels from April showers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"I haven't read a book that had me laughing so hard in a long, long time!

This first installment to the Aphrodite series is fast paced, funny, romantic, and downright silly, but it was just what the doctor ordered in terms of a whimsical fun rainy day read. Although there are definitely some steamy scenes, the cover art is a lot more serious and mysterious than this book actually reads.Zoe Smith is a half mortal, half superhero or halfling coming upon her 25th birthday where she has to make a choice to apply for membership to the superhero council or declare mortality where her memories are completely wiped and she embraces a mortal life. Before she was born, her mother, scared out of her wits to learn what her father was, insisted he leave never to bother them again. Her father, however, had other ideas and has been an integral part of her life, along with her half brother, to teach her about what she is. Zoe, struggling with alienating her mother, has to tell her what she is if she's going to officially apply for superhero status, but she knows in her heart she was meant to help people. Growing up as a halfling, she's always been a loner with people sensing she's different and she longs to have a normal life as well, especially a normal relationship with a man. As far as her superpowers go, they're pretty weak and often detrimental, especially when it comes to her overactive senses. She has super hearing,super smelling, super taste buds, super sensitivity to touch and x-ray vision. Off the bat, one would think this is pretty cool, but for Zoe, she can't eat something as simple as chocolate without having near orgasmic reactions and she's terrified to be with a man afraid she might lose control and hurt someone.With all of these obstacles, she's not even sure she'd be accepted by the council, however she must pass a series of tests setup for her leading to an ultimate battle between herself and her cousin in a display of skills. Unfortunately, under the influence of his evil father, her cousin isn't going to play fair and the stakes are much higher than admission to the council. Adding an unexpected wrinkle and major distraction to her dillemma, she meets George Bailey Taylor, the man of her dreams, and suddenly she's not sure she cares about anything else than experiencing everything she can with this man.As I mentioned before, the story is very cute. My synopsis also sounds more serious than it is since this reads more like a chicklit novel than anything else. Taylor and Zoe's interactions, especially in the beginning are absolutely adorable and they're constantly humiliating themselves in front of one another while desperately trying to act calm and collected. The quirky supporting characters were a great addition to the overall story and if you can get beyond some ridiculous bouts of miscommunication, then its a really good read."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"The premise was rather silly, as were many of the situations, but this book had a clever story line and was a fun read! Recommended for someone looking for some light entertainment."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Do you love a hot, sexy, dominant vampire warrior? Especially when he's got several brothers that are equally hot and sexy? Well, if you do, then you'll love this book. Especially if you like a lot of action-packed scenes as well.Fated gives us all of the above, plus a spunky heroine, an adorable little girl and shapeshifters. Cara is a scientist that works with the genetics of plants. Manipulating things to make more disease resistant crops, that sort of thing. Plants are what she's comfortable with, other than her sister and daughter. Not dominant men that turn out to be vampires. Vampires that demand that she marry them right now because it's what's necessary to protect her daughter from the freaky, bad vampires.Talen is the warrior vampire that is on a mission to protect a little girl that they know the Kurjans (the freaky, bad vamps) want. He is the \\"strategic leader\\" of the realm, which includes vampires, shapeshifters, etc., and his family is the royal family - Talen's brother Dage is the King. Which adds up to one very alpha man. Once he meets Cara, he realizes that she is destined to be his. Unfortunately, the Kurjans want Cara too, as well as the daughter. Talen is determined that nobody is going to take her from him - despite her insistence that she can handle things herself.This book is fun and fast paced with lots of action sequences.The little girl is absolutely adorable and the scene where she wins over the big, macho vampires is hilarious. Cara is spunky and, despite a sketchy background, refuses to back down from a fight regardless of her fear and distrust. The science in the book is very interesting, making you want to see what's going to happen with it rather than leaving you scratching your head.The other characters in the book are very intriguing and you want to learn more about them. Even the ones that don't necessarily warrant their own story are fun to watch and add a lot to the story. Luckily, the author plans to write a book for each of the brothers (and I'm hoping she'll continue with some of the shapeshifter characters someday as well) so we will get to know them a lot better in the future.Fated gives us a new, interesting twist on vampire lore. It's a well written, fun, sexy book guaranteed to keep you reading from cover to cover. If you enjoy paranormal romances, and especially vampires, be sure and check it out! I promise you'll be waiting for the next brother's book by the time you're done.Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"A light, fun, thought-provoking story. It's always interesting to think about how a normal-appearing person who is dealing with having \\"super-powers\\" handles things & her/his thoughts. This has some light moments and some heavy ones, but is well written. Not just dealing with and learning super powers, but trying to be ethical in their application is a thoughtful and difficult process, I'm sure. This would be appropriate for teens as well as holding the interests of adults."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't as good as the 'demon hunting soccer mom' series by this author, but I liked it. I will definitely buy more books in this series."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"The book is about Zoe Smith, a superhero. Really! She has X-Ray vision, super senses that make her lose her mind at the taste of chocolate and many other powers. She is about to take her tests for becoming a full fledged superhero but, something stands in her way. Telling her mom about her powers, which is really hard since that's the reason she left Zoe's father, and her pesky cousin Mordichai who is really messing with her. She also has to deal with a hunky PI and makes her, literally, go into hyperdrive all over.To say that there are some grammar errors would be a great understatement. The book definitely need some serious editing. There were grammar errors every few pages. It was very distracting. I found myself wishing for a wikipedia-type scenario so I could edit the book. The book is also very contracting in terms of plot, character's personality and keeping the superpowers straight. Seriously, she can do it all. But, this was such a guilty pleasure to read. It was thoroughly entertaining to read this short book."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"I really liked this novel!!

As Zoe's twenty-fifth birthday approaches, Zoe has a huge decision to make, will she become a superhero or give up her powers and live her life as a mere mortal.Although she is just learning how to control her powers she has a long way to go but she is definitely learning. Zoe meets P.I. George Taylor under unusual circumstances but that one meeting has Zoe's heart racing and she wants to have a normal relationship with this man but she's afraid to take the chance as she is unsure how her super-sensitive powers will react.There are many crises that pop up throughout the story especially when the lives of all mortals become at risk but in the end love saves the day. I had so much fun reading this novel and besides sometimes we need a break from reality and into the world of fantasy."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Zoe Smith is a funny heroine who must \\"save the world\\" (of course) in time for her 25th birthday. Along the way, she meets a private detective with whom she falls in love with. The premise is cute, but it lacks information. For example, Zoe is a part of the \\"Council\\" which is supposedly descended from Greek gods and goddesses. However, the author leaves out a lot about the council, making vague inferences and hasty explanations. Next, is Zoe's personality. At first, she is a complete klutz, then she's making amazing flips into the air. Which is it? Finally, our hero, George Bailey Taylor's character had no depth, only a vague sense of honor.While the story was funny and sweet, the author should have put more time into developing the characters and storyline. Things I did like: Zoe's relationship with her friend Deena was very entertaining. The differences between the two girls made them great friends and helped move the story along. I also enjoyed the fact that the story moved quickly and didn't get boring."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"It's cute, in a goofy sort of way. The characters are pretty one-dimentional and the plot is marshmellowy, but if you want a light read with little plot, you'll like it. I didn't like the hero in the story, he seemed too soft and emotional. That Pierce Bronson comparison, really lost if for me. I don't think an author should ever compare her leading man to any known man in Hollywood, then she puts him in a sterotypical box. A reader can't picture as any other sort, but that actor. You should just leave it to the reader's imagination. Besides, I think Pierce Bronson looks like a dweeb, so how am I suppose to assume the lead character is hot?Well, whatever! Suffice it to say, this book needs work."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"If it was possible, I would give this book 0 stars. Yes it is THAT bad. The first chapter starts out pretty interesting with this girl who can't indulge in too much or she will go off the chart and get an orgasm. Sounds interesting right? well it's not. She finds a guy who is super hot and you think the story line is going to go somewhere with that but it really doesn't. She plays hard to get and then she has this battle and they all live happily ever after. That basically just sums up the whole book. It is full of fluff and is not well written at all. I found myself skipping through most parts just because the author's description of many things were just so boring, I was falling asleep. I highly recommend that you do not spend one cent on this book and if you really want to read it, go to a library. Even then...I still think, you have spent too much effort in to getting this awful fluff book."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Seeing the reviews I was really excited to read this book but was very much disappointed. I sensed that the author just sat time and typed a book as opposed to developing the story and the characters. There were some many contradictions and the story dragged and lulled in many place.Stories are in the details. For instance the characters found themselves at a backyard party at a supposedly fancy house. There was champagne, the owners of the house were wealthy and there was even valet parking but the guest ate off paper plates??I know that might sounds picky but those are the little mistakes that add up to a bad story, and there was a lot of those little mistakes."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Wow, what a fun read! There's some fun silliness going on here - some of the hot and heavy thoughts pinging around in Taylor's and Zoe's heads might lead to some eyeball-rolling, though later in the story their feelings seem a bit more natural despite the little bit of time they've known one another - if you have a tough time believing in love at first sight that only grows deeper VERY quickly, you might feel like you've fallen into a mythological fairy tale. The story line isn't fluff and the characters have some substance - there are a wide range of feelings, easy-to-relate-to emotional challenges, and childhood memories emanating from mortals, halflings (Zoe's father is a Protector; her mother is a mortal), and Protectors (mythological-type superheroes). A few of the characters seem one-dimensional and they're easy to dislike or place in the \\"bad guy\\" catagory. But some of the bad guys have feelings, too, and you can't help but hope against hope that they manage to get their act together and join the \\"good\\" side. Some of the good guys frustrated me in a big way - Zephron's insistence that Zoe not receive any help from brother Hale or father Donis, for example. It didn't seem fair to leave her clueless to what was going on! But Zoe, with Taylor's help, does manage to unravel the events and her place in it all. But is she strong enough to do one-on-one battle with her cousin, who has always beaten her at skill challenges when they were children? Does Taylor have a place in the challenge to save the world? Can the love that she and Taylor share help when all else fails? And does Taylor, a mere mortal, really have anything to offer Zoe, who could kick his butt on her bad days? Reading to find out will be well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesOn her 25th birthday, Zoe Smith has the chance of a lifetime. She gets the opportunity to become a superhero. All her senses are heightened and she has to learn how to handle it. She gets it all...super powers like flying ability and x-ray vision and preternatural speed and agility...except the one thing her heart desires above all else, George Taylor.George is a private investigator. He turned to this career after his life with the police force was cut short by a sever injury to his leg. He hides all his feelings behind a gruff facade, never letting on how he truly feels about anything. Zoe is convinced he is looking for an average woman to share his life. He can never love a woman like her, who disguises her superhero tendencies behind the mask of a sedate school librarian. Or could he?Ms. Kenner has done it again with this delightful tale. Her characteristic humor is evident throughout every chapter. This book is full of laugh out loud moments. Zoe and George fly off the pages of the book and right into the heart of the reader. There they hang on with a tenacious grip to fast become reader favorites. The relationship between them is very sensual and is absolutely electrifying.The reader rides along with Zoe and George as they battle all manner of vile creatures. For they are in a race against her villainous uncle who schemes to eliminate all of Superhero Central and take over the world with his underlings made up of superhero \\"Outcasts\\" and evil henchman.Through it all Zoe and George are drawn even closer as their passion grows. But each is convinced the other can never love them for who they really are. Will George and Zoe overcome all of the obstacles in their way? The reader gets sucked in to see if love truly can conquer all.As is guaranteed in any novel by Julie Kenner, the entire cast is made up of fascinating characters, right down to the amusing talking ferret. She uses vivid detail in describing her characters so that the reader can picture them as if they are right here in front of them. Also to be expected in any Kenner story, humor abounds throughout. The reader will laugh, cry, and roar in frustration, right along with the heroes.Ms. Kenner, already having proven herself in series romance, demonstrates that she can tackle the paranormal world with ease. She is a one of a kind author, on a steady rise to stardom."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Clunky dialog, shallow characters without a hint of emotional resonance and a hackneyed, faux-humorous style.

I felt that the author was repeating over and over again how important it was for the heroine to stop something, but monotonously. It just seemed like she was trying to say a point but didnt actually get to it.After a while, the whole thing started becoming redundant. What couldve been said in 150 pages sort of dragged to 300.

A++ Highly recommend.."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"~* 3.5 Stars *~Zoe Smith is almost twenty-five years old. Instead of preparing a party for the big day, however, she's struggling with insecurities, worried about telling her mother about her halfling nature (afraid that her Mom will spurn her like she did Zoe's father before she was born), and working on her superhero skills to try to pass whatever tests she needs to pass when she submits her application to the Venerate Council of Protectors. Only problem is, she's iffy at best with telekinesis, hasn't come close to mastering flying with the cloak, and if that wasn't bad enough, as her birthday gets closer and closer, the superhuman hypersensitivity of all her senses (most women are speaking metaphorically when they talk about the orgasmic effects of chocolate - Zoe, not so much) is getting harder and harder to control. Simply put, the elementary school librarian (even potential superheros need a secret identity) is a mess. So much so that one more straw on this heavily-laden camel's back may push her into choosing forfeiting her Protector heritage and accepting mortalization, giving up her abilities and all memories of her more-than-human heritage.Camel, meet former police detective and current private investigator, George Bailey Taylor.He's a little down on his luck and strapped for cash since stubborn pride pushed him to leave the force when a bullet in his leg ended his ability to do field work. The private investigations business isn't exactly booming. In fact, his current case has him spying on a seemingly faithful woman with a fine reputation at the behest of his client, the scum-sucking, thug-minded husband. The whole mess is making him feel dirty. That is, until he meets Zoe during a particularly low point of the job. Five minutes with her and he knows he'll never be the same.Zoe fights her attraction to the mortal man, even though he makes her body and heart zing stronger than the best chocolate. Unfortunately, her problems only mount when her cousin Mordichai starts popping up, acting in ways that make no sense for a fellow Protector-in-training, and don't bode particularly well for Zoe's continued existence, either. She only has a short time before her birthday, but all the worries and insecurities may have been a mighty waste of time if she can't even make it to twenty-five, let alone survive it.Quirky and unique,Aphrodite's Kisshas several things going for it. The narrative is smooth, the dialogue has a natural conversational flow, and the mythos offers up an interesting concept, though I found it to be sparsely defined and a bit undeveloped. The romance between Taylor and Zoe was cute and sweet, but a little protracted. As a character, though, Taylor was a pleasant blend of earnest good guy and clueless male. He's got a charming, sexy way about him, balanced with a truly decent and giving nature and a protective streak a mile wide. I liked him.Zoe was a bit flighty, which is fine for the style and tone of the story, but she was also a little slow on the uptake sometimes and her waffling about telling her mother she's a halfling and in contact with her father and older half-brother got old very quickly, as did the should-I-shouldn't-I over her attraction to Taylor. She is, in a lot of ways, an innocent. A bit naive and too trusting. Uncomplicated. Her provincialism was cute at first, but started to wear on me long before the end. Kick ass heroine who can handle herself in all situations she is not. I would have preferred it had she been more so.The plot was my biggest problem with the book. I felt the central conflict was slow to develop and unevenly paced, and the transitions between the protagonist and antagonist threads were rough. The tone was so disparate that I found it difficult to peg just how to take the threat level. On one hand you have the hypersensitive Zoe and her wacky and wonderful friends and sweet potential romance. On the other you have a megalomaniac Outcast coldly but intently planning the death of a relative and the conquering of the world. Then the final conflict and denouement came...and went...with a startling about face and a few too many neat plot thread wrap ups.The strongest pluses for the book were the characters, Taylor in particular, but also a nice mix of secondary and ancillary characters that added humor and poignancy to the story. I wish we'd had more page time with several of them, but I enjoyed Zoe's best friend and thought her brother was introduced quite nicely, even though he wasn't utilized as much as I'd hoped.Despite my issues, this wasn't a badly written book. I just wish there had been more substantive development of the mythos and a more balanced tone. I would have enjoyed reading more about the Protectors and their role in the world had that been the case. Unfortunately, the biggest stumbling block for me with this book was that the light paranormal/superhero romance just wasn't to my reading tastes. Neither the stylistic choice of mixing quirky fun with serious threat or the subject matter of the sparsely explained superheros did much for me, and the female lead occasionally tried my patience. Taylor was a doll, though. No argument from me on that one.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"APHRODITE'S KISS by Julie Kenner is a cute paranormal romance about a girl descended from Greek Gods, who are really superheroes. In Zoe's case, she has x-ray vision, super strength, and she can levitate objects - when her superpowers work right. She also has super senses, which means her sense of touch can go wacko at the slightest stimulation. So when she meets Taylor, a really hot private investigator who likes her back, she's torn between wanting him and trying not to let her fledgling superpowers go berserk around him. In the meantime, her dastardly uncle and cousin plot to take over the world, and only Zoe can prevent it....For me, APHRODITE'S KISS started off slow, but really kicked in about page 200 - then I started speed reading, anxious to see what would happen. I thought Zoe and Taylor were a good couple together as well as sweet characters, and I especially liked secondary characters like Deena & Hoop, as well as the \\"talking\\" ferret, Elmer.I'm also glad I read THE CAT'S FANCY first, which also features Deena & Hoop and is the story behind Deena's sister-in-law, who was once a cat. Otherwise, I might have found Deena's acceptance of Zoe's superpowers too nonchalant.Anyway, I enjoyed reading APHRODITE'S KISS and look forward to reading the rest of the series, which also includes APHRODITE'S PASSION, APHRODITE'S SECRET, and APHRODITE'S FLAME."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"Zo Smith was considered to be a simple librarian of South Hollywood Elementary School. Only her best friend, Deena (a volunteer art teacher and Oreo cookie lover) knew the truth. Zo was a Halfling. She was only half mortal. Her mom, Tessa, would freak whenever Zo got around to telling her that she was not the normal person Tessa thought. Nope, Zo inherited some of her Dad's special abilities. Problem was that Zo was nearing her twenty-fifth birthday. In order to join the Council Of Protectors (her life long dream) she had to tell Tessa about her abilities, pass some tests by the Council, somewhat master the abilities she was showing, and (oh, yeah!) save the world from Hieronymous and her cousin Mordi! Hmmm, sounds simple for a super hero, right?George Taylor gave up his police career because of the bullet in his leg. Now he was a private investigator, barely irking out a living. He had his eye on Zo ever since they met (an embarrassing moment for him). But she would have nothing to do with him! Okay, she was after some ugly, green gem ... something called Aphrodite's Girdle? A legend? And okay, so her family was a bit strange. Hale thought he spoke to animals, her cousin thought he could turn invisible, etc. etc. But none of that could be true, right?***** Now HERE is a new type of Romance!

Talking ferrets, a missing belt said to make the wearer irresistable to men, some really ugly henchmen, an over-protective brother who models for romance novel covers, and a heroine able to leap off of tall buildings in a single bound, it all adds up to a lot of fun!

If she decides to become a Protector (rescuing mortals from various perils, such as fires, car crashes and the likes) she must pass various tests without any advanced notice...AND she must tell her mortal mom, who, years ago, left her husband when she found out he was a Protector! As if Zoe didn't have enough problems, enter George Bailey Taylor, ex-cop, now turned PI...........as soon as Zoe saw him, her insides were turned all around.....she knew she wanted him, but how could she possibly make love to a man, especially a mortal, when she practically burns at the slightest touch! Imagine the heat emanating when making love! Besides having to make these difficult decisions, Zoe had another job...........unbeknownst to her, the fate of the entire human population was in her hands! Could she save the world??

It's the work of a genius (or, at least, of an author who must have been a great stand-up comedienne in another life) This author hasn't disappointed me yet....for some reason, even though she writes romantic comedies, her characters not only keep me having to cross my legs from laughing so hard, but they also warm the cockles of my heart......I find them unforgettable, likeable and certainly not the run-of-the-mill type of heroes/heroines!! I do believe that the author, herself, is not an ordinary author...she, too, is exceptional! Julie Kenner is one extremely talented woman, whose books I just can't get enough of....I truly and highly recommend this book to one and all!

Irrepressible as ever, Ms Kenner has outdone herself in this outrageous, sexy, savvy love story of superhero proportions.Controlling superhero powers is like living an episode of The Twilight Zone for Zo Smith. The taste of chocolate bring about uncontrollable responses. X-ray vision can be controlled by glasses, but other senses register with fearsome clarity. Yet Zo has yet to levitate or steer a propulsion cloak with any degree of control. Considered a halfing, because she's half mortal and half Protector, Zo has to pass her twenty-fifth birthday tests to become a member of the Counsel. In her case, the test includes saving the world.George Bailey Taylor isn't the typical hero. His endearing qualities make George remarkably human, such as when he meets assistant librarian Zo, and he finds himself turning into a &quot;tongue-tied idiot.&quot; Undeniably sexy, George also has money trouble, seeking lost change in his car to buy a soda and hotdog for supper. So when a man promises $10,000 for the recovery a family heirloom, with a worthwhile deposit, George leaps at the opportunity. Little does he realize how his quest for the family heirloom will dovetail with his new romantic interest.With her characteristic flair, Kenner will have the reader laughing till tears come at the marvelous antics and sparkling dialogue. Richly created characters, an outrageous plot, and a loveable ferret make APHRODITE'S KISS is a keeper. Do I see another promise of a story line from Zo's overly protective brother? Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"George Bailey Taylor, &quot; was having a rotten day.

His foster sister, Lane, kept trying to play matchmaker with all her weirdo friends, but when he finally met &quot;The One,&quot; he managed to anger her with his questions about her co-worker The first time Zoe Smith saw Taylor her highly tuned senses went into overdrive. He was gorgeous, exuded masculinity and had that protective air about him that made her feel all safe and loved when around him. He also made her want to look over her glasses and see what he looked like under his clothes. But until she had her super powers under control, the Council would not let her use them. She was a halfling, descendent of the goddess Aphrodite, and a mortal. This rollicking tale of supernatural powers, saving the world and falling in love all at the same time is nothing short of hilarious. And when the two of them finally start concentrating on each other, the fireworks literally explode! A wonderful tale of true love conquering all, in both worlds!"},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"I enjoy books that don't take themselves too seriously - something fun and witty. I can definitely see where that was the intention, but it just didn't make it. I honestly had a hard time finishing this book, which is a pretty big deal for me. Everything about it was so cliche' and overly dramatic. The characters had no depth, and the writing didn't do anything to draw the reader in.

Guess I'll keep looking."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"The idea is so good, if only the author could have made it interesting. It is about a world inhabited by people with superpowers. The heroine has to take some tests in order to become a full blown superheroine, while trying not to fall in love with a mere mortal. It reminded me of the old Supergirl comics, except that the heroine was a very silly woman, the hero was uninspiring, and the only interesting person was the villainous cousin. The ending was a cop-out.... Now if this concept had been expanded upon by Nora Roberts or Jayne Ann Krentz, they'd have done a much better job."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"This is the second book by this author that I've read and I loved it. Its not a direct sequel but two of the supporting characters from the first book \\"The Cat's Fancy\\" Deena and Hoop are just as wonderful in this book.The heorine is a Superheroine, or at least a would be Superheroine. Zoe Smith is from a race of people that in ancient Greece were know as the Gods. She half human and half superhero. Her mother was human and her father a Protector(superhero).She has super powers like x-ray vision and telekinesis(she's still working on this). She has very heightened senses so that even eating is a challenge. Her mother doesn't know her secret and in oder to become a full fedged superhero she must tell her.She has to do this before her 25th birthday which is approaching fast. If this wasn't enough pressure she soon meets up with a mortal man who drives her crazy. George Taylor P.I. is on a case that he despises. He is broke and needs the money so he accepts the job and meets Zoe. He is knocked for a loop. He is longing for a a normal woman who wants to settle down, he thinks he has met that in Zoe but soon finds himself choved into a world that he can barely comprehend. He has always been the protector and now has to let Zoe protect him and this causes some conflicts.There is also a element of danger thrown into all of this by Zoe's cousin Mordi, who is also a halfing and approaching his 25th birthday. He needs something Zoe has but doesn't know she has and he will do just about anything to get it.

Excellent world-building! I really liked how the superheroes fit (or rather, didn't fit) into society. I also enjoyed all the characters except for the villain, who wasn't given any redeeming characteristics. The heroine was someone I could root for, as well as her boyfriend and her two nutty friends and the talking ferret.But... There was too much exposition in dialogue scenes, where someone would say something and then you'd get two paragraphs of the responder trying to figure out what had been said and what to say, and then they'd say something and you'd get two paragraphs... I'd rather read straight dialogue. Also, there were a lot of plot shortcuts taken during the last half of the book where people did things that weren't logical, just so the plot could proceed. The guy assigned to protect our heroine completely disappeared. Where was he? And the scene where our hero met the heroine's mother... what was that? Wrong scene, wrong PoV, went off on a strange tangent and left me scratching my head. Speaking of PoV, there were too many.But the sparks between hero and heroine were quite tasty and the humor of the book was consistent and very good, sometimes laugh-out-loud, which is VERY hard to do! Again I have to issue commendations for world-building.I'll be keeping an eye on Julie Kenner's future books."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"A wonderful read full of great comedy, great romance, great ferrets, and great bad guys!

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Aphrodite's Kiss (Time of Your Life)","review":"I'm not usually a fan of romance novels but I decided to give Aphrodite's Kiss a try since it presented an interesting idea: a race of superhumans who are descended from Greek gods and goddesses (called Protectors). Zoe Smith, who is half Protector and half human, is faced with an important decision on her 25th birthday--she can either become an Outcast (a full blown mortal with no superpowers whatsoever) or a Protector. To become a Protector she must face several challenges, including saving the world from her evil uncle and cousin. In addition to having the fate of the world rest in her hands, she faces love problems: she meets the man of her dreams, George Taylor (an ex-cop who just wants to find a girl who is normal).Although the romance started off a bit unrealistically, it got much better as the book progressed. The chemistry between the main characters was good, and the relationship seemed plausible (after the first meeting, of course). In addition, the other aspects of the story were very entertaining. A lot of comedy was thrown in. Also, the idea of the descendants of the superhuman Protectors was terrific--after all, who doesn't want to be a superhero?Overall, Julie Kenner blends a perfect amount of fantasy, romance, and comedy into a delightful story.

Dorchester/Love Spell needs to stick with the risque covers that have been their staple until now. And, btw, if the girl can see through clothes, why can't she see through the guy's boxers, too? *eg*The idea behind this book is quite good. It's a storyline long overdue. Kenner's writing style is also engaging. I wanted to like this book for those reasons alone, I was ready to like it, but the heroine, Zoe, completely ruins it. Zoe is clueless, so lackluster she's boring, incompetent, and overly prissy. In short, she's unworthy of the superheroine moniker. How can this twit compare to Rogue, Jean Gray, Storm, or Xena--smart, capable women who kick some serious booty? Then again, it's the rare romance that lets a woman be smart and capable. Worse still, Zoe is that appalling contemporary romance staple, a 25 year old virgin. For those unfamiliar with this cliche, romance books (historical AND contemporary) almost always trot out the kind of virgin who's so pure she hasn't even been felt up. Come on! That is beyond unrealistic. Haven't we seen enough of this already? Can't these writers be just a tad more original, or, dare I say it, drag themselves out of the 1950s?The hero is all right, but rather flat, and the story never quite jelled for me. I kept trying to find the will to finish it, but kept putting it down. Took me forever to finish it, and the ending was rather hum-drum. Wish I could get my money back..."},{"Title":"Truth and Symbol","review":"Karl Jaspers is a German Existentialist Philosopher born in 1883 and passed away in 1969. Before, Karl Jaspers was not a philosopher but a medical student who practiced psychiatry but unsurprisingly Karl Jaspers was fairly well versed in philosophy but decided not to pursue it as a professional career due to the fact that Philosophy at the time was too detached and \\"academic\\" (Most of philosophy was based on logic, language, etc). When Karl Jaspers did become a philosopher he wrote three volumes called Philosophie (or simply Philosophy) and then summarized his works in his work Philosophy of Existence and Reason and Existenz.In this book Karl Jaspers begins briefly expounding on the notion of Cyphers, which are \\"Symbols\\" of Being. Cyphers in themselves are not objective existing entities but \\"consummation\\" of the phenomenon that we usually encounter in our daily basis. To try to abstract it or objectify it we lose the cypher, but when we reflect on our daily experience and try to capture it's essential reality then Cyphers appear to us. Cyphers are complicated part of Jaspers Philosophy, and Jasper does not give a clear definitions of what Cyphers really are, but the general function of cyphers are almost like obscure windows into Being-Itself. Cyphers are like the borderline of our Self that are both real yet symbolic. Anything that inspires, captivates, moves, or transforms our experience is really a Cypher. Karl Jaspers seems to believe that \\"Philosophizing\\" is to cultivate the fascination of reality through Cyphers, it is not to decode these cyphers (since this would be an abstraction and objectification) but to quietly meditate on them to enjoy them as they are.Unfortunately, while Karl Jaspers is one of the very interesting Philosophers in the 20th century (and one of the founders of German Existentialism) his reputation is very much underrated. The reasons for this is unknown (probably has to do with the fact that Heidegger and Ardono severely criticized Jaspers for his philosophy and radical Liberalism) but it is quite certain that Karl Jaspers' philosophy is unwelcomed in the analytic tradition since his philosophy is obscure to read. However, there is no simple answer to the undeserved neglect of Karl Jaspers."},{"Title":"Hetzer Jagdpanzer (Schiffer Military History)","review":"I fall for it every time: I see an interesting title that was translated from a German original, I buy it, and proceed to be totally ticked off at the miserable quality produced by quickie book publishers. The typos, poor spelling, and downright mistranslation of this book ruins it for me. I lay the blame at the feet of the publisher (Schiffer, in Pennsylvania) rather than the author; after all, the author wrote it in German and didn't have responsibility for the English-language product. The publisher farmed out the translation and apparently accepted whatever came over the transom, typesetting it without review or, for that matter, the slightest application of some common sense.So for example (picking a page at random) we see tech specs such as \\"Valves: side mounted on camshaft dive wheels to the front.\\" I have no idea what that means, even if I insert \\"drive\\" for dive. Oh, here's a beauty: \\"Transmission: Parge-Wilson tarpaulin power drive with 5 forward gears.\\" Tarpaulin power drive? What the hey? Then I figured it out. It's a totally boogered translation of \\"Vorgelege-Getriebe\\" -- the old Wilson preselector gearbox. Parge is supposed to be Praga. And the list goes on. I see another use of \\"dive wheel\\" for running gear, so it's not an isolated typo. Who does this sort of work anyway? MS Spell Czecher?Picking another page at random. \\"Steering and break system: ...break-steering operated by 2 levers.\\"The translator is obviously unfamiliar with the technical jargon. Another example is found in the repeated use of the word \\"mantle\\" for \\"mantlet,\\" the cast shroud where the gun barrel exits the hull. Small point? What if your only source of knowledge on a subject is books of this sort, and you get the words wrong? How will you communicate, or for that matter avoid looking like a dolt, when talking to people who know the subject?I'm not even going to start on punctuation errors. Doesn't anybody know how to rite gud Inglesh no more?In my professional opinion (I translate German engineering and technical books -- not military, so there's no conflict of interest here), a translated book should if anything be BETTER than the original; there is more time for errors of fact to be weeded out, more eyeballs see the copy, there is time to check with the author if he really meant to say this instead of that, etc. Unfortunately there are too many in the publishing industry that don't see it that way and just use the generated text to fill the white space between the photos. I am fortunate in working with technical publishers on both sides of the pond who take quality seriously; unfortunately, sometimes I become a consumer of books not done to the same standard.So does this book have anything to recommend it? Well, it's hard to booger up photos; for modellers, there's plenty of detail in these images. But the English translation, proofreading, and typsetting are an amateur effort not worthy of a high school newspaper.This coulda been a contendah. Squadron/Signal does a far better job on books in this format. They also had a book on the Hetzer, and it's an infinitely better production, but appears to be out of print at present (they reissue these from time to time). I see Amazon also lists another publisher's book, ISBN 1841761354. I will probably order that. Hopefully that (apparently British) production did a better job of it. But I'm becoming accustomed to disappointment in translated military history..."},{"Title":"Hetzer Jagdpanzer (Schiffer Military History)","review":"This book is poorly done. No history of the tanks preformance in battle,no outlines on paint schemes and little more than a few rather poor pictures. Why this book was ever put out is a wonder as there have been since 1945 about a dozen top running tanks of this kind avaliable for study and for color photowork and even in 2012 there are a few operators in Germany alive who rode this vechile into battle- why all this was tossed aside leads one to scratch ones head as the book looks more like something thrown together from a copy machine used to copy off material off the sides of model boxes and old news paper clipping. This is a real tragedy as the Hetzer is probably one of the more fameous unique tanks of the second world war-it is almost comical to think one can learn more about the Hetzer reading a article in wikipedia than reading through this cheap and disappointing book."},{"Title":"The Hammer Will Fall","review":"If you're a fan of Ed Lee or Jack Ketchum you should really like this first novel by indy filmmaker Tim Ritter, who is no stranger to the genre. It's sort of like &quot;CLASS OF 1984&quot; crossed with &quot;THE SUBSTITUTE&quot; combined with a slasher movie! What happens when a teacher can't take his abusive, out of control students anymore? Students not even the school's principal will reprimand? Students who break in to his home, harass his pregnant wife and put the cat in the microwave? You'll find out in this fast paced, quick read. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Hammer Will Fall","review":"Mr. Ritter is a genius! Taking the reality of 21st Century schools that are so far out of control and putting it in this context is absolutely brilliant.'Hammer' is at once intelligent, realistic, and entertaining. This book should be a wake up call to America about how far our schools have truly decayed. The writing is based on real facts and a teacher that was in the system. It cannot be argued and who knows, in twenty years teachers may face \\"fighting back\\" their students like gladiator barbarians or just quitting.Education is a joke, America's high school SAT scores are so low it's ridiculous---teens graduate that cannot even read and no one is doing anything. This book is an eye-opener---kids are doing whatever they want and their family lives have rotted them from the beginning. All today's self-centered teens are concerned with is sex, drugs, violence, and sick music. Society as a whole has ruined them from the get-go. I see it in my old neighborhood and where I taught (yes, I'm a former NY teacher---glad I got out before I got a bullet in the head).While this book hits the fictional zone about midway through, the reality it's based upon is just so haunting. Wake up America, your schools...and future leaders...are crumbling.And this book shows why! I think THE HAMMER WILL FALL is the new 1984. It offers insight, reality, and then switches into a \\"final solution\\" that, in a fictional sense, is most satisfying.Read this book at all costs!"},{"Title":"Typefaces for Desktop Publishing: A User Guide","review":"This wonderful book explains how you can use type to help your documents communicate better.

Prof. McLuhan describes the Menippean tradition beginning with Lucian and traces a continuous line to Joyce. He describes the breakdown of the Greek Logos into the Trivium, and how the ratio between Grammar, Rhetoric, and Dialectic (and the culture itself) changes under the influence of technology. He shows how Joyce uses the thunders as rhetorical gestures enacting the transformation of culture by technological metaphor using textual context and multilingual etymology. Sounds horribly stiff, perhaps; its really much more fun (and much freer) than most over-conceptualized scholarship."},{"Title":"The Role of Thunder in Finnegans Wake","review":"This book make FW a bit less obscure. First he narrows his focus to the ten 100-letter Thunderwords in FW and shows that, like DNA in a chromosome, each Thunder contains all the themes of its section in microcosm. (find the Joseph Campbell on Finnegans Wake video and hear him read the first thunderword for the full effect) Second, he fits FW in the genre of Minippean satire, so its disorderly mess has a bit of company on the bookshelf. Hey, &quot;Every artist creates his own precursors&quot;, Borges wrote. When I went to school, it was Horatian and Juvenalian, nice and nasty, Garison Keillor vs Howard Stern. Well, now there's room for Tristram Shandy and Frank Zappa, too.

Oh my gosh...how does one write a review of this book. I guess it's for Joyce fans, or those who have read &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; more than once. To me, reading &quot;about&quot; the Wake is as fun as reading the Wake. &quot;Oh; THAT'S what that means!!&quot; Let's face it, we all need a lot of help. If you've seen the paperback &quot;War and Peace in the Global Village&quot;---where, I think, the page called &quot;What the thunders said...&quot; is found---you'll have a headstart. Enough! or too much. Thanks, Eric McLuhan."},{"Title":"The Role of Thunder in Finnegans Wake","review":"Like the Gnostic text Thunder, Perfect Mind, the Wake is a song of oblique wisdom.

Not only do you have a superb collection of cats, but you also get them placed in the art-loving world of the 17th century Dutch upperclass--with gabled houses, Vermeer-like paintings in the background, ornate, beautifully crafted furniture, etc. And with all this in mind, I sent a link to images of this deck to my wife, who thinks tarot decks are a bit of a joke. \\"Shovel, garbage bags. These people had too much time on their hands, and should have been out cleaning garbage from the roads,\\" she replied.For myself, with a collection of 46 tarot decks, this one doesn't make it. The images aren't for meditation, and the cats really get in the way of readings; also, while the deck is clearly patterned after Rider-Waite, a lot of the detail has been sacrificed to the cats and background.So who should buy it? Lovers of the 17th century artworld, and catlovers. But for tarotists, either into the tarot as a tool of personal exploration or divination, there are far better places to look."},{"Title":"The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot Kit","review":"I did recived mine and was delighted with the scenes of the card and the simple way the book guide of to use it.

Its awful because and don't know how I could fell in such dissgrace except for the mistake of using this thing.

Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot Kit","review":"This is a must for cat lovers and tarot readers. This deck is beautifully done and worth every penny."},{"Title":"The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot Kit","review":"\\"There seems to be some definite, if indefinable, link between cats and tarot...Could it be that people who are attracted to animals as enigmatic, untamable and yet at the same time as warmly emotional as cats also find some of these same qualities in the tarot?\\" - From the companion bookKaren Mahony and Alex Ukolov, the creative geniuses who run baba studio and Magic Realist Press in Prague, meld lavish costumes, posed cats, stunning Bohemian scenery, and quirky art and architecture in the Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot. While many \\"cat decks\\" are mostly art decks, this gorgeous Tarot is a bona fide reading deck based on the Rider-Waite-Smith tradition.Sumptuous fabrics and lovely detailing grace the costumes created by Finnish artist Anna Hakkarainen, while many of the \\"models\\" used in the Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot were from the Prague Cats Rescue Home. Russian Blues, Tabbies, Persians, Siamese, Orientals, British Shorthairs, mixed breeds--all manner of hue and personality infuse these cards.From the singing Abyssinian on the 3 of Pentacles to the wide-eyed kitten on the Sun card (which was coaxed to stand up on a horse with a teaspoon of cream!), the almost-human expressions surprise and delight. The fierceness of the Siberian on the Knight of Swords crackles with energy, and the sweet innocence of the 6 of Cups elicits an \\"awww!\\" for both its cuteness and the way it captures the essence of this card. The 9 of Cups is a hilarious card, with a British shorthair licking his lips in snarky Puss in Boots fashion. Ms. Mahony writes of this card:\\"A somewhat portly and obviously very satisfied cat sits on a barrel in the public room of an inn, licking his lips. Behind him, carved in wood, can be a seen a scene of grand merrymaking.\\"Because some readers prefer Strength and Justice as either Trump 8 or 11, the deck designers have chosen to keep the Majors unnumbered. In addition to the standard RWS attributions and format, Ms. Mahony and Mr. Ukolov have also added a \\"good luck\\" card to the Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot: Hermes--which shows a golden statue of the god in a sunny courtyard while a lovely cat clothed in a sage green gown with white ruffles looks on. At first glance, it appears the card backings are fully reversible, but upon closer inspection, you can see the names Ukolov and Mahony on opposing sides. Because the script is so small, however, the backings still work wonderfully for reversals.This deck, like their Fairytale Tarot, arrives in a box set with a beautifully bound soft cover book. With 207 pages, the glossy pages depict black and white reproductions of the cards as well as photos of fountains, sculptures, paintings, and various architectural elements found therein. Ms.Mahony's prose, as always, is a sheer joy to read, and she offers a brief overview of what's going on in the card, a \\"cat's interpretation\\", keywords and phrases for both upright and reversed meanings, and a lucid, in-depth explanation of the card. She also notes source materials for each card.The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot is an excellent reading deck, and especially good as a deck for children or cat lovers. Because this deck follows RWS, it can be used in conjunction with many Tarot books, making it a great beginner's deck, as well. I've had quite a few insights with these cards, which I've jotted down in my Tarot journal. While an artistically exquisite Tarot that belongs in every art deck collection, it's an excellent deck for both reading and meditation.(To see 10 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"The Baroque Bohemian Cats' Tarot Kit","review":"I have a growing collection of tarot cards.

I would like to add that the artists did not skimp on the minor arcana,as is so common in many other decks. The entire deck is gorgeous. Instead of being cutesey or cartoony, it actually has(in my opinion) a moody, serious tone. The cats take themselves, and your questions, very seriously. I started out doing a reading for a cat fanatic, humor expected, and instead we were bowled over by the messages. The tonal artwork gives the feel of alchemy, elegance, and undercurrents so often found in the old courts. I highly recommend this gorgeous deck as a means to enter another world to find your solutions.

So very true. And the history of Iraq is not yet written. Bush deposed one of the most ruthless fascist dictators of all time, and established a democracy, virtually overnight. At the same time, the U.S. took out, as Cheney put it \\"the most likely nexus between Al Quida and weapons of mass destruction\\" [it never was just about WMDs, as the Left always states]. But this book is not only about Iraq. The Iraq essay is excellent and shows the shallowness of the Left on that issue. The other essays are interesting, and it is not just about politics. I really am impressed by the Weekly Standard, and I read it every week. It has some of the most fresh and new ideas (for example, this past week, an excellent article on why the 'bird flu' scare is overhyped), and I find it a nice change of pace away from the group-think, paranoia, shallowness, hatred, and pessimism so prevailent on the Left today."},{"Title":"The Weekly Standard : A Reader: 1995-2005","review":"I saw Jon Stewart interview Kristol last night on the daily show.

It's a Poetry Jam: Discovering Performance Poetry","review":"Holbrook, Sara. 2002. Wham! It's a Poetry Jam: Discovering Performance Poetry. Honesdale, PA: Wordsong Publishing. ISBN 1569379885.\\"Show the world that poetry was never meant to simply lie quietly on the page, any more than kids were meant to sit quietly in their seats to read it.\\" With this closing line Holbrook encourages teachers and librarians to try out the exercises outlined in this work to get kids up and performing poems from favorite poets and their own creations. The author includes her own poetry in this work to demonstrate performance poetry and include tips and advice to adults and kids on how best to perform certain works.The format of this work lends itself to adults wanting to include performance poetry and poetry jams in their classrooms or programs. Each poem is paired with explanations on how best to perform the poem out loud, alone or with a group. The instructions are included at the beginning and end of each poem, and additional cues are highlighted in colored boxes of various shapes on each page. The author includes open ended questions to encourage children to think about how the poem sounds when performed with different tones and emotions and ways to include movement in the performance. Each page of cues, instructions and poems give teachers ample information on not only performing the poem offered but also encouraging children to want to perform. The work begins with poems suited to more than one voice to give children the safety of performing as a group. Holbrook then moves on to solo performances and how to instill the courage in children to give this a try.The most useful chapter for adults working with children is \\"Get Ready to Wham: A Word (or Two) About Contests. This chapter provides useful information in hosting a poetry jam that would be a contest between performers. Holbrook includes instructions for who can participate, how to keep score, who the judges should be, the rules to follow, who is in charge of the contest, and other information to ensure a smooth and fun poetry jam for all contestants. The inclusion of this chapter is clearly helpful to beginners in the poetry jam field.Holbrook's enthusiasm for the subject comes through loud and clear. Unfortunately, her chipper tone and dramatic phrasing could turn some young teens off. This book is best suited for teaching adults. There are a lot of good solid pieces of advice, instruction, and tips in this short work for teachers and librarians. From the use of stage space to the tone, rhythm and emotion behind the words to the volume and strength of the voice, Holbrook offers the right information to inspire adults to give performance poetry a try in the classroom or library programs."},{"Title":"Wham!

But this book is a real gem -- not a cut and polished diamond with a cold shine, but a more organic beauty, like pearl or amber or raw emerald.These poems are accessible while at the same time retaining a wonder at the mystery of life. The size of each poem is just right -- about twenty lines or so, and each poem is about the length of one whole utterance or train of thought. I really love that I can hear a real, distinctive human voice in these poems, and not the flatness and lack of emotion you get in a lot of poetry these days, especially if it is written by younger people.

There are many great things to talk about, so I should better categorize: The ART is detailed and impressive. We can get lost in the intrincate detail and look at the book over and over and find out new details that were missed at the previous readings.The STORY is complex, with lots of layers and lots of action and characters and events. Absolutely entertaining and hard to put down.The CHARACTERS are three-dimensional and very believable.

There are not enough words to describe the excellence of the storyline and art, so I wont go into that. Pick up an issue and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"If you were introduced to a Distant Soil in its WARPS Graphics incarnation--this is a toned down version rewritten to be less offensive, yet be warned it delves more deeply into unpleasant subjects like child molestation and rape. Incidents that were hinted in the WARP version are now in chilling detail, while other plot points, characterization and intrigues are glossed over or toned down so we are left with a version that feels schizophrenic.A Distant Soil is sci-fi in its truest form. A diabolical long-lived alien race is set on conquering the galaxy. When not killing their own children for unwanted psychic powers, they spend their time conquering lesser races to enslave. The alien race's power is embodied in the Avatar, a godlike deity that is supported/enslaved by the vile Hierarchy.The gist of the story (for there are many subplots and dimensional cross-overs) is a recently deceased Avatar charged with killing children with unwanted psychic powers took pity and allowed many to live that would have otherwise been killed. One of these deviants is discovered and with the help of the new Avatar escapes to earth where he fathers several children...One of which happens to be an Avatar incarnate, sharing a soul with the current Avatar. The alien race is shocked that such a lesser being wielding this power and sets out to find and kill this upstart. Unfortunately, the alien race has an underground resistance who is also trying to capture the Earthen Avatar and use her for their own ends.Mix in a fairy, an Arthurian knight, a policeman, and some various aliens and you have a fabulous sci-fi story.Be warned there are heavy scenes of homo-erotica, homosexuality, bisexuality and hinted at child molestation (the last hyped up since the first incarnation of this series to level that personally sickened me-hinting was enough before).I enjoyed the original series and was very confused or lost in this incarnation of the story -though it did proceed further than the WARP edition-because basic explanations are missing. Relationships between characters have been toned down since the first incarnation, but nudity is on the rise.The lovingly crafted art is fabulous and is what drew me first to the series. It still contains many of the original elements, but has lost the spark the first incarnation from WARP displayed.I would have given it five stars had she stuck to the original story from WARP but it is too transformed and confusing to be given 5 stars (especially when you can lose faithful readers in scenes they have all ready read before!)"},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"A science fiction struggle over some super powered hybrid children, involving some unpleasant aliens.This is Doran's magnum opus, as the children learn their place and start to understand what is actually going on."},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"A Distant Soil contains everything from Arthurian Legends to alien imortals in the style of a classic Roger Zelazny novel. It's artwork and atmosphere also reminds me of such great Japanese Shojo comics (esp. Clamp's works). Her artwork and story meld together into a strong epic piece, similar to Smith's Bone or M. Oakley's Thieves and Kings (the other two comics I'm currently following). If this book is unavailable online, you probably can hunt it down at your local comic store."},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"OK, so Distant Soil has one of the basic principles of sci-fi: People from another planet take over the earth, someone has to stop them. One of the great things about this graphic novel, however is the unique blend of physic powers, realism and the traditional space odyssey along with a colorful cast. The plot in the 1st book isn't really 5 stars, but of course the characters are just being introduced as their circumstances, but DS1 serves as a necessary component in the long run. If you buy this for anything buy it for the artwork. Though in black and white, Colleen Doran is one of the best illustrators I have ever laid eyes upon, her artwork so intricately detailed you feel these people are real. (Watch out it was published in the 80s: mullets and short shorts for men.) Even the dreamy sequences that take up a full page are remiiscent of Japanese manga. But don't listen to my stupid rambling, buy it for yourself and decide!"},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"This is a book I got for my birthday (3-17) that I had read in another edition from another publisher when I was 14. I was a little bit worried to read it again because when you have good memories of something from a long time ago, sometimes it is hard to go back to them again. One of the reviews here sounded like the book was going to be really yaoi with lots of sex and things I wasn't sure I wanted to see and that it was hard to understand the new version. I didn't have any trouble understanding the new version, and if there is a lot of sex in this one, I missed it. There's no naked people sex in this book. Maybe in later volumes? It looks like a little bit of skin in the next book (I got that too), but nothing much. Maybe I am a little disappointed now! Especially since the guys are so cute! That is one thing that is different. I think the artist draws a lot better than they used to. Rieken-Seren is so beautiful. His face is like a dream. He is like a prettier version of David Bowie, if you can do that! Anyway, I really liked this newer version a lot. I had no trouble following it. So, I don't know why anyone said they did. It takes careful reading, but I like that. It doesn't seem to me that this is a book you can just flip through. You have to pay attention. If you do not pay attention, you will miss a lot. It is as if almost every little line has double meaning. It's a great puzzle and that interests me. It has a dreamy quality too, but it is good fantasy (more fantasy than science fiction, I think). The Avatar is Seren who is so gorgeous he should just have his own book by himself. Anyway, he is like a god to his people because he can draw on their collective life force and use it as his own power. But since there can be only one (sounds kind of like Highlander but it isn't), the evil Hierarchy of his world comes to Earth to find Liana, a little girl who is also an Avatar. (She's not that little but she is young). The Hierarchy must kill her or the Avatar can't use his power. Seren is working against the Hierarchy but they don't know. He is leader of the rebellion. When his people come to Earth to kill Liana he gets some humans to help him to kill the Hierarchy. There is a lot more to it than that and I am already reading volume II, but don't want to flip forward. It is a little strange about the fantasy in here. How did Sir Galahad get into this story? I really want to see how that works out. Oh yeah, he is cute too. This book sort of feels like manga, but it isn't. It is harder to read than manga, but I like that because I get more story. Some manga seems to take 15 minutes to read a whole book. I really read and studied this book a lot and got a lot out of that. This art is pretty like manga, but more realistic. That is OK to me. This book is not yaoi like that other review makes it seem. If you are looking for serious yaoi, you will be disappointed probably. But it is shonen ai a bit. Seren and D'mer are lovers, but you don't really see much. Anyway, this is my first review and I hope you like it."},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"The plot of A Distant Soil involves aliens who look just like people and whose society is based entirely on psychic energy by which they communicate. We follow the story of Liana, a girl who has been raised in a mental institution where her psychic powers are studied. She and her brother, her only family in the world, escape. They are separated and Liana is approached by aliens who explain that she has very powerful psychic powers and they need her help. Their society is ruled by a single person (alien?) with very powerful skills at organizing psychic energy. This person, the Avatar, serves as a religious leader and alsoThere is a certain amount of disconcerting randomness here. Author Colleen Doran began publishing this series (its been redrawn for this release) when she was in her teens. This may explain why this book is the way it is. It is lots like a teen girl's daydream: beautiful drawings with lots of flowy lines, Galahad comes from the land of Avalon through a time warp and accompanies our heros into space among other plot oddities.So the plot is kind of stupid. At the same time it is extremely complex and twisting. Characters have complex motives and act accordingly. We see lots of politics. And it all makes sense. Within this random random world there aren't inconsistencies. There are things to figure out and a plot to follow.The drawings here are very nice. They are done in a very defined line drawing style. Every page is well done and also pretty: art nouveau flowers and rainbows pretty. Battles fought with psychic energy work well with this style of representation. The layouts are packed (in a good way) and there is lots happening on every page.I liked this but I don't know if it is worth reading in general. It is an intelligent and involving comic... ... on the other hand: Galahad in space is never a good sign."},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"I have known the work of Colleen Doran since her high school days, and I can tell you there is nothing capricious about what the reader will see and read in A Distant Soil. Colleen's characters are verbally realistic and engaging, with their appearance masterfully captured and conveyed by the hand and eye of their creator...and Colleen's story flows well. I didn't want to put A Distant Soil down, but when I had to, as with other engaging books, I looked forward to returning to that world. You will have to remember and think a bit, and even occasionally look back to review who means what to the plot, like in a Sherlock Holmes mystery, etc., but that is very interesting. A Distant Soil and ALL of Colleen's creations are the work of a genius whose talent is shared with the rest of us mortals because of her work ethic, and her unrelenting attention to detail. As a musician who is never satisfied with what others consider 'good enough', I was struck early on in Colleen's career by what I saw as real talent, conveyed through the unique quality of Colleen's ability to put on paper what is in her mind, and then to improve on that. It has been for the years to show me, and others, that all of Colleen's work is the rare combination of collector quality and enjoyable, engaging reading.

The art, while *good*, did not qualify as beautiful to me; the 80s clothes looked ugly, the characters introduced too quickly... However, after reading it... I love the dialogue, I love the characters, I enjoy the set-up and plot very much. Colleen combines a bit of everything, and it comes out on top... the dialogue is great, I laughed outloud at points, which anyone who is honest will have to admit does not happen often.

In this case, it's more than talk. This book is so good, so well done, so well written, I can't believe I have never heard about it before. I didn't know there were comics like this! A fifteen year old girl named Liana finds out that she is an Avatar which is a kind of psychic conduit for her people. All of their power can flow through her. There is already an Avatar on her homeworld and his power is hampered by Liana's existence. The corrupt government of that world needs the Avatar as a weapon, so they travel to Earth to find Liana and kill her so their Avatar will be able to use all his powers.This book has a large cast and I was surprised that I was able to follow it this well. Every character actually looks different and moves different and talks different, like people you would know. I have trouble figuring out diffenre character in other comics, like Elfquest, where all the characters look alike.I especially like the King Arthur scenes which are a real mystery at this point in the series and I am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.Absolutely wonderful!"},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"Colleen Doran draws like no other artist in the comic book industry. Her skill and sumptuous sensibility results in a story which is, graphically, fascinating. A feast for the eyes. The story is equally engaging, blending science fiction and fantasy. An alien empire of willowy telepaths from Ovanon, sends a war ship to earth to eliminate Liana Scott, a girl whose father was a fugitive from Ovanon. Liana was born with the ability to tap into &quot;the Collective&quot;, marking her as Ovanon's spiritual leader.

I (1998, Image Entertainment)I should preface this by saying that Colleen Doran's A Distant Soil is the first graphic novel I've read since The Watchmen, some thirteen years ago, and so I may be missing some of the subtleties involved. If so, mea culpa.I've just finished the first volumes of the A Distant Soil trilogy (at least, it's a trilogy as of this writing), and I've been trying to decide whether I want to continue on with the other two books in the series. Still haven't decided one way or the other. Doran seems to be trying (as Neil Gaiman says in his introduction to the book) to cram just a little too much into the space provided.The story centers on a brother and sister who have grown up in a mental institution-cum-research facility. Both have psychic powers, but are unaware of the extent of those powers, as are their keepers. The two of them, after a crisis situation, escape and are separated. They find themselves aiding two different (and possibly conflicting; it's impossible to tell) branches of an alien resistance force, along with an odd assortment of characters both alien and human, including Galahad (yes, THAT Galahad).There is, without doubt, a lot going on here. And once you've got a handle on things, you can probably keep track of it all, but it takes much longer to get a handle on things than it should. Again, Gaiman's introduction rings true here; Doran's work got better as she got older. If you're willing to get through the earlier parts in order to get to the later stuff, you'll find much to enjoy here.The problem, though, is that some of the failings persist until the end of the novel. Cuts in location and time aren't indicated in any way, and the segues remain jarring throughout. The atmosphere is minimal; a good thing in some cases when telling a story, but generally not so good when one is working in the graphic realm. (One of the things that made The Watchmen so excellent was Moore's constant use of atmospheric detail, which is lacking here.)Hard to really say. I liked it, but I still haven't figured out whether I'm going on to volume II. **"},{"Title":"Distant Soil, Vol. 1 The Gathering (v. 1)","review":"First off, let me just say that the art in this tome is fantastic! It is black and white, however the level of detail and skill exhibited is excellent.The story is a little ambitious. As Neil Gaiman discusses in his introduction, sometimes a writer will come up with a story and attempt to incorporate everything. Doran begins her series with a story about two teenagers with psychic powers who are escaping an experimental institute. You discover that these kids are descended from a powerful alien entity. The alien race makes contact with the pair and attempts to connect them with others in an intergalactic rebellion. In addition to recruiting powerful people on Earth, there is also much action out in space. Additionally, Doran throws in an entire section about Arthurian characters, and she pulls in a knight from the past into the rebellion in the present. Any of these stories would be interesting on its own, and since there are so many scene changes and complications, it is occasionally difficult to follow the story (discerning the connection with the Arthurian time is the most difficult). Perhaps many questions are answered in later volumes.However, all the situations, though incredible, are interesting and well-written. You develop empathy for each of the characters and want to find out more about this epic.Oh, did I mention the artwork is fantastic?!"},{"Title":"The Logic of Opposites","review":"Rollings writes wonderful poetry.

I was prepared to give it a full 5 stars as a comprehensive overview of the various effects of media violence (both negative and positive). But unfortunately, some careless writing sneaks into most of the second half of the book, with subtle exaggerations and various arguments that won't hold up to rigorous scrutiny. Those exaggerations and arguments are meant to strengthen his criticism of media violence, but unfortunately weaken his strength as an overall authority. The author has assembled a lot of great information into this book, which may be an ideal starting point for readers new to this topic, but many of his excellent points, arguments, and insights get carried slightly farther than are truly defensible at this time (scientifically, logically, sociologically). I am still waiting for the definitive book on this topic that I can recommend without reservations to people I know. This one I would recommend to average readers but not unreservedly to the rigorous thinkers and scholars I am fortunate to count among my friends.

This is just a 34 page booklet that had NO proofreading before printing. Zip, Zero as in None!It may have been written by an adolescent, or an adult whose education hadn't been proofed either. And those comments are the nicer things to be said about this so called 'book.'It is no more then a badly put together series of notes, and even the notes aren't well written.There are muddy photos throughout, the kind of poor quality we used to get trying to Xerox color prints to black and white. They never produced well and here they fail as well. The newer technology of photo reproduction is totally missing. So too are clear, easy to understand IDs for many of the subjects of these photos. People should be paid to read The Adamson Bro's Conspiracy, but no one should pay to read it.It's an embarrassing read and no, I couldn't finish it. From the very first page, first sentence, the author quotes the bible and tells us that &quot;Cain Slew Abraham.&quot; Pardon me but, didn't Cain slay Abel?This effort at book writing ( if any real effort was made), is rife with clumsy phrases and sentences. We find for example on page two that one of the Adamson family was....&quot;Nominated five times for an Academy Award five times.&quot; Or how about this quote, &quot;Let us take a look at the process of what which took.&quot; Huh?

The books are wonderful for helping children explore their feelings and interaction with others.

You see Francis make up rhymes about the food her mom puts in front of her to eat, which is really cute. Then something interesting happens. Francis is only given bread and jam to eat, her absolute favorite. She soon realizes how boring that can be. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a classic!"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Frances, a young badger girl, wishes to eat nothing but bread and jam, although the rest of her family enjoys many kinds of food. Her mother gently and lovingly teaches her the value of eating a diversity of foods by plying her with nothing but bread and jam until she is very tired of it, and by the end of the story she has learned to enjoy other foods. Young children, who often gravitate toward the same comfort foods for long periods of time, will identify with Frances' preference for bread and jam, with which she knows she is \\"always pleased.\\" After she tires of bread and jam, her willingness to try other foods (and to savor them with the niceties of doily, flower and vase, even at her school desk) sets a good example without being at all preachy.It is difficult to write well with the simple sentences and limited vocabulary of early-reader books, but Hoban does a wonderful job with this carefully-paced, pleasingly illustrated story. The aesthetics and rhythmic repetitions in this story make it pleasing at several levels. The best part of this story is that Frances' parents are loving, patient, and kind, and express genuine respect and affection for one another. A very nice read."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I grew up listening to Francis tales on road trips with my family. A fine example of what children should be reading at a young age--pure, simple, clean fun--not adult themes, concepts or sexual innuendo \\"imbedded\\" cartoons.

These stories are perfect for entertaining on long trips or just to teach a simple lesson without the strain of tantrums or punishments."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"We love reading the Hobans' books to our daughter. Frances is an excellent example of how aware, how strong, and how vulnerable children are. In this book, what is at the center of Frances' attention is the family--more precisely, how the family inaugurates a way of eating, of understanding the crucible of family meals. Frances' parents embark on an implicit lesson for Frances--that giving her what she (from their perspective) THINKS she wants will lead Frances to see that what she wants is in fact different and more sophisticated than bread and jam for every meal. It is poignant and melancholy and at times humorous as Frances works through what her mother, father, and sister are setting up for her as images of what it means to eat well. Are the parents doing what they should? One can only hope. Thankfully, Frances has her friend Albert as a model, too. And, as Frances goes on to see, it is true for her that eating a variety of foods is something she can start to like, in a variety of ways.For the careful reader, and for the parent who can process the book with his or her child, the character of Frances may offer hope to a young child who is faced with how to eat in a family. This is no small task, and we can all be more reflective, I think, on how well we are helping our young ones to accede into adult practices. May we all arrive at the wisdom that Albert and Frances share at school...there is something eucharistic there, I think."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Russell Hoban, Bread and Jam for Frances (Harper Collins, 1964)The badger is one of the world's most noble creatures.

In this one, Frances refuses to eat anything but bread and jam, no matter what her parents give her to eat. After a while, they stop giving her anything else, and she realizes that variety is a good thing. Ah, if only it worked that way in real life. A fun one, this. ***"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I loved the Frances books when I was a child. I love reading the Frances books to my children. Frances is a delightful character who makes you smile with her witty songs and her unique view of the world.Bread and Jam is probably my favorite Frances story. I love the detailed descriptions of the food. Frances is a typical picky eater who only wants to eat bread and jam, everyday. Frances' parents allow their determined daughter to do just that. Frances learns a wonderful lesson about variety.The illustrations are detailed and soft. They match the excellence of the story.The length is perfect and it is a wonderful read- aloud book."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"The Frances books were popular with my daughter when she was a young child and with me as well. I recently bought all of the available titles for my twin grandsons (4.5 years old). I love the little songs that Frances sings. Common childhood situations crop up in the stories - in this one, children's food phases - and parental solutions are creative, kind and effective."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Frances is a picky eater. She likes bread and jam because it's consistent.Her parents are understandably upset by this, but they deal with it in the most practical way - they give her exactly enough bread and jam to fill her up for life.The story is resolved very quickly, after only a day, but satisfyingly. \\"How do you know what I'll like if you don't even let me try it?\\" indeed."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I remember my mother reading Frances books to me when I was little, and I couldn't wait to read them to my daughter. The Frances books are wonderful children's stories."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"The book is great, and my daughter had to \\"read\\" it as soon as it was opened."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I loved the Frances books growing up and now my two-year is enjoying them. I just read Bread and Jam to her and she loves it, especially the songs Frances sings (I sing them to the tune of Mary has a Little Lamb). I love the parenting advice in the book, too. We love the description of the lunches these little badgers unpack and eat at school. I love the quality of the illustrations and the writing. I think it's children's book writing at the best. So many books now are just plain silly!"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I read the FRANCES books to my daughters (now grown) and am buying every one I can get my hands on to read to my two grandsons and my granddaughter. The character of Frances is so very human, and she has such realistic foibles that every child can identify with. Frances is a classic.(I have no qualms about the parental roles portrayed in the book. Can't parents choose the roles they wish, and isn't the traditional role a valid choice?)"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"It was one of my favorites as a kid and now I read it to my little girl"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I love this book! The drawings are charming and the text is just as wonderful. Parents can give in to their picky eaters or be too heavy-handed in dealing with them. Frances's parents wisely choose to allow Frances to only eat bread and jam for several days, until she realizes that she is missing out on many other foods. They are gentle but firm with her, and in the end, we are all glad to see her enjoying a variety of foods again. We started making poached eggs on toast for breakfast after reading this book-- yum!"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Russell Hoban's Frances series is a must read for all small children. The illustrations are delightful and the text shares common problems small children face. My 32 year old son loved these books and now his 3 year old son is enjoying them."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Mine, that is. I read the Frances books when I was young and was delighted to rediscover them for/with my own children. The illustrations are great, and the little songs Frances invents are priceless. The kids are going around the house now, singing to their food.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I'm not shocked or horrified that only Mother is seen cooking and Father has a job. Maybe Mother is a better cook; I'm sure she's a better mom. My kids are homeschooled, but I'm not even offended that Frances goes off to a traditional school on a school bus. Can't we all just get over ourselves already?"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I remember reading this book as a child with my mom. She would read a page then I would read a page. I'm glad it's still around, so I can share it with my family since my copy isn't in the best shape. It is a great story. It has easy read print and the words are great for those learning to read."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I remember reading this book to my daughter. It was always one of her favorites. I'm so pleased to see that now I have a granddaughter ready for early reading that the book is still in print."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was young, and I was happy to read the library's copy to my little ones. However, when I purchased this version on Amazon, it was not the same - they left out sentences here and there which, after reading the library's copy over and over and over, were sorely missed.If you've never read this book before, this version may be ok. However, I'd recommend sticking with the original, unabridged edition. It's not much longer (maybe 1 or 2 pages total?) but is better with all the original text.Another good one about picky eaters is the D.W. the Picky Eater in the Arthur series."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"This is a cute and captivating tale of Frances, the picky eater who only wants to eat bread and jam. Her parents handle her food refusal by indulging her with bread and jam at every meal and snack. She soon tires of it and wants to eat what everyone else is eating: a well-rounded meal.This is a cute tale with little rhymes that Frances sings to herself with her food musings. The illustrations are adorable, they are not a visual assault as some other children's books have. This book was first published in the 1960s and as with other picture books of that time, has nice long prose, a good length of a story.Both parents and children who deal with fussy eaters will appreciate this funny tale. It is a classic that is sure to be a favorite!"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I remember falling in love with &quot;Bread and Jam for Frances&quot; when I was a child and I was eager to see if my 3 year-old daughter would be equally fond of it. It's one of her favorites. We've read this book before bedtime almost every night for the past month.When fussy eater Frances refuses to try anything new to eat, her mom and dad teach her a loving lesson in how you can have too much of a good thing. My daughter likes pointing out all the different food that's represented in Lillian Hoban's wonderful illustration and she's memorized all of Frances's charming little songs about jam and food. The love, humor and gentle nature of this book make it a good one to pass down from generation to generation."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Bread and Jam for Frances by Russell Hoban, with illustrations done by Lillian Hoban is one of my favorite books. This book teaches a very important lesson to any child who has a favorite food. In the story Frances eats only bread and jam, even though her mother prepares other foods for her. Eventually, Frances' mom stops preparing other foods for Frances and gives her only bread and jam, just as she likes. Frances is happy with this at first, but then grows sick of eating the same food for every meal while her friends and family are able to eat other foods. In the end Frances' mother gives her different foods for her lunch at school and Frances is happy again. I believe this story to be one that any elementary school aged child could relate to. The story tells children of the importance and enjoyment of eating a variety of foods. The pictures and text directly complement each other. The text is needed to tell the complete story, but the pictures enhance the story. Bread and Jam for Frances is a simple story that is easily followed by children. Children can read this story and relate to the realistic situation. This book captures the child's attention and finishes the story within the short attention span of a child. The illustrations of this book contributed to my choosing it as a favorite. Frances' facial expressions in the illustrations help children easily identify her feelings throughout the story. In the beginning Frances is very happy, but as she gets tired of eating bread and jam a frown appears on her face. When Frances becomes very upset that she can only eat bread and jam, she cries. At the end when Frances' mother offers Frances other foods Frances is very happy again. The pictures are very soft and friendly. The colors are engaging and follow the story directly. The style of the illustrator follows the style of the author. Neither the text or the pictures overpower the other; there is a complementary style between the two. I believe this book to be very appealing and appropriate for an elementary age child."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"In 1964 Russell Hoban wrote, and his wife Lillian illustrated, a charming little book entitled \\"Bread and Jam For Frances\\". Already an established character in such books as \\"Bedtime For Frances\\" and \\"A Baby Sister For Frances\\", this next story observes Frances as she stubbornly believes that she would like to eat only bread and jam, rather than any other food. Her parents oblige her willingly, and Frances comes to learn that a person should expand their tastes once in a while. The book is charming and dated only in the slightest of ways. Yes, Frances only wears skirts and dresses. Yes, Mother is the only one making the meals. But this is such a light happy little tale that these flaws are easily overcome. Lillian Hoban's illustrations are as cute as can be. The story itself is amusing (Frances often singing little songs to the food she dislikes out of earshot of her parents). Sometimes you just want to read your kids something that doesn't involve huge battles, gross out jokes, or didactic morals. If that's you, then allow me to introduce the perfect solution.... a little number I like to call \\"Bread and Jam For Frances\\"."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I read this book about twenty-eight years ago. Taught me that there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. I love it, and think of it often. A great gift for any child."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Fussy eater Frances only wants to eat bread and jam (whichactually sounds pretty good right now) - but she's confused when herparents actually give in to her wishes and allow her to eat as shepleases.These are wonderful books, the lessons are taught kindly and gently, and the illustrations are delightful."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"The irrepressible badger Frances, now an older sister to baby Gloria, decides that she likes the predictability of her favorite meal, bread and jam, and refuses to eat anything else. In a gentle way, Mother Badger shows Frances just how boring life is when you always eat the same thing. For fans of Frances, it is as much of a treat as the other books. For example, Frances's thoughts on the drawbacks of eggs is laugh-out-loud funny. However, do be forewarned that the gender roles in this book are even more traditional than usual with Mother Badger whipping up every meal and Father Badger praising her for it. It actually doesn't bother me because at least the father is appreciative, but I thought readers should know what to expect."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"This wonderful book has quickly become one of my children's favorites, and they regularly ask to hear it at bedtime. Frances is a cute little badger who has a passion for bread and jam; so much so that she refuses to eat anything else.Breakfast, lunch, and dinner consist of the same thing; a slice of bread with some jam spread on top. Frances refuses to try the other meals her mother makes, such as veal cutlets or soft-boiled eggs. She just happily eats her bread and jam and skips rope. Eventually, her mother and father only fix her bread and jam, while they eat other types of food. Soon, Frances is asking why she is not getting such things as spaghetti and meatballs, while the other family members are. Finally, Frances agrees to try the other food, and much to her surprise, she enjoys it very much.This is a wonderful book for young children, and it provides them with a valuable lesson; too much of a good thing can turn out to be bad. The pictures are fun to look at, and the story is very entertaining. I can remember hearing this story when I was a child, and my own children have grown to love it just as much as I did. I highly recommend this great book. Your childen will surely enjoy hearing about Frances and her picky eating, and how with a little love and encouragment from her parents, she learns to try new things."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I remember this book from my childhood and thought I'd order it to indulge in a little nostalgia. It's such a great book for teaching children about variety and new experiences."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I loved Frances as a child, and now my children love these books too. But please know that the \\"I Can Read\\" editions are incomplete. For no discernible reason, a sentence here and there is snipped, making it feel a little choppy. It's still ok, but why not get the original?"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Like someone else mentioned, this I Can Read edition is abridged. They left out a sentence or two here and there... maybe to make it easier to read? Or maybe to save a few pennies on printing. Either way, it's unfortunate.Besides that, though, this is one of my favorite children's books ever. I'm going to send this one back and buy a different edition."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I bought Bread and Jam for Francis the first time 40 years ago for my daughter when she was little. She saved it over the years, but lost it in hurricane Katrina. Now with a 5 year old grandson, I decided it was time to buy it once again to delight the next generation. He loves the book - it has become one of his favorite bedtime stories. I recommend this for every child's library."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I like sending to my grandchildren.

I love this book; I love the illustrations, and was happy to find that it is still around."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I was disappointed that I couldn't find the original version of this book to buy on amazon, but this abridged version isn't a bad one. Our kids love this book and request it often. Having a picky eater in the house makes meals a struggle sometimes; it is cute to refer to Frances and how she realizes that variety in trying new foods makes life interesting! Great writing style and one of my favorite illustrations comes near the end if the book... How wonderful to see Frances pull out a decadent lunch at school (wish I had lunches like that) along with a nice tablecloth and small vase of flowers! If only!!

My aunt gave it to me right around the time I started kindergarten. I loved the feisty heroine and her stubbornness, as well as all the detailed descriptions of food. I think that this book contributed to my love of food in general. As a child, I had so much fun making lunches like Frances had at the end, with all different types of food. I even used to write my own food descriptions to be like Frances. To this day, I still remember most of the text. It's a great gift for any little girl or boy, especially for those who are interested in talking about food."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I read this book as an elementary school child and never forgot it. I was so happy to purchase the book for my child. It is a wonderful book that is good for young readers because it uses words and phrases that are not common today. I think that is important because todays world of TV and over use of slang has almost destroyed Americans use of english. I love any book that offers new words for children to add to their vocabulary in addition to a being marvelously entertaining read.

This is a gem."},{"Title":"Christ Before Creation: Introducing Christ and the Unseen Realm","review":"It is amazing to consider just how much Christ did before creation. It is almost as amazing that so few writers seem to have covered this subject. I already have all of Edwards' Chronicles of Creation and First-Century Diaries, so this rounds it out very nicely. It was awesome to be reminded once again just how Christ sees me as a part of His Bride, in eternity past AND future. Definitely destined to become a classic."},{"Title":"Christ Before Creation: Introducing Christ and the Unseen Realm","review":"How can predestination and free-will coexist? Whether you're on the camp of 'once saved, always saved' or 'salvation can be lost', read this book and you'll rejoice!When Jesus said, \\"I'm the Alpha and the Omega\\", He didn't mean \\"I'm the Alpha first, and later on I'll be the Omega.\\" He's both Alpha and Omega, First and the Last, Beginning and the End, ALL at the same time! Read this book and you'll understand why.After reading this book, my faith level shot through the roof! I can't help but kept saying, \\"My God, You're simply AWESOME!\\"This book will definitely bring you into a higher understanding of the magnificence of God!"},{"Title":"Christ Before Creation: Introducing Christ and the Unseen Realm","review":"Gene Edwards has a very interesting view of the spiritual world. I have been leaning towards this view and it was refreshing to find an author who, in general, agrees. As in all areas of the generally \\"unknown\\" there are a few things one might question in his writings. But, due to my own life experiences he has touched on a reality that I believe we all \\"feel\\" but don't understand. I would encourage anyone to travel down the path of his writings."},{"Title":"Christ Before Creation: Introducing Christ and the Unseen Realm","review":"Anything written by Gene Edwards is always a treasure to enjoy!

A wonderful story, by a masterful storyteller!"},{"Title":"Christ Before Creation: Introducing Christ and the Unseen Realm","review":"This is as usual a good book by Gene Edwards.

The author gave a lot of thought to this subject,the actual word count is very short."},{"Title":"Christ Before Creation: Introducing Christ and the Unseen Realm","review":"This book was not what I was looking for. I was hoping to see unrecognized scriptural based descriptions of heaven, Christ and the invisable realm, but it seem more fictional, with 2 to 3 scriptures references scattered between between one and two page chapters. I think I would not have been so disappointed if I knew in advance that the book was primarily from the author's imagination."},{"Title":"Political Deliverance","review":"This book by Edward Leo Lyman is a telling discourse of how The Morman people abandon a princible they held so sacred and true to obtain Statehood. I thought it pretty interesting how the pressure from the government and a lack of faith on their part forced them to give up one of their highest princibles. Very informative!"},{"Title":"Stepford Wives","review":"This is a thought provoking, tautly written novella. A gem of suspense, it was first published in the early nineteen seventies and in 1975 went on to become a popular movie of the same name, starring Katherine Ross. It was remade again in 2004 with Nicole Kidman in the role previously played by Katherine Ross.The story is very simple but gripping and well written. Joanna Eberhart moves to the seemingly bucolic town of Stepford with her husband, Walter, and two children, leaving behind the dangers of big city living. An independent, assertive, intelligent, and creative woman, Joanna epitomizes the newly liberated women of the nineteen seventies. Looking for like souls with whom to become friends, she seeks out some of the other married women of the town, only to find that they are all uniformly addicted to housework, give their husbands complete obeisance, are made up to the gills, and have figures courtesy of maidenform.Joanna manages to find several like minded women such as herself. Yet, when they, too, become addicted to housework after having a romantic weekend alone with their respective husbands, Joanna becomes convinced that the town's Men's Association has hatched a sinister plot to change all the wives of Stepford into submissive Barbie dolls. Will Joanna manage to escape the fate of the rest of the Stepford wives? Read the book and find out.
