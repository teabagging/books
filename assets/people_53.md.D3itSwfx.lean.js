After having actually read it, I cannot understand why. Bradbury's characters, by and large, are pretty thin. That might be forgivable if he were writing in order to set a mood or make some kind of interesting point, but his writing style tries too hard to be poetic, and his ideas are mostly pretty trite. There are quite a lot of books that cover colonial insenstivity, nuclear war, and the supposed meaninglessness or self-destructiveness of modern life, and Bradbury's doesn't stick out from the crowd.This could be partly because the book doesn't fully cohere. I know that it is supposed to be a connection of linked short stories, not a traditional novel, but Bradbury seems to have frequently changed his mind about the most fundamental aspects of his version of Mars. I might not mind this if I thought he was trying to make a point by presenting radically different kinds of Martians at different times, but that wouldn't be consistent with his somewhat superifical handling of many of the other ideas in the book.There are several stories in The Martian Chronicles that do succeed, and I suspect I would have been more impressed with it if I had read it when it came out. I can certainly see how it could seem impressive to someone who had read little or no science fiction, or literature in general. Still, it didn't have a lasting effect on me, and it looks pretty anemic next to, say, Ursula K. LeGuin or Gene Wolfe. If you are new to science fiction, I would refer you to one of those authors, or to a number of others. They have more interesting things to say than Bradbury."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The praise on this typewriter drek is hard to fathom. To damn it with faint praise myself, it is a darn good try from a collegeless Mechanics Illustrated fan born right after WWI. It shows no knowledge of science itself; could Bradbury explain the rocket equation, for instance? Written right after the a-bomb was dropped on the world's consciousness, and the mainly white GIs returned home to start the Baby Boom, what it does show is a thinly disguised attempt at political satire, using &quot;Mars&quot; as a stage prop. The cartoonish satirization of humanity, 50 years later, seems silly. Yes, Ray, there were changes in society, and the year 2005 doesn't look like the year the world will burn, sorry. If it does, there won't be any people on Mars trying to jump on rockets and get fried either. You did much better at satire in F451. In TMC, though, why did you end the last chapter with the &quot;new Noah of Mars&quot; solemnly burning all of Earth's books? Next thing you know, they'll be burning people up on Mars :) The quaint descriptions of Bradbury's smalltown life would have done better in a 'real' novel, say, about a lawyer named Finch fighting racial prejudice :) In sum, don't read this unless somebody really gives you a reason, because it's hoplessly obsolete."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is a book I have in my must read book, but...

As expected, macabre and unusual short stories. More internal consistency would have help readability though."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is a group of stories that range from melodrama to quirky comedy, and everything in between.I read this book at a slow pace, usually two or three of the stories a day. I think this was a good decision on my part as it helped to really demonstrate how drastically the stories change from the beginning of the novel to the end.The quality of each story, just like their genres, range greatly. There are the very good ones such as 'Ylla', 'The Earth Man', and 'The Third Expedition; and there are the very bad ones such as 'Usher II', 'The Off Season', and 'The Silent Towns'. The only thing that seems to tie all of these tales together is their shared inherent aberrancy.The book has a sloppy nature to it at times. Also, certain things were seemingly assumed, while they should have been explained in much more detail. The most notable example of this is the war on Earth and the mass migration from Mars. It all just seems very empty.Overall, it was a very flawed book, and at times became highly confusing. Some of the stories were quite interesting, so it is a shame that the good is overshadowed by the bad. I would suggest reading it if you're a huge fan of Ray Bradbury, but if you don't like it from the beginning don't bother continuing, as it goes down hill very progressively."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"These tales represent quite an imaginative collection of storytelling by Bradbury. The Martian Chronicles is a series of short stories which loosely interlink and tell of Man's arrival to Mars in the distant year of 1999 (Bradbury wrote book in 1941), with the stories continuing on chronologically until the year 2026. They depict Man's behaviors and emotions as humans make discoveries on the planet. Within the stories are human interactions with the Martians, and the subsequent problems they create when they try to project their culture onto the new land. While many of the stories are told from Man's point of view, one consistent theme is Man's ignorance to his new surroundings.The stories have an ironic, underlying spooky approach to them; they don't really reach out and grab you, but they slightly get under your skin enough to make you feel uncomfortable. Evident within the tales is a Twilight Zone-like feel, where you are given some irregular settings and conflicts, and sometimes slight twists at the conclusion. Most of all, these stories make you think about existence, and the possibilities, and man's sometimes overzealous nature with exploration.Here are some of the stories in the collection, and a quick synopsis:\\"The Third Expedition\\"-- a group of explorers led by Captain Black arrive on Mars only to find that it looks like their old home town and is inhabited by friends and family from the past. While many of his shipmates are thrilled with joy to see their loved ones, Black is cautious and skeptical about what is happening, believing this too good to be true.\\"The Silent Towns\\"--A man, Walter Gripp, seems to be the only one left on the planet. He seeks everywhere to find someone, anyone, but it seems that fate will leave him isolated. That is, until he finds one woman, Genevieve, to talk to. However, he realizes there is a twist to finding the only person left, it seems...\\"Usher II\\"--This tale pays homage to great literary writing, especially Edgar Allan Poe. A man, Stenghal, builds a macabre house, which he dubs The House of Usher. Stenghal has built the house as sort of a tribute to all literary legends and the classics of the past, but with stuffed animals, and other bizarre features, it is straight out Poe's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher.\\" Literature and books have been extinguished, as have many other forms of entertainment, such as films. A man comes to tear down the house, and to report Stenghal, but slowly finds himself in the middle of an Edgar Allan Poe story.\\"The Long Years\\" - Captain Wilder and his crew come to the red planet to find Mr. Hathaway and his family alone. Wilder notices something out of place about Hathaway's wife and kids--they haven't aged! He sends one of his crewmembers to find out what the truth is.\\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\"--A haunting isolation has crept over the planet. Although a house's appliances and mechanisms live on--- the clock ticks, the alarm sounds, a mechanical voice is overhead--the house is, in fact, lifeless. This is a story that is quite apocalyptical in its setting, and seems to depict the destruction forces of humanity...\\"The Million Years Picnic\\"--This is the final story in the book, and tries to tie all of man's encounters and lessons together. A family appears to be headed towards a picnic as they pass the desolate, dead towns of the planet, but the father reveals his true reasons for taking his family on the excursion, and reveals the truth of the Earth's destruction. The story is a commentary on starting over.Over all, a worthwhile collection of stories, and definitely a must for science fiction or Bradbury fans."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I was hoping for a whole lot more than what I got with this one. In some ways I enjoyed the book, but in others I couldn't wait to be done with it.The Martian Chronicles really can't be considered anything but a very loose collection of short stories, many of which were published separately in magazines. In fact we only see one character who appears in more than one chapter, thus making for the characterization to be weak with no bond or familiarization to be had.On the plus side Bradbury can definitely write well. You see his wit behind the social commentary of the post atomic bomb era and the perception of a interplanetary race as a result. Witty and fun at times, you couldn't help but begin to enjoy the characters. Of course the chapter ended a few pages later and you never saw that character again. His description at times is great: \\"...her eyes were like two immense eggs stuck into a white mess of bread dough.\\"In the end the short stories pieced together a semblance to a story and you can come away from it with a feeling of mild satisfaction as you read the last chapter. I would have enjoyed this much more if he would have developed the characters a little more, explored individual time periods (as each chapter is a different month/year) and fleshed out a more coherent plot line. In the end I appreciate Bradbury and would like to read more of his, but I wouldn't recommend The Martian Chronicles.2.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I love this best of all Bradbury's books.

If 1950's America would have had the rocket ships, and an inhabitable destination, planetary colonization would probably have gone very much like this. As the text says:\\" They were coming with small dreams or large dreams or none at all. But a government finger pointed from four-color posters in many towns:THERE'S WORK FOR YOU IN THE SKY: SEE MARS!\\" Heck, I'd go right now if I could._His Mars is the essense of the wild frontier: the path finders, the pioneers, the pilgrims, the homesteaders, the townsfolk, the eccentrics- and then the bureaucrats.... Bradbury's Martians are haunting and tragic- and fare about as well as the Plains Indians in the face of \\"progress.\\"_Actually, this story parallels the story of American West a little too closely- especially when it talks of the \\"silent towns.\\" If you've ever seen the dead and dieing farm towns of the plains you know what I mean.A word of caution- many \\"hard\\" science fictions fans do not like Bradbury. That is because he is a poet and a magician weaving a rare, ephemeral atmosphere. Do you have the sensitivity and the soul to follow?"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"An inspirational look into the future is what best describes this sci-fi classic. It is not written like a normal book, but rather like a journal. It chronicles the human colonization of Mars. In the book, man conquers the martians the second he arrived. But who conquered who? Mars did, with its vast mountains and anchient cities that overwhelemed man. The wonders of human civilization become plunders, as Earth is erradicated by war. Mars becomes the new home for man. Is this a sci-fi book? Some may say yes, but I think it is something much deeper than those usual, cheap, garbage, sci-fi books that are for some reason so popular among the mainstream society. It is an interesting look inside human life. Our good and bad side. Ray Bradbury is a very original writer. It is no surprise that he is one of the best sci-fi writers of all time. I truly enjoyed his writing. Although this is one of his best books, I would advise that you read Farenheit 451 because it is also a true classic. No sci-fi fan should not miss this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Not so much a novel as a collection of interrelated short stories arranged so as to form a somewhat cohesive narrative, The Martian Chronicles (as Ray Bradbury says) also isn't so much science fiction as fantasy set on Mars but with a clear allegorical-thematic connection to real-life, present-day issues. Most of the stories are quite good, such as \\"Usher II\\" which anticipates Fahrenheit 451 with a story of censorship and resistance to totalitarian bureaucracy, as is the book taken as a whole.The one major issue that is a little hard to swallow, even on the books own terms, is why practically all the human settlers of Mars, many of whom left Earth precisely to escape the threat of war, would return to Earth as soon as war actually breaks out. Bradbury sort of attempts to explain this, but doesn't really succeed.Still, the Martian Chronicles is a classic of fantastic literature, a virtuoso display of Bradbury's talents, and well worth reading. If you've yet to experience it, get it now!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian ChroniclesRay Bradbury's recent passing created an opportunity to reread some of his stories and novels. No, I don't like all that Bradbury wrote, but his whimsical, lyrical style always attracted me. He could create a world of \\"Firemen\\" in Fahrenheit 451 or the mysterious characters of \\"The Illustrated Man\\" and leave me entranced.The Martian Chronicles was no exception!First Impressions:The book itself is a loosely-knit series of short stories, one leading to the next, in date order in the writer's 21st century future. Here we have Earth that is looking towards Mars as a haven from the brewing atomic wars and rumors of such. What impressed me was the stylized characters and fleshed-out civilizations and how both Martian and Earthman deal with each other, as well as their own jealousies and prejudices.Stories!I won't bore the reader with a mini-review of each tale, but the few that I really liked involved some of the crazy characters - one an off-kilter man, Spender, part of a crew from the Fourth Expedition, who didn't want to see Mars commercialized as he looked upon the dead Martian civilization (destroyed by Man's diseases - holy War of the Worlds!) and decides to kill off his own men and keep the planet pristine! That plan does not go over well with Captain Wilder. The darkness of the story and its clear criticism of colonialism were enticing to me.The other story I really liked involved the last colonists on Mars (the rest being called back to Earth because of atomic war) who missed the last rocket, and gets lonely. Far off, he hears a phone ring. He finally finds who rang it, hoping for some female company, but the guy isn't so lonely that he does not have standards!Finally, the tale of a Martian and an Earth worker, both going to a party driving in their respective vehicles and meet each other on a lonely road - 10,000 years apart! Crazy.Bottom Line: Most of the stories flow well one to the other. Ray does reflect some of the 1940s' style prejudices of the time which may put off modern readers, but if you read Ray's poetic style in its historic context, you too will see that a lot of his criticism and satire is still quite relevant.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"As a writer, I thought this book was everything I expected and more.

As a child reading The Martian Chronicles for the first time, I was always puzzled at how all of these different stories on Mars could take place in the same universe. With CRT's rendition, however, all the pieces fell into place, and I listened, captivated, from the moment Earth first made contact with Mars to the moment long after the colonists have returned home.The choice to include Usher II was a little unusual -- it doesn't quite fit the rest of the stories in tone -- but the story is superbly told, and a joy to listen to, so I forgive the slight shift in tone for its telling.Fans of Bradbury should buy this immediately! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Originally posted at FanLit.The Martian Chronicles is a collection of Ray Bradbury's stories about the human colonization of Mars which were previously published in the pulp magazines of the late 1940s. The stories are arranged in chronological order with the dates of the events at the beginning of each story. In the first edition of The Martian Chronicles, published in 1950, the events took place in a future 1999-2027, but a reprinted 1997 edition pushes all events forward to 2030-2057. Because it's a story collection, The Martian Chronicles has an episodic feel which has been made more fluid by connecting the stories with short vignettes, similar to the structure of Bradbury's collection The Illustrated Man.In the first story, \\"Rocket Summer,\\" we visit a small town in Ohio while the first human exploratory spaceship takes off for Mars. Bradbury explains in the introduction to The Martian Chronicles that this small-town mid-America feel was influenced by Sherwood Anderson's novel Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life which Bradbury admired and hoped to emulate.The next two stories, \\"Ylla\\" and \\"The Summer Night,\\" show us what the Martians are like. They're humanoid in form with brown skin and round yellow eyes. Like humans, they live in houses and towns, eat and drink, sleep, age, read books, study science, desire love, become jealous and irritable, and commit murder. (I find it amusing that the Martians have the same kinds of depressing marriages we see in Bradbury's stories set on Earth.) But the Martians are telepathic and the humans' approach is causing them to quote our poetry, sing our songs, and adopt other aspects of human culture without understanding why.The first spaceship was unsuccessful, so a second expedition was launched a few months later (it seems reasonable for Bradbury to expect that by 1999 we'd be able to get to Mars a lot faster than we actually can). In \\"The Earth Men\\" we learn the fate of this crew and we learn that Martians, just like Americans in 1950, have to live with bad psychiatry and insane asylums. Stephen Hoye, the narrator of Blackstone Audio's 2009 version of The Martian Chronicles, was particularly brilliant with this story.Next comes \\"The Taxpayer\\" in which an Ohio man is trying to get on the third expedition to Mars (the second one failed). This very short vignette tells us that things are going badly on Earth and that an atomic war is expected in about two years. \\"The Third Expedition\\" (originally published in Planet Stories as \\"Mars is Heaven!\\") describes what happens when the third doomed mission lands on Mars. This story doesn't quite work with the chronology of The Martial Chronicles because it portrays astronauts from 2030 growing up in the small Midwestern towns of early 20th century America. It also ironically highlights the biggest problem with The Martian Chronicles when one of the astronauts asks \\"Do you think that the civilizations of two planets can progress at the same rate and evolve in the same way?\\" Clearly the astronaut doesn't think that's possible, but in these early stories, Bradbury's Martian culture is just too much like ours. Even so, \\"The Third Expedition\\" is a clever little horror story and one of my favorites in the collection.\\"And the Moon Be Still as Bright\\" is the story of the fourth, finally successful, expedition to Mars. The Martians have mostly died of chickenpox -- humans, in our blundering way, have inadvertently killed them off. Most of the men of the expedition don't care, eager to begin exploration and colonization, but Captain Wilder and an archaeologist named Spender regret that humans have destroyed such a beautiful civilization, like they destroy everything else they touch. There's a lot of social commentary about 1940s American culture in this story.The next several stories are about the rapid spread of humanity on Mars. \\"The Settlers\\" and \\"The Shore\\" describe the type of people who came to Mars from Earth, \\"The Green Morning\\" follows a Johnny Appleseed type of character who plants trees to increase oxygen levels, and \\"The Locusts\\" and \\"Interim\\" describes how men and women made Mars look just like another Earth. In \\"Night Meeting,\\" we learn that \\"even time is crazy up here\\" when a colonist from Earth meets a Martian who seems to be in a different time-stream. This story also reminds us that civilizations both rise and fall and that perhaps it's best that we don't know the future of our own civilization.I especially liked the next story, \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" in which a group of missionaries prepare to bring the Gospel to the Martians. They don't know what the Martians will look like and must consider how a different culture, and even a different anatomy, might dictate the types of sin a society is prone to. (It seems unlikely that the missionaries don't know what the Martians look like by now, but we must keep in mind that The Martian Chronicles is a story collection, not a novel with a continuous story.) When the missionaries meet the Martians, they have even more theological questions to deal with. \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" has a beautiful ending.Male explorers and settlers have been the main characters so far but \\"The Musicians,\\" a story original to The Martian Chronicles, shows us what boys do for fun on Mars, \\"The Wilderness\\" features two women who are getting ready to emigrate from Earth, and \\"The Old Ones\\" focuses briefly on the elderly. Those first courageous men won't be forgotten, though; in \\"The Naming of Names\\" we learn that they've been immortalized -- many places on Mars have been named after them. These human names, and other industrial-sounding names, have replaced the nature-focused names used by the Martians.In \\"Usher II\\" Bradbury returns to one of his favorite pet peeves -- book burning. A man who has left Earth to get away from the \\"moral climate\\" police is angry that they've now shown up on Mars. To get back at them for outlawing Edgar Allen Poe's work, he uses his fortune to build his own House of Usher and he invites them all to a party. This story is entertaining, but I'm not sure that Bradbury makes his case. After what happens, I think the moral climate police will feel they have even more grounds for banning Poe.\\"The Martian\\" is a terrific horror story which shows us what becomes of one telepathic Martian when humans, full of painful memories and wanting to start over, arrive on his planet. This is one of the best stories in The Martian Chronicles.The next few stories, \\"The Luggage Store,\\" \\"The Off Season,\\" and \\"The Watchers,\\" tell of the nuclear war on Earth that was predicted in earlier stories. It can be heard on the radio and seen from Mars and soon the colonists get an urgent message: \\"Come home.\\" And so they go back to Earth.\\"The Silent Towns\\" tells the story of Walter and Genevieve, living hundreds of miles apart, who assume they're the last humans left on Mars. This story is entertaining, but highlights the rampant sexism so often found in the science fiction written for pulp magazines. Where does Walter decide is the most likely place to find a woman? The beauty shop. (Genevieve, what the heck are you doing in a beauty shop on a deserted planet?) Then, after driving for hundreds of miles to find her, Walter rejects and runs away from the last woman on Mars because she's overweight. Really.Bradbury is back to doing what he does best with the next two stories. \\"The Long Years\\" tells of Hathaway, one of the crew of the Fourth Expedition, who stayed on Mars with his family when the rest of the colonists left. When Captain Wilder, his former commander, returns to Mars after exploring other planets in the solar system, he finds Hathaway and wonders how his wife and kids stayed young while Hathaway kept aging normally.\\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" returns us to Earth where the atomic war has wiped out most of the people. An automated house (common in Bradbury's stories) still stands in California, going about its daily routines as if the family who lived there is still alive. This story was inspired by Sara Teasdale's post-apocalyptic poem \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" in which we see nature taking back the Earth after humanity is destroyed. This imagery in this excellent story is chilling and unforgettable. Unforgettable.After all of the destruction that humans brought upon themselves (we nearly obliterated the population of two planets), the last story, \\"The Million-Year Picnic,\\" offers a bit of hope as two families escape the devastated Earth and plan to start over. To ensure that humans don't make the same mistakes we made before, they burn books, maps, files and anything else that contains the sorts of ideas that may have led to our destruction. (A little ironic, I think. Apparently, Bradbury thought it was noble to burn some of our literature.)Whenever I read Bradbury, I'm struck by his lofty visions, in the early 20th century, for future technological developments and space exploration. He envisioned a degree of achievement by the 21st century that we're not even close to yet. However, at the same time, it seems that he didn't foresee how much American social culture would change even during his lifetime. Thus, in most of his stories set in the future we find the juxtaposition of robots and rockets with the same sexism and racism experienced in 1950. Fortunately, the nuclear world war that he and many SF writers imagined has also not happened. Perhaps we can give Bradbury some of the credit for warning us so vividly.The Martian Chronicles is some of Ray Bradbury's most-loved work and foundational reading for science fiction fans. If you've never read it, or haven't read it recently, I encourage you to try Blackstone Audio's version.Leaving behind a world on the brink of destruction, man came to the red planet and found the Martians waiting, dreamlike. Seeking the promise of a new beginning, man brought with him his oldest fears and his deepest desires. Man conquered Mars and in that instant, Mars conquered him. The strange new world with its ancient, dying race and vast, red-gold deserts cast a spell on him, settled into his dreams, and changed him forever. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster enthralls, delights, and challenges us with his vision, starkly and stunningly exposing our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Although I still have my Bantam paperback copy of The Martian Chronicles that I bought in 1969 for 75 cents, I thought I would give my library's copy some circulation and just check it out and read it. After looking through the Table of Contents and comparing it to my old copy, I realized that this edition was a revision of the original. The chronology was moved farther out in time. In the original, it began in 1999 and ended in 2026. This version begins in 2030 and ends in 2057. References to specific years in stories have also been changed and there has also been a replacement. The original edition had a story, \\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\" that was intended to address the implications of journeys to Mars on the oppression of African Americans, as more of them decide to simply leave their oppression and second class status and start over again on Mars. The story is very dated and, with its frequent usage of the n-word, could be seen as very offensive, even though I know Bradbury was trying to make a counterargument against racism. I believe he was wise to replace that story because, despite its best intentions, it doesn't really work and even though it's set in the year 2003, he is clearly describing the Jim Crow era.The replacement story is \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" a leftover Martian story that was originally included in his next collection, The Illustrated Man. This story deals with a pair of priests on Mars and their efforts to determine if Martians have moral consciences, can commit sin and can be sent to Hell or Heaven. It is probably a bit more successful. For one thing, it actually deals with Mars and Martians. There is also a new story (1972 copyright), \\"The Wilderness,\\" which transfers the customs of the mail-order brides going out West on the Conestoga wagon to Mars.All of this is prefatory to a re-reading of this classic work of fantasy and myth (Bradbury persisted in denying that it was science fiction). In his new introduction (1997) Bradbury sees a parallel with Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio. I have still not read Winesburg, Ohio although I know enough about it to see that the structure is similar, interrelated stories bound by a common theme or setting and, in Bradbury's case at least, with a few recurring characters. The whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts.Like almost all of his stories from the 40's and 50's, the stories in this book valorize a mythical small town Midwest past i.e. the era of Bradbury's childhood and even earlier in the 20th century. Characters fly to Mars but still carry this idyllic past in their minds. The telepathic Martians even use this behavior as a weapon against the unsuspecting space travelers. Ultimately, however, the Martians are a dying race and, from the extent of their resistance against these Earthly invaders, they relinquish their planet to the humans. There are many parallels with the Native Americans and their reaction to the European invaders become colonists. Meanwhile, the state of the planet back home is dire indeed. Colonists who have only resided on Mars for a few years and have not had time to form attachments to their new world seek desperately to return to their home, no matter how close to destruction it may be.Like much of Bradbury's speculative fiction and science fiction in general, there are prophetic touches--wars that become progressively more destructive with advanced technological weaponry, commercialization and entrepreneurism expanded to a new setting, mechanized home appliances, culminating in a home that literally runs itself after the inhabitants have abandoned it (\\"There Will Come Soft Rains,\\" still impressive as the only completely character-less story I have read).Taken individually, the stories range in quality from mediocre to outstanding. Cumulatively, they acquire a power and epic scope that have earned this book deserved praise. The anachronisms would have remained whether Bradbury had updated the time frame or left them as they were. That is always the risk a writer runs when setting a futuristic fantasy in a future that has not been set distant enough to be overrun by a very different reality e.g. time-bound works such as 1984 and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Nonetheless, as a product of its time, the post-World War II era of the late 1940's, The Martian Chronicles has earned its classic status. As I probably said in my October Country review, the stories taken at face value are often not tremendously impressive, but Bradbury's language and inventive vision bring them distinction as literary works."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I'm not much of reader besides the required books from school and what';s on the internet. However I have read a few books I like, like All the King's Men, Arrowsmith, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the main Tolkein books which were actually read to us kids by my father.However while reading the Martian Chronicles, I remember thinking, wow, this is a good book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I bought it for my eleven year old and he has listened to it every niight until he finished it tonight. A great presentation of a terrific book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I first read this book back when it was still called \\"The Silver Locusts\\". A set of short stories about Martians - a story form of which Ray Bradbury is a master.This is science fiction at its best. Interesting, profound, appealing to all ages and timeless."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"If I were to write a jacket blurb for this book, it would go something like this:\\"Ray Bradbury does it again with another stellar title. This is a novel of science fiction, mystery, beauty, and conflict. Starting with the first rockets to Mars, Bradbury tells the story of Mankind's spreading and fleeing to and from the planet. It is a great story and is not only for science fiction fans but also for anyone who enjoys a good book.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I picked it up thinking it wouldn't be to amazing, but once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. It isn't just another science fiction novel; it's much deeper than that. I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friends. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't willing to read and understand this, because it's a bit higher then comfortable reading level for me, but it's really not that hard. Any extra effort you put into reading this book is generously rewarded.There really is no major character in this book, because the same person rarely appears in multiple chapters. It is a book of short stories, so this is understandable. I picked Captain Wilder of the Fourth Expedition as the \\"most\\" main character for two reasons. One, he plays an important part in the colonization of Mars as the captain of the first successful expedition to the planet (there were actually 3 attempts before his success). Two, he is one of the few characters to appear in more than one chapter. I think he is somewhat similar to Tobias MacIvey from A Land Remembered in several aspects. They are both leaders, Tobias of his Cattle Company and Wilder of the Fourth Expedition and the mission to the outer planets, and they are both peaceful but powerful. They rarely fight anyone, and when they do, they never started it, they have a good reason to be in it, and they usually win. They do differ, because Tobias is always trying to make a living and drive cattle and get money, making him a bit more economic-minded than Wilder, who wanted to preserve the natural Martian landscape as it was when they first landed, making him a bit more conservative. I believe these two characters would get along fine. They never pick fights with anyone, so I can't see why they would with each other. If there was any interaction, I think it would be cooperation.There are many conflicts of all different shapes and sizes in this book, so it is hard to determine the most significant one. I think one of the most major ones is between man and his fellow man. There are many examples of this throughout the book, from one on one struggles to gang fights to full scale wars. The largest of these is an atomic war on earth that destroys the entire continent of Australia in the first blow. Right after that, everyone is called home from Mars and only a handful is left. The book shows no clear resolution to this at the end. As one character puts it near the end of the book, \\"I take it most of Earth's a shambles, but the war goes on.\\"One theme of this book is man's nature to ruin beautiful things, especially natural beauty like that of Earth and Wars. Near the middle of the book there is a small chapter who wants to go to mars on a rocket because he is afraid of an \\"atom war\\". Later in the book, we have that atomic war on Earth and actually destroy the entire continent of Australia, among other things. With mars, there is a chapter devoted to that too. It says \\"The rockets came like locusts, swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke. And from the rockets ran men with hammers to beat the strange world into a shape the was familiar to the eye to bludgeon away all the strangeness, their mouths fringed with nails so they resembled steel-toothed carnivores, spitting them into their swift hands as they hammered up frame cottages and scuttled over roofs with shingles to blot out the eerie stars and fit green shades to pull against the night.\\" And this is exactly what we do to mars. We kill off the Martian race, and then use their ancient cities for target practice. We then bulldoze what remains and build a city of steel on a once beautiful metropolis. This theme is easily applicable to real life. Basically, the life lesson is to appreciate natural beauty instead of destroying it. That's a moral many people could use."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Now I know where Rod Serling got the idea for \\"The Twilight Zone.\\" I listened to an audiobook of this, and was an excellent experience, and it had the added value of being a favorite from my youth. These stories focus on a series of American expeditions to Mars. However, it is a different Mars for each group of astronauts, in some cases anyway. Certain stories refer back to previous ones, others seem to stand alone. The planet sometimes has the same features in different stories. Each time it is a dreamlike experience, and one that seems to harken back to the small town midwest or west. There are Martians, but they vary from story to story. In each piece, you get the feeling that humanity has journeyed into space to confront some sort of inner space - loneliness, for example.Bradbury plays with time and space to create little stages, settings for his vignettes about commercialization and race relations and alienation. Like a lot of great science fiction, \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" deals with the issues of the present in an imagined future. Bradbury's writing still possesses a good deal of its power today. These stories feature classic American motifs - square-jawed, masculine heroes, simple dialogue, the struggle of man against nature - yet these elements are twisted into strange shapes that, despite being a little corny, are still fascinating."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I bought this recent edition of Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" as a gift, having enjoyed my copy long ago. But I looked through it and found, comparing this to my older book, one story eliminated and two new ones added. So it was an education and extra bit of entertainment for me as well as the recipient. The \\"dates\\" of the various chronicles have been updated, too, since the older edition had us landing on Mars and setting up colonies in the 1990s. It's still a great read."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book is better than the 1980s movie. Parts of the original story, that could have made the movie great, are not cut out. The story not only deals with interplanetary exploration; it also deals with interplanetary racism, murder, bigotry and conquest. Especially the idiocy of the first earth expeditions. A good read!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Originally issued in 1950, Ray Bradbury's \\"Martian Chronicles\\" consists of 27 short stories previously published by him in the late-1940s in various sci fi mags. To give these \\"future history\\" vignettes a semblance of continuity for this compilation, Bradbury wrote linking narratives.Events begin on the cusp of the 21st Century with the first Mars mission and run to the year 2057, as a family departs from a nuclear war-ravaged Earth for the red planet, where they see Martians: their own reflections in a canal.CONTENTS--1.

Now almost at the new millenium the stories weren't cutting edge. I have seen more movies with more twisted spins and evil alien like planets. The book probably caused controversy when it was first published, and caused new topics to be discussed, but I don't think that in this day and age we should have to read something this old. The book did have good stories although they were not new ideas. Personally, I thought that the book would have been better twenty years ago when space exploration wasn't as common."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"overall, bradbury did a superb job of writing these science fiction stories. the stories are entertaining while still incorporating a bit of symbolism."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I guess I liked this book, but it was rather boring. I didn't see any real problems with it and I don't want to discourage people from reading it, but if you aren't in to space fantasies, you won't like it. I did like the story Usher II. It had some good refrences to Edgar Alan Poe and a good lesson on censorship. As a whole, though, I did not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book deals with almost every aspect of human nature, from Ylla to Usher II. If your looking for a nonstop thriller then this book isn't for you, but if you want a good book and your a sci fi fan then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This was one of the books that introduced me to science fiction, and it has stayed in my mind ever since. The writing is pure poetry, the tone is haunting, the work itself unforgettable. The tech may seem dated today, and the Martian setting a trifle naive, but it works anyway, largely because Bradbury doesn't attempt to measure the human heart with a slide rule. If you've never read SF, this is certainly one of the places to start. If you've grown up on the stuff, it's worth your while to reacquaint yourself with this small red gem."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This was a very intriguing and interesting book. There were some aggravating parts though. Bradbury, lacked a bit of vision when it came to how the roles of different people in society would change. Other than that it was a good book, and through some of his characters Bradbury was able to make some very interesting philosophical points that can be seen as still being true."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Wow! that's all I can say! This book was absolutely fantastic. At first I was confused because I was used to books that use the classical way of meeting a threshold guardian, then going into the underworld, etc. After it became apparent the way in which he wrote his books, it was easy and it just flowed, I couldn't put it down, and it was an absolute true classic! I recommend it to everyone who likes a little sci-fi!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I first picked up this book thinking it to be for ppl of a much younger age, but felt i should just read it because it was a &quot;classic&quot;. I was stunned. i read 10 pages one night, went to bed unsatisfied, and the next night finished the book. It layers science fiction, fantasy, philosophy, and poetry all into one amazing story. I had read excerpts of this book, such as there will come soft rains, as a child out of my english books, and in the context of the rest of the stories this means so much more to me. Another great part of this is Usher II, which rewards Edgar A. Poe fans with a story beyond description"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is an incredibly engrossing book. Bradbury's use of imagery is excellent. But I had to read the book several times before I got the gist of it. But it was well worth it. Read this!!!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I remember being given a tattered copy of this book at age 11 by my grandmother, who had bought it at some garage sale &quot;because I knew you liked space and all that&quot;. Little did she realize the tremendous gift that she bestowed upon me. I read the book twice and then raided the local library for every bit of Bradbury I could lay hands on. I became a Bradbuy fan overnight. My kind-hearted librarian looked quizically at me when I requested a map to look up Green Town, Illinois.At that young age I realized that this, my friends, is how you do it right. I have yet to read Mr. Bradbuy's equal in both power and poetry. There are many imitators, but only one original.If you have a young son, daughter, niece, nephew, or neighbor (or combination of the aforementioned) who are avid readers and are approximately 11 years of age, do yourself a favor and give this book as a special gift to encourage a lifelong love of this fine artist's work."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury's significant comments on society, through these stories, come wrapped in beautiful scenery, and interesting characters, especially given that they are short stories.Western Civilization is portrayed as arrogant, and the first astronauts/settlers on Mars are cowboys. The portrayal of the attitudes of the settlers and their lack of respect for Martian territory and people is closely linked, as a theme, to the colonization of North America and the displacement of the North American Indians...ignorant and careless.Another running theme is the danger of ignoring the arts in society...people forget how important literature and music and art really are, both as learning tools and as forms of expression.I, like some of the other critics here on this page, first read the book when i was in Fourth Grade, and didn't fully understand it. This is understandable as the ideas are somewhat complex. This year (18 yrs old) I read it again, and promptly recommended it to all of my friends and family. The Martian Chronicles is a relatively short read, and is also easy in that the stories are all short, too. This book could well be read either story-by-story, or all in one night. (the latter is not a good idea if you have school the next day. i speak from experience.)Read this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"A wonderful, insightful look into human nature told through a story of science fiction.

Bradbury took this book to the extreme to prove a point, the destructive nature of humans and he did a great job. But if you are looking for a science fiction book, with exact descriptions, and high tech nonsense try a different one."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"A wonderfully enthralling series of tales that relate in spirit only, The Martian Chronicles has been unfairly lumped in with Sci-Fi since it's initial release. Yes, it takes place (mostly) on mars, features rocketships and aliens and strange technology, but it is not at all a science fiction novel.No, this book is a novel about people. It's a novel about humanity, told through the eyes of the innocent, the alien, the lost, and the dying. It is a series of stories interelated by several themes. Do not expect an epic plot or a lovable manin character, because you will not find either here...instead, you will simply get a sometimes moving, sometimes thought provoking, and sometimes sad tale that will fill your vision for some time. Very recomended."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"It was hard for me to get into, but once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.

I think at that point, I basically got it, but I don't think I fully grasped all the nuances (I suppose I probably still don't grasp all the nuances of this book). I reread it recently, and by the time I was finished, I couldn't believe it. It is so beautifully written, and the end was so amazing, that I actually cried. I never cry at movies or books. I couldn't stop thinking about the book for three days. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read an amazing commentary on human nature, and the destruction that it brings."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I think that all of Bradbury's books that I have read are fantastic!

I am also reading now &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; which is also great so far."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Using references from other stories really brought me into this book. The story \`Usher II' really grabbed my attention.

I love it, and you will too"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The stories in the book &quot;Martian Chronicles&quot;, are okay, but they all say the same thing. They are all about a group of people going to Mars, someone going nuts, and killing everyone. My favorite short story in this book is was &quot;Usher II&quot; It was exciting and interesting, but on the other hand, the one i hated the most was &quot;The Earth Man&quot;. The reason i disliked &quot;The Earth Man&quot; was because by the fourth short story, I knew that every story is about the same thing. I think that the book could have been better if the stories weren't so similar. Overall, i would have not read this book if it was not required for me to do so."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"&quot;The Martian Chronicles,&quot; by Ray Bradbury, goes through a chronological progression of man colonizing Mars. Starting from the first expedition in 1999 and coming to an end when the colonists return to Earth in 2005. The colonists travel to Mars to escape the worsening situation on earth. However, the colonists discover that humans cannot stand to live away from their home, the place they have known all of their lives. They choose to return to earth, even if it means dying.Bradbury uses juxtaposition to compare the humans with the Martians. By doing this, the book provides a view on humanity and human nature. He even makes the Martians very human like. This makes the comparison easier. Bradbury gives the Martians the ability to manifest themselves as appearing as human beings. When the Martians appear as humans the real humans don't realize that they are Martians. This is a tool that ends up symbolizing human nature in the way that the Martians are protecting themselves and their land, just like humans. Another example is when a lone man travels a road at night and cross paths with a Martian. Their two worlds or times merge at that instant and both realize the similarities and differences they hold."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of the best-known science fiction writers of two generations ago. His distinctive soft-science style helped to offset science fiction's early flood of space operas and narrative physics homework problems. By some definitions it isn't even science fiction, but by any standard it is good story-telling. This collection of 28 stories is set on--or on the way to--Mars in the years 1999 to 2026. These years are the unknown future for readers and the writer looking forward from the 1950s.Interesting snippets of this future Martian history from the past include:In \\"Rocket Summer\\" a departing expedition to Mars causes a sudden climate change.In \\"The Summer Night\\" the poetry of Earth is heard on Mars for the first time.\\"The Third Expedition\\" lands on Mars and is greeted by familiar faces.Young boy explorers become \\"The Musicians\\" in an old Martian village.\\"The Luggage Store\\" sees a surge in travel after news of a war on Earth.The science in these stories is old, but this matters less than usual in dated science fiction because they aren't really about the science. Readers are left to decide whether the view of human beings from half a century ago may have become dated. It is worth reading these stories to wrestle with that very question."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is really one of my favorite books. I pick it up every year and reread it purely for the pleasure. If you like fantasy, this one's for you. I hope that someday, Peter Jackson will make a movie of this story. After what he did with Rings, I know he could do it justice that the old TV mini series did not. Check this one out. It was written a while back, so add some years to some of the dates mentioned and remember, it's a fantasy...for now!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I think this book was good for students who enjoys science fiction.

The stories should have been left as a collection if short stories. Come on people the book doesn't even tie the stories together. You have a story about one thing then you a little ditty about some guy planting trees. What does that matter, he never shows up in the story again and the trees aren't important. The best storey in the book is &quot;There will come soft rain&quot;. The only redemning quality of that story is that it has that dog who dies of radition poisoning, and then gets ate by those little rats. As for the worst story, I nominate the whole friggin' book. It was like pulling teeth, I've had a better time a church. It was a stream of meaningless stories, that should have never been put together.

There aren't any main characters, main plots, and only minute description. By now you're probably thinking: What the hell? Well, it would have been a mistake had I not read this book, for it was referred to me by a dear friend. There are so many numerous plot twists in this book the sheer size of it boggles ones minds, and tests ones imaginations. I can clearly hear the distinct sound of KoRn's 'Dead Bodies Everywhere&quot; echoing through my mind as there is the scene of the shootout with the renegade spaceman.

I'm really not a fan of books, but when I have to read them, it's nice to read a book that interests me, and catches my eye. The story that seemed most enticing to me was, Way up in the middle of the air. I was able to follow, and understand the meaning of this story. I liked the way it described the river of blacks on their mission to leave earth. I like the non-fiction books better than the fiction, because they seem more real. They are also able to give me more of a mental picture, and it's easier to follow something that has happened to me or ever could happen to myself.

In my short life this was book was one of the most boring books I have ever read. The over all text flowed like molasses in January: the paragraphs turned in to sentences, the sentences in to words , and words in to letters that eventually put me to sleep. The over all story didn't have a classic plot line , most of the characters only showed up in one (or very rarely two) chapters: I found it very challenging to relate or sympithize with what the characters felt over all. If a character was killed off early (or even late) in a chapter I could care less (and most of the characters were killed off). It was just a few short stories that us as eleventh graders shouldn't have been forced to read. The only reason I gave the book a two was because the over all point of view, of a self-distructing planet (EARTH), and our attempt to flee from: Racism (one of the over all themes), War (which did distroy earth) , and People who attempted to censor and control those who were not in power. The most interesting chapter in the book was USHER II: this chapter had the insite and the theme to censor people in any way was a bad and potentialy deadly practice. I believe that not all sensor ship is good but it's not all necessarialy bad: their has to be that comfort zone that society needs to survive. My least favorite chapter showed a post atomic earth and an empty mars : left on mars after after the atomic war on earth was no one but a lonely man and a fat woman; the theme entailed &quot;not even if you were the last person on the planet&quot;. I was offended by the way fat people were portraid, food crazed and pushy. The book was not only put together strangley, but worded in that intolerable way that made reading before bed time a quick nap and a long night of realy strange dreams. If your looking for A GREAT NARCOTIC this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":". . . when he wrote this, I would have thought, nice job Ray. But he was 30. Writers at this age should not be this naive.Admittedly, there are some interesting ideas in this book but it's too much for Bradbury to handle. He wants to address censorship, the American West and the treatment of the natives, racism, Nuclear War, and general ignorance. Unfortunately to do this in a short work, he has to populate Mars with idiots who all think in black and white and kill flies with sledge hammers. There's one dolt I particularly love who decides to start a hot dog stand. Then one day a martian tries to calmly talk to him and this guy shoots him. Now, by now he's got to be fully aware of their mind powers and how they could easily kill him. So instead of realizing he's already beaten, he shoots. Why? Because Bradbury's characters are two-dimensional idiots.There's also the part where all of Bradbury's dialogue and depiction of behavior seem to come not so much from observing and experiencing human interaction first hand but by observing pulp fiction in print or at B-Movies. It's like reading the script to a 1930s gangster movie.As a keen observer of human behavior, Ray gives us a scene where a party of astronauts land and decide to get drunk and make a lot of noise after the first three parties (maybe 2, I don't care enough to look it up) went missing and are presumed dead. What? Aren't these scientists and military people? Shouldn't they be a little more careful and perhaps not sing songs and get their drink on?There's also Bradbury's utter lack of Scientific understanding and imagination. You know what he predicts? The answering machine. Wow, what an amazing future we have to look towards. I'm not saying he should have accurately predicted the future, but my god, shouldn't he have guessed that we'd advance a bit further than he allows us in his world? People are riding on Steam Boats and mailing letters to Earth!!! (Which costs $5, in case you're wondering.)Hey guess what. According to Ray you can see Earth pretty well from Mars. No telescope required.Oh, did I mention the dialogue is truly awful? I am now going to open any page and write the first thing I see. Here we go. \\"Sir it must be, it has to be that rocket travel to Mars began in the years before the first World War!\\" pg 36. You know, around 1910-1912. There's more, but I just can't read any more of it.Well there is one more. This one actually rewards the star and not given because I can't go lower. Here it is: \\". . . she tosses salads neatly, never once pausing for breath\\" page 162. Look it up. It's there.Oh, finally, for some reason, Bradbury thinks that people would actually leave a peacful place to go fight in a nuclear war. Sure pal. You really got your finger on the pulse of the human psyche.If you want to read a good book from this era from a guy who can actually write, read Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\". Good story and readable dialogue."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The first delivery lost and I counted myself on that book for a work, lost time and money, the second package I arrive well, but when she asks for first they continue to me on time assuring that arrive"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"At the very begining of the book, Rocket Summer and Ylla, I thought I would be very interested.

I was twelve years old and the paperback was .99 cents, so I convinced my mother to buy it for me. And I fell in love with Bradbury's prose in The Martian Chronicles; it is almost poetry and a joy to read. I've since read every science fiction, and every other story he published. Bradbury's novels and short stories all make subtle, but accurate, commentaries on modern American culture. I recommend his works to anyonre who loves good story telling and beautiful prose."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This was an interesting series of short stories about what might happen if there were Martian beings and Americans landed there. The tendency of the Americans was to impose their own culture on the world, with little appreciation of the existing culture and the beauty of Martian creations. In a way, it was a retelling about 'how the west was won'."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is a collection of Ray Bradbury's Mars colonization stories which were originally published in pulp magazines over a period of a few years. They are independent of each other in plot, but it is fascinating how Bradbury managed to pull them all together in a cohesive whole which told a story in itself. This book is considered the bridge between classic pulp science fiction (which targeted lowest-common-denominator audiences) and the more thoughtful and sophisticated modern science fiction. The stories have the same raw imagination as pulp, but each one tackles one or more social issues as well. The stories are fast and fun, and yet intriguing.My favorite story is about two missionaries bent on saving the Martians from sins that we humans haven't even imagined yet. The philosophical discussion of sin and the ironic use of Christian symbolism meshed surprisingly well with the sf-pulpy imagery. Bradbury also touched on evils-of-colonization, race-relations and xenophobia, and politics...to name but a few issues. I was also impressed by Bradbury's expectations of \\"the future\\" (1999 - 2020). Unavoidably, some of his themes were dated--we no longer worry about nuclear holocaust and (I hope!) lynch mobs are very rare in the US these days. He didn't foresee the civil rights movement or the cooling of the arms race. Despite this lack of foresight, he showed that humans never change. We may think we're living in an enlightened age, but xenophobia still exists and we're still willing to destroy the history and of an old land in order to set up our new world. Yes, I did feel that the stories tended to be a bit on the dreary side, but for some reason it didn't bother me so much because it was made palatable by Bradbury's fantastic imagination.This is a fantastic classic that any science fiction fan should read."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Aside from hearing that The Martian Chronicles is a fabulous book, I had no expectations before diving in. I knew it was a book about life on Mars, but didn't know much else. I wasn't sure whether to expect Heinlen's Stranger in a Strange Land or Burroughs's Princess of Mars. What I found was very distinct from either of those.The book is structured in a series of short chapters, each of which felt like it could stand on its own as a distinct short story. Each chapter (perhaps with the exception of some of the shortest ones) had their own fun and interesting sets of character & environment developments, plot twists and story arcs. At the same time, they are all bound together by the passing of time from the first story to the last story and the consequences and effects of each story on the life and world of Mars.Unlike the other 'life on Mars' books I mentioned above, this book envisions a race of Martians living very much like Earthlings. In fact, for the first little bit I thought I was reading about Earth inhabitants living on Mars. Instead they were Martians but with some of the Earth habits and quirks you might stereotypically find in TV shows from the 50s and 60s. As the story progressed, the Martians definitely became their own distinct race with their own huge differences in behavior, community, rules and expectations. I really enjoyed the way Bradbury did this. He made the Martians immediately relatable by giving them Earth-like behaviors and traits but then quickly made them unique and intriguing by expounding on the differences of their world and their race.Within a few pages, we find that Earth is about to make contact with Mars. Again and again and again.The results are consistently humorous and intriguingly provocative. The interactions between Earthlings and Martians is a fun and interesting commentary on the way we all interact and deal with the unknown. I absolutely loved laughing at the ridiculous and over the top reactions and interactions while at the same time thinking about the truth of the behaviors and wondering why it is we do the things we do.It was slightly off-putting the way Bradbury seemed to ignore some of the scientific realities of Mars. I acknowledge that this is a work of science fiction and that it was written in the first half of the 20th century, but some of the elements struck me as a little odd for the first few chapters (such as the Earthlings being able to breath on Mars, the abundance of life both in terms of humanoid creatures and in other animals). The way some of the behaviors mixed with mid-20th century America, I sometimes felt disoriented by the lack of \\"true\\" Martian planetary realities. Fortunately this was very easy to ignore once I really dug into the story. And thanks to the fast pace of the storytelling combined with short chapters and a short overall book, I found myself completely immersed very quickly and thoroughly enjoying the tale without worrying about \\"reality.\\"As a whole, I absolutely loved this book. The full stretch of the story was very engaging from the initial Earth-Mars contact to the final pages of the book. I also love the way the book is structured into a series of shorter almost stand-alone stories. I had quite a few favorites but I love that I can quickly and easily return to and reread or share these favorites without worrying too much about them being \\"out of context.\\" I really loved the combination of silly humor, amazing sci-fi creativity and thoughtful social commentary. Definitely and A+ recommended read.*****5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The book does not read like a novel or a bunch of short stories.

This book was recommended to me by a close friend so I ordered it and I am glad I did. This was written years ago but you would not know it from the various stories in it. I found this book to be exciting, strange and most entertaining!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This was Ray Bradbury's first novel, from 1949 when he and his wife were expecting their first child. That said, it isn't a true novel, but rather collection of short stories that are tied together. It well-written, compelling, and I really enjoyed it.Other than Fahrenheit 451, I haven't previously read anything by Bradbury. In terms of science fiction, I'm more used to the science fiction of Robert Heinlein, a man who Bradbury looked up to and considered a major influence.Heinlein was clearly a pioneer in world of science fiction. He lead the pack in terms of the technique of indirection, describing far out worlds not through a lot of explicit description, but rather subtely through the eyes of his characters enabling the readers mind to fill in the details. According to Eric Raymond, he got that from Kipling.That said, I believe there is an area in which Bradbury excels far beyond Heinlein, that is in the lyrical/poetic power of his writing. Bradbury's writing is beautiful in a way that Heinlein's is not. And that beauty shines forth even in this, his earliest published book.Bradbury once said \\"Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries\\". It's very clear that as an author, Bradbury loved reading and that he drank very deeply from the works of the best poets."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Writing from the perspective of the late 1940s, Ray Bradbury imagined Martians who were like a more highly evolved version of us: they drove wheeled vehicles, ate meat, went to motion pictures, played guitar-like instruments . . . but had mental telepathy too. When the first earthlings showed up with their genocide and their germs, the Martians had no trouble concocting fantasty &quot;hometowns&quot; that mimed the Americans' imaginations. . . just enough that the Yanks let their guard down. Ultimately, of course, something had to give.But the real beauty of THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is its poetry, not its plot. No one can hymn the beauty of a mild Midwestern evening like Bradbury, or conjure up the etheral quality of an alien's mindset. Ultimately this book is a set of Rod Serling-type exercises in paradox, an ode to lost wisdom, a pioneer saga, a cautionary tale to imperial civilizations, and more. If you're looking for something much more in the vein of DANDELION WINE than FAHRENHEIT 451, THE MARTIN CHRONICLES is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"When I was first reading this book I felt that it made had some good underlying points about our society, but nothing revolutionary.

It moved me like few things I have recently read. That is art. In this age of the Novel, many readers will balk the the crazy-quit pattern of chapter-stories, and its lack of linear plot-line. But this structure of Chronicles weaves a wonderful thread for readers mature enough to follow it.If you haven't read it since childhood, read it again! And if you've never read it before, please correct this error soon!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"At first I was a little lost with the lack of continuity between chapters...However, I really began to enjoy the book once I accepted it for what it is, a collection of individually published short stories. It's easy to be critical of Bradbury's fantasy as the stories assert facts/issues known to us now not to be true or not to have happened, but give the guy a break! I admired his boldness in taking a 'stab' at our future...and if anything else, found it interesting to 'see' the concept of our present day world through the eyes of a fiction writer experiencing the times immediately following WWII...If you can only enjoy feasible/factual Sci-fi, this is not a book for you! A special treat for me was recognizing a number of these stories as scripts used in the Twilight Zone series. This is a book I look forward to picking up again someday and sharing with my kids."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury was not a John Campbell author. John Campbell, editor of ASTOUNDING SCIENCE FICTION magazine, launched the modern era of science fiction with his discovery of such authors as Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein, and his insistence on scientific accuracy imprinted itself on what science fiction became.Ray Bradbury, on the other hand, had another focus in his stories. It was Edgar Allan Poe who said that the purpose of a short story was to translate &quot;mood&quot; to paper; Ray Bradbury's ghostly sentimental prose did that wonderfully, and science was secondary. At one time, science held that the planets were formed in a sequence moving inwards toward the sun -- therefore Mars was an Earth-like world, but much older and consequently dying. (Venus, on the other hand, was much younger and wetter, as was believed Earth was in its youth.) Ray Bradbury set his stories on these worlds, even after it was discovered that this specific planetary formation theory was incorrect. Specifically speaking, Ray Bradbury wrote fantasy, not science fiction. (This is a fact difficult to recognize because we've come to identify fantasy with all the Tolkien rip-offs less imaginative authors turned out.) This is immediately identifiable in such stories as &quot;Rocket Summer&quot; or &quot;The Green Morning&quot;, which are scientifically impossible but written instead as mood pieces.Speculative Fiction followed Campbell. This offered us its own rewards, and its own classics, but we've never had an author like Bradbury again. It seems our only option is to reread his work again and again."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The world of modern sci-fi seems to be dominated by scientific accuracy and technological worship. In The Martian Chronicles Bradbury sacrifices some of that excruciating technical detail in favor of more emotional and beauty based sci-fi. Bradbury's vivid protrayals of the Martian landscape and it's effects on the Terran settlers provide a brilliant experience, leaving one with a feeling of satisfation. In an age where the term &quot;Science Fiction&quot; is quickly becoming synonimous with &quot;action&quot;, The Martian Chronicles is a breath of fresh air and a revisitation of the way sci-fi was meant to be."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book is about the founding of Mars as a US territory, and the effects of the mass emigration on the continental countryside as well as the politics of civilizing a new area. This is exactly the year when the events of the novel were projected to take place, and what is most fascinating is how differently history actually turned out than Bradbury imagined. Published in 1950, Bradbury never foresaw the civil rights movement and the integration of all races in this country. Instead, while still muttering &quot;yessirs&quot; and deferring to the white man, every single black citizen of the US flees to Mars to be free. Women are also frozen in time in his depiction of the future, with the more subtle issues of discrimination and reproductive freedom completely ignored. It just goes to show you what a dramatic effect political organization and protest can really bring. But let me step off my soapbox to finally say that this is definitely a classic work of science fiction to wrap your mind around."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book defies reality and imagination, and yet it is so believable that i found myself shivering in my shoes.

It is very surreal; for added effect, play nothing but Pink Floyd instrumentals when reading this. It will captivate your imagination.

Still, I know that this is for everyone, not just sci=fi lovers."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury has become, to me, a living legend in science fiction. In high school, I gained much respect for his knack for storytelling. Now, I've come to respect him for the lessons he teaches thru his works. This book definitely teaches us as humans to look in the mirror and see that we are each responsible for the future of ourselves and of Earth itself. It shows how humans can take things for granted and overlook the beauty of their surroundings. I was honored to meet Mr. Bradbury at the LA Book Festival and found him to be a nice person even though I was speechless. I will definitely be reading more of his works in the future, but this book so far is one of my all-time favorites!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This must be the best literary work(in my mind) to come from America. Who else other than Bradbury can make one see, taste, touch, and hear all the wonders of the hidden yet powerful and moving niches of literature. The Martian Chronicles makes haste to destroy the idea that Martians are a blood thirsty race of people. The vast dried up oceans of sand, the canals that are so abundant, and best of all the old dead towns filled with ashes. It was most moving. This book was a journey for me and I cannot express clearly in words how it moved me."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Have you ever read a beautiful short story that made you want to find out what happened next?This book is just that - each story tells you what happened after the last one. Each story could be read separately, if you wanted to. But when you begin the next one, you find it adds another layer to the atmosphere of the previous tale. The image gets deeper and more complex, until you are looking at the flow of centuries over Mars, and the humans and others on it. Each piece of this history is a gem, each has it's own glitter- from the tale of the first landings on mars to the ill-fated hot dog stand on a deserted highway there - but they come together to form a crown Bradbury fully deserves.The stories have that haunted feeling that only Bradbury can really create. The taste of his world is somehow exotic, though it be made of elements we all know. The Martian Chronicles is a book that could fit in either the Short Story or Novel category, but perhaps the best place for it would be in Poetry."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles, by Ray Bradbury, is a gripping book full of little surprises. Bradbury puts his messages across in a blunt, shocking manner that leaves the reader wanting more. Each story is a success in itself, yet all of them are mystically linked to the same main plot. This is a plot of the exploration, settlement, and eventual abandonement of the planet Mars. The first stories deal with the initial Mars landings that were failures. The book goes on to delve deep into the effects of the settlement of Mars on not only the Martian, but on us, the Earthmen. Such is the conflict between the two rases that in one story, &quot;Night Meeting,&quot; there is a depiction of the createion of two totally different dimensions on Mars; one of them inhabited by the human settlers, the other inhabited by Martians, who were thought to be extinct. In the familiar Bradbury plot, the humans are celled back to fight in the atomic war on Earth and Mars is abandoned. In conclusion, this book is one of many points of view on the same general thesis: the connotations and implications of the settling of the planet Mars. It has a little something for everyone, even Edgar Allan Poe lovers."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles are not the most scientifically accurate books in existence , even for their time . Life on Mars was fairly unlikely , and that knowledge existed even in the 20's era . But this story is beyond such things .The story grabs your attention at the very beginning . The description of summer during winter is not overdone , and while not plausible by today's standards , it was perhaps more so during the time Bradbury wrote it .But this is trivial . What &quot;Rocket Summer&quot; , the first tale in the chronology , does is set the tone . The images immediately leap out of the reader's mind , giving them a very distinct view of Bradbury's world . In this small opening , Bradbury meshes poetry with prose , and sets the stage.The tales that follow are nothing less than beautiful . The descriptions of the Martians are wonderful . As the humans arrive on Mars , however , things begin to change .Now historical analogies can be drawn . The Chronicles are the tales of the dawn of the Americas , put on the scale that only science fantasy can offer . The Martians are wiped out , or at least thought to be , by human diseases , setting the stage for the colonization of Mars . This period is no less interesting than the others , and perhaps even more so . &quot;Usher II&quot; is a look at a future where many of the great works of literature are gone ... and forgotten , for the most part . Lost in the Great Fire , a time of mass book burnings . &quot;The Watchers&quot; succeeds in its descriptions of an Earth that &quot;seemed to explode , catch fire , and burn .&quot;The tone is then set for one of the most powerful stories in the Chronicles , &quot;The Silent Towns.&quot; Beautiful and sad , it is possibly the most memorable story in the entire collection .The Chronicles close with &quot;The Million-Year Picnic.&quot; It is a very fitting end , because it also signifies a new beginning .Overall , The Martian Chronicles is on a playing field all its own . No other work is like it , and that cannot be denied . It is beautiful and breath taking at turns .When I read this story , in that same instant , it conquered me .

The stories are perfect for the younger reader, they are short, well written, and full of imagery. The book is a tribute, and a cautionary tale, to those who aspire for higher goals.

It is one of the most moving and important set of observations about our human issues ever written in either science fiction or science fantasy form.Ray Bradbury wrote these short stories in the late 1940s at a time when we knew almost nothing about Mars. Some scientists even thought there were probably canals and the remnants of a dead or dying Martian civilization on Mars. Written as science fiction originally by Mr. Bradbury, our growing knowledge of Mars makes these assumptions science fantasy today. But don't let that shift rob these stories of their power over you.But Mars was just the setting for a more serious set of questions. Mr. Bradbury was concerned that the world was too full of hate, war, short-sightedness, and greed to amount to much. He despaired as to whether humans would survive the discovery of the atomic bomb. From this raw material of human excess, he stitched together a powerful vision of our choices -- to operate at our best . . . or our worst. He appeals to our better selves in a vivid way that will be unforgettable to you, if you are like me.The development of the book has an interesting history. Mr. Bradbury was in his late twenties, and had written quite a few short stories. While visiting New York, he showed his short stories to publishers who liked them. The publishers advised him that there was a market for novels, but not much of one for books of short stories. Then one night it hit him, he had the raw material for a novel about Mars if he simply wrote a few transition stories to fit with ones he had already written. He sat up late that night writing the book proposal, and sold it the next day. That concept became The Martian Chronicles.Mr. Bradbury had recently read Winesburg, Ohio and was impressed by that book with the potential to use a series of stories as a way to tell a community's history. It seemed natural to use that structure for his Martian book.The book covers a time period from 1999 through 2026, starting with the first manned expedition to Mars from Earth. The American astronauts do find Martians. The complications of the first four expeditions come from the interactions between humans and Martians, and are unexpected and intriguing. The stories explore the implications of a race being telepathic in very revealing ways.Much of the human colonization of Mars in the book pits those who want to recreate Earth against those who appreciate what is special about Mars. So exploitation versus conservation is one theme in the book. As a backdrop for the stories, you will read about all of the themes of the Westward migration in the United States from the eradication of the native peoples and culture, to excess exploitation of natural resources, to the desire to be free of &quot;civilized&quot; society.There are wonderful stories in here against racisim, censorship of books (which became the basis of Mr. Bradbury's later book, &quot;Farenheit 451&quot;), and war.Towards the end of the book is a lovely sequence of three stories about the various meanings of loneliness. I particularly recommend them. The first looks at men and women seeking each other out when there is no other company. The second considers the loss of a family and how to cope with that. The third looks ruefully at the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust.The last story in The Martian Chronicles, &quot;The Million-Year Picnic,&quot; causes me to shiver and moves me almost to tears every time I think about it. From that story, you will be able to answer the famous question in the book, &quot;Who are the Martians?&quot;By the way, the book is much better than the movie. If you think you know the story from the movie, I suggest you read the book. If you have a choice of one or the other, I definitely suggest the book.By the way, years later Mr. Bradbury reviewed this book and commented that the world had turned out much better than he had hoped. He said that would have written a different kind of book on the same subject in the 1970s, but he still had great respect for what the young man he was in his twenties who had written The Martian Chronicles.The manned exploration of Mars is probably our greatest and most important challenge as a species. Yet, we pay little attention to the question now. I suggest that you use your reading of The Martian Chronicles to help reignite a discussion with those you know of what our goals and methods should be concerning Mars.Reach for the stars . . . to create the fullest human potential and accomplishments -- morally, spiritually, emotionally, and physically."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is, in many ways, one of science fiction's most important novels. It's deemed an essential read on almost all notable lists, is the book that broke Bradbury into the mainstream, and was the single most widely read SF book during the 1950's. This book is not a novel per se, but rather a collection of separately linked stories that chronicle, in about as many ways as you can imagine, Man's experiences with Mars, hence the title. Though it covers a span of time from 1999-2026, it is, like all great SF, a commentary on the times in which it was written, rather than the times it is set in. This book is a startling example of human folly. In contrast to much science fiction (from The War of the Worlds onward) the Martians in Bradbury's universe are calm, peaceful, and dreamlike (for the most part, anyway) rather than vicious and malicious. This book shows how humans-arrogant, self-righteous, and irrespectful-can and probably will ruin a beautiful, peaceful planet through ignorance and lack of respect. Also in the book are situations depicting ways in which other races we meet in space may react to us. I found these situations to be highly original and imaginative, sometimes we fail to realize that there are other ways for them to react besides peaceful, cooperative tranquility and war. Sprinkled throughout the seriousness of the stories mentioned above, are lighter, somewhat comical tales that liven up the pace a bit. Through fictional situations, this book also manages to comment on such issues as racism, slavery, social life, marriage, etc. A highly interesting read. Though it is a short read (less than 200 pages) it feels like an epic. By the time you are done with the book, you will feel like you have witnessed a saga, a great work of art, a feeling that few books indeed, much less ones this short, manage to accomplish. The last two stories in the book are startling in their differences. There Will Come Soft Rains is an utterly believable, highly pessimistic, and ultimately thought-provoking piece of work followed by The Million Year Picnic, a contrastly optimistic, hopeful story. These two situations are beautiful in their contrast and a fitting ending to a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The William Morrow Hardcover Edition (February 1, 1997) appears to be missing a story: \\" Way in the Middle of the Air \\"Mr. Bradbury wrote a story where all of the black people get fed up with the south, and the way they are treated, load up the rocket and leave all of the bigots behind. Incredibly some paper pushing editor must have thought this story would offend our sensitivities, and took it upon him or herself to remove it from the chronicles.Strange that the work of Mr. Bradbury, a champion of free speech, is being edited.Do not get this version! (I got hosed, but vowed to save my fellow readers from the same fate)!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is one of the most fascinating explorations of man-alien contact, and even man-man contact, ever, if a bit dated.When reading the Martian Chronicles (or, in my case, listening to the excellently read book on tape), the key is to keep in mind the context of the time in which it was written. In the post-war 1940s, the prospect of nuclear holocaust was all too real. More than 50 years later, the book is far too pessimistic about humanity and its future, while at the same time far too optimistic about the ease of travel to Mars.Regardless, this is not the kind of science fiction that most are used to reading. For starters, it's a very literary book. The language is beautifully crafted; we're not talking pulp fiction here. Also, it's not a book about the rockets, or even Mars, per se. Bradbury spends no time explaining how the rockets are able to easily traverse the millions of miles to and from Earth, for example. It merely uses those conventions to tell incredibly poignant stories about man's paranoia and selfishness. One of the stories echoes the censorship-mad society in Fahrenheit 451, for instance. It just happens to occur on Mars.The end result is somewhat depressing, yet profound. Think of the Martian Chronicles as the opposite of Star Trek's touchy feely Hollywoody SciFi."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"With the passing of the master (Isaac Asimov)the question is hardly asked anymore. Who's better, Bradbury or Asimov? The two were both born in 1920 and they made their fame in the forties, fifties, and sixties, writing (and pioneering) a kind of fantastical pulp fiction that would eventually become known as science fiction. In short, the two men were giants of the genre and so their work, their art, naturally invited comparison. I have always loved them both, Asimov for his great ideas and Bradbury for his great storytelling voice. Asimov, the university professor, was trained as a hard science man--physics, mathematics, chemistry. If he had not made his name as a writer, he probably would have designed the first rocket ship that landed on the moon. In fact, we owe him thanks for the word &quot;ROBOT&quot;, the rules for governing them (ha-ha-ha, see I Robot), and the fledgling field of robotics itself. Is there a more representative work of science fiction than The Foundation Trilogy? Though Asimov is known primarily in literary circles as a science fiction writer, the great man was a thinker of ideas so varied that his books earned him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records: he is the only author who has at least one book in every category of the Dewey Decimal System. In other words, no matter where you are in the library, you can find a book written by Asimov. Bradbury, on the other hand, is not a scientist. In fact, if you check out some of the stories in the Martian Chronicles, his best collection, you will discover working rocket ships that were built with hammers and nails in somebody's barn. You'll find life forms that are bubbles with voices. You'll find a variety of strange and contradictory rules for space flight. And you know what? None of it matters because Bradbury's appeal, unlike Asimov's, has nothing to do with his grasp of scientific principles and the various real and imagined extrapolations thereof. We read Bradbury because he is a writer first and a scientist second. Bradbury could write a story about ice melting in a cup, and we'd be on page 200, reading with pleasure, before we looked up and said, hey, why the heck am I reading a story about ice melting in a cup? Bradbury explores the humanity of his characters when he writes, as the stories in the Martian Chronicles prove, and he has an absolutely addictive storytelling voice. It's kinda like sitting under a tree with your grandfather and listening to him spin yearns. Time passes before you know it, and you wish he could go on talking forever. So here it is then, Read the Martian Chronicles not for the science, but for the fiction, and you will not be disappointed by the master."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I feel that \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is one of the best and most creative works of Science Fiction of all time, but I would recommend buying another copy of it. There was one chapter in the original work that was taken out of this version. Apparently the editors felt its racial themes were too strong, although I feel it was, in reality, speaking out against the racism of the 1950's. Its ironic how Bradbury has always been so outspoken in his writing against censorship of books, and yet his own book was censored."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I am the biggest Ray Bradbury fan in the world.

CRT is responsible for the new golden age in radio."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Mars has always played a big part in science fiction. From Burroughs's macho fantasies to Wells's merciless invaders, from Heinlein's strange land to Robinson's terraforming, Mars has been writ large in our imagination. But the current that runs through all of these works is of a world both coherent and uniform. The planet exists as a whole and is presented to us as a whole.But if we stopped to think about it, how can a planet as immense as Mars be taken as a whole? If we looked deeply, wouldn't Mars present an infinite number of facets to our scrutiny? Wouldn't each facet tell its own unique and peculiar story?This is what Bradbury does in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. The title serves as fair warning. This is not a conventional novel, but a set of chronicles: a collection of tidbits written to give us a taste of a place's boundless variety. And what a refreshing approach it is. In this work, Mars is more than just a setting. It becomes a personality; some days happy, some days sad; some days heedless, some days thoughtful.Some of these vignettes succeed better than others. But taken in their entirety, they provide us with a breadth of feeling that would not be possible in a single uniform work.However, if this were all that this work accomplished, it would be no more than an interesting exercise in technique. &quot;Chronicles&quot; really compels us because it touches our souls. Of all the science fiction greats, Bradbury strikes closest to the human heart. No one else can write quite his way; achieving that just-right balance between eccentricity and pathos, ordinary and fantastic; life and circumstance: living and breathing filtered through the orange mist of nostalgia. Nowhere does he strike that balance as well as he does here.Nor should readers be put off by the abrupt changes. The various stories may jump from place to place and character to character, but there is a wealth of strong underlying themes that bind the various segments into a coherent whole. How do ordinary people respond to an extraordinary environment? Can intelligence overcome tribal instincts to embrace completely different beings? Can we ever, in the depth of our bones, truly make an alien landscape our home? Is our greatest challenge the conquest of space, or the conquest of human frailty? These are only some of the many worthy themes that run through the various episodes.It's not perfect. I will be the first to admit that some episodes don't quite work. But what it lacks in consistent polish, it makes up for in nerve and originality. Bradbury is not content just to explore human themes. He chances unconventional approaches because the themes he wishes to explore are themselves unconventional. It takes literary guts to take such chances, and when they even half work, the composer deserves respect. In this collection, the general quality is so high, that it demands our appreciation."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The most important and startling (in a good way) thing about &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is that Bradbury hasn't written a science fiction book. He has written a book about the human society. If you try to look at it as a science fiction book, you'll be greatly disappointed; I must say I cannot agree with the reviewers who say that he has depicted life on Mars (the details about it) in a vivid and fascinating way. Actually, the complete unlikeliness of a world like that makes the book a bit strange to read at times.What makes this book so beautiful is the simple fact Bradbury doesn't write for the sake of writing. He writes because he has important things to say about the human way of life. Humans destroy everything noble and great around them; if that could bring money, they'd sell hot dogs at temples (in fact, don't they?). It is almost incomprehendible that he wrote this book in 1950; the problems discussed in it have reached and are reaching increasingly more epic proportions.Aside from the fact that Bradbury is brilliant at expressing important ideas, he writes stories that make you want to read on and on at the same time. He uses inventive storylines and has a fascinating way of describing things that seem illogical or even completely absurd at the first glance (I'd provide details, but I refuse to spoil the wonderful experience of reading the stories for anyone...).The only reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that among great (and I mean great!) stories there are some short ones that are of considerably lower quality than the rest. They're much less interesting than the others and keep me from pronouncing this book a masterpiece - a title that a considerable part of the book justly deserves.All in all, I urge you to read this book. Perhaps you will not find much in it if you're looking for some credible science fiction, but you will find much to think about there - as well as simply a close-to-incredible read."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Preface: I own the Bantam Books paperback editon, printing number 68 in 1988. It includes the story where the blacks get fed up with the south and head to Mars. Some editions have this story edited out. :(I first read The Martin Chronicles in 1988. I continue to come back from time to time to (to use a Bradbury phrase)dip into the wonderful writing and story telling of Ray Bradbury. He set the standard very high when he wrote The Martian Chronicles. The book contains one of the most important set of observations about our human issues ever written in either science fiction or science fantasy form. We see a broad picture of humankind and to some extent even racism. It would make a fascinating study for a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation.Like many of Mr. Bradbury's works, The Martin Chronicles is a collection of short stories. He turned them into a novel by writing a few transition stories to fit with ones he had already written. He wrote these short stories in the late 1940s. That was a time when we knew almost nothing about Mars. He uses Mars as the backdrop for a more serious look at issues and questions including hate, war, not thinking of consequences of our actions, and pure capitalistic greed. Mr. Bradbury visualizes an amazing future. He sees what can be when humankind operates at our best. He appeals to our better selves to build a better future.The book covers a period from 1999 through 2026. It begins with the first manned expedition to Mars from Earth. The American astronauts find Martians on the first journey to Mars. The complications of the first four expeditions come from the interactions between humans and Martians. The complications are unexpected and fascinating. The early failures of the journey would probably today have futre trips cancelled, but not in Bradbury's writing. The complications include the basic extermination of the Martian race from one of our childhood diseases.In the book, much of the human colonization of Mars brings those who want to recreate Earth against those who appreciate what is special about Mars. Therefore, exploitation versus conservation is one theme in the book. There are magnificent stories in here against racisim, censorship of books, and war.Near the book's end are three stories about the a variety of meanings of loneliness. They are wonderful. The first looks at men and women seeking each other out when there is no other company. The second considers the loss of a family and how to cope with that. The third looks remorsefully at the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust.The last story in The Martian Chronicles, \\"The Million-Year Picnic,\\" makes me very melancholy. From that story, you will be able to answer \\"Who are the Martians?\\"Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"It takes a couple of chapters to start getting into this book, but I was hooked by Chapter 5.Bradbury describes an environment that transforms the people who settle it. Bradbury's Mars serves as a frontier for an Earth on the brink of Armageddon. The people who settle Mars come for different reasons, but all are changed by the endless landscape of sand, ruined cities and canals.The flow of the book is disjointed, it leaves the impression that it was originally written in installments for different magazines. Bradbury only hints at the rich Martian civilization that once flourished on the planet.A larger subject is the state of humanity that attempts to conquer the planet. Bradbury offers a scathing criticism of people who are motivated by conquest or commerce to tame Mars. The Chapter on the \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\" was brilliant and thoroughly entertaining. Public officials and latter-day inquisitors get their just desserts after being lured into an irresistable trap. I savored every sentence of this chapter, and thought of a few people I know who I would love to invite to a modern House of Usher.This is a book that will stand the test of time and grow beyond being a science fiction classic."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I've had this book laying around for years, kind of wish I would have read it sooner. The book spans around 27 years of man/martian history. It is striking in alegory and observation. Anyone with and eye and an ear should enjoy the many short stories that deal with issues like racism, greed, paranoia, hate, loss, and jealousy; just to name a few. The book is at times humorous, and sad, but always profound. I realy enjoyed watching the story progress through the wonder in frontier, into the darkness of self destruction, and into the silver lining of hope.I should also warn that the book is a compilation of short stories that follows a timeline, or chronicle of martian/man history, and not one straight novel with long developing plot and characters, though some do have multiple appearances. It is a book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and backgrounds. Don't miss it. I know it made me a fan of Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"*One of the reviews posted here says that this version of the book has had a story taken out (\\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\"), but actually that story is in the book. Maybe that person had a faulty copy or something, but this version has not been edited.About the book itself: Although I had to read it for school, I found that I actually ended up liking it. The stories themselves are often somewhat bland, serving as conduits for a larger idea or theme, but I thought that the ideas the book presented were thoughtful and intriguing and some of the stories were interesting as well. As far as storyline, there are very few strong characters and the plots can be confused, isolated, and conflicting, but as it is a series of short stories and not a novel, this can be forgiven to some extent. All in all The Martian Chronicles held my interest and introduced me to some interesting ideas."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is the fictional history of the discovery of life on Mars and its subsequent settling by humans. Every chapter is a different short story (sort of like The Illustrated Man, though IMHO better).Ray Bradbury is definitely one of the most influential and prolific American writers ever. In a recent article Chuck Palahniuk listed this book as the one that inspired him the most as a young adult, always keeping a battered copy with him. I Love Palahniuk's work, so this is a big complement to Bradbury. As one \\"So you would like to...\\" list states- your grandkids will probably be studying this as a classic in the future, so check it out and find your Sci-Fi roots."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Regardless of what other reviewers have written, I believe this book to be a haunting work of art. Bradbury manages, through dozens of short vignettes, to tell the story of how mankind came to inhabit the Martian landscape. The idea that Bradbury imparted his own social agenda on this book is claptrap: He wrote with the beauty and elegance that is exclusive to him, and wove together a story from many different threads. He tells of the first voyages to Mars - and their subsequent failures - to the extinction of the Martian people.While the book's premise - and even summary - comes across as nothing more than formulaic science fiction, Bradbury manages to stretch it to much more than that. This book is evenly paced and well-written. It is imperative that one recognises that this book is meant to transcend the circumstance at hand: Bradbury arguably wrote this book to represent the tie that mankind to Earth, rather than to just express the ventures of humanity to the stars.Contrary to what many reviewers seem to have said, I don't see this book as being misanthropic or critical of humanity. Rather, it seems that Bradbury portrays humanity positively: He shows that mankind is always striving for something more, to go farther, to be better, faster, stronger, and more attune to their surroundings. And, he also shows how no matter things may change for mankind, we have a primative, yearning nature to return to the place that bore us: The Earth.Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite books of all-time. I still find it to be crafted in a way which rings true of the Golden age of science fiction: It doesn't get bogged down in misanthropy or cynicism. Rather, it finds the silver lining - a sort of resounding feeling of hope eminates from this book. Wholeheartedly, I applaud not only the story, but Bradbury's magnificant ability to tell a story, an ability which seems to have been lost in most contemporary writing."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Some \\"classics\\" don't live up to the hype, but this groundbreaker by Ray Bradbury still deserves to be called a classic. There are few writers who can display Bradbury's sense of melancholy and creeping dread, and these qualities give the supposedly pedestrian sci-fi subject matter of this book an unexpected depth and edge. Sure the basic futuristic aspects of this book are getting rusty (it was written in the 1940's mind you), but the unique themes of interplanetary culture shock and social phobia are what make this book unique. We've all heard the term \\"ugly American\\" applied to obnoxious and condescending American tourists around the world, and here Bradbury extends the phenomenon to human colonization of Mars in the near future. The obvious parallel that Bradbury is making is with the European destruction of the Indians and enslavement of Africans. This is evident in the book's most haunting chapters concerning the mass death of Martians from human disease, and the haunting exodus of African Americans to Mars from the racist South. There are also many instances of cultural misunderstanding and conflict between the human colonizers and native Martians, allegories for the root of just about every social problem on Earth. This book is essentially a collection of short stories or vignettes (not a full novel as is often assumed) dwelling on these concepts that are highly unique to science fiction, and remain groundbreaking to this day."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I really enjoyed The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury .It was a very interesting and at times disturbing novel.The book is about the adventures of a few different crews as they make their way to Mars.My favorite part of the book by far was the chapter entitledThe Third Expedition.This chapter was about the men making their way to Mars only to find all of their dead relatives there.Like I said I really enjoyed the book but at sometimes it did drag, but i still reconmend that you read it."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is not quite my favorite collection by Ray Bradbury, but it would have to be pretty darn close.

Here is a piece of literature that disguises it's grandeur in the simplicity of innocent construction, yet holds in it\`s interior the answers to some of humankind's deepest and most trascendent questions. Bradbury has the poetry of endless summer nights, yet the conviction and straightforwardness of an historian. He builds civilizations from his mind and heart only for us to destroy, yet he gives us the hope of human irresponsability and ignorance to justify our behaviour. This is the kind of literature that you want to remember your grandfather by: quiet winter nights, reading by the fireplace, giving life to those wonderful golden eyed beings from a not so distant nor strange world in your mind... This is the kind of masterpiece that you keep in your treasure chest, between your most precious belongings. I re-read it every year, and everytime I learn something new of what we are from it.

He should how he was not going to lat the goverment take over his life and controle it and he mad a house that was against all there rules. When they come to it he would kill them and then replace them with robots. That was the best part I think of the book.The part I did not like was the last story, The Million-Year Picnic. I think that Ray Bradbury did not write it as wall. It was a littel hard to fallow. I think the ending about the wrold comeing to a end with a wor was right. I like the part at the end where the boy is looking for martions and his dad says there are some and he was talking about them.

From the story &quot;The Long Years&quot; to &quot;The Million Year Picnic&quot;, Bradbury skips from one subject to the next, not leaving enough information in between to help the reader understand. If he would have had a little more of a whole story going than a bunch of separate 'expeditions' the story would have achieved more understanding and happy readers. Some people may think this book is the best out there, but to me the story could have been much beter. The best story in the book was &quot;The Third Expedition&quot; because of all the suspence, mistery, and unbelievably good ending, but the story &quot;The Million Year Picnic&quot; distroys the whole book with the amount of confusion it creates. My opinion of this book does not rate very highly and it may differ from one persons to the next, but keep in mind that it's only my opinion."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Many years after its' publication I have finally gotten around to this wonderful piece of literature. The more I read the more it sounded like everyday life. Of course some things are still ahead of us, most of the cool techno-gadgits have actually become common day houseware. Within these boundaries, the story tells of a great future, but Bradbury didn't take into account that humankind can only live with inequality for so long, and that the practice of slavery and all its' entrapments would no longer be a common day thing. Even without knowing specifically when the book was actually published it would still be easy to place it in time as to its' content. It is my belief that dating a book or movie with its' content berates the book and it no longer is relatable to those of a new generation."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Don't be fooled: this book is not about Mars. Rather, it is a picture of America in the aftermath of the second World War, with all of its accompanying hopes, dreams, hypocricies and hysterias. Read in this light, the stories are not merely entertaining diversions, but (often scathing) social commentary."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Well, first of all, I must say, this book is one of the first books I ordered from Amazon.com. I finished it in one day. Ray Bradbury is one of the best writers of the century! I really loved the different points of view in the book (the native-martian, the first settlers, etc) and I thought the descriptions of views and the author's imagination are simply amazing. However, the thing I liked the most was also the one that bothered me,it was hard for me to get used to a different point of view every few pages... The problem is that there's no main character that exists through all the stories. Each time a new story begins I have to &quot;re-adjust&quot; myself for a new main character with new background and new everything... It was hard but after a while I got used to it and had a blast reading this awesome book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"There was a time when people still believed in Martians - real Martians. This was a time when a dying race roamed around a dying, dry world, oblivious to the activities of humans on Earth. It is this romantic notion of the early twentieth century that The Martian Chronicles begins with and continues onto what we would now consider an impossible future.Each chapter is it's own self-contained story and some of them have clever, entertaining twists that remind me of old Star Trek episodes. If you read science fiction you must make sure that Martian Chronicles is one on your list.P.S. When someone asks me have I read 'Martian Chronciles' I now say yes!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"From the First Landing, to its abandoment, the story of Mankind and Mars is told in a collection of progressive short stories. Bradbury is a master storyteller, drawing the reader in, and weaving an intruiging and thought-provoking tale around him. More than just science fiction, the Martian Chronicles are a commentary on society as a whole, and the destructive course humankind sets for itself. If you are looking for a happy ending, or a light, fast read, then this is not the right book for you. If, however, you are looking for a story with meaning, told by an extremely talented writer, then I cannot recommend the Martian Chronicles more highly. A timeless classic, I would rank it among the best sci-fi's of all time."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Two things struck me about this book: 1) The title says &quot;Martian Chronicles&quot; and it is just that, a set of stories which are chronicles about Mars, and 2) As much as I hate to say it, Ray Bradbury's portrayal of humans is still accurate today. Mankind is almost entirely made up of people who are only interested in claiming something as &quot;mine, mine, mine!&quot;, just like a greedy child, along with no real thought about possible ramifications of such things as war and murder.For an &quot;old-fashioned sci-fi story&quot; it sure holds up well to the prism of time!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury's 'The Martian Chronicles' subjects a reader to an entirely different series of stories. The collection of stories is more of an account of various observations and reflections about Mars and man. The stories all tie together in one sense as they are about Mars, but each paints an entirely different viewpoint about the planet from the perspective of the people who go there or reside there. All the stories are good, and unique unto themselves. I found this book to be quite remarkable."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"....it remains quite a commentary on what people do when finding themselves in the unknown. Will you revere the relics of a bygone people? Or shoot the tops off them, just for fun? Will you lose yourself in reddened landscapes? Or strive to have the first hotdog stand on Mars? All options are open in these gripping tales."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This was one of my favorite all time books, and one of the first I have ever read by him. It is completely all sci-fi, and is very well written. The ideas that he presents in this book are just so awsome it leaves you wondering about where we are headed. The end is what makes this book an old time classic. I have never read a better ending in my life. The characters are wonderful through out this whole book. Each chapter is a different little story, but they do connect in some way. I suggest that you read this book. It is one of his best."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I have read this book four times! It seems to strike a chord in me. I don't know why. Each chapter is like a slice of heaven. Bradbury just hits on every note of &quot;What Could Happen But You Were Afraid to Ask&quot;. And he does this in the simplist way. No long ordeals of &quot;tension&quot; and &quot;conflict&quot;. He just rips into your brain with the ease of a good brain surgeon. How can I review this book without giving anything away? Alright. I will try. The Martians at the funeral will chill your bones. The astronauts finding their homes on earth after they land on Mars will force you to be with them and share their elation. How wonderful! Spender's compassion will make you question his solution. And you will feel for him. The astronauts dealings with the Martian psychiatrist will make you re-live all your experiences with doctors and dentists. You will feel like them. The appeal of this book is rough to figure out. I think it's because Bradbury gives us &quot;snapshots&quot; of our own fears and desires in short and brief chapters that make us feel untouched but shaken. He gets the needle into us deeply while seemingly doing nothing in order to do so. In other words, he delightfully blows our minds. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book started out a bit confusing, but had enough plot twists (i.e. the asylum) and enough subplots to keep it going strong throughout the entire novel. It also totes some decent quotes, and overall is a worthy read. I however enjoyed it alot."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The conquest of Mars was a popular theme in the science fiction of the golden age, and novels on the topic usually featured a square-jawed, all-American hero killing Little Green Men who had suspiciously Red tendencies. Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles revisits this subject, but presents a far more thoughtful, complex analysis of the issues involved. In this loosely connected series of short stories, he explores issues of conquest and colonisation. He looks at how the discovery of a \\"new\\" land inevitably means the destruction of existing cultures and artifacts, and at how colonists are rarely pioneers or visionaries looking for a new way of life but merely individuals wanting to reproduce the American Dream (or their culture's equivalent of it) in a new place. He also tackles the issues of censorship and governmental repression that he will later go on to explore in his compelling and searing Fahrenheit 451. Consequently, Mars may be read as a metaphor for the frontier, for the New World, for any point of contact between cultures.Reading the Martian Chronicles at the time when most of it is set, parts of it may appear archaic. Bradbury did not predict the Civil Rights' movement of the 1960s, the second wave feminism that changed the role of women, or the profound advances of technology that have taken place in the last fifty years. He also knew little about the Martian landscape that various probes have revealed to us, although I would argue that his Mars is not meant to be a real place but a fantastic vision of the ultimate new frontier.Even so, he can hardly be blamed for the science of the time's ignorance; more important is the fact the essential issues that the novel explores are as relevant and as interesting as they were in the 1940s. The Martian Chronicles is a beautiful, sad and elegaic piece of work that will be appreciated by anyone who enjoys thinking deeply about political and social issues."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles are a mixed work by the Science Fiction master, Ray Bradbury, sometimes functioning just to entertain, but at most times functioning to comment on the inhumanity of man.A theme that runs throughout several of his stories is the arrogant and often-provincial nature of humanity. One of the opening stories deal with the desires of man for recognition while everyone he encounters thinks that he is mad. (It wouldn't be a long stretch to say that this same story also is a commentary on euthanasia.) Other stories discuss the provincial nature of man, who so very often is appalled by that which is unfamiliar. Bradbury's apologetic on this is aimed against such closed-minded philosophy of life, as its inherent lack of dialogue precludes any exchange of beauty but instead locks mankind into a downward spiral, locked inward on himself.The exodus to Mars ultimately calls man back, as he does not feel at home in the new world. In the end, mankind's attachment to the homeland is Mars' defeat of mankind. Bradbury doesn't speculate much on morality of this choice but does outline the disastrous outcome of all the iniquity of man compounded together on Earth.Throughout Bradbury's other stories, he either whimsically tells a tale of encounters on the Red Planet or reflects on other fears which he had for mankind.It is difficult to tie all of these together on one string other than that of \\"beware of your fallen self, o mankind.\\" Bradbury raises valid questions about mankind's tendencies and philosophical quandaries. The work is not a feel-good type of book but instead presents a challenging view for the reader's reflection."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"A Martian wife is having dreams of people from Earth coming to Mars and talking to her. But then her husband gets jealous and goes and kills the men when they actually come. That was the first expedition from Earth, there were more to come. The second expedition is a group of four men. When they go to the Martians and tell them they are from earth they are sent into an insane asylum. Later on, one of the Martians put them out of their misery thinking the captain is crazy, he shoots them, and then shoots himself. The third expedition is a bunch of men, but when they are all in their home town and see all of their old relatives, the split up and spend the night with there long lost relatives. That night their \\"relatives\\" kill all of them. In the fourth expedition, most of the Martians have died of chicken pox. Then the captain lets them drink, litter, and party. An archeologist names spender gets angered at them disrespecting Mars. He then goes on a rampage killing five men before the captain has to shoot him in the chest to kill him. Settlers start coming to mars. Later on Mars is flooded with settlers. But then Earth goes into a nuclear war and mars had to be evicted, everyone leaves and Mars is safe from the humans destroying it. This was a good book. Not the greatest I've ever read, but still sort of kept my attention. I liked that it wasn't one straight story and a lot of stories in one, but they were all sort of part of one big story. This book was also very eventful. It also was a cool prediction.This book wasn't exactly one story. A lot of people wouldn't like that by I liked it. It had many different stories. It was sort of like history book of the future. It had a different story in each expedition. That way you didn't get bored of one story the whole time, it sort of switched them up.This book was very eventful. It kept me on my toes like no other book had done. There were many times where I was desperate to know what was going to happen. Even from the start of the book when the Martian wife's husband went to go kill the two men it had me on my toes. And then for the rest of the expeditions you always were wondering what was going to happen to the astronauts and wondered if they were going to die or not. Especially on the fourth one, when spender went around killing everyone, I wanted to know what was going to happen badly, I could take my eyes of the book.This book was a cool prediction. It was written in the 1940's but was written as if the time period was from 1999 to 2006. It was cool to read about what the author thought the world would be like these days when he lived 60 years ago. Though most of the things weren't right, a lot of it was. It was almost hard to tell that it was written so long ago. The author did a good job.This was a well written book. I really like the author. It's the second book I have read by him. I have liked both. I recommend this book to all readers. I would read it again if I had to.-J. Hamilton"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"First off, I need way more than five measley stars!This is, hands down, one of my favorite books of all time & probably one of the greatest books ever written! I say that without a trace of guilt. Ray Bradbury is God! I have read The Martian Chronicles no less than twenty times and I'm sure I'll read it at least that many more times before I'm through with it. One of the true masterworks not only of Science Fiction, but of literature in general. Bradbury is the unofficial spokesperson for the human race here. Clever and intriguing, with more than a few twists ala The Twilight Zone (which makes sense since he used to write for TZ with his buddies Rod Serling and Charles Beaumont). More of a collection of short stories than it is an actual novel, The Martian Chronicles asks and answers and comments on so many issues from the destruction of the environment to the rape and pillaging of new frontiers to social and racial tensions. Free-thinking? Is that anarchy? Bradbury asks the questions and gives us his version of the answers. Usher II is one of my favorite bright spots. This is tongue-in-cheek Bradbury at full-throttle. One of those \\"boring\\" books you had to read in High School, The Martian Chronicles was one of the first books that I had to read, that I did read, and that I actually enjoyed. After that the full spectrum of Bradbury's work became available to me and I couldn't stop until it was all devoured. Something Wicked This Way Comes, Dandelion Wine, Fareheit 451, The Illustrated Man, R Is For Rocket, S Is For Space... Like I said before, Bradbury is God and The Martian Chronicles is his crowning achievement. Get your hands on it one way or another. Lie, Cheat, steal,sell your immortal soul, whatever it takes. The Martian Chronicles is a masterpiece!Dig it!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I picked up this book again after reading it as a child. It has lost none of its lustre. Bradbury's novel presents both an engaging metaphor of colonialism, as well as, an accurate portrait of human nature. A must read."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This short stories are as powerful today as they were when they were first published. They have been seen on the TV screen and even a few have appeared in school books of mine. They deal with racism, life, death, love, and even the environment. Are we being shown the future or a reflection of our past? Do the stories hold important truths or are they just stories? No matter how you look at them, they are powerful, touching and, sometimes, ugly in how they show us ourselves.A must for ANY library."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury has a very interesting approach to sci-fi. He seems to to place all his stories within the reachable, not completely detatched from real life or the future. (like, ironically, most futuristic sci-fi works are)I'd definately recommend this book even to those who are normally uninteresting in sci-fi. It is short and if you end up not liking it you won't have wasted much time."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"A perfectly crafted collection of interwoven stories. A social commentary made up of flawless story telling that makes us look into ourselves and just say \\"woah.\\" And it's not just for science fiction fans- I'm definitely not one. I'm just a huge Bradbury fan."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"In the 1940's a little-known writer penned a look at life, technology, and culture in the distant future of 2002. Bradbury has assembled a collection of generally unrelated vignettes that explore Earth more than Mars.Some are outrageously hilarious, such as the tale of the first explorers who are greeted with total indifference by housewives more concerned with baking and cleaning, and minor politicians immersed in righting old wrongs. Finally they are locked up with the other space travellers.A key theme seems to be the lack of space planning. People randomly decide to emmigrate, or leave their homes under duress. Upon arrival on Mars, they have no idea how to build the society, beyond bringing some of their familiar Earth items, such as luggage shops and hot dog stands.The most interesting line followed by several vignettes is the ultimate journey for technology. Robots outlive their designers and computer programs continue to initiate automated devices to fry bacon and make martinis long after the home is deserted.Bradbury also deals with the response of the Martians to the invasion. Many are killed by disease as occurred in the colonies in the 17th century. Others fight back with telepathic weapons, conjuring up images of 1920's Ohio, complete with doting grandparents, lemonaide, and trolleys, to disarm the explorers. Less easily comprehended is that many continue to thrive in a parallel world where they are not visible to their rivals.This is a good read, everyone needs a chance to reflect on our human journey of exploration and implementation of technology. For those like me, who don't care for science fiction, there is not much of it here, despite the title."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is an important book, especially now. It is a whatif, a maybe and a possibility. We are just now coming to grips with the reality that Mars will someday be inhabited by humans, but what of the Martians? Who were they? What did they call themselves? What would they think and how would they feel about us taking over their planet? This book left a lot to ponder. I read it in elemetary school, and recently picked it up again and it's still spellbinding and even a bit scarey. This could be our future, our present...or maybe even our past. I recommend this book for any and all scifi fans, Bradbury fans, and people who just want to read something that stirs the heart as much as the mind."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury's book, &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, maybe wasn't as entertaining, as it was an outlook on human behavior. In this book Bradbury captured the human soul in it's ugliest form. In his twenty-six chapters he has shown light on some of are more monsterous emotions. This book is as much science fiction, as it is a book on human behavior. This book shows us Jealiuosy, censorship racism, religein, and so many other emotions. The chapter &quot;-and the moon be still as bright&quot; was I think the singal best outlook on the human soul, that I have ever read in a science ficton book, up to date. Even the weakest chapter &quot;The Green Morning&quot; still captivated the mind, if you let it. Even with all its great outlooks it still succeeded in being some what entertaining. With everything said and done &quot;Martian Chronicles&quot; was a good book, with some great, and not so great stories."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Martian Chronicles was an enjoying book. It was one of the most creative and inventive books I have ever read. My favorite chapter was the last one, &quot;Million-Year Picnic&quot;; probably because it has a great ending and it kind of sums the whole book up. Some of the stories were somewhat boring and just not getting my full attention such as &quot;The Third Expedition&quot;. I know it was needed in the book but I didn't like it. I did like how incorporated social issues in the book though, like censorship and racism. In all I liked the book through it's ups and downs."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Over all I liked the Martian Chronicles, but I don't think it deserved a five. Mostly because there was nothing that would inspire me to change my life in any way. It never made me cry. No hero or heroine ever died to preserve their virtue. I never got attached to a specific charcter, (except for Ylla who never re-entered the story after chapter one). However, not everything I have to say about this book is nagative. It was a great collection of stories that kept you on your seat. It held you in suspense. It was a great puzzle to fit together. My favorite story was probably Usher II. It was purely evil, and thats not something you find often in a book. Other chapters I liked were &quot;And The Moon Be Still As Bright&quot; and &quot;Night Meeting.&quot; The only chapters I really didn't like were &quot;The Earth Men&quot; and &quot;The Third expedition.&quot; It's not that I didn't really like them, they just weren't my favorites."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This story, in it's own age, was probably nothing more than a startling look into a future of a planet that we could not yet reach. A look at an age filled with space travel, and strange creatures of a different race. But today, it's just another science fiction novel on a row filled with classics, sitting next to 2001, and A Brave New World. But, apon reading it you discover more to it than that, you see a philosophy, and thought that most could not have reached. Apon reaching the end of the book, you find a startling paradox that is worthy of a Japanese Proverb. In my own opinion, My favorite story was &quot;Usher II&quot;, but then again, my least favorite was &quot;Way In The Middle Of The Air&quot; so I guess you could say I was evenly distributed. But over all, I say it is worthy of it's classic status, and should continue to be read by students al over the world."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury is one of the few science fiction writers who actually writes something worth reading.

Feel free to form you own opinions."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Martian Chronicles was a good and interesting science fiction novel.

It was detailed and painted a good mental picture."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray bradbury's book, The Martian Chronicles, was a complicated book. It was hard to read because nothing tied together, and every story was left with out an end. I understood it but never really liked it that much.

This was reviewed by Stephanie :o"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Possibly one of the greatest pieces of literature of all time.

Stories that we not only can enjoy, but should grow from."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I really thought it was an alright book. I am honestly not a book reader so I really didn't get into it. Since this book was ficticional, I really didn't care because I like non-fictional books that pertain to my everyday life. Martian Chronicles is the kind of book that only certain readers like and enjoy. I for one am not that kind of person. No offense to any readers whom really liked this book. I admit that if I might of spent more time in trying to relate to this book maybe my opinion would change. The only story I liked to a certain point was &quot;The Luggage Store.&quot; So I would recommend it. In conclusion, I may not of liked this book as much as others, but keep it in mind this is my opinion."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book displays Ray Bradbury's incredible imagination and talent to make Mars, and life on Mars (something that could become very real) come to life. This book is a must - read for all sci-fi lovers and for people who like a good twist in their stories. Bradbury always comes up with some shock to end you with; leaving you wanting more and more. But since he has written 6 thousand other things we are very fortunate to have more. Don't let this be the one you don't read."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I love The Martian Chronicles~~it's definitely one of my all~time favorite books. It pulls you into it; you get curious and can't put it down. I reccomend it to anyone who has an imagination.To people who think it's too unrealistic~ fiction isn't SUPPOSED to be reaslistic....that's the whole point. And in order to read it, you have to totally escape reality and let the author invade your mind with ideas and thoughts you would never think of by yourself. That's the fun of it! :o)"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is probably one of the best and most worthwhile books I've ever read. As a fun, exciting space story the book reads very well, but the true beauty of this work lies deeper-- in its examination of the philosophy of the human race. Although this book was written about fifty years ago, the message of it rings as true today as it did when it was first published."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Well, now I see why it this book is considered a classic. I found it to be tremendous. My only complaint is that is rather short and it was over too quickly. I wanted more! Bradbury just has a neat way of describing things, I found myself constantly amused, yet very interested in where each story would go next. I wouldn't say I loved every story, but most of them are great if not good. &quot;The Third Expedition&quot; is the best short story I have EVER read period. The book would be worth getting just for that one alone. Fortunately, the rest of the book is enjoyable, too!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Far too often writers are recognized long after a work has been written. In the case of Ray Bradbury, his time came very quickly, and the world paused to see what came next. The Martian Chronicles are a masterpiece of Sci-Fi. Ray has built a world in which you are just happy to spend time, and every page draws you deeper into the rich story line. The human experience and the highly descriptive landscape of the fictional Mars universe could not feel more natural. This story has been, and will be, a model for every Sci-Fi writer to come. No one captured the essence of Mars the way Ray has. A bit violent in parts, it deals with many strong conflicts. One of the best that you can get in the genre."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is a great book.

Anyway you go about it Bradbury can write it. An excellent book all scifi lovers should read... An enchanting novel that can almost weave a spell around you."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"It's been many years since I last read this collection, and I was surprised on several levels. I'd forgotten the lyrical language, laying the visual scenes and emotions down so clear you can see and feel them. Some of the ideas and concepts he was dealing with (exploitation of a new world; how a race might react to being invaded, how will religions adjust to meeting other races) are current topics still. Indeed, Stanley Kim Robinson focused on some of them in his Mars trilogy. But I was reminded that this book is a product of its time, especially when dealing with the roles of women and nuclear family, which stayed firmly in the 1950s. But some of the stories, notably Night Meeting, The Fire Balloons and The Martian are still gems. And it's always good read the old classics -- it helps one to appreciate where the new ones came from."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I cant think of any other book that can be discribed by all of these words at once. true, it isnt the most scientificly sound book, but that is hardly the point. the style of this book is very intresting, and i love the way that almost every story is unconnected, but as a whole they fit perfectly. a few of the storys are a little dated, but that only adds to the overall story. it reads more like a dramatic history then a normal fiction. one thing i dont like though, is after the great war breakes out on earth. i know that many people would return to earth to help loved ones or to defend their contry of origin, but i have a hard time believing that every single person would leave, save for a few who were left behind accidently. i think it would be more likely that a good number of people would stay on mars of their own free will. thats my only negative comment. when i read this book, i couldnt help but think of the colonization of american. how the humans(europeans) came to mars(N. america) which was already inhabited by martians(indians). it was hopeful and bleak at the same time. masterful. by all means, read it!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Mars fascinates us. We've probed and photographed our neighbor for years but never managed to visit in person. Our pulp prophets have launched thousands upon thousands of occupying armadas from its orbit, their commanders green-skinned and tentacled and wanting to be taken to our leaders. Ray Bradbury, though, gently subverts fact and expectation in The Martian Chronicles, with humanity becoming both explorers and invaders of the Red Planet.Chronicles binds 26 of shorts and short shorts -- most original to the collection, some not -- into an overarching narrative about man's arrival on, settlement in and abandonment of Mars. The initial stories weave horror into the blend, the planet's telepathic inhabitants considering the earthlings to be romantic rivals (\\"Ylla\\"), insane (\\"The Earth Men\\") and, finally, marauders (\\"The Third Expedition\\"), with fatal results. Only after disease runs rampant among the inhabitants does man begin to colonize, ushering in a looser middle section. \\"The Green Morning\\" re-imagines the myth of Johnny Appleseed. \\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\" tackles race relations. A lonely couple mourning the loss of a child finds unexpected comfort in \\"The Martian.\\" But colonies can't survive without support from the motherland, a theme the final stories tighten around. With war raging back home, a business owner gets ensnared by bitter irony (\\"The Off Season\\"), a frustrated Romeo learns that there are worse fates than loneliness (\\"The Silent Towns\\") and a widowed inventor faces \\"The Long Years\\" with the family he fashioned for himself.Despite Bradbury's mastery of the short story, Chronicles never quite comes together. His infatuation with middle America (\\"Rocket Summer,\\" \\"Interim\\"), emphasis on the evils of censorship (\\"Usher II\\") and embracing of facile humanism (\\"The Million-Year Picnic\\") appear anachronistic when viewed from Mars' desert wastes. Also, continuity isn't his strong point; the capabilities, culture and even appearance of the Martians varies from piece to piece. But when read individually, the stories still have the power to steal both your breath and imagination. Chronicles' threads are stronger than their frayed sum."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Unlike most science fiction stories written before the improvements in scientific knowledge rendered the depictions of the environments of other planets completely incorrect, this one has stood the test of time. The reason is that it is fundamentally not a story about Mars, but a satire on how humans behave. When the first human explorers land on Mars and encounter the Martians, the humans are astonished at the reaction of the Martians. The Martians do not celebrate their arrival and consider the humans insane and in some cases kill them.Unfortunately for the Martians, a human-introduced disease wipes nearly all of them out, leaving the planet essentially empty. The greedy and exploitative humans begin to colonize the planet, turning it into an extension of Earth \\"civilization\\", such as it is. In many ways, society on Earth has deteriorated, there is brutal censorship of ideas, and most books have been burned out of existence in a manner similar to Bradbury's other classic, \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\"Racial bigotry in its' most raw form in the south is also the topic of one story in the chronicles, as the blacks in the southern United States manage to purchase rockets and leave Earth for Mars. Finally, as there is the prospect of a global nuclear war on Earth, most of the human inhabitants of Mars fly back to Earth, only to be annihilated when the war breaks out. The few people on Mars that did not fly back and a small number of people who managed to flee Earth before the war are now the only \\"Martians\\" left.With the clear historical parallel of the European colonization of the Western Hemisphere as an obvious backdrop, Bradbury created a story that is unfortunately the most realistic depiction of how the exploration of other planets will take place. Rather than be changed for the better by this dramatic event, humans will most likely change the environment of the planet for the worst."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury is a timeless author. His storytelling borders on poetic. The Martian Chronicles was the first book of his I had ever read. After 15 years I just completed my second reading and am no less moved by his work.A lot is accomplished in this short work of science fiction and fantasy. Its opening chapters center around Earthmen attempting to land on Mars and communicate with its not so welcoming inhabitants. As the book progresses war on Earth makes Mars either a refuge or an asylum, depending upon one's point of view. The final chapter of this book is particularly moving. The final page, the final few paragraphs send shivers down my spine and cause me to pause in wonder.As an added side note, there is one chapter titled Usher II and involves a man who constructs a house replete with images and scenes from Edgar Alan Poe's stories. This is just an added bonus to us Poe fans.I do recommend this to anyone, especially as an introduction to Bradbury's work. While not hardcore science fiction, it definitely has many similar elements that make the genre so compelling."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I typically don't like short stories because I find that they are usually over before I am drawn into them. However, Bradbury delievers short stories in such a way that I found myself unable to put the book down. This stories are tied together thematically in that they collectively tell the story of the colonization of Mars. There is humor, tragedy, social commentary and more in this amazing collection. I appreicate how Bradbury uses the sci-fi genre as a platform to make some profound observations about human nature. This was my first exposure to Bradbury and I can't wait to try out some of his other works. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I've never read Bradbury prior to picking up this book for a class. Very intriguing stuff, and I'll definitely read more of his work if I get the chance. It makes for some great comparisons/discussions on imperialism, colonization and all that good stuff, while also immersing you in a completely new world. One of my favorite chapters was \\"There Will Come Soft Rains,\\" in which an abandoned house on Earth continues its daily routine of making food, cleaning the house, alerting its (former) occupants of the time and events, etc. Only towards the end do we see the silhouettes of the occupants as the only remaining paint on the side of the house; everything else has been seared away. An interesting look at what Earth could become, and the role that Mars or any other planet may play."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" (1950) was Bradbury's second book to be published and a consecrative one. The author received immediate attention from sci-fi lovers, publishers and general public.This book is not really a novel, but a collection of short stories describing Mars' colonization, from 1999 till 2026 where Bradbury's future is already our past! Nevertheless it is a mesmerizing piece of literature.Bradbury writes in poetical prose style. Most of these tales transmits a deep sense of melancholy, as if the author has already passed judgment over Human Kind and found it guilty; guilty of greed, selfishness, short-sightedness and ruthlessness. In other words the same sins showed whenever different human cultures get abruptly in touch.The initial stories describe the ill-fated initials Human expeditions and their weird relationship with the Martians. \\"The Third Expedition\\" is really touching and chilling at the same time.From then on, Humans are left alone with all Mars at their disposition for better or worse.Colonization start in earnest as described from \\"The Settlers\\" to \\"The Off Season\\" while in Earth atomic war menace evolve into actual devastating war.Bradbury proposes the reader different approaches to the subject: phantasmagoric as in \\"The Martian\\" or performing homage to Edgar Allan Poe and criticizing censorship as in \\"Usher II\\".The last tales describe Mars almost depleted of Human life with poignant sadness.This is not hard sci-fi, it is almost oneiric fantasy, so do not expect strict logic. Relax and let emotions flow free!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Great book for enjoyable read. Written in the 1940's it looks into the future (1990's and 2000's). Great ideas to talk to high school and college kids. Unfortunate use of the \\"n\\" word makes it questionable for use. Although the look at the prediction of the treatment of Southern Blacks is interesting and can be a topic of discussion for advanced classes. Gomez's Martian meeting and their discussion of time is fascinating and a great discussion maker. How about writers taking type writers to Mars? So much for the computer.

The Martian Chronicles is a wonderful book from the genius mind of Ray Bradbury. Written in the early 1940's The Martian Chronicles is Bradbury's most famous book.With the invention of the atom bomb the people of America foresee nuclear war. So the only logical explanation is to go to mars right. Of course. So America sends up some test explorations of mars. They didn't go to well and most of them ended up dying. One of them the space team missed mars somehow and ended up on another planet that looked like earth and was in the year of 1928. On it was all of their dead relatives brothers, sisters, grandparents and parents. When they went to sleep in each of their old houses and went to sleep the captain felt something odd. He felt cold like there was something very wrong. He got up to get some water and when he started running his brother got up and killed him.This book is about love, deceit, friendship and betrayal. Ray Bradbury really lets you picture the scene. Not only can you see it but you can feel it. You can feel how scared the explorers are when they have troubles. How sad they are when they see a fellow crewmember die. Some times it's wonderful but sometimes it's horrifying. One part actually made me feel the pain of being shot by lots of little poisonous bees.This book is sci-fi but all types of people would enjoy it. There is romance, mystery, action and adventure. It is a great book and I highly recommend it to people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Although parts of Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" are over 60 years old, segments that where once published in magazines before being included in this much important volume of Mars colonization work, it is still some of the freshest SF you can read and certainly this book is easily a contender for one of the all time SF greats. Bradbury deals with the topic of mankind leaving Earth behind in the pursuit of adventure and discovery on Mars which usually results in the destruction of themselves or the home world they have founded with very little compromise between because wherever mankind goes he can not escape the one thing he always brings with him - that is... HIMSELF. The is the core of what colonization SF should be about. TMC consists of 26 short stories, some interconnected, others not, producing poetry of modern literature coupled with stories that capture the feel of the early Twilight Zone episodes (something this book would have innovated). \\"Rocket Summer\\" is a short poetic story that lasts a single page, \\"Ylla\\" a strange story of a Martian couple who live very out of the ordinary lives and express extraterrestrial emotions foreign to our own. \\"The Earth Men\\" is a very interesting story where other worlds are believe in relativism where truth is purely subjective and but a creation of the power of the mind. It sets the tale up for how some humans from Earth make first contact and have trouble convincing the Martians that they are real. This is just a fraction of the genius at work. It is hard to imagine that a SF novella could be so crammed packed with such timeless imagery.(note: the story of the black evacuation is in this edition)"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This wonderfully poetic collection of loosely-connected science fiction shorts is best summed up by a quote on the jacket of a version I own, which reads, \\"Man conquered Mars, and in that instant, Mars conquered him.\\" Bradbury describes in his 1946 novel man's future exploration and colonization of Mars, from 1999-2026. The process isn't an easy one, to be sure, for Mars and its residents are all too aware of how Earth's inhabitants have treated their home, and wish to thwart a repeat performance on the red planet. Bradbury's Martians break tradition from the classic aliens of comic books and B movies, however; they're much more cerebral, in every sense of the word. Telepathy and illusionism replace lasers and ray-guns, and perhaps their most potent defense is giving the marauding Earthlings enough rope to hang themselves with.Infighting, pollution, censorship, and greed are but a few of means through which Bradbury's space travelers prevent themselves from realizing their missions' goals. And those who do succeed in beginning life anew on Mars are summoned back to an apocalyptic Earth that needs human capital to wage its wars. The Martian Chronicles illustrates beautifully but bleakly how the problems faced by a future Earth are inevitable on immaculate Mars, too, should humans gain a foothold there through routine space travel.Bradbury's writing is always excellent, always haunting. He's descriptive without being wordy. He addresses pain and longing in a poignant and beautiful way, illustrated in Chronicles in a couple of memorable chapters featuring characters who mistakenly think they've been reunited with lost loved ones on Mars. The Martian landscape is populated by all sorts of ghosts, and it's a pleasure to read about them courtesy of Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book is no less than a classic. When I took ithome from the library and began, I was hooked for days.This is actually the book that inspired me to read Bradbury.The book is familiar, the Martians are familiar. The shortstories that the master Bradbury writes are some of his bestworks ever. This is not a story. This is a history of thefuture.THIS IS JUST A GOOD BOOK!Even though I'm young, I don't see why that makesa difference in enjoying good literature. THIS is goodliterature.

Bradbury weaves horror and race relations and man'sfailings and triumphs and even Poe into the tapestry. Butwhat holds it all together is his magical descriptions ofthe planet's landscape and its people. Given what we knowabout Mars today, the book might seem outdated to some.Still, it's pleasant to think that Bradbury's poetic visionof Mars might have been the truest. A fine starting placefor the science fiction genre."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Absolutely superb short stories chronicling the attempts by a warring Earth to land explorers on Mars. The golden-eyed natives enjoyed poetry, music, canals of wine, and telepathic prowess. But how would they react to the tall, blue-eyed, white-skinned aliens visiting from the distant blue-green planet? Through distinctly Bradbury poetic prose, the reader is drawn into the soul of both visitor and host in this mesmerizing, aesthetic account of their meetings. Not modern effects-driven attempts to scare or battle, the Martian Chronicles have taste, sight, smell, sound and most of all touch, as a result of the fluid metaphoric and similistic command of the English language by the master himself: Ray Bradbury"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I started this book with high expectations and perhaps that's part of the reason that I didn't find it as enjoyable or profound as I had hoped. Bradbury paints the future of Earth and humankind as bleak. For example, every human in it seems to have a Redneck persona. The few that don't are examples of genius gone mad. The Martians aren't presented as being any more sophisticated. The only real difference between them and Earth people is that they have telepathic powers. I realize that I'm reading this book 50+ years after the first publication, and perhaps Bradbury really had this pessimistic outlook on mankind, but it's hard to believe, as Bradbury wants us to do, that a people could achieve travel to Mars if everyone in that world acted like they're out of a poorly scripted Western. For example, one would assume that the first ships to Mars would have only the brightest and best trained astronauts on board, but those ships are manned by astronauts that act like a bunch of squabbling kids at camp with guns added. In short, lots of major points in this book just don't make sense.The book is extremely sexist. Nearly every single male (Earthling or Martian) is either stupid, gullible, easy to anger or ready to kill. With only one exception (the old man in The Martian) the only ones that show any compassion are crazed lunatics (also doing killing). All of the Women are presented as docile, subservient and nonviolent (lets get real). Evenassuming that Bradbury was writing the book as a warning as to what the world may become and how we may ultimately destroy ourselves, a more realistic range of personalities would have made the book more believable and, therefore, more effective.With that said, there are several stories in the book that are very well done in their own right. They were released as short stories before inclusion into the book showing that they can stand on their own. Usher II is definitely the highlight of the book. Another is, There Will Come Soft Rains.I gave the book three stars because, in spite of my objections, I think the book is readable and does have an important message."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I enjoyed THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, which is essentially a collection of loosely connected short stories about the world's attempt to colonize Mars over a thirty-year period. While I don't consider this novel a masterpiece like Bradbury's brilliantly dystopian FAHRENHEIT 451, it's still a very fine effort that's worth your time.While THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is technically a work of science fiction, it contains very little hard science. Most of the stories are really just an excuse for Bradbury to engage in some biting social commentary. I found most of the stories to be a complete pleasure to read. Many of them are written in a witty, whimsical style. Bradbury is not a particularly subtle writer, but I do admire his sharp satirical voice, especially when it comes to his insights into the dark side of human nature.This book was written in the 1940s, and reads a bit like a relic from an earlier era. Stories that were probably cutting edge for their time (such as the story condeming racism) now come across as quite obvious and heavy-handed. The book's central concept -- humanoid life on Mars -- is also quite laughable by modern scientific standards. So if you're looking for modern, cutting edge SF, THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is probably not for you. I would instead recommend Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars novels written in the 1990s, which are far more scientifically believable.But if you enjoy tales with strong humanistic themes, THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is quite satisfying. It's imaginative, well written, and its moral messages are right on target. This book is considered by many to be one of the greats, and I can definitely see why."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"People are evil and callous! It's in our nature to go around knocking down ancient sculptures without a thought! What innocent but beautiful alien races could possibly survive our barbarous passage?! Though an interesting read, this book just about overdoes the whole pessimism about humankind thing. Almost all the human characters, even the first astronauts to land, are stupid, ignorant, and impulsive. Sure, there's people like that, but almost all humans in the story are glib thoughtless sorts you'd like to punch in the face. The descriptive language and writing style is brilliant, but sometimes the plot itself is almost too much to deal with.The part where the black people go to Mars is ridiculous. Even as they're leaving for a new life, they are still cowed by some white guy on his creaky porch.The sequence where this ugly lady chases the last man on Mars all around the planet made me roll my eyes.On the other hand, the Poe chapter and the &quot;There will be soft rains&quot; chapter were particularly interesting.I have very mixed feelings about this book and therefore give it three stars.The book was written shortly after World War II, so like George Orwell, it's not surprising that Bradbury looked to a grim future."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The first time I read this book, a few years ago, I loved it and I worshipped Ray Bradbury. I found it profound and funny and sad and everything a good book should be and then some.The second time I read it...not so much. Maybe I'm getting older and more cynical. His bright-eyed enthusiasm and innocence is still refreshing, but the bemoaning of All We've Ruined gets a little old. And I find it a little disturbing that he repeatedly kills off the boring close-minded characters... like they don't deserve to live. And we haven't lost our imaginations and this planet isn't done for -- yet. Amazing how such an enthusiastic optimist can have so little hope.There are still gems and beauty here. The best thing about it is that it's not at all what you expect from the title(an effect clearly lost the second time through) and the absurdity of man is wonderfully funny at times. I guess I mostly just wish it didn't harp on the same things story after story.

Ray Bradbury is a very descriptive write, and that quality let him write a fast-paced and descriptive book. His writing gives you a sense of being therre on Mars, observing, while nobody would know you were there. His story is supposed be set in the present, although it is necessary to know that the story takes place in the future. When Bradbury wrote &lt;I&gt;The Martian Chronicles&lt;/I&gt; the year was 194 so 1999 would be a reasonable year to expect settling on the moon. &lt;I&gt;The Martian Chronicles&lt;/I&gt; is a very well written and descriptive book by Ray Bradbury.

I would urge, you the reader, to think about the cultural climate at which time this book was written. What is masterful about Bradbury's art is that the highly political issues of civil rights, atomic war, etc. are not so much in the forefront as some of the other readers have led you to believe. The main question of this book, as it is and was with NASA space program is \\"what of the colonization of mars?\\" So, there is your task, what is your answer, how do you feel?

The Martian Chronicles will not be remembered in the annuals of sci-fi writing for amazing new technologies, weapons, aliens, or bravery. It will be remembered for the desperation of the Martians to preserve themselves, the classic (on Earth) destruction of native peoples because of introduced diseases (and rememberThe War of the Worlds?), the arrogant aggressiveness and moral poverty of the stewards of Earth, and the classic \\"history as written by the victors\\" ending.It's enough to get one addicted to sci-fi, even though these stories date from half a century ago.I also have an old cassette ofLeonard Nimoyreading \\"Usher II\\" and \\"There will come soft rains.\\" These stories, and the others, are haunting, and full of visions of mind control issues and future outcomes fueled by the Cold War.For the serious sci-fi fan, this is an important work."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"If I were to write a jacket blurb for this book, it would go something like this:\\"Ray Bradbury does it again with another stellar title. This is a novel of science fiction, mystery, beauty, and conflict. Starting with the first rockets to Mars, Bradbury tells the story of Mankind's spreading and fleeing to and from the planet. It is a great story and is not only for science fiction fans but also for anyone who enjoys a good book.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I picked it up thinking it wouldn't be to amazing, but once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. It isn't just another science fiction novel; it's much deeper than that. I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friends. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't willing to read and understand this, because it's a bit higher then comfortable reading level for me, but it's really not that hard. Any extra effort you put into reading this book is generously rewarded.There really is no major character in this book, because the same person rarely appears in multiple chapters. It is a book of short stories, so this is I picked Captain Wilder of the Fourth Expedition as the \\"most\\" main character for two reasons. One, he plays an important part in the colonization of Mars as the captain of the first successful expedition to the planet (there were actually 3 attempts before his success). Two, he is one of the few characters to appear in more than one chapter. I think he is somewhat similar to Tobias MacIvey from A Land Remembered in several aspects. They are both leaders, Tobias of his Cattle Company and Wilder of the Fourth Expedition and the mission to the outer planets, and they are both peaceful but powerful. They rarely fight anyone, and when they do, they never started it, they have a good reason to be in it, and they usually win. They do differ, because Tobias is always trying to make a living and drive cattle and get money, making him a bit more economic-minded than Wilder, who wanted to preserve the natural Martian landscape as it was when they first landed, making him a bit more conservative. I believe these two characters would get along fine. They never pick fights with anyone, so I can't see why they would with each other. If there was any interaction, I think it would be cooperation.There are many conflicts of all different shapes and sizes in this book, so it is hard to determine the most significant one. I think one of the most major ones is between man and his fellow man. There are many examples of this throughout the book, from one on one struggles to gang fights to full scale wars. The largest of these is an atomic war on earth that destroys the entire continent of Australia in the first blow. Right after that, everyone is called home from Mars and only a handful is left. The book shows no clear resolution to this at the end. As one character puts it near the end of the book, \\"I take it most of Earth's a shambles, but the war goes on.\\"One theme of this book is man's nature to ruin beautiful things, especially natural beauty like that of Earth and Wars. Near the middle of the book there is a small chapter who wants to go to mars on a rocket because he is afraid of an \\"atom war\\". Later in the book, we have that atomic war on Earth and actually destroy the entire continent of Australia, among other things. With mars, there is a chapter devoted to that too. It says \\"The rockets came like locusts, swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke. And from the rockets ran men with hammers to beat the strange world into a shape the was familiar to the eye to bludgeon away all the strangeness, their mouths fringed with nails so they resembled steel-toothed carnivores, spitting them into their swift hands as they hammered up frame cottages and scuttled over roofs with shingles to blot out the eerie stars and fit green shades to pull against the night.\\" And this is exactly what we do to mars. We kill off the Martian race, and then use their ancient cities for target practice. We then bulldoze what remains and build a city of steel on a once beautiful metropolis. This theme is easily applicable to real life. Basically, the life lesson is to appreciate natural beauty instead of destroying it. That's a moral many people could use."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury by his own admission has always deemed himself to be more than a SciFi writer. And this book has stood the test of time. Written so long ago that the calendar dates 1999 or 2001 seemed soi distant and perhaps not attainable by Americans living in the Cold War.These are a collection of vignettes about the early exploration and human settling on Mars. The novel's Mars is radically unlike the one we know now so much about. To wit, the real Mars is a place where humans could only live in enclosed climate controlled domes akin to what we saw in the Schwarznegger film \\"Total Recall\\".These are great and timeless stories. I think I read the book as a teen and a few years later with the first images transmitted back to earth from the Viking Mars lander the news actually cut away to interview Bradbury himself.When the book was adapted into a screen play with Rock Hudson and other prominent actors the opening scene plays homage to the Viking lander. We see the lander excavating a small amount of martian soil from the lifeless surface of that planet. And then a voiceover announces \\"..however, had the craft only landed a mile or so away it would have seen the remnants of a once vibrant civilization!!\\" and sure enough you see just over the immediate horizon all manner of structures suggesting intelligent life and habitation.One story in the collection involves a post nuclear war, fully-automated house. The computer that runs the house has somehow managed to survive and function even though all its residents were fried in the nuclear blast. In our own era of programmable this and that (coffee makers, household thermostats etc) the automated house does seem prophetic! A voice announces wich bills are payable today and having had to pay online at the last minute, I know I'd pay to have such a feature."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I read this book shortly after graduating High School and still read it from time to time. This collection of short stories is perfect for readers of all genres, be it sci-fi, mystery, romance, suspence & thriller or anything else.Bradbury wrote this collection in the 1940's, framing the storyline in the distant future (1999). Each story is centered around mans arrival and subsequent \\"conquest\\" of the planet Mars, but that the extra-terrestrial location is the only constant in this collection.This is not a hard sci-fi book filled with technical terms, theoretical physics and lengthy explanations of how pieces of technology work. The subject matter is very poetic and philosophical. You could breeze through this book in a single day, but if you do, read it again, because you're certain to have missed something special in this collection."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Here is one of the highest examples of the sci-fi genre. Social commentary on the human race in the form of fiction about made-up beings from another planet. This is an almost flawless demonstration of the art form. Dated, but that only makes it more charming. Bradbury's Martians are superior to men (more sensitive, more warrior-like, more artistic, more philosophical, more cultured, more advanced, more intelligent) while at the same time not possessing any attributes that are not common to men (see the foregoing list). The synopsis is: humans repeatedly attempt to colonize Mars, only to be initially frustrated by successful defenses by the Martians. The Martians use telepathic mind games, old-fashioned gunfighting, and plain ol' marital jealousy to delay the inevitable for a few years. But we keep coming, and we turn the New World into a interplanetary suburb in short order. Eventually, after we've ruined Mars (like, goes this story line, the white man ruins everything), we answer the call to return to an Earth devasted by the stereotypical total nuclear (or \\"atomic\\") war. But this synopsis is like summarizing 'Gone With The Wind' as a Civil War book. Great one, not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I would have to say that reading this book was one the most enjoyable book reading experiences of my life. I can't think of too many books that kept me in such a constant state of total immersion and pure enjoyment then this one. Everything about it sings out originality and, as mentioned, enjoyment. Seekers of deep reading pleasure need look no further, I have your book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles was a book. I read it. It was really good. The martians are red and I can relate to this because the martians are red. I like martians, but I like marshmallows more. Anyway, I recomend this book.I recomend this martian because everyone can relate. People these days are really weird. They walk the streets day and night looking for food. If I was a martian, I'd read this book.Additionally, I loved this book because of its sophisticated diction and wild wild west. The words in this book blew me away. They used the word martian a lot and the book was about martians so I was satisfied. The wild west is too much to handle but this book is about martians.Finally, martians can speak and beak. I read this book and now I am well bred. This book really spoke to me. I realized that now Mars is a planet. The planetarians aren't just for planets no more. Martians book I read.In conclusion, I recomend this book X1000. It was the best and I'm a martian book reader."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"In spite of Bradbury's prose, which is lyrical and incredibly enthusiastic, I really didn't care for most of these tales. The book feels very dated, especially with it's cold-war fears of blase censorship and social propriety. Although the story about blacks in the south going to Mars to escape Jim Crow is interesting from an anthropological point of view. (Apparently a sci-fi writer in the 1950's could more easily conceive of interstellar travel than imagine a civil rights movement). But a lot of these feel like unfinished fragments, and even the ones that stand well on their own get sort of muddled and lost amidst the more outlandish ones. A genuinely sorrowful tale about a family abandoning a war-torn earth for a lonely, red planet just doesn't mesh into the same universe as someone who builds robots to stage an elaborate, Edgar Allen Poe styled revenge fantasy. It's a mixed bag of poignancy and kitsch"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The book said that we would be on Mars in about 30 years and i thought that was way untrue it seems to close for us to be leaving a planet that desn't have to much wrong with it"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles was a very weird book. The book was written in 1946 and was very outdated for my taste. Although the stories that I did read I found them only somewhat interesting but not horrible. And the stories that I did not read and learned what they were in class were very strange and for the most part uninteresting.Although I did not like this book one story that I did find interesting was Way In The Middle of the Air. This story showed the controversy of blacks and whites in any society and I think that that subject is something important to talk about in a book. The story that I liked least was Ylla because I really didn't pay attention to what was happening and the events of the story. Also it was very boring and the story was retarded and horrible. Poor Ylla, I can't believe she would stay with a total jerk like Yll!!!I think this book is a boring and worhtless book to read in school because it shows nothing about English class and is really a pointless book to read. This book, I think should be updated and it could be much better. The book could even be a good science fiction movie and with the help of Hollywood it could be a hit!!!!! Well for now good by and if you are reading this book GOOD RIDDENS!!!!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles, by Ray Bradbury, is a science fiction novel written in the late 1940's. Each chapter is a small story about humans migrating to Mars because of war on Earth. While a few of the chapters relate to each other and have the same characters, most of them are entirely separate short stories. The book starts off by describing the first few expeditions to Mars. Humans are able to breath and live healthily on Mars. When humans back on Earth realize this, they start moving to Mars to start a new life. Giant rockets shuttle people to Mars. Bradbury sort of predicts the future of technology. The book references the year 2026 but we have not even attempted to put humans on Mars yet. By the middle of the book, Mars is populated by hundreds of thousands of humans. There are a few episodes where humans come in contact with Martians; however, most of the Martian population is extinct. The Martians take a different form in each story. Some look like humans while others take the shape of alien bodies. The Martians are strange creatures but show no desire to harm humans. Bradbury shows how humans would relate and communicate to other people in a realistic way. The humans destroy ancient Martian towns and start to trash the clean planet. In my opinion, this is exactly what humans would do if we moved to a new planet. As I got farther in the book, I saw a pattern develop. Humans begin to wreck Mars just like they wrecked Earth. You will have to read the book to find out what happens. The time that this novel was written is significant because nuclear weapons had just been developed. I think Bradbury is trying to share his view on the outcome on nuclear war. Eventually, Earth will get so destroyed that humans will have to migrate to other planets. Overall I would not recommend this book to a reader who enjoys a flowing novel. This book is very choppy and there are many different stories going on at once. I did not like this book simply because I like novels with a continuous story line. However, if you like short stories about science fiction, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I though this book was EXTREMELY confusing.

Anyone who has read \\"The Illustrated Man\\" knows that short stories are not Bradbury's strength. Reading this book was like reading a collection of long-lost post-it notes with ideas that popped into Ray's head late at night before he fell asleep.It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to a casual sci-fi or Bradbury fan."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"We, an English course at a German Gymnasium, rate the book, The Martian Chronicles, a two because the structure of the book seemed quite confusing to us. Despite this fact we all liked the first couple of chapters a whole lot since the idea of settling a foreign planet was shown in an exciting way. After reading half through the book most of us put it away because from now on the stories got boring... Most of us found the effort of reading 308 pages a waste of time!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book is HIGHLY overvalued. Most of the stories meander and are ultimately unsatisfying. Only a handful are meritorious, but they do not serve as justifiable rationale to purchase the book. Read Classic Stories I and The Illustrated Man instead."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury is my one of my favorites of the older generation of speculative fiction writers. He blends social commentary with strong and traditional plotting in a way that is both moving and accessible.The Martian Chronicles (published in 1950) is a set of short stories which together create a tapestry of life on Mars. The first story, \\"Rocket Summer\\" begins with the first human expedition to Mars and the book ends with \\"The Million Year Picnic\\" with what is most likely the last expedition. These stories are not concerned with accuracy or believability in the sense of science and xenoanthropology. Instead, they should be seen as a series of \\"What If\\" stories which illuminate all aspects of human behaviour: good, bad, and ugly. The believability comes in the way that people treat each other in times of great stress.You won't catch a fan of the genre giving this book less than five stars. It is too important and too well-written to be considered anything less than a classic. I will say that it is not my favorite Bradbury. Some of the stories are stronger than others. I think that some have not aged as well, and are too preoccupied with the concerns of the early 1950s when the book was released. Still, if you are interested in Bradbury or early speculative fiction then this is a must-read.If you are not familiar with Bradbury's works already, then be aware that it has little in common with recent space opera. If you like writers such as Clifford Simak, Mary Doria Russell, or Michael Swanwick then you are probably will also enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is an incredible work of imagination by one of the Giants of Science Fiction. It is a combination of some previously published shorter works (in some cases altered a bit to fit with the other stories in the collection), and some newer pieces. The book as a whole was first published in May of 1950, with the earliest story first published in June of 1948.Few writers in any genre can make the reader really feel the way Bradbury can. Here he blends longer works, with shorter vignettes, to lay a rich tapestry to the overall book. The longer works tend to be about specific individuals or groups, while the shorter pieces deal with society and the environment, and they set the overall tone and feel of the book. One of my personal favorites is \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" in which Bradbury effectively delivers his message with no characters.Several of the stories included in this book, also are related to other short fiction that Bradbury has written but that doesn't appear in this book. For example, \\"Usher II\\" (originally published as \\"Carnival Of Madness\\") clearly comes after \\"The Exiles\\" (originally published as \\"The Mad Wizards Of Mars\\"), and \\"Way In The Middle Of The Air\\" clearly comes before \\"The Other Foot\\". Both \\"The Exiles\\" and \\"The Other Foot\\" appear in \\"The Illustrated Man\\"."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Although it was a little confusing at first, I finally understood that it was a collection of Bradbury's short stories. Basically, it is about men pioneering to Mars and trying to civilize it, but alas, fail, save for Walter Gripp, Genevieve, and Timothy and his family. The Martians, before dying out completely, had a few tricks of their own (i.e. \\"Edward\\" -who is a Martian in disguise-killing his brother, John Black) and they also can be civilized (remember the astronaut talking to the Martian?). In all, it showed how men tried to conquer Mars and make it their own, just as the Europeans took the land from the Indians. History does repeat itself, doesn't it? I think, to some degree, this book represents history, but instead of success, there is a great amount of failure. Gosh! People die too much in this book! But it is a good book, nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I really enjoyed the novel The Martian chronicles by Ray Bradbury.It was a very intresting, and at times disturbing book.

Anyway, I start reading, and after being terribly confused after the first couple chapters, I realize this book is a bunch of short stories loosely (I mean, VERY LOOSELY) linked together. And all of these stories have one point, to comment on societies' flaws. Well, now I have a paper to write for my assignment, and this book made me think more than any other I have ever read (except Catcher In the Rye). The problems with this book is that it rambles sometimes and stories aren't well linked together. A lot of times, they are just trying to find an excuse to put in some of Bradbury's short stories.

It spans several years and tells of the settling of Mars. Most any reader would admit that the book was fascinating.

Ray Bradbury wrote this book in the forties? fifties? He actually thought technology would have progressed so much in the time since he wrote it that we would already be going to Mars. He figured we would have sent the first mission in 1999. He was way ahead of his time, I can say that much. He was way ahead than we are now. The book was incredibly good, though. I really loved it.

I bought it as a gift for my dad and he really likes it so far."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Certainly not. Admittedly there are a few bland points but one must get over the fact that it really _isn't_ a science fiction book. By all means that does not make it bad. Sure, it's off a category or so but that's beside the point. To judge we must judge by quality and meaning, not simply a genre miscalculation.The Martian Chronicles portrays human behavior, ideas, and even fears. There are bland chapters and there are really exciting chapters. It's the feeling in the book that counts. Most books that involve other planets focus on technology, war, or a conflict that is external to the inner most thoughts and feelings of human beings. Bradbury changes that with his unique style in The Martian Chronicles. It doesn't ruin literature with modern literary devices that are overused or overanalyzed, yet applies them when appropriate - without disturbing the quality of the book.Unfortunately it's rather rigid. From discussion with others about the book, you either like it or you dislike it. There isn't a middle ground for The Martian Chronicles. It's worth a read so if possible rent it at your local library. I ended up buying a copy because I find some of the stories rather interesting. Try to make sure to obtain the book that has all the chapters - since I recall in a few versions there is a lack of a certain chapter.Final rating: 3.5 - It's a nice read but isn't a MUST have. The bland chapters are in bad places - it sometimes makes it seem like the book is dragging on instead of progressing smoothly.

I might have saved myself the trouble of reading it, since in the end, I really didn't enjoy it.I'll admit that it was very well written and imaginative, nothing short of what one would expect from Ray Bradbury. The Mars of the future that he creates is one that is easy to believe in (or would be if we didn't already know it wasn't like that), and the changes it goes through over time are almost what is to be expected, sometimes a daring leap away from the expected.So it wasn't bad. It was just boring. Most of the time. The occasional story that was an exciting, thought provoking, and adventuresome escape from reaility. For eight whole pages, it was easy to forget that I am living today, in 2010, in a world in which Mars is uninhabited by human or other. I would get so into that Mars, not wanting it to end. . .And then the next story would start, and I would have to force myself to read, to not fall asleep, for a good 70 or 80 pages until the next 8 pages of joy would sneak up on me.The prose was lyrical and beautiful, and Ray Bradbury's ideas are fresh and different (especially, I imagine, back in the 1940's when it was written). It's really just such a pity that it had to go off and be boring. Because it could have been great. It had potential.I'd love to give the titles of the short stories I particularly enjoyed, but I read the book in French.

It's important to remember that Bradbury wrote these stories in the late 40s, LONG before we had any idea what Mars was actually like (atmosphere, etc.) and long before we entered the space age.

What an outstanding, terrific book that should be required reading for every young reader and won't hurt us older folks either remember to keep dreaming big.

Give them a try, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Written as a number of short stories that build a coherent arc, The Martian Chronicles is the story of mankind's repeated attempts to colonize Mars. Before man, Mars is populated by a psychic race that is in some ways surprising similar to Earth's western civilizations, a suburban utopia of housewives, gardens, and jobs, but with more complex and ancient arts, histories, and literature. Earth's initially missions are all failures, but eventually the Martian race is wiped out and humans colonize the planet, destroying the old beauty that the Martians leave behind. When Earth begins to collapse in nuclear war, Mars is abandoned, left to a few stragglers and some new immigrants. The whole of the work is varied, and each chapter/short story is different: some expository, some humorous, some scientific, some bittersweet, some about Martians, some about humans. There is something haunting and memorable about the text, the last chapters specifically, and while The Martian Chronicles is not my favorite sci-fi work or even my favorite book about an alien race (that would be Asimov's The God's Themselves), it is classic Bradbury: surreal yet suburban, science-fiction but relevant, ironic, enjoyable, bittersweet, and all in all a good book. I recommend it.It is hard to discuss or summarize The Martian Chronicles because of the amount of variety from chapter to chapter in the text. Each chapter reads like an independent short story and could even stand alone. However, as a whole the text does build a definitive arc, creating a final product that is greater than the sum of its parts. As a result of this build up, the last chapters are definitely the best of the bunch--they are the ones that will stick with the reader and carry the most impact. They are also the most depressing, surreal, and haunting of the bunch--haunting is a world that I'll use a lot because it really is the best descriptor of the final effect of this book. While early sections are funny and some later sections truly ironic and cynical, the book ends with the remnants of an abandoned planet, creating a story of remorse, memories, and, in the very end, the possibility of hope. The Martian ghost town is an image that sticks with you. It's magical, unreal, and, yes, haunting.The Martian Chronicles is classic Bradbury in its relevance, however--while the book may end with an abandoned foreign planet, every event implies a lesson and every lesson can be carried over to our domestic culture on earth. Bradbury teaches cynicism, the ignorance and foolishness of humans, our weakness, our hubris (and with it our downfall), the fragility of all people on all planets, and, somehow, ultimately, the human/sentient ability to persevere. It may be about Mars, but this is a very human book. While taking the reader to a foreign landscape, Bradbury ultimately reminds him of his own backyard.There is a lot of good sci-fi out there, and there are better (more original, more unique) examples of alien races, but Bradbury's Martian Chronicles is still worth reading. It's easy to get into and addicting, a very interesting concept, delightfully ironic, a little bit religious, very spiritual, bittersweet and hopeful. I enjoy this book and have read it a few times myself. I recommend it to others, although there is other sci-fi worth reading too. Pick this one up if the idea interests you or if you like Bradbury's other books."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"In August of 1945 the power of the atom was unleashed on the world. In a horrific display of power and energy a single bomb did more damage to a city than months of non-stop bombing to other cities. A Few kilo's of matter released the energy in 12 thousand tons of TNT. The fossil fuel equivalent is equally staggering. America and the allies had won the war and discovered a new source of energy that was thought to be boundless and cheap.The late 19th century and up until this time there was incredible amounts of innovation and improvements in life. Radio, television, the automobile, flight, refrigeration, air conditioning, the diode and transistor, early computers.. Technology was expanding at an exponential rate. Things that were pipe dreams less than 100 years before. like heavier than air flight, were everyday realities. The Earth was well mapped and it was obvious that there would be no more land discoveries on the Earth and people looked to the sky. With technology increasing at a dizzying pace and a new form of energy that was seemingly limitless, many people thought that the colonization of space was right around the corner. If we were running out of room on the earth, no big deal, just open a colony on another world. However, despite all the good things, America and indeed the world, lived under the constant fear of nuclear war.It's against this backdrop that an explosion of space exploration and colonization books were written. The Martian Chronicles is a series of mini stories all interconnected The book begins around the turn of the century with a manned mission to mars. The rocket reaches mars but is never heard from again. It is just a single man and he is killed by a jelous martian husband. The first few trips all fail in interesting various ways, but eventually success is reached and mars is colonized, much to the regret of the Martians. Ultimately, the book is more about humans and human behavior than it is about mars. The book covers everything from racism to mental illness to loneliness to nuclear war and it's aftermath. It shows us at our best and at our worst and disguises it as a book about mars exploration.The stories are all very good and very well written and loosely connected, but connected enough to tell a bigger story. I had a hard time putting this book down and I've read it three times so far and plan on reading it again. Some parts are funny, some parts are scary and some are kinda weird, but it works great. Get this book, you won't be sorry. It's one of the best science fiction has to offer. The only thing near a negative about this book is that it is not \\"hard\\" science fiction. But it doesn't really matter, because the science of space exploration is not really even discussed in the book. It does present a very different planet than the real Mars. But like I said, it's not really about Mars anyway. A definite 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I first heard about \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" when I read Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" a number of years ago. Back then, I was under the impression that the \\"Chronicles\\" was actually a series of books, or at least a very long book. This is not so. The \\"Chronicles\\" is a fairly brief collection of short stories that fit into an overarching fictional history, starting in 1999 and ending in 2026.The book was initially published in 1946 - right after WWII - a time in which the year 2000 must have still seemed a long way off. Due to the specific time frame of the book, it is somewhat dated and less convincing than it must have been in the 1940s. After all, we *live* in the time Bradbury depicts, and the world is of course not the same as in his fiction.But the dates in the book are the only thing that's dated, because the stories themselves are timeless. And I don't say this lightly. For me, the predicate \\"timeless\\" is one of the highest praises I can bestow on a book. This one deserves it.It is most emphatically *not* a science-fiction book per se, and it is not even remotely about technological gadgets. Bradbury himself has likened the book to mythology rather than science-fiction, and I think he's right.Not technology, but human identity and the experience of the ironic - this is the golden thread that runs through the book. From the beginning when men first arrive on Mars and do not at all experience the kind of welcome they expected, to the very end when - well, but let me not tell you how the book ends. Suffice it to say that is full of the ironic. Often it is tragic irony, but always thought-provoking and delightful.Bradbury touches on other themes too: religion, the effect of science on humanity, racism, illusions vs. reality, etc.It's only the second book by Bradbury I've read, so I can't compare it to his other works. But for all those who crave the timeless, this is the real thing.- Jacob Schriftman, Author of the \\"The Crack Beneath the Worlds\\""},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I loved F451 by Bradbury and wanted to read more of his work. Being a huge sci-fi buff, I figured \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" would be a great place to start. The book is definitely well worth the read, and its effects are surprising.I have to admit that I had trouble with the story at first. Because of the lack of knowledge on the \\"Red Planet\\" when the story was written, I had to forget quite a bit of facts (I'm 25). Luckily enough, the story grabs you and keeps you turning pages so that facts don't matter. The book also has an almost romantic quality in its depiction of the future. For example, in 2030+ there are malt shops, soda fountain shops and people still use wired telephones (no cell phones or wireless homephones).The dialogue is also what you'd expect from a 40's and 50's movie. Again, its sort of romantic. I have to admit tho, this book brought with it an amazing array of emotions... Bradbury is one of the few who was actually able to make me laugh out loud (a spectacle to my co-workers). The authors talent also inspires other emotions in the reader.Like F451, \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" has a message for and about humanity, albeit a different message. I'll never regret reading this book, and I bet you won't either."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I read the Martian Chronicles growing up in the early 70's.

Packed full of interwoven stories that depict a world that is all too familiar. It has the same social impact today as it did when these stories were written. The fact that human nature does not change. Bradbury captures that perfectly in these stories. These are not tales for anyone looking for uplifting, life affirming prose. These tales border on the macbre and deliver it in a way that is often humorous. This book is simply a MUST READ for anyone who loves science fiction. This is not a high-speed, action adventure, sceince fiction read. It will appeal to those who are respectful of the genre and not those looking for a fast high."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"A work of science-fiction genius!

This collection of interconnected short stories however, are not abot colonization or even sci-fi, they are more about human nature. Though there arae Marrians in the stories, fewer than half of the stories even include them. They are mostly included as a foil for human charecters, and their true nature is more often then not left to the opinion of the reader. The book does however have several excellent stories, particularly Usher2, a modernized version of Edgar Allen Poes classic The Fall Of The House Of Usher. Bradbury has created a unique world for his charecterts to exist in, the ultimate goal of any scienc fiction work. I really give the book a three and a half,for though some stories are excellent when taken as individuals the book does not work particularly well. Martians are represented inconsistently, as well as several highly improbable acts taking place. For an example I cite the humans abondoning of Mars when WWIII breaks out. The book centers on human nature, so why do his charecters do something that is highly against human nature?"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The book Martian Chronicles was an alright book but kinda boring.

At it's best, it is a masterpiece that simply succeeds at everything. While it may be a collection of short stories, Ray Bradbury molds all of them together beautifully into one coherent whole. This book is very dark but has a surprisingly optimistic and happy ending. The Martian Chronicles should be required reading in all high schools.The Martian Chronicles is my third favorite Bradbury book after Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes, though in some parts it was more enjoyable than both books.FIVE stars. Keep writing masterpieces, Ray."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is actually a collection of stories rather than a novel. Each story is separate from the others, with different characters and different conflicts. Though they are all different they all concentrate on the same subject, mars, and its exploration by the people of earth.The reason I read this book is that after reading Fahrenheit 451 I found Ray Bradbury to be a writer I really liked, and although I didn't like The Martian Chronicles quite as much as Fahrenheit 451, I still enjoyed reading it.At first I was put off by the idea of the stories, but eventually it came to be one of the things I really liked about the book. The stories made it easier for me to pick up the book and read for only short periods at a time.Another thing I liked about this book was Ray Bradbury's descriptive writing style. The descriptions of the Martians and their cities were really detailed. It was interesting to see how Ray Bradbury imagined the inhabitants of mars.The only way I was really let down at all by this book was with the lack of aliens. I kind of expected the book to mainly deal with the aliens of mars, but they didn't really play that big of a part in most of the stories, of course if the had the theme would be different and the book might not have been as good.Overall I thought this book was really good and well worth reading. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates good writing."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I have been reading this one since the mid l950s and still from time to time give it another shot. This is not a \\"happy book\\" by any means. In fact, it can be down right depressing at times. I suppose that is because there is so much of \\"us\\" in it.This work of course can certainly be classified as a classic. It is well written, and at the time of publicaiton, more or less set the standard of the time, and set it quite high. This is a wonderful collection of short stories which are interlinked, concerning the colonization of the Planet Mars. Bradbury, in typical Bradbury style, is able to examin our own civilization threw these stories. Most of the stories are rather sad in nature, ergo, the unhappiness of the book. Through his writing the author more or less makes the point that we certainly do not learn from or mistakes, repeating the same ones over and over again. I absolutely hate the phrase \\"a must read,\\" but in this case sort of am forced to use it. It is certainly a must for any person interested in the history of this genre and you certainly will not be the worse for wear in reading it. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I acquired my first copy of Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" when I was in elementary school back in 1966. My school library had a book fair and my parents had given me some money to spend, when I saw the \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", a paperback version with a cover showing a bright orange Mars against a black, star filled sky, a spaceship in orbit and the ominous face of a Martian superimposed on the planet's surface . . . I knew I had to have it. As soon as I opened the book and began to read, I was hooked . . . forty years later and I'm still wandering through the deserted marble, crystal and glass cities that are scattered across the deserts of Ray Bradbury's Mars.The 1960's were a wonderful time for anyone who was interested in space and science fiction, as I was. The race for the Moon was in full swing, Mercury, Geminii and then the Apollo missions were blasting off from Cape Canaveral every few months . . . it wasn't hard to imagine, as Ray Bradbury wrote in \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", humans traveling to and colonizing the Red Planet. Also, television was in it's golden era with shows like \\"Star Trek\\", \\"The Outer Limits\\", and \\"The Twilight Zone\\", the future looked very bright and promising. Sadly, the future hasn't quite turned out as I expected back then . . .but that's a story for another time and place.\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is a wonderful book, but you will have to put some amount of effort (and imagination) into your reading to get the full benefit from it. If you're interested in scientific and technical accuracy, and prefer the spectacular battles and special effects of \\"Star Wars\\", this may not be the book for you, this is more of a study of humanity set against the backdrop of a beautiful and mysterious alien world. \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is really a collection of short stories that Ray Bradbury wrote, all of which revolve around the theme of humans leaving their own troubled planet (Earth) and attempting to colonize Mars. They find an advanced and mysterious civilization that is in it's twilight years, and the stories explore the encounters between . . . and ultimately, the sad destinies of . . . the two alien races and their way of life.I consider Ray Bradbury to be one of the finest American writers, his ability to bring a story to life is unparalled. When I read \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", it's as if I'm actually walking through the courtyards of those ancient cities, I can feel the Martian sun on my face, hear the water bubbling in the fountains, and feel the loneliness and sadness of the lost Martians who still wander the marble pathways of those cities. Whether it's an iridescent metallic Martian machine gliding through the orange and white sand dunes at night with the light of Mars' twin moons sparkling off of it, or a beautiful abandoned Martian city, the wind blowing leaves through the deserted streets with the sound of \\"dead beetles rattling in a skull\\", it's as if I were actually there.The last chapter, \\"The Million Year Picnic\\", is also one of the most haunting and beautiful, if not the best, chapters in the book. Colonel John Wilder, in an effort to escape a violent and ultimately doomed Earth, brings his wife and three young sons to Mars to build a new life . . . and in the process come \\"face to face\\" with the \\"real\\" Martians. A superb and moving ending to \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", it has some interesting and disturbing similarities to the state of humanity as it exists in 2005._______________________________________________________________\\"The cities were deep-laid with granaries of silence, time stored and kept, pools and fountains of quietude and memory.

That said, he never overestimates the information we have to use it.

I suspect that a decade or two from now readers will wonder why it wasn't so obvious.Glenn KoocherCambridge, MA"},{"Title":"Sands of Empire: Missionary Zeal, American Foreign Policy, and the Hazards of Global Ambition","review":"\\"Sands of Empire\\" is book about ideas, specifically about two fundamental ideas that alternately drive American geopolitics: one is the idea of progress and the other is the cyclical theory of history, which holds that civilizations rise and fall, but cultures remain constant. This paradigm, according to journalist Robert Merry, will show us where we've gone wrong and how to rectify our course. This book is very well written and very well researched, but some of the conclusions he reaches are problematic.The idea of progress was a product of the Enlightenment. The main thesis is that humanity is progressing inexorably from backwardness and ignorance to higher stages of enlightenment, and that the process would go on indefinitely into the future. Exponents of the Englightenment believed their values to be universal. The most recent intellectual manifestation of this idea was expounded by Francis Fukuyama in \\"The End of History,\\" written shortly after the demise of the Soviet Union. He believed that liberal democracy and capitalism were the ends to which all civlizations strived and that the goal had been reached. There would be no more conflicts between major powers or as Thomas Friedman said in \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree,\\" no two countries with McDonalds would ever go to war with each other.This illusion came quickly to an end with the conflicts in the Balkans and with 9/11. The cultural view of history tells us that not only does history not end, but that it had come back with a vengeance. Samuel Huntington, a champion of this view, tells us in \\"The Clash of Civilizations\\" that the world is made up of different cultures, values, and traditions, none of which is superior to the others and none of which encompasses universal values.Merry is a conservative and an endorser of the cultural view of history, and he has some harsh things to say about liberals as well as the Bush Administration. He believes that the Clinton Administration's military intervention in the Balkans to save Muslims was a big mistake since it did not directly affect our national interests. The Bush Administration's military intervention in Iraq to transplant democracy was even worse. According to Merry, Muslims have no traditon of democracy and to force it upon them will only encourage them to hate us more.Merry does not believe that there is a war within Islamic civilization between moderates and extremists, and that the West should be assisting the so-called moderates. Instead, we should be supporting dictatorial regimes that are suppressing Islamic fundamentalists. Presumably this would have included Saddam Hussein. According to the cultural theory of history, there are certain unalterables in Islamic civilization that the West has no business trying to change. Islam should be fenced off and we should be supporting the oppressors.A refutation of Merry's view can be illustrated by the example of Japan. Prior to World War II, the Japanese were illiberal and isolated from the West; they wanted Western technology, but they didn't want to be contaminated by Western culture. However, since then, they have quite seemlessly absorbed many Western cultural values while at the same time retaining their own traditional culture. Inspite of Merry's very learned argument, I think he came down on the wrong side of the debate. Indeed the example of Japan shows the insufficiency of the progress/culture paradigm itself. Reality is always more complex than the paradigm that tries to understand it; it has led Merry to some very dangerous conclusions. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book for the insights it gives as to why countries choose to go to war."},{"Title":"Sands of Empire: Missionary Zeal, American Foreign Policy, and the Hazards of Global Ambition","review":"It's hard to think that people would argue too much with this book's prescription for a thoughtful and cautious American foreign policy, based on continued strength and the sustenance of the Republic, not empire or even political conversion of the globe. Merry is a batten-down-the-hatches conservative, somewhat in tune with Patrick Buchanan, although even less of an isolationist and without the cultural and moral absolutism.Key to his thesis is that this good thing that we have, this Western civilization, is in something of a decline when we look at the big picture. It is paramount that we nurture it carefully, and try to see it last as long as possible. That seems to be a good idea, even if he's wrong about the decline. He has nothing but disdain for American multiculturalism. We ARE the best. But he thinks in terms of civilizations, not just political states, cultures or races. The dangers of interventionism (in Balkans, Africa, Middle East) are respective of our standing amongst the other civilizations especially.The conclusion is that, although the Bush administration, guided by a convenient alliance of \\"defend-America-by-spreading-democracy\\", Neocon gadfly intellectuals and the more traditional hawks, along with Liberal Interventionist thinkers has made exactly the wrong choices after 9-11, it is certainly not too late for the right changes to come into effect. My summary of his prescription:1. Unify and re-strengthen Western Civilization by befriending \\"old\\" Europe all over again.2. Support Russia and China as balancing interests against Islam. Don't play tricky political games with China. They may be the next hegemon, but at least they have not openly expressed the desire to destroy the West.3. Continue to launch military attacks if necessary, but only in response to terrorism against us, or against states that are truly nurturing Islamic terrorists. Death from above, maybe. But no more occupations! Islamic civilization is the enemy, not terrorism.4. Encourage the growth and strength of pivotal Islamic core states, like Turkey and Iran. Since states with organized government, not necessarily democratic ones, are the key to slowing down the Islamic revolution. We need states that will be naturally restraining of Islam. The clock is probably ticking on the Saudis (although we've been thinking that for a while!)5. Globalization isn't going to do it all. The markets aren't everything. The world may modernize, but it won't westernize. Culture is hugely important. Especially Islamic culture.6.

As president and Publisher of Congressional Quarterly and a former Wall Street Journal reporter, Robert Merry is closely acquainted with government trappings.Even European democracies have cultural nuances from the American model. Attempting to require conformity to 'our' way of doing things only engenders suspicion, distrust, and then hatred. We should then not be surprised when the nations rebel against 'Colonial Democracy' or why. Our desire to control other countries earns us the moniker of 'bully'.Those people only want the right to have their own nation run by their own cultural values, a standard which had ironically founded America. Our 'missteps' in the middle east actually provide further justification for the anti-American sentiment; we are then living up to what their culture previously had said about American democracy and Americans.Reading this book I thought about the 1960's cold war. We were then-attempting to convince 'third world' nations that embracing American democracy was the right move for security and prosperity. We became locked into the Vietnam War because our then-government did not want Southeast Asia to have a communist form of government. We were also condescending to those nations because we earnestly had believed that America knew what was best for everybody else in the world.Sadly, I must concede that the current administration (including a PhD Secretary of State) has not absorbed those lessons--or read this book.

However, the book could have instead simply focused on an overall history of Iraq - a \\"nation\\" made up of people more loyal to their historic tribes than any overall nationalistic spirit. Thus, Sunni's are likely to relinquish centuries-long control, and the Shia's will not give up their dream of a government dominated by higher clergy. Merry believes that the Bush team failed to think about the likely outcome of deposing Hussein - fragmentation, and should have first listened to experts before proceeding. The result was that the U.S. was surprised to not be greeted as liberators, but instead as occupiers.Finally, Merry concludes that the U.S. in a cultural \\"war with Islam.\\" Few others refer to it as such; however, our non-stop insensitive actions (eg. establishing a large, permanent base in Saudi Arabia, support/bias for Israel, prisoner abuses, invading Iraq) that antagonize countless passionate Islamic followers seem to steadily make the situation worse."},{"Title":"Sands of Empire: Missionary Zeal, American Foreign Policy, and the Hazards of Global Ambition","review":"The idea that America can go everywhere, and do anything, in a quest to reshape the world into a likeness of our own Western free-market society is one that has been embraced by both the left and right in U.S. history, as Merry explains, so this book isn't at all partisan, which makes it refreshing. It is essentially a plea, supported by a historical outline, that Americans realize a couple of essential facts: That we are in a civilizational war with Islam -- and not \\"a few angry fanatics\\" -- and that our idealistic impulses, like trying to turn Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, etc., into democracies, only deepen the dangers we face. Whether you buy all, or any, of this, it is important that it be said, and Merry says it in a concise, interesting, and forceful manner. Idealists in foreign policy from Wilson to G.W. Bush have led us into peril, Merry argues, and it is time for some old-fashioned realpolitik, balance-of-power diplomacy.

More importantly, it contrasts that tradition with the modern view of inevitable progress and the impact of these different underpinnings on foreign policy and affairs.Although the author meanders a bit towards the end of the book, it is truly a valuable contribution to the literature and the discussion of the post-9/11 world."},{"Title":"Sands of Empire: Missionary Zeal, American Foreign Policy, and the Hazards of Global Ambition","review":"The author Robert Merry is president and publisher of Congressional Quarterly. In this fascinating book he explores various influential ideas about foreign policy common among the US ruling class.He proposes that the key divide is between the idea of progress, which he claims leads to interventions abroad, and the cyclical view of history, which he claims leads to non-intervention. He presents the five resulting foreign policy options: expansionism, liberal and conservative interventionisms, and liberal and conservative isolationisms.He notes that Francis Fukuyama upholds the idea of progress, telling us that globalisation will end all history, including wars, as we all become American. Merry notes that Norman Angell presented the same idea back in 1910, predicting that the growing economic interdependence between countries made wars impossible. Now New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, a bugler for globalisation, says that Angell was \`actually right', little details like the world wars having clearly escaped his magisterial attention. It certainly seems that the globalisation can only be achieved by wars to impose it on reluctant nations.Merry himself espouses Samuel Huntington's cyclical view of history as the eternal, inevitable clash of civilisations. But what is peaceful about this vision? Civilisations clash only when states invade other people's countries.Yet Merry opposes Bush's foreign policy and his bellicosity against Iran, Russia and China. Merry also opposes Bush's policy of getting Turkey into the EU, noting that Bush fatuously said, \\"As a European power, Turkey belongs in Europe.\\"Of the current US war against Islam, Merry writes, \\"In such a war, unprecedented in modern history, probably the most destabilizing approach would be a combination of Theodore Roosevelt's Will to Power imperialism and Woodrow Wilson's missionary idealism.

This wrapper makes the book very interesting, and yet it is questionable whether the interpretation given is really correct. The question of the idea of progress, after an all too partial history of the idea's own progressions, is then mapped onto the Bush foreign policy. The change of scale is misleading and counterproductive. Similar problems arise with the cyclical views of Toynbee and Spengler. Then the Hegelian End of History thesis is grafted onto the discussion in a way that doesn't quite fit. In a way it is good to raise these issues and attempt the 'philosophy of history' genre as a backdrop to cultural discussion, but the key to doing that has been lost, if it was ever found, and the result is a kind of ad hoc historicism. The idea of progress gets a bum rap these days, and that's not surprising if it is claimed that Bush is its representative. But the idea, on the right scale, is an essential component to historical understanding. The problem is that historical dynamics and the machinations of ideologicalpolicy mongers become scrambled.I think, beyond the analysis, the cautionary critique of the false universalism of imperial presidents remains of value in the book, but the overall result goes begging for some relief from the cliches of rival pastiche versions of the philosophy of history. Interesting book in any case.The right way to reconcile the contradictions of cyclical theories, the idea of progress and the confusion over Hegel's 'end of history' can be found in the reviewer's _World History and The Eonic Effect_. The works of Spengler/Toynbee and naive versions of the Progress idea need to be scrapped/upgraded to something more usable."},{"Title":"Sands of Empire: Missionary Zeal, American Foreign Policy, and the Hazards of Global Ambition","review":"...a review in the way of a question. Mr. Albert Lee, I ask you this: how often do you have to replace the microchip in the back of your head? Curious......"},{"Title":"Sands of Empire: Missionary Zeal, American Foreign Policy, and the Hazards of Global Ambition","review":"The Argument of this book is strait forward and un-nuanced. It consists of three themes:1) America is an empire and is decidedly run as a crusader state trying impose its Christian liberal secular ideas on the world.2) Progress is relative. Rather then progress, the world is \`cyclical' and therefore nothing is ever right or wrong, peoples are different. Civilizations are different. Slavery is \`bad' it is just a different way of organizing society. Genocide isn't \`bad' it is simply a different way of creating homogeneity. We must never judge.3) Because of the above to \`facts' America must never impose its ideas or will on anyone.This is quite clearly the line of thinking among those in the world who either a) oppose America, or (b) hate America. This includes parts of the academic elite in the United States who due to their wealth and status doubt their nation out of a misguided view that everything their nation engages in is bad and when their nation is attacked then it deserves it. Putting this behind us let us analyze why this view is simply incorrect. The Moral Relativist mafia would have us believe that Islamic law is simply \`relative' neither \`backwards' or less \`progressive' then secular law. However under this logic Nazi law, and genocide and slavery are also simply \`relative' Who are we to judge the Nazis, after all the Nazis were a \`civilization' and therefore who are we to impose our \`progress' on Stalins Russia, Hitlers Germany or Saudi Arabia. Under this logic western women would still not be allowed to vote, but lets leave that behind. The logic that we must never label anything \`progress' because we aren't allowed to judge may make sense. However when another civilization, i.e. Islam, tries to impose its will on us through terrorism wouldn't the logic of one civilization not being allowed to impose its will on others kick in. According to this study no. This is not only wrong headed it is hypocritical. Militant Islam wants to impose its will on our western society. However we are not, according to this view, allowed to defend ourselves. This book is a blueprint for terrorism, it gives those who want to murder westerners an excuse and it is a self hating literature if one is an American.Seth J.

As the greatest civilization in the world,America has the right and duty to spread freedom to the restof the world. We must do so not only because it is right, butbecause the lack of freedom is what creates terrorism. Americacan ultimately not be safe in a half-free world.The book says America is an empire. WRONG! America is FREEDOM!America saved the world from communism during the cold war andhas served for 200+ years as THE example to the rest of the worldin how to build freedom.The writer brings moral relativism into the book. Like mostliberals, he can't tell right from wrong anymore. He tries totell us that what might be right for us might not be right forarabs. NONSENSE! There is one standard for right and wrongin the world. There are good people in the world and badpeople. There is nothing else. Saddam was an evil dictatorand the world and iraq is much better off to be rid of him.Liberals like this guy were ready to surrender the country onseptember 12! Thank God we had a president who didn't listento fools like this.As brave men like David Horowitz have pointed out in theirbooks, there is a liberal elite in our country who hates usand will make an alliance with anyone, including Islamicterrorists, to destroy our country. They refuse to see thebasic immorality of Islam. They refuse to see that life itselfis a moral battle between good and evil where only one can win.There is no peace. Peace is a false liberal idea spread throughliberal intellectuals. The idea of peace is that there is noevil in the world and that all wars are just misunderstandings.But as the British proved at Munich and Roosevelt provedat Yalta, compromise with evil only means the destruction ofgood.This fellow Merry doesn't understand the war on terror at all.As our president has told the country many times, we can eitherfight the war on the frontlines in Iraq or we can fight it inour own streets and cities. Iraq is the central front in thewar on terror for a very good reason. If we can show thecountries of the world oppressed by dictators and islam therewards of freedom, they will turn their backs on terrorismin about half a second.Contrary to this book, we are making progress in Iraq. Iraqhas made more progress under american guidance than it hasin centuries. The people there have freedom and are steppingup to defend themselves. America just has to be patient andunderstand that people whose minds have been oppressed byan evil like Saddam can't learn freedom overnight. The armyis being trained. They had an election and soon they will havea constitution which gives them freedom.Are things perfect? No. But they never are. But we can'tsecond-guess our leaders or are troops. We must give thema free hand to deal with the situation as they see best.This book is a blueprint of an American defeat in the war onterror. It refuses to accept our morality and the evil ofour enemy. It mocks the power of freedom to change the worldand it refuses to accept the reality that our civilization isin a war with an enemy civilization. Only one civilization cansurvive.

He seems to be writing mostly about money and why not to want it. In 1923. I think it somewhat simplistic at its core, however. Is it money that is really the evil, or is it character deficiency that puts money on an altar and measures success by it? Money is only useful for the choices it allows us to have in living our lives. Without it, no choice is available. The book covers over a decade and at the end gets very preachy and throws in World War I almost as if the author forgot about it and had to stick it in somewhere.

Remember Tom Wolfe's The Painted Word and how it is theory which supports a horrisly unappealling and juvenile work? Poetry is either the juvenile mind's last stand or the visionary's gift to the tribe and Mark Strand has fearlessly chosen to embody the latter in his life, attitudes and work. It may occur to the reader that I do not believe in seperating the poet from the work and I believe that especially in poetry that this is true. A pompous arrogent bore who had distain for his audience is not a person worthy of emulation or admiration. But aside from that, Strand's philosophy is self-aggrandizement via esthethic manipulation of his audience and he will readily admit this in person. Please, do yourself a favour, and read Phillip Whalen or old Gary Snyder (rip-rap) or even fall into the benevolent solipsisticly egomaniacal realm of the late Allen Ginsberg. But do not believe that a poet is good simply based on reputation and public favour. Especially when the author is writing at your expense. Finally, vision, eh? In a conversation with the poet, he brashly declared that there was no use for it in poetry. That is an academic profanity. I would pity him and his readers if he was not so vile and his work was not so insipid. reader be aware."},{"Title":"Selected poems","review":"Mark Strand's poetry speaks volumes even in this thin-ish book of selected poems. It's my favorite of poetry books by living English-speaking writers. His early work reflects influences from Latin Surrealists like Octavio Paz. He moves later to the personal...autobiographical, beautiful elegies, and words on that basic thread that ties together the human experience...love. But enough of the pretentious crap on poetry that exists out there already in useless spades, on to the meat and bone of the matter, the poet's words. You be the judge. Here are some of my more favorite lines: &quot;Tonight as it gets cold tell yourself what you know which is nothing but the tune your bones play as you keep going.&quot; from &quot;Lines for Winter&quot; &quot;She slept without the usual concerns, the troubling dreams--the pets moving through the museum, the carved monsters, the candles giving themselves up to darkness.

There is no happiness like mine. I have been eating poetry...She does not understand. When I get on my knees and lick her hand, she screams. I am a new man. I snarl at her and bark. I romp with joy in the bookish dark.&quot; from &quot;Eating Poetry&quot; and finally &quot;The meek are hauling their skins into heaven. The hopeless are suffering the cold with those who have nothing to hide...There are stones in the sea no one has seen. There is a shore and people are waiting. And nothing comes back.

While on a week's holiday, the pair meet Miss Magdala Buckley who has had a series of life-threatening accidents. Poirot believes these &quot;accidents&quot; are more likely attempts on her life. In true Christie tradition, a murder soon occurs. However, Miss Buckley is not the victim, but the newly-deceased is a cousin of hers. Poirot must prevent another murder while discovering why anyone would want Miss Buckley dead. Into the mix enters her friends Frederica Rice and Commander Challenger as well as a mysterious couple from Australia who live in a cottage on the grounds of End House, possible narcotics involvement, and a surprise ending that will truly amaze. I won't reveal what the ending is, of course, but it is one that Christie will successfully use again in later works."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"Mystery writers are supposed to play by a set of rules, ie give the reader all the clues, no rare, undetectable poisons, the murder can't be the butler, detective, victim or someone we've never met etc. Agatha Christie always played fair in that all the clues were present for the reader, and she didn't rely on obscure poisons unknown-to-science but she was somewhat more creative in her interpretations of some of the others. PERIL AT END HOUSE is an example of Christie's creativeness with one of the rules of mystery writing (but you'll have to read the book to find out which rule).Poirot and Hastings are spending some time at a seaside resort. Poirot is still insisting that he has retired but concedes that \\"...if a bullet should strike the wall by my head, I would ...investigate the matter!\\" Needless to say one does and Poirot is soon investigating the numerous attempts on the life of a young woman. Poirot sorts his way through a murder, drug trafficking, false identities, secret engagements and attempted frauds to reach the truth.The ending is clever and we are treated to Poirot being forced to ask someone else for the answer to a minor secondary puzzle."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"This mystery is less a who-done-it than it is a who's-gonna-do-it. Attempts are being made on the life of Nicky Buckley, the pert proprietress of End House. Poirot sets out to foil the would-be murderer, but feels that he's failed miserably when Nicky's cousin dies instead. Poirot redoubles his efforts to save Nicky and to solve the cousin's murder, but he finds himself in a quandary. As Poirot fruitlessly attempts to discern a motive and discover the murderer, Nicky has another narrow escape from a poisoning attempt. Poirot finally decides that the only way to flush the murderer out is to fake Nicky's death. The denouement is both surprising and satisfying. Another nice thing about the story is the glimpse into the mind of Poirot as he sorts out the clues. In this case he does not keep his thoughts and surmises secret from Captain Hastings, and we follow him step by step as he winnows through the evidence to come to his conclusions. He does, however, hold back enough to surprise the reader in the final chapter.Now for the critique: [1] Christie either knows nothing about the behavior of bullets or expects her readers to know nothing. Her description of the near fatal shooting of Nicky is as full of holes as Nicky's hat. Poirot took no notice of the fact that there was no noise from the report of the pistol, no noise from the ricochet of the bullet, and no scuff mark on the wall. No mention was made of the bullet being deformed by striking the wall. This is not the first time Christie has betrayed such ignorance. In the short story &quot;Dead Man's Mirror&quot;, a bullet struck a gong without denting the gong, deforming the bullet, or depositing a lead scuff on the gong. [2] Although Poirot twice stated that the simplest explanation was the best, the final explanation was not simple. It was so complex and convoluted that such a series of events could never have converged to produce Christie's result. [3] Again we see Christie borrowing from Arthur Conan Doyle. One of Sherlock Holmes' favorite maxims was &quot;When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot; Poirot paraphrases Holmes thus: &quot;when you have eliminated other possibilities you turn to the one that is left and say - since the other is not - this must be so.&quot; I can't say Poirot improved on Holmes' proverb."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"One of the early Poirot novels (the seventh to be exact), and once again narrated by Poirot's faithful companion Hastings, \\"Peril at End House\\" is a classic Agatha Christie mystery. In fact, it's so \\"classic\\" that it's one of the few mysteries that I managed to puzzle out before the denouement, though this in no way impinges on the reading experience (and takes my grand total of outwitting Christie up to three).Poirot and Hastings are enjoying a break at the Cornish resort of St Loo when they meet a vivacious young woman known as \\"Nick\\". Her real name is Magdala Buckley, but her nickname derives from her grandfather, who was called Old Nick on account of his devilish nature. Both men are enchanted by her, but Poirot is gravely concerned when Nick lightly tells him that she's had three near-death encounters in as many days. That very day, someone takes a shot at her and leaves a bullet hole through the brim of her hat, though Nick doesn't take it very seriously until she realizes that her gun is missing.Yet she can't think of a single reason why anyone would want to kill her, even though Poirot suspects that the constant nature of the attacks point to someone in her inner circle. Various lodgers, servants, friends and family members regularly converge on End House where Nick lives, and so Poirot asks her to send for a trusted family relation to stay with her at all times.Yet a case of mistaken identity means that Nick's cousin ends up dead, and Poirot is beside himself with guilt. Somewhere out there is a murderer who has not yet achieved his/her objective, and Nick's life still hangs in the balance - especially when it comes to light that there is a very good reason why someone would want her dead.It's an interesting twist on the usual mystery, in that it's not a whodunit so much as a who-wants-to-do-it, and far from his usual confident, breezy self, Poirot finds himself stumped on several occasions. But since everything is fair and neatly structured, those familiar with Christie's formula may find that it's relatively easy to piece together the clues and find the culprit. A few leaps of logic are required - but such is the case in most of Christie's novels.With a few little winks at previous books, such asThe Mystery of the Blue Trainand the short-story \\"The Chocolate Box\\" (chocolates have a prominent role here as well), this is not my favorite Christie novel, nor the best, but certainly worth curling up with on a cold night."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"Agatha Christie's sleuth, Hercule Poirot is a singular creation. Often conceited by his great intelligence, Poirot is stumped for the longest time in \\"Peril at End House\\". Even though he has retired, again, he finds himself caught up in the case of the beautiful Miss Nick Buckley, who has escaped three near-fatal \\"accidents\\" in three days. \\"Peril at End House\\" reunites Poirot with his friend Captain Hastings, and is filled with Christie's usual twists and turns as Poirot tries to stop a murderer before it is too late.Knowing that Nick Buckley's brushes with death were no accident, Poirot takes it upon himself to protect her and find out who may really want her dead. He knows immediately that it cannot be a stranger, so he looks into the intimate circle of friends surrounding Nick. There is her friend, Frederica Rice, who stands to gain from the will Nick had drawn up earlier in the year. There is Frederica's lover, Jim Lazarus, whose business may be in a shabby state of affairs. Also, there is her cousin, Charles Vyse, a lawyer who will surely inherit the family home. And then there is also Commander Challenger, a Navy officer in love with Nick, but it is a love that is unrequited. Yet Nick Buckley lives in the heavily mortgaged End House and has very little money of her own - why would anyone want to see her dead to gain money if there was no money to gain? When murder does occur at End House, Poirot begins to wonder if there is more to the matter of inheritance than he at first considered.All of these characters and all of the questions concerning them stump the great Hercule Poirot (and the reader) until the very end. The conclusion is a clever and surprising finish. \\"Peril at End House\\" is a delightful mystery, one that will have readers guessing for the longest time and gasping when the truth is finally revealed.

Her writing is brilliant and beautiful. The mysteries are suspenseful and exciting. I never know who it was. Ever. I though I had it pinned right away and it was obvious, but I was wrong. My suspicion had committed a crime, but it was not attempted murder.Since I have read a couple Christie books, I have talked to a lot of mystery fans about her...and it turns out they have not read anything she has written! I am trying to push them to try because she is so brilliant. They will also find, like I have, that they have been missing references all of their lives! Other TV shows and movies have so many little nods to Christie, it is just astonishing once you realize it!It is so interesting to read mysteries that are back in the early 1900s. Some things never change. This book has drugs, cut brakes, forgery, and plenty of \\"accidents\\". I could completely see it taking place in modern times, which I think is just another reason why Agatha Christie was so brilliant!I will say that as I read reviews on goodreads, people who read a LOT of her books were able to figure it out right away...which could be annoying and make the rating go down, I am sure. Since I am still a newbie, I do enjoy it.One last thing. Did you know that the Poirot book are in a specific order? I didn't think it mattered until this book.

For one thing, it was the first time I ever successfully predicted the ending of one of her mysteries. Partially, it's just a function of the fact that I've been reading a lot of her books lately, but it just seemed quite obvious, almost from the beginning. (Also, the table of contents gives it away to a smart reader!) The other problem was Poirot. He was excessively demeaning and cruel to Hastings throughout the novel, to such an unreasonable extent that I was mentally urging Hastings to tell Poirot where he could shove his mustaches, and get the heck out of there. Also, perhaps I was reading too quickly or simply got a badly edited edition of the book (I have the 1942 Pocket Mysteries edition), but parts of it were almost incomprehensible. She wrote it when she was fairly young, so I'm inclined to blame shoddy editors at the publishing house.Overall, this is a quick and distracting read, nothing more. Christie fans may not enjoy it as much as her other real masterpieces, but it may impress a novice. However, I would not recommend it to a novice, because the portrait it paints of Poirot is extremely off-putting."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"Captain Hastings and Hercule Poirot are on holiday when they learn that several attempts have been made on a local girl's life.

As the New York Times Book Review said of this novel in 1932, \\"With Agatha Christie as the author and Hercule Poirot as the central figure, one is always assured of an entertaining story with a real mystery to it\\" [1].[The previous Poirot works are - in order -The Mysterious Affair at Styles,Murder on the Links,Poirot Investigates, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,The Big Four,The Mystery of the Blue Train, andBlack Coffee(a play later adapted as a novel).]Note on potentially objectionable content: Sexist protagonists (Women, they are impatient!) and murder as entertainment.[1] Isaac Anderson, March 6, 1932, p20. Quoted in the wikipedia entry for this book."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"I enjoyed this book, but didn't really want to read it. One of my friends recommended it to me. It is a mystery that is well written but I've read better. It is a little hard to figure out what Christie is trying to say in the French phrases. I don't know very many words in French so if you don't know any words of French or don't have a friend that does I suggest you shouldn't read this book."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"This book is exactly what you come to expect from an Agatha Christie mystery, but with a change in Hercule Poirot, the famous detective and star of this mystery series. He has just retired and is slowly settling into a quiet, calm life of leisure and is refusing to be called back into duty. His mind, he thinks, is made up. However, a new mystery finds him, small and subtle at first, then shows itself to have a sinister meaning. He can't help but observe that which is right in front of him, and without meaning to, he is drawn into its web, and begins to apply his detective skills.The great Hercule Poirot, who is known far and wide for his unmatched detective skills, can't resist asking one question, then another, then another. A perplexing and potentially deadly set of circumstances takes shape, and his concern for the wellbeing of a young woman he happens to meet, leads him to investigate. However, the motives and players behind this mystery prove themselves difficult for him to ascertain. Where he was always bursting with confidence and assuredness in his perceptions, skills, and outcomes, he is now struggling with something unfamiliar to him - a shaky self-confidence that worsens and lingering uncertainty. He finds himself bumbling about without meaning to. As events unfold, he feels powerless to stop them. His once sharp and nearly infallible intellect and investigative skills seem to be outmatched. His frustration grows and so do his mistakes, missteps, and incorrect assumptions.With its intriguing twists and turns, Peril at End House is a very engaging and rewarding mystery tale and will be sure to please die-hard Agatha Christie fans as well as those new to the stories.Rai Aren, co-author of Secret of the Sands"},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"I love Agatha Christie's books and think they are all worth reading. It's very difficult to even come up with my top 10, but I can say this one is not in contention...the story itself was terrific and captivating (I want to go on vacation to these places), but the ending had pieces that weren't tied into the story as well as she normally pulls it off. With that said, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"When I first read Agatha Christie's \\"Peril at End House\\" many years ago, I was disappointed. I thought there were serious flaws in the plot and that Poirot was practically a caricature of himself. Later I watched a PBS Mystery version, and the flaws seemed even worse. I believe this is one of the books that Agatha Christie in her autobiography admits she couldn't even remember writing.So it was with some misgivings that I approached rereading \\"Peril at End House\\". Yes, the flaws are still there, and it is certainly not one of Miss Christie's best. Nevertheless, it is very good. The plot despite some weak spots is quite clever. The characters are good even with Poirot being \\"over the top\\". The Christie humor is there but not as apt as in most of her other works.I never cease to be impressed with the way in which Miss Christie lays out the clues for the reader. It is always \\"fair play\\". One critic compared her to a magician in that she is a master at misdirection. \\"Peril at End House\\" is a beautiful example of her use of misdirection -- if 15 or so paragraphs had been printed in bold-face type, almost every reader would have figured out the solution.Not Agatha Christie at her best, but \\"Peril at End House\\" is still a winner."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"Wonderfully written and constantly on the move so that you never want to set it down! I haven't read a Hercule Poirot book before, and this seems to be a later one, still I felt no problem picking up on his eccentricities and persona. The book is fairly short and so intriguing that I found I had finished it much sooner that I hoped!The plot is full of twists so that I never saw the ending in its entirety until the final chapter, but I never felt like the book relied on absurd jumps to hide the solution.Also, the book was written a while ago, and the language and style reflect that. Some stock scenes are used and cliches are bandied about (like the climatic scene!) but I found this more charming then worn out!"},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"As the author of Peril on the Katy Trail I was curious to find out more about Peril at End House. This book was showing up at the top of the search list whenever I typed Peril. Who else had used the word Peril in a title and who was so popular?Oh My! Imagine my surprise quickly followed by a smile. Peril at End House was written by Agatha Christie! I immediately understood the attraction. So I obtained a copy and began to read. I am glad I did.Peril at End House is a classic Hercule Poirot mystery. The primary strengths are in the plotting and mystery. From the very beginning the reader is intrigued and captivated by wondering the who and why.Another strength is the description of the location. I found myself wanting to travel there to enjoy the ambiance. Perhaps to enjoy high tea.For me, the use of occasional phrases in French slowed the reading. Many of the obvious were quickly translated. However, a few references to a French dictionary were necessitated for a complete comprehension.I enjoyed reading Peril at End House and now understand why it is usually first on the search list when typing the word Peril."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"I've only read about 11 Agatha Christie books, but this one was one of the worst that I have read so far. I'm not saying it is bad, but it's not that great compared to some of her other books. The middle was slow, and it started out slow. The ending was sort of surprising, but I had figured out who the murderer was because it was pretty obvious. If you want to read some really good Agatha Christie books, I suggest And Then There Were None, or The Murder of Roger Acrkoyd."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"Love Christie, love Poirot, and this is a very good story.

I started reading the Christie mysteries about 6 months ago and have not been disappointed yet"},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"One of Agatha's most twisted works, Peril at End House is simply riveting...especially since the murder accurs more than halfway through and is not the focus of the story! The end will shock you. I nearly guessed... I did guess, actually,but I pushed it away without bothering to think it through. A bad mistake. I am not one of those readers who like to work on the mystery,read in bits and pieces and do their own work. I sit back,relax and enjoy the show. I let the detective do the work for me...that's why there's a detective, after all. It won't happen again.Anyhow...this is a first rate book. For once Poirot is not the magician who pulls the rabbit out of the hat. He struggles and actually is almost stumped(!)I recall once when reading another of Christie's books,Poirot is questioned if he's ever failed at a case and he replies that he very nearly did with Roger Ackroyd.That wasn't true. Should've been this murder instead.Roger Ackroyd played out quite neatly. ( Although, does anyone know if Ackroyd was written first?)Characters are well-developed,with the story still being fast-paced (in some of her other works, Christie really doesn't bother too much with giving characters enough depth.) And of course,the lovable Hastings,the soul of honesty- any Christie book with the young man involved is one that will be read by me.All in all,this a wonderful murder mystery,right up there with Sad Cypress and Murder on the Orient. Go for it.~Kawthar Bakhach,Eighth GraderP.S Needless to say,this is not a school-requested book review. Doesn't follow all the rules,does it?

Great fun for all of you die hard Hercule Poirot fans."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"Classic Agatha Christie (and that's a good thing). The answer is obvious but in typical Agatha Christie fashion it isn't what it seems. An enjoyable read: Fun, not too heavy."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"Reason for Reading: I love this series of graphic novels. I've read all Christie's mysteries but so long ago that, except for the most popular titles, I barely remember the plots, much less whodunit.Peril at End House is classic Christie! Apparently someone is trying to kill a young woman who vacations in her ancestral, but quickly running down, home nearby where Poirot and Hastings are vacationing in Cornwall. He meets her upon the fourth attempt and takes charge of the lady's well-being, promising to find out who would want to kill this kind and not very monied woman. Suspects are narrowed down to a small group of close friends she has in Cornwall plus a couple who staffs the house. Twists and turns abound making this case one that Poirot himself almost can't solve until the last hour and the shocking reveal at the end is typical of Christie's master of the craft.I love these books. They are so huge, like picture books, that they are so fun to read slowly and enjoy the French type art. Jollet has used his own imaginings of Poirot, staying close to the bookish description of him rather than the one we are used to seeing on TV, though he is immediately recognisable his appearance is more manly than dandy. Of course it has been too long for me to compare the graphic to the original but the story runs very smoothly. There is a brief mention of drugs that casts a cloud over certain parties that I think may have been a bigger issue in the original book as it seems superfluous to the plot in the GN. Otherwise, a great rendition of one of Christie's classics."},{"Title":"Peril at End House","review":"Peril at End House is a 1932 Agatha Christie murder mystery gem. Like the vast majority of her novels this one is also short running to just over 200 pages.The Plot: Nick Buckley is a beautiful young woman who is due to inherit End House. The old mansion is situated in St Loo a town in Christie's native Cornwall region of Great Britain. Nick consults Hercule Poirot, the retired Belgian detective now resident in England. Miss Buckley explains to Poirot and Captain Hastings his friend from Scotland Yard that three recent incidents have led her to believe someone wishes to murder her.During a fireworks exhibition at End House a kind young girl named Maggie Buckley is shot dead after she borrows a red Chinese shawl from Nick's wardrobe. The young woman is the daughter of a clergy couple. Poirot and the police believe she was mistaken for Nick by the killer. Poirot learns that Nick has been involved in a love affair with famed pilot Michael Seton who is killed in an air crash. Poirot also discovers that her good friend Fredrica Rice is involved in a love match with James Lazarus. Poirot persuades Nick to go to a nursing home to escape any further murderous attempts. She receives a box of candies which contain arsenic poison but survives. Charles Vyse is an attorney who would inherit Peril House and millions of pounds if Nick were out of the picture. Poirot solves the case with a brilliant scene set at Peril House involving a supposed ghost at a seance.This is excellent murder mystery fiction by Agatha Christe the Dame of Death. Christie knows how to entertain her millions of devoted readers. See if you can solve this throny case and match wits with Christie and Poirot by using your little grey cells.

She generally plays fair and there is a satisfaction in following the clues to an end. This one tricked me and that made it fun. Poirot also heads in the wrong direction so at least I was not alone. A number of attempts are made on a young woman's life, leading Poirot to investigate and do his best to save her.

We are fortunate that one (if not the only) book in this field is as well written and educational as this.While Financial Services face the same challenges as conventional products, there are difficulties and challenges unique to the industry.Considering the size and momentum of the world's financial markets, you would think there would be more attention paid to this field. Ennew and her group carefully walk you through all the major categories of banking and financial services.That being said,there are areas where the book might not sit well with many readers. Most of the data is UK centered. One might have to look for another source to learn more about marketing financial services and products in a global scenario. The book probably did not explore the value of BRANDING in the financial services industry with the depth it could have.However, this is a fine introduction for novices and a convenient resource book for old hands."},{"Title":"Marketing Financial Services (Marketing Series)","review":"This is a fine academic text but of limited use to practitioners.

The book that first appeared in 1953 is a terse account of nostalgia and life of a writer who returns to his homeland after spending fifteen years away at wars. The story progresses through reminisces the writer has about his childhood. It yields, in a poignant and heartwarming detail, the development of narrator's personality through the two world wars in the backdrop. Essential to the story is the character of Kadetka, who the writer remembers lovingly as a child embedded with his nostalgia. His Auntie narrates some bits of the novel, and the contrast between the voices reveals what difference in insights experience, age, travel and education brings to us.Several parallel tracks come together in this mature and modern novel. The affair of a Slovene girl with a Czech soldier, and years later another affair of her daughter with Italian soldier bring out the complexities and absurdities of war out in a very taut novel. The writer reveals his love for the mountainous country, the river Idrica and his people through descriptions that are lyrical and border on poetry. The personalities of the characters in the novel are revealed mostly through events, and the dialogues are kept to minimum. There are occasions in the novel when the reader feels sheer joy or compassion or love and in creating these occasions nearly a dozen times through the novel, Ciril Kosma' manages to arouse my whole hearted admiration, applause and appreciation. It was indeed a pleasant surprise to find this 169 page novel to be so aesthetically pleasing and rich in imagery and experience.I have to quote the following extract from the book, for I think if it was relevant to Yugoslavians in 1950s, it is even more relevant to young nation of Slovenia now. It must be remarked that Slovenia is young nation in Eastern Alps, with population of two million. It is located close to Italy and Austria, and in the World War II, was the arena where partisans fought against Germans and Italians. Here is the quote, that is both a homage to his country and in some respect to his own terse novel:\\"Yes,it seems to me that we small nations love our land more dearly than great ones do, or at least in a manner different from theirs. Our native land is small, and as we cannot sing of its greatness, we celebrate and sing of the details which are full of beauty. Because beauty is like truth. Truth does not require bulky tomes to make herself plain, nor does Beauty need a wide, boundless space wherein to unfold herself, to thrive and blossom. Let Expanse thunder forth its mighty song, true Beauty grows in silence. We know our country as we know our mother's face. Her lines and wrinkles are familiar to us, her expressions of joy and happiness, her furrows of grief and anxiety. We are always aware of the clasp of her hands, rough as a peasant's but kindly and warm; we cling to her and have defended her for a thousand years, often with simple means, yea, often with bare hands, but with success - because the chief sponsor of our victory is impassionate love, which does not calculate and therefore does not yield, even when faced with overwhelming odds.\\""},{"Title":"Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology Fourth Edition","review":"I used this book as a reference for my anatomy and physiology class in college and found it be right on target.

(Reviewer bias: I am an American - originally from the Washington D.C. area - who lives in Paris so am very interested in this type of book. It also means I can REALLY appreciate some of the help and humor in all this.)In \\"Savoir Flair: 211 Tips for enjoying France and the French\\", she has taken numerous interesting stories or observations about an American operating in France, added a punch line (i.e., tip) and organized them into 20 chapters. What I particularly like about this book is you can read just the topics of interest if you're visiting Paris for a vacation - topics like arriving at the airports, hotels, using taxis, Metro, Cafes, French food - or you can read it all if going there on business or longer. An example of tips more oriented to those of us living in France include comments on business meals, driving, the local scene, rural living, or requesting information from the French (not as obvious as you think) - just to name a few. One of my favorite sections is the chapter on dogs.The French can give the British a run for their money on their infatuation with dogs. You haven't lived till you sit down in a beautiful French restaurant and realize the \`person' sitting at the table next to you is named Gizmo, and he's a Yorkshire terrier! Read Chapter 7 to hear about the rest of the story; including dog dirt on sidewalks. Hilarious (to an American) and true.Mrs. Platt, an American, has a nice writing style, mixing humor with authority.

Truly,this book was a joy."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"Merci, Polly Platt and thank you so very much for both of your wonderful books. My experiences in Paris were delightful. I traveled to Paris for the first time last year. Three trips in all. The delightful and helpful hints found in Savoir Flair were used daily. For example, on one trip last November when the presidential election in America was hanging on the Florida vote count-- I was just off the plane and had taken the RER and Metro into St. Germain des Pres. (I had no prob using the RER on my second time there. Just beginners luck, I guess. Or pehaps the tips from Ms. Platt which remained in my mind. And an elaborate map drawn on an airline ticket jacket by an American commercial pilot who firmly believed I would be lost and bewildered. I lost the map. All I really needed was to remember the word: Sortie) I floated into Paris transported through the galactic portal at CDG -- appearing pretty much as described by Ms. Platt. I found the circular design comforting -- I couldn't get lost. It was a loop.Before 2 hours had elapsed I used Ms. Platt's information, again: I left my bag at the hotel and stepped out for a refreshing walk. The heel on my favorite (and only comfortable AND pretty) shoes had broken. Vanity more than need was driving me to find someplace to repair them. I didn't want to wear my ugly, but comfortable shoes. These cute little Stuart Weitzman black ankle boots w/black rabbit fur inside were perfect for the chilly, wet weather. They were three years old but still wonderful. However, I was slipping a little with every step (and it wasn't on dog poo.)What were my chances of getting a repair while I waited -- not great, I figured. Probably impossible. Plus, where would I find a repair shop. Whoops, quite by accident I saw one and stepped inside. Guess what! As quoted by Ms. Platt: Napoleon was right, &quot;Impossible does not exist in France.&quot; Following her solid advice on manners, conversation, banter and keeping things interesting: Not only did I receive a shoe repair from a St. Germain des Pres shop keeper who first declined to fix the shoes unless I left them. But I had a wonderful experience. &quot;Bonjour Monseiur,&quot; I said -- and as you can see, I speak French as poorly as I spell it -- followed by the magic words Ms. Platt recommends we all use to describe my problem (and to find out what those are you must READ the book), &quot;I know this is impossible, and I am sure you don't have time, but could you fix my shoe while I wait?&quot; He had stopped a conversation with another man to address me. &quot;You can't leave them?&quot; he said. &quot;They're my only shoes....&quot; I said but paused and considered his request carefully and looked over my shoulder out the window and said thoughtfully, &quot;Oh, yes I could leave them, but I would have to walk barefoot on the cobblestones...or sit here in my stocking feet until the heels were repaired...&quot;&quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked. &quot;The plastic on the bottom of the heel is off,&quot; I said. &quot;Ah, you are slipping on the cobble stones!&quot; &quot;Oui!&quot;Ah, now he was engaged and wanted to solve my problem.He held up five fingers, &quot;Watch my store, I need to talk with this fellow. Five minutes.&quot; They left the shop and when he came back, he took my shoes and said to me, &quot;So, who is your President, today?&quot; I feigned an indignant tone: &quot;Monsieur, we all know who the President is, it is the president-elect who is in dispute...&quot; This made him laugh... He asked about my preference between the candidates and then I asked about his ten or so framed black and white photos of 1940s-60s American movie stars. He spoke about his favorite movies and asked me my favorite movies, &quot;Oh, you like American cinema&quot; I said to him, &quot;and I prefer French film directors...Jaques Tati and .....&quot; several names rolled out. He raised an eyebrow.So, he glued and polished and made conversation with me for an hour while I sat feeling like Alice in Wonderland in a large, old rattan chair and enjoyed the scent of shoe polish and leather, the scene on the street outside, and the comments of the shoe repairman. He fixed my shoes AND polished them to look better than when I walked in.I held the shoes for a moment and admired his work. I thanked him and asked how many French francs I owed.He made a wave of his hand brushing aside my question, &quot;The conversation was compensation enough.&quot;Can you imagine any place in the world where a person would depart from his daily work routine, work for an hour on your behalf, carry on an intelligent and engaging converstion with you, do beautiful work, make the product look better than when he received it for repair, and then refuse payment?I love Paris!(And Ms. Platt's wonderful book. Buy it, enjoy it and by all means travel to France and collect your own wonderful tales of French extravagance -- an abundance of joy in life and each of life's moments!) My encounter at the shoe repair shop was just one of a multitude of wonderful examples of hospitality, wit and generosity that you, too, will find in France. By all means, go with some preparation -- and Savior Flair -- so that you will appreciate the banquet set before you."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"I had mixed reactions to Polly Platt's book. Some practical how-to info is accurate and useful. I had a problem with her lack of objectivity in some areas. She does a lot of name-dropping and you get the sense that her friends are of a certain wealth and social status. This affects the way she presents other info. I live in Paris and I ride the Metro without the fearful incidents she describes. I also take exception to her advice on page 157, which sounds like racist propaganda from the Front Nationale (Le Pen's far-right poltical party)..&quot;if you're blond, you'll be stared at and perhaps approached by French men of all ages. Blond or not, second generation from North Africa may follow you and accost you.&quot; Other warnings are that you should not walk alone in the 20th arr. I am blond, blue-eyed and petite and I frequently shop, walk alone or go to cafes in the 19th/18th and 20th (neighborhoods with many North Africans). I have consistently been treated with friendliness and respect by men and women alike in these areas. It's 'trendy' for a certain elitist class of people in Paris to bash Algerians and Africans as being violent or dangerous.

For many travelers not knowing how to negotiate the small things (catching a bus, using the subway, knowing how to use the security code plaque at someone's front door) can seriously diminish the pleasure of being abroad.

With utmost patience, specificity, knowledge and humor she tells you everything you need to know (including things you didn't even know to wonder about!) for a smooth and happy experience in France. Platt is an American who has lived in Paris since 1967 so she knows exactly whereof she speaks. She is the founder and director of Culture Crossings, a training organization for corporate employees and their families who have been transferred to France. She has written an earlier book, French or Foe, aimed more at the latter audience, though I read it and found it helpful for the traveler.Still, there is nothing like Savoir Flair anywhere. I pity people going to Rome or Turkey or Berlin or Sri Lanka who have to make do with standard quidebooks. (As far as I know Polly Platt has not been cloned in other languages and cultures!) This book is my new best friend. Buy it and you will see what I mean!"},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"If you are going to France you can get a head-start on understanding how the French are different from us. Polly Platt's wonderful book Savoir Flair! is a fun read and helps explain why the French are \\"rude\\" to Americans. I wish I had read this before my previous trips to Paris (no doubt there are a few French men and women who wish I had too). Ms. Platt uses her book to take us in hand and walk us through the pitfalls of visiting France. What to do, what NOT to do, and, with her humorous anecdotes, helps us understand and recall that what is expected behavior where I come from (maybe you too) is rude and disrespectful in France. She illuminates with wit and precision the grace and warmth of the French, plus, she gives the reader the tools to elicit the same from the French. A book well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"Polly Platt's excellent and engaging book, &quot;Savoir-Flair,&quot; was of particular use to my wife and myself on a recent trip to Paris. This was the first trans-Atlantic trip for us, and I had last actively used my French 27 years ago, in my sophomore year of high school. I was given Ms. Platt's book for Christmas and dove into it immediately, hoping to get the help I needed for knowing just what to say and do in various circumstances in Paris. We used countless tips from the book--everything from knowing how to hail a LEGITIMATE taxi, to how to greet shopkeepers, to using the Metro, to eating in restaurants--the list goes on and on. My French is, as you can imagine, a bit rusty after 27 years, but with the assurance gained from the book, we were able to successfully navigate through our five days with style and FLAIR. Speaking with the Parisians was easy and fun, even though I had to occasionally ask someone to speak &quot;plus lentement, s'il vous plait.&quot;My favorite story from our stay took place on the day we were to leave Paris. We came down to the hotel desk in the morning and asked the young woman on duty (in French) where we might be able to buy some Pokemon cards for our sons. Her pleasant smile grew into a huge grin, as she echoed back &quot;Les cartes Pokemon?&quot; She then delighted in telling us which department stores in the area might carry them. We found the cards in the toy department at one of the stores she had mentioned. When we brought the cards to the cashier in the toy department, we asked if the cards were indeed in French. She asked us if our children understood French, and when we replied no, she looked puzzled...until we explained that some of our children's friends had Pokemon cards from Japan, and that these French Pokemon cards would make our sons very popular indeed. Her laughter told us that she understood.So, many thanks to Polly Platt for this most interesting and extremely helpful book!"},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"Just spent &quot;April in Paris - 2004&quot; -- Polly's book did help me understand some etiquette points: saying &quot;Bonjour&quot;, asking &quot;parle-vouz anglais&quot; instead of assuming people should speak English (even though for the most part, almost EVERYONE I in Paris did), but I think SHE buys into the French Mystique and really DOES think that the French are superior to all other nationalities.It all comes down to, if a person is a rude, boorish person, they're going to be rude - no matter what their country. Polly excuses bad behaviour by dismissing it as &quot;french&quot;. (rather insulting to NICE Fench people, don't you think?) As one reviewer pointed out, Polly can be rather condescending. I felt TOTALLY intimidated by her constant glowing praises on how Parisiennes dress: she says no one but students and tourists wear blue jeans -- TOTALLY WRONG! I saw almost 65% of the &quot;fashionable&quot; women with jeans -- granted, they were also wearing stiletto boots and make-up!My best tips are: dress nicely, neatly. I feel you will be treated better (but, hey, that happens here, too! -- try walking into Nordstrom dressed as a slob); greet people in their native language, they'll appreciate it, and, please for all our sake, be a good ambassador for OUR country.Except for one snot-nosed sales-chick, almost everyone in Paris was not only polite, but &quot;bend-over-backwards&quot; friendly.I'd recommend this book, but don't let it intimidate you. I would also recommend a crash course in conversational French -- THAT will really help your trip be more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"I bought Savoir Flair! by Polly Platt before I went off for a couple of weeks in Paris. I had never been to France before, but I was familiar with the reputation of the French for being rude -- this coming from Americans, of all people! Platt has lived among the humans of France, like Goodall among the chimps of Gombe, and I thought she might be able to provide some cultural insight.The book met my expectations, and I can recommend it as reasonable for anyone in a situation similar to mine. The book is organized into intuitive chapters dealing with arrival, hotels, shopping, the prevalence of canine feces, eating out, caf&eacute;s, etc., and each section contains useful contact information. You'll also find numerous anecdotes of problems other visitors have had, which in some regards will save you from having to learn them the hard way: CDG is a big and confusing airport, lots of hotels in Paris have similar names so make sure you have an address and a map, cabbies begin charging your fare from the moment you call them (not from your door), etc. At the same time, this is France, not the Congo or Afghanistan. After spending a couple days in Paris, I concluded that Polly Platt's tales of tourist and ex-pat frustrations were largely worst-case scenarios. Except for the challenge of most interpersonal interactions going on in French (it is France, after all) and some of the crazy aspects of French culture (e.g., same alphabet, different keyboard), I found the people to be completely pleasant - both polite and easy on the eyes.Savoir Flair! is touted by the editors as funny and entertaining. Actually, I would say it is more \\"cute,\\" although readers with no fun or entertainment in their lives may enjoy its style. It is a quick read, and worth the effort if you are on way to France. However, Polly Platt seems to have made her literary career out of writing and updating basically the same book, so check to see if she has something more recent. It is likely to touch all the same bases and will perhaps have even more cute anecdotes."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"I am a huge fan of both of Polly Platt's books. They have had a huge impact on my travels and my comfort level abroad-- and not just in France. They start you thinking about the different mindset of the Europeans in a way that makes it easy (with minor adjustments for each country) to get along practically everywhere. I've lived in Geneva, Florence, London and Rome since reading French or Foe and Savoir Flair, as well as traveled to Paris and other parts of France, and cannot tell you the number of times her tips have gotten me out of sticky situations or helped me understand the undercurrent of a conversation in a way that others who have not readthem do not. They should be required reading for anyone traveling to France and would be especially good gifts for college students studying abroad who want to get an exclusive look at the way the French really live and intertact with each other."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"I just got back from Paris, and I am so glad I read &quot;Savoir Flair!&quot; and &quot;French or Foe.&quot; These two books prepared me for my trip and helped to make it even more pleasurable. I loved Paris! In fact, I loved it so much, I'm going back in August, so two trips in a matter of three months!The people of France were nothing but welcoming. Everyone was so nice. The French people went out of their way to be kind to me. I know for a fact that because of reading these books, I knew what to expect and how to handle myself in their environment. Everyone should read Polly Platt's books and take a few French lessons before they go to France, if they want to get the most out of their time there.I am now going to reread these books before I go again. I have purchased many books about France, but these were by far the most helpful."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"I bought this book in preparation for a recent trip to Paris. I'm an experienced traveler, but I hadn't been to France in many years. For some reason I allowed myself to get sucked into the whole French \\"mystique\\" and felt that I needed more advance work than I normally put in before a trip. This book was part of that effort.IMHO, the book had some useful tips, but what I disliked most was the feeling that I was being talked down to. I will acknowledge some differences in style also - I'm not a backpacker, but I'm generally more of a Lonely Planet kinda girl."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"I can recommend this book to those interested in the French culture or those planning to travel there. If there has to be a choice between this book or her first book \\"French of Foe\\", her first book would be the better choice."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"My family heard her speak in Tulsa, OK and they were sorely disappointed. When Mrs. Platt stuck to her topic, she offered some interesting tidbits. But, when she veered off into the political arena, she offended those attending her 'seminar' on Paris. She made comparisons between the twin towers attack and Hiroshima. My family left in disgust. The book offers some bits and bobs on getting around in Paris which are nothing new and can be found in Let's Go Paris or Rough Guides. Don't waste your money on this book. Spend your money on a professional."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"I wrote a very positive review of this book more than a week ago and it has not been posted.

Knowing the simple tips of always greeting people (individually!) before asking questions, ordering, etc; concluding with &quot;Au Revior!&quot; as I left, paved the way for a pleasant trip to France. I cringed to hear Americans jump right in to questions in English with no greeting. No wonder we Americans come across as rude!!SF tip #42 came in handy, as well! I felt so much more like a Parisian and less like an American tourist when I was not stuck at the Metro door! I will say that after consulting two friends who had recently traveled to Paris, I opted to take the RER and Metro to my hotel from Charles De Gaulle. Not only was it a piece of cake, but thus began my love affair with the Metro!As for hotels, tips number 8 and 19 came in handy. The one time I took a taxi instead of the metro, sure enough, the taxi driver did not know the hotel! Many hotels now provide a small area map on their websites, showing their hotel locations in relation to the nearest boulevard or main street. I simply whipped out from my passport the map I had printed from our hotel website and he drove us right to it. I chuckled at my American friends who tried to navigate dark hotel hallways before cluing them in that they had just passed a light switch!

We tried a restaurant recommendation from Savoir Flair! and dined one evening at Le Petit Saint Benoit; it was delicious! We also experienced a very memorable evening when, towards the end of our meal, our waitress somehow initiated a conversation between our tablemates and us. One of them spoke at bit of Spanish, as do I, and he spoke &quot;un petit peu&quot; of English, which expanded somewhat as the evening wore on (just as SF explained it would!). We had a wonderful time speaking for an hour in French, English, or Spanish, depending upon who was speaking to whom. You should have seen my brother and me try to explain that I had earned the trip to Paris as a sales incentive from my employer!

Before leading a group of students to France: have them read this book. This book removes many of the mysteries of the French.

Not only was it so informative and helpful, but it was also funny and delightful as well. I've often quoted it out loud, not only reading passages from the book to my husband and friends, but as my husband and I have walked around Paris, I've been known to say, &quot;Well, Polly said...&quot; as though she's one of my good friends! And in a way, she has been! This book is full of wonderful insights, lots of wise advice, and just lovely prose. Polly Platt's love of Paris comes through on every page and it's made us love Paris more! I've bought it for many of my friends as a great introduction to a beautiful city and its charming people."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"After reading this book and using it's suggestions my wife and I experienced the trip of a lifetime. We had a beautiful honeymoon traveling throughout France. We experienced not the steriotypical rude French, but a wonderful and friendly people. Just try to speak French and remember to be patient and let the salespeople show you their goods and you'll endear yourself the French. They will bend over backwards for you - Bravo Polly Platt!!! P.S. To the person who reviewed this as a racist book: My wife was followed for several blocks and nearly accosted by a man in the Arab Quarter (fortunately she found a police man) It may not happen every day - but it definately happens! The rest of Paris was wonderful!"},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"Intimidated in France? This is the book to get! Easy to read and insightful, it will truly help you function happily in Paris and France. You will finally understand the reason the waiter has not served you yet is about honoring your pleasure not his rudeness; that the little white slip on your cafe table is NOT the check and the reason the server has not brought your check is they do not wish to bother you until you tell them you are ready! And so very much more about so very many aspects. The French are different than we which is exactly the joy of travel. Too many Americans think the French are rude when they just think differently. Read this and you might just a find yourself thinking how rude unknowing Americans appear and let the French lead you to a whole new awareness of politeness and pleasure! A 'must have' for anyone who travels there on business or for those who want to actually get off the tour bus. Very much worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"With the opening caveat that I'm only about a third of the way through this book of Polly's and that I'm also a HUGE fan of her first book explaining the wonderful mysteries of the French, I will say that as a frequent visitor to Paris there are some inconsistencies here that I haven't enjoyed. For example, rather than advise some practical cautions about taking the RER/Metro from Charles DeGaulle into the city which is by far the least expensive and fastest way into Paris from the airport, she flat out says DONT take the subway which I find very bad advice. Early on in the book, she encourages people to seek accommodations in the Marais (4th arrondisement) as a less expensive and more vibrant place to stay in Paris (which is the equivalent of a New Yorker encouraging someone to stay in SoHo, absolutely more vibrant but hardly inexpensive) but then goes on not to list not a single hotel in the Marais! Overwhelmingly, there is no one who writes with more down to earth good humor about the French: their culture, their history, their customs, etc. but I think in this volume when she becomes a bit more of a tour guide to Paris, readers would be wise to take certain tourist type information with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"My husband and I took our maiden trip to Paris in September 2006. I bought Savoir-Flair! about two weeks before we left and devoured it on the plane. Although my husband and I both had studied French in college, we were rusty and unsure what to expect, especially given the bad PR the French seem to receive from Americans.Ms. Platt's book explains so well the cultural differences between the French and Americans, and we followed her advice to a T. We only encountered one person during the week we visited who was downright rude, and I just think he was a curmudgeon. Everyone else was so gracious, despite our terrible pronunciations and grammatical errors. The fact that we were attempting to adapt instead of forcing ourselves on the people we encountered put everyone at ease, from shopkeepers to waiters. It was a magical experience.And I put Ms. Platt's tips to use at a Starbucks in La Defense. My husband was having major American coffee withdrawal, so while he was in a business meeting I popped over to the Starbucks to get him a big cup of java. I ordered in French. I know I made some mistakes, but the barista was very nice about it, and we laughed. She spoke English but appreciated my not assuming that she did.Behind me in line was a very impatient older American woman who was crowding my personal space. When I moved over to wait for my coffee, the older lady stepped up to the counter and asked, quite loudly as if the barista had a hearing impairment, whether the place served cappuccino. The woman was practically shouting. And the barista never offered to speak English, either. I took my coffee and slipped out, lest someone assume I was American, too. In hindsight, I should have offered the older woman my copy of Savoir-Flair!"},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"Unless you need fast, specific travel advice, it would be a good idea to read Polly's broad cultural perspective of France first (French or Foe), and then assimilate the more specific tips in this sequel.Oh, just buy both books at a discount and read them on the plane. It's going to take awhile, since you can't catch the Concorde anymore.Both books are well-written and useful, but the first is a broad, classical exposition of how to deal with the frog mentality. (By the way, they will not take the \\"frog\\" term with any more offense than the Brits resent being called \\"rosbifs\\" or Arabs find the term \\"beurs\\" offensive in France. It ain't a big deal.)When she gets specific, Polly is usually at the high end of societal etiquette and decorum. You can't go wrong following her advice, but you can bend her rules a bit. If you aren't invited to a formal dinner party with place cards but a college kid party, taking a bottle of wine or a bouquet of flowers will not be considered too gauche.On the other hand, carefully remember not to touch the merchandise in any small boutique where it is artfully displayed. That really ruins their day. The French are funny, and Polly sees the inherent humor -- as well as the logic and history -- of their ways."},{"Title":"Savoir Flair!","review":"I had a FABULOUS first trip to Paris, and I believe that it is largely due to having read &quot;Savoir Flair!&quot; before my trip!

This is NOT a travel GUIDE but very useful for someone who plans a visit and wants to learn more about the French and their culture than see France.It is equally enjoyable for those who have spent much time in France. I have been to France five times - about 6 months in total - including a foreign exchange living with a French family for a summer, several months working at the French subsidiary of an American company and several vacations with my spouse. For me there was little new information in the book, but it was most enjoyable nonetheless.This is not to say that the book is without fault. My criticisms include:* Sloppy editing and occasionally poor writing. While the book does have decent organization, the details are very choppy. There are several passages that are completely in the wrong section. Much of the content has obviously been cut and pasted from other sources - many of the anecdotes come from emails from friends and readers of her first work. Often no attempt to reword or reformat these has been made.* Far too much of the book is devoted to Paris and Parisians (maybe 75%)* Big gaps in coverage. I.e. in section on restaurants - although there are details about the attire and rank of the wait staff, there is little on what one might expect to see on the menu for different types of restaurants, or How to tackle the task of translating ingredients and preparations.* On occasion, I felt the author crossed the boundary from discussing cultural differences and into stereotypes.

From her acute awareness of young adults' perspectives and prospects in the rapidly changing interplay between education and a life at work, Professor Evans brings us a clear message admirably written: that all learning today is continuous both in time and amidst the shifting variety of occupations. Professor Evans rejects outmoded notions of 'transition' from learning to work, especially during or immediately after post-compulsory enrolment in formal programmes. She rightly sees each stage of learning, each job-change, as a threshold of the next. No matter how occupationally involved, people are personally engaged in self-education, or in the miseducation inflicted by the failure of systems. This book is full of meat from the author's own researches and experience in Britain, in other European countries and North America; but it is also enriched by research partnerships across the continents. It opens our eyes to present actuality, but still more to the future already beckoning young adults personally and occupationally.&quot; Edmund King, Emeritus Professor of Education, University of London, UK"},{"Title":"DIEN BIEN PHU: (Battles in Focus)","review":"A someone who has read almost every english book on the famous battle.

Definitively informed and informative, Dein Bien Phu 1954 is a seminal addition the growing library of 20th Century Military History in general, and the Vietnam conflict in particular."},{"Title":"DIEN BIEN PHU: (Battles in Focus)","review":"Of all the battles that took place in the last half of the twentieth century, the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu was probably the most significant. Their defeat at the hands of the communist Viet Minh forever destroyed French military power in Southeast Asia and led to the involvement of the United States in the region. Unfortunately for Vietnam, America and the rest of the world, it took three more decades before the true lesson of Dien Bien Phu was learned. In the long run, the Vietnamese led by Ho Chi Minh were going to control all of Vietnam. Foreign military intervention could delay that fact, but never, ever make it impossible.This book is a history of the circumstances that led to the battle, the incredible mistakes made by the French and the actions of General Giap as he planned and executed his battle plan. At first, the French had a good idea; their plan was to draw the Viet Minh out into a pitched battle between the two armies. On the surface, it was a good strategy. At the time, the French forces had superior firepower and total control of the air. However, the French military leadership completely underestimated the Viet Minh resources and their resolve to win. These were the same mistakes that the American leaders made during their involvement in Vietnam. The French military leadership also overestimated their capability and made a bad choice regarding the location of the battle. Finally, the fortress was sold as impregnable and the battle was labeled as decisive by the French before it ever took place. Therefore, they turned their defeat into one that would be decisive, motivating the Viet Minh to fight that much harder to achieve it.For while the French defeat in Indochina was inevitable, their loss at Dien Bien Phu was not. As Stone points out, the Viet Minh suffered considerable losses and there were times when it was possible that the French forces could have staved off the defeat. Had they had more M-24 tanks and better logistical support, the French forces could have survived much longer. While the Viet Minh forces would have continued to fight, at times their losses were so great that some units temporarily lost their fighting capability.One of the best aspects of this book is the explanation of how the Indochina war was presented back in France. The war was so unpopular that it directly led to legislation forbidding conscripts from fighting there and it played a part in the later fall of the French government. Stone also is very meticulous in chronicling the facts regarding the forces arrayed on both sides, including both the strengths and weaknesses. In the end, France could not hold the line in Southeast Asia and it is sad to note that many of the mistakes made by the French were later repeated to a greater extent by the Americans. Which should not be surprising, as both were operating based on the same set of false initial assumptions, namely that their presence could make a difference."},{"Title":"DIEN BIEN PHU: (Battles in Focus)","review":"Excellent book and it gets better from there!David Stone has created a well thought after book on DBP. he give you plenty of the battle and history of it, but more important....He give you alor of stat's and information of units,weapons and commanders contected to maps it is a great graphic piece of work.Buy it keep it and re-read it. It will helpyou when you read the larger books on the battle."},{"Title":"DIEN BIEN PHU: (Battles in Focus)","review":"This is the first book I have read on this famous battle. The book covers the history of the region prior to the battle and the related events afterwards. Anyone who wants to read about how a battle should not be fought should read this book. The also covers how elite troops of the French army were poorly lead but put up an very couragous defense. I would recommend anyone who is interested in the French Foriegn Legion should read this book."},{"Title":"Goha The Wise Fool","review":"According to the book's flyleaf, Goha is a traditional Middle Eastern folk figure, \\"whose tales have been passed by word of mouth through the streets of the smallest villages...for centuries and centuries, beloved for their wit and wisdom.\\" Each of the 15 brief stories (translated by the renowned Denys Johnson-Davies) has an accompanying illustration made originally from a khiyamiya-a hand-sewn tapestry constructed here by Hag Hamdy and Hany of Cairo, Egypt. The textures, colors, and imaginative compositions and aanimal motifs highlight this unusual and entertaining book.Goha is a delightful mix of wisdom and folly, two characteristics often intertwined in folklore. The stories read like a comedian's monologue, there's a set-up involving such issues as Goha's domestic arguments with his wife, his encounters with unfamiliar settings and/or people, and his concerns with thieves and moochers, resolved by a short, one or two-line observation/punchline. Although Goha occasionally out-tricks the tricksters and gets direct, though mild revenge (as when some uninvited guests find that their shoes are missing because Goha sold them for the food that they ate, and Goha tells them, \\"Your shoes are in your stomach.\\"), more often Goha simply turns his inquisitors' comments back on them. After swimming fully clothed because his clothes had previously been stolen on the river bank, his critics comment,\\" How stupid of you...Whoever goes for a swim wearing all of his clothes?\\" \\"'Only someone who prefers ...wearing his clothes wet than have someone else wearing them dry.\\" In a few stories, the closing is flat; the humor is neither clever nor funny: A thief makes off with all of their possessions when Goha and his wife settle an argument by seeing who can stay silent the longest. In the story illustrated on the book cover, Goha concludes that there are 19 geese instead of 20 because one of the 20 policemen didn't pick up a goose. Some of the stories work well as moral instruction; in others, however, the storyline seems diminished by the need to convey a message. In the best stories, such as when Goha buys back his own beloved but old donkey after hearing the donkey seller shout its praises, humor combines with Goha's folly and wisdom (sometimes, a naive wisdom) in a natural, unforced manner.A brief afterward includes a photo of the two illustrators, Hag Hamdy (who drew the pictures) and Hany El Saed Ahmed, who sewed them into tapestries (in a district called the \\"Street of the Tentmakers\\"), and also tells more about the Goha character and the various cultures in which he appears. While the stories are a bit uneven, the pictures are unique and beautiful, and lovers of stories set in other lands will find much to enjoy here. Note: The book does not contain cloth material; rather, the tapestries are rendered on high quality paper that reveals the original materials, vivid colors, and texture-based detail."},{"Title":"Goha The Wise Fool","review":"My kids and I love this book. Goha is foolish and wise from story to story. The artwork is truly unique, the stories well-written and thought provoking. So much more than just another kids' book."},{"Title":"Goha The Wise Fool","review":"This book is not just for children, but for anyone interested in the the delightful adventures and life lessons to be gained from mythic characters. Called Goha in the Middle East (Egypt), \\"the wise fool\\" goes by many other names and folk fables about him are found in many other cultures. Illustrations for this book are done in fabric art (hand-sewn \\"khiyamiyas\\", and the slim little volume is beautifully presented."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Great Hymns for Guitar","review":"I like this book.It has hymns arranged in playable keys for guitar (none of those gol-durned 'golf clubs' in the key signature). You get the hymns with music and chords. One thing that I like is that most of the hymns have older, more original words than the hymnal that we use at church (Hymns For The Family Of God), and usually all of the verses.The selection of hymns is good."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Great Hymns for Guitar","review":"It was an inexpensive book and I got what I paid for. Overall, it is just okay.The song selection is very good. The arrangements are mediocre at best; but they allow for easy simplification or embellishment (depending on skill levels). The skill level required varies so that players of most any level will find something they can play with a little effort.My biggest issue is that the TAB is mostly illegible, at least in the copy that I received. The fret numbers in the TAB are so small and jammed together that it is impossible to read most of it.My suggestion is to re-transcribe the songs you want to work on using a computer so that you can print out TAB that can be read easily. The chords are the most difficult to read; but you can make them out well enough to figure out the chord voicing/fingering (very slowly...) and then write it out so you can read it easily. The chords are mostly open chords using the most common voicings."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Great Hymns for Guitar","review":"Not at all what I was hoping for. This would be better if they wrote a melody line instead of the two part vocal harmony. After all, it is called Great Hymns for Guitar, not vocal. I might be able to use it as a referenc to rewrite some of the music for guitar solos, but a hymnal will probably work better for that. Overall, a disappointment. Poorly arranged, and not in any style I would use for playing in church."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Great Hymns for Guitar","review":"I was disappointed to find that this is not a finger style guitar book; since the description includes TAB and notation, I assumed these would be arranged hymns for the classical or finger-style guitarist.instead, the hymns consist of:Lead and one part harmony vocal lines ,Chords,and the the chords written out in TAB and notation in a simple strumming pattern with a few very basic fills and bass linesIf you have problems with strumming from a chord chart and would like every individual strum notated in very cramped TAB and notationthan this book is for you. the strumming is very simple and I would say any player with a little imagination could come up with a style as good or better than the patterns provided.on the good side, the book contains a nice large selection of common hymns with ALL the verses, and the two part vocal lines are nice for singing with a partner.so, a good \\"fake\\" style hymn book, just don't expect much use for the TAB and notation."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Great Hymns for Guitar","review":"I bought this book for my husband who has been playing the guitar for almost a year. Although none of them are difficult, there are some songs he can play now and some he can grow into--perfect for a learning musician. It has a great selection of mostly familiar hymns! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This Story bible has made family worship time exciting again. I appreciate the fact that the story bible closely follows actual scripture. This is hard to find in most children's bibles."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"The Christian private school where I work uses this book as its Bible curriculum.

It is so easy to read and is written in a vivid, fun way. I love that it make the Word of God fun and real to my kids."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"Our family just loves this Bible. It's perfect to read aloud to a child in Kindergarten and sometime around 1st grade, they should be able to read it on their own (especially if you've already read it aloud once to them). It's accurate to Scripture, but it also reads like a grandparent is telling a Bible story, so it includes a lot of theology and explanations. I've given this as a gift numerous times. It really is the BEST children's story Bible."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"We purchased The Child's Story Bible at the recommendation of a friend. Our son loves to read it.My only disappointment -- in this digital age, it would be nice to have an audio version to accompany it."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"I purchased this after reviewing several children's story Bibles to use in our homeschool. After reading all the reviews I decided on this one, and I'm delighted. The stories are fairly accurate, though condensed and edited somewhat. These story Bibles are not meant to replace scripture, but as a supplement to be used at the parents' discretion."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"My children enjoy and understand our Bible story time so much more. The writing style is both quaint and insightful.

It holds my childrens' interest."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"I purchased this Children's Bible as a baby gift after I received one myself when my first was born nearly 16 years ago. We realized later that my husband's late mother had also used this Bible with her children and, after a few years, we found that original version. I loved going through this with my kids and it was a good version for preschool to middle school age."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"My husband was given this story Bible back in 1961 when he was baptised as an infant. We are still reading it to our 4 children today. It has been glued and reglued, taped, etc. to hold together this beautiful text. I was ecstatic to discover it's been recently republished. I have encouraged many parents to purchase it as it is an excellent, easy to read Bible for the whole family! Parents themselves don't often model personal devotions because so much of the Bible is difficult to understand. Read this every night and I guarantee you'll understand your own Bible much better, and have the best basic biblical overview possible! Vos doesn't water down the Bible stories - even some of the gory details - but in a respectful, careful manner she presents nearly every bible story. We LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This book is wonderfully written in a manner as if a grandmother were telling these Bible stories to her children (that is actually how the book came to be written). It is not watered down Bible stories but they are portrayed as the exciting, dramatic events they were. Customs and doctrines (reformed) are explained right in the story line. Although it is not the complete Bible, it contains all the narrative and historical passages of the Bible. It is divided into chapters which may cover several Bible chapters (it may mix books of the Bible as it tries to tell the story of the nation of Israel chronilogically). The Child's Story Bible contains 110 chapters of old testament stories and 92 of new testament stories. It is a wonderful devotional guide for the family as it is easy for young children to understand yet not too simplistic for older children. Our family loves it and has learned a lot from it!!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"My children love this Bible. The stories come alive and they are easily understandable. The stories are biblically accurate and center around Christ, even in the Old Testament stories. I highly recommend this Bible for giving your kids a well-rounded knowledge of the Bible."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"Mrs. Vos's daughter gives her mother a most beautiful compliment in writing of her mother's passion: creating a Biblically accurate children's story Bible. She observes, that, as a child, she took almost no notice of her mother's personally-committed habit of ascending the steps of their home to an upstairs area where she could research and write... what has become one of the best Bible story books written.Our family used it as a three year Bible course. We learned so much from her added notes which weaves the stories to the time line of Israelite history. Catherine F. Vos' chronologically written stories gave a point of reference from which our son could create a timeline of pictures and Bible references."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"I first heard stories of the Bible from this book and reread it multiple times through high school. I grew up on the King James Version of the Bible and this book closely parallels it as well as providing the actual Biblical references for each story. When I had my own daughter in 1978, I asked my mother for our old volume, but she had gotten rid of it. At that time, all I could find was the paperback version and so had to make do with it. I continued to search for The Child's Story Bible and purchased a 1932 and 1961 version from a major on-line auction site. Nevertheless, I was delighted to find Amazon had obtained the 1986 version - the last hardback I can find of this book. I purchased one for a future grandchild and one for my daughter to give to her niece. In reviewing the text, I was pleased to see that the editors had not succumbed to making this a politically correct version of the Bible, but chose to maintain the integrity of the original text. If you are looking for a great addition to your child's library or a text that will provide many hours of delightful reading and sharing of the Bible with a child, this is your choice!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"My wife and I argue over who get's to read this to our kids. It is that good. I would recommend this Bible to anyone who wants a clear, plain language understanding of the Bible.

You will not wrong with this one! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"We heard about this Bible from several homeschooling resources and weren't sure about purchasing it because we already had 3 children's Bibles.

Before I could read, my parents used to read me the stories. Once I had learned to fend for myself, it became \\"my\\" Bible until I reached my teens. When our daughter wanted to start hearing the Bible stories, we read to her from the Child's Story Bible; I was amazed at how well the old book had held up. Its simple style and gorgeous paintings were as enchanting as they used to be. Now, we are waiting until our granddaughter is old enough to embark on the wondrous stories. I am so glad that the book is still in print! Buy it and use it--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This is the best Children's Bible I have ever read.

Is so true to the bible and so doctrinally correct. I love it. Many children stories are so off and don't mach the real Bible . Their message is confusing . This book gives a bit of background coverage so the children understand the times of the bible , the culture of the people that live in bible times so the children can connect the story. This way they can understand the message of the passage. It is amazing. I love it. It can also be used as teaching material in a sunday school class. Also can be used to introduce someone to the bible . It is very simple and the language is very simple. Anyone can understand it.

My older 3 kids are 11 year old twins and a 7 1/2 year old, and they all look forward to our nightly Bible reading, and ask me to keep reading even when it is bedtime! My 3 1/2 year old gets bits & pieces from it too, although he is a little young to understand it. I recommend this Bible for all parents of school-age kids and up. It really makes the Bible understandable. I would even recommend it to adults who are new Christians without a bible background."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"If you are looking for a way to bring your family together for family worship time and/or would like to teach your children about the Bible, this is it!!! What I love about this story Bible is that it speaks at a child's level giving them ways to remember the stories by. There are analogies and comparisons to real life throughout. When I read this to our kids, I feel like they are getting so much out of it. And it makes me smile when I hear them remember what I've read to them.

Also, I appreciate the chronological order which helps the readers- kids esp. to understand the connection all the stories have to one another.The one thing I don't like though is the lack of pictures. This would really help my kids stay focused as I read them the stories.I hand out the typical children's bibles, mentioned above, which are so chock full of pictures yet lacking in substance, and the kids look at those pictures while I read from this book.Overall, a good book. I would buy it again."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"One day my 15 year old son told me that he didn't know the stories in the Bible. I got to thinking...I knew bits and pieces of all the main stories, but I didn't really think I could repeat them to my son. I was embarassed, so I went right to Amazon to find a book that explained the Bible in a fun, understanding, interesting way. I also wanted something that hadn't been \\"modernized\\". I didn't want to read that God is our Mother, or words like \\"humankind\\". I wanted a good old-fashioned, biblically true book. This one exceded my expectations!! I am halfway done and have learned so much! I read it to my son, and he enjoys it. I have not been able to put it down, so my son is not as far as me. I can't believe how much I DID'NT know. I would highly recommend this for anyone. Even if you are very familiar with the Bible, it's a great refresher."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"I LOVE this Bible. The writing is beautiful, the insight rich and thought-provoking. Highly recommended as a next step after beginner-type Bible storybooks. Note: There are some lovely illustrations here, but unlike the Golden Children's Bible, they are very few and far between. This is a Bible for children who do not need pictures to follow the story."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This is hands down the best child's Bible I have come across and I've been searching for a long time. Even though it is a bit old for her yet, my 3 year old loves it and regularly asks for me to read to her from it.The best aspect of this Bible for me:The stories are all tied in together. As a child I knew plenty of 'Bible stories', ie, Daniel in the Lion's Den, Noah's Ark etc, but if you had asked me how any of them related to each other, I wouldn't have been able to join the dots or tell you why knowing the stories was important. In this book, I believe Catherine F. Vos is very committed to teaching children the WHOLE story of the Bible. The narrative voice that tells the stories is constantly tying the themes together, drawing the child's mind back to a previous story and setting the scene for the new one. I've actually been filling some holes in my own Bible education leftover from my childhood through her concisely related insights.The downside for me:Through the narration style, explanations are sometimes given for parts of Bible stories that I myself struggle to read to my children because I disagree with her interpretations. I know that people will often disagree on interpretation of scriptures, but I think there are many things that could have just gone unsaid. Here is an example from the story of creation.\\"The Bible says, 'God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.' This does not mean that God picked up a handful of dirt and made a man out of it. It means that man's body is made out of the same material we find in soil and the rocks.\\"Which is all well and good if you are teaching the 6 day creation story as a metaphor on the whole, but this book does not. It only picks on this one aspect of the creation story. I wish that in this case, as in a few others, the author had just quoted the Bible and left it there.Nonetheless, a very valuable addition to our household's library."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This Bible is a must for everyone! Unlike children's Bibles that tell lovely feel-good stories and are filled with pictures to keep the kids' interest, this Bible has only rich, rich content that feeds a child's heart and soul, AND leaves them wanting more! I cannot imagine how different it would have been for me had I had this for my children when they were young, BUT, not wasting time with regret, it is now a staple here at Nana's house whenever the grandkids come.Along with that, it will now be a standard baby gift for me to new parents. In fact, I am so passionate about this book, I am buying them and giving them to people who will commit to either read them for themselves or to their children or grandchildren. The thank-you's I've received from recipients inspire me to give away more! (We all have hobbies we spend our money on, don't we? So this is mine!) This is an excellent Bible for adults who struggle with reading their own Bible; it says \\"The Child's Bible,\\" but in reality, it is a rewarding read for ALL ages. I cannot recommend it enough; it is by far, the only and the best children's Bible that should EVER be read.WARNING: When reading this to children, DO NOT have a time frame! The questions and chatter that this Bible brings up is unbelievable and oh, so gratifying! It is really difficult to get through a whole chapter without going off on every subject under the sun ... subjects that we should talk about such as death, diet, our government, money, propaganda; the list is endless!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"I LOVE that this is now a part of our library. It's great to read these Bible \\"stories\\" to my kids starting in Genesis and going through the Bible. I LOVE that aspect of it. This is an OLDER Bible and the Scripture text when quoted is taken from the King James Version. I have two children under the age of six. I will frequently modernize the language for them while I'm reading. To note: this is NOT a picture book (although there are some pictures included). When sitting down to read this with my children I encourage them to utilize their imaginations. We then often will draw our own pictures of the stories that we just read. We'll grow into it! I will probably also purchase the Egermeier's Bible Story Book."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"I really enjoy this Bible. My son's teacher uses it with his First grade class. (Christian school) It is nice to be able to read him the stories that are put into wording that children understand. Nice pictures too!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This book is by far the best Bible story book we have found. I have been a children's minister for 20 years and have reviewed many books and this one tops them all. The stories are biblically accurate and incredibly easy to understand. We have bought this for every family/friend that has had a baby for the last 5 years and will continue to do so because it is so wonderful."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This book is one that has been around for a long time. It is ideal for teaching young people and new Christians about the history in the Bible. The book is written in narative form and is such that all people can understand it well.

I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This book came highly recommended to me 10 years ago when I had my first child. We read it through, cover to cover at least once a year. It clearly weaves complex Bible truths through the entire text. Very understandable read aloud for four year olds and up. I've learned much from it. Catherine Vos had a real gift for relating the stories, yet not watering them down for children and the whole thing flows as she relates God's word from Genesis to Revelation. We buy this book as a gift for new moms. It's great!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"If you are looking for an in depth, true to fact Bible for your children ages 4 and up I definitely recommend this. It has been an awesome learning tool for my children!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"We read this book right after dinner and my kids ask if were are going to read it every night because they like the book, we have had are ups and downs reading to our kids because they are 5,8,14, but for the most part, we really enjoy the stories and they are easy to understand. My mom came for a visit and when we were reading this book she really liked it and so we bought her one too. She has grandchildren living with her right now and was excited to be able to read with them.The stories are easy to read,understand and a great bonding time for the whole family."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"We are almost halfway through this for the second time. It's been a hit with the kids from the beginning. At ages 10 and 7, they are the ones who insist we read Bible stories before anything else. It's enriched my own understanding of the Old Testament stories as well (I tend to get all of those kings mixed up!). My oldest is now reading the actual Bible as well, and I think this book opened his heart to regard the Bible as an exciting read.It's beautifully written and biblically sound. It's also written with the worldview that the Bible is MUCH more than a guide for right living; it is truly God's story - and everything was and is about His preparing a fallen world for a Savior. Love and respect for the source -- as well as for the children for whom these stories are intended -- shine through the pages. What a loving mother and grandmother Mrs. Vos must have been. Her desire for children to understand how much God loves them is palpable. Wonderful."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This book has been great for family read aloud time.

My children are 3 and 4, so a bit young for this particular one. But it still holds their attention for quite a while. I am very glad I purchased it as part of our library. Often times my 4 year old is very interested in a Bible story from one of our Kenneth Taylor picture Bibles or the Big Picture Story Bible, and I like being able to go to the Children's Story Bible to give him more information. For family devotions, my husband reads directly from the Bible. This book reminds me of the modifications one might make for young ones when reading directly from the Word. Very well done.For those starting out with young children, I highly recommend trying and buying lots of different children's Bible books. I love all the different things that different Children's Bibles incorporate. And I like that the kids are really drawn to all the different ones. It makes reading and talking about the stories and integrating the truths into our lives easier, as opposed to having just one single Bible story book. And the more I've gotten, the more interested my kids are in our family devotion times where we read straight from the NASB."},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This is the best child's story bible printed, true to the word of God and a great teaching tool for raising children in the faith.

I cannot say enough good about this book! I love Vos' insight and the way she explains and connects the Bible stories. The central theme of the entire Bible, Jesus Christ, is clear. The only thing that could be improved is the pictures are few, rather dark, and placed at odd intervals (not close to the stories they illustrate). However, the text is so wonderful and engaging that it doesn't matter. My daughters will sometimes scurry to find a picture of a story in one of their other Bible books, creating their own \\"interactive\\" lesson--ha! This isn't for the youngest children, however. They do need an attention span and ability to follow the story. But once they have that, this Bible is the one to buy!"},{"Title":"The child's story Bible","review":"This is a fantastic book.

After years of working I realized only a select few of those many many books were accurate. This book, you can tell, is written by people who know the industry from an inside perspective. Most other books i've read are from authors who don't really have a clue other than what they've heard. This book is a testament to the \\"old industry\\" before Steve Jobs and MySpace hit the scene.

While not as broad in it's scope as other books, such as \\"The Orthodox Church\\" by Bp. Kallistos, the smaller scope of the book does allow for a closer examination of the subjects that are dealth with, and Fr. Michael Pomazansky does this quite well.This book is a systematic examination of Orthodox theology, and for that some have criticized it; systematic, catechism, etc. are four-letter words for some Orthodox. However, one cannot help but wonder why organization as it happens in this book could ever be considered a bad thing. Perhaps only behind \\"The Orthodox Church\\" and \\"The Orthodox Way,\\" this is the book that I would most likely recommend to anyone wishing to have a broad but intellectually satisfying overview of what the Orthodox believe.I do have two minor issues with the text as it is today. First, it is impossible to tell when footnotes are from Fr. Seraphim Rose (the translator) or Fr. Michael (the author). This has caused a problem at times when I know that Fr. Seraphim feels a certain way about a subject, but I am not sure whether Fr. Michael also feels the same way. A lengthy footnote is sometimes provided, but with no indentification as to who is speaking.And second, Fr. Seraphim does seem to insert things into the book that were not originally part of the book. While this is not uncommon in books published by the St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, and while these additions are given in appendices, I still feel like it is an unfortunate move sometimes, as in a case like this book where the appendices bring in a controversial tone to the book that would have otherwise been absent. If I lend or give this book to someone and they have questions about Orthodoxy, I'd much rather try and answer questions about icons or Mary, and not controversial subjects like the Dogma of Redemption."},{"Title":"Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition","review":"Orthodox Dogmatic Theology is a top-notch introduction to Orthodox Theology for the Orthodox Christian, the Catechumen, or the Outsider (that's me). I keep this on my shelf along with The Orthodox Church by Bishop Kallistos Ware, and The Mystical Theology of the Orthodox Church by Vladimir Lossky. This is a fine translation by Father Seraphim Rose, a gifted and intelligent man who became an atheist as a young man but after his college years, walked into a Russian Orthodox Church and became a Priest, Monk, and Scholar. Don't let the controversy surrounding his views concerning aspects of the intermediate state keep you away from this book. A must read for anyone with an interest in Orthodoxy."},{"Title":"Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition","review":"I had been looking for a textbook on Orthodox systematic theology for quite some time before accidently coming across an older edition of this volume while I was in Europe. I am an evangelical who is painfully aware of our tradition's ignorance of Eastern beliefs, and of our dependence on Western conceptions of theological categories and methods. As such I was (and still am) deeply interested in exploring the depths and riches of Eastern theology, and to this end Pomazansky is a gem.I imagine most pastors have at least one or more volumes of systematic theology in their libraries. Everyone has their favorites: Barth, Calvin, Miley, Mueller, Grudem, Ott, Wenger, etc. Most of us try to have a wide variety of sources at our disposal for the sake of reference. Pomozansky's Orthodox Dogmatic Theology deserves to be on your shelf because I doubt anyone has written a one-volume systematic with the same measure of depth, eloquence, and brevity, let alone from an Eastern Orthodox perspective. Think of Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology, but with greater clarity, and a even more deeply devotional/pastoral spirit.That being said, Pomazansky's book is not without its flaws. He is strongest when articulating the faith all Christians share, and in that respect, I would reccomend his book to every student of theology, both lay and clergy. On the other hand, from an evangelical perspective, he is weakest when defending Orthodox distinctives. I think evangelicals will find that some of his arguments are far from convincing because they are exegetically unfounded or suspect. That being said, Orthodox readers probably won't be bothered too much by this apparent shortcoming because Scripture does not have the same place of authority in Eastern traditions as in evangelical traditions.But even with these (minor) doctrinal dissagrements, this is an eminently useful book that I constantly refer to for inspiration and explanation. In fact, it may be the most dog-eared, highlighted, and underlined systematics I own. You should get one."},{"Title":"Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition","review":"To quote from the 'Translator's Preface', written by Hieromonk Seraphim Rose, 1981: \\"One of the major advantages of this book is its simplicity of presentation. It was written not for academic theologians, but primarily for pastors, and thus it has a practical approach that is missing in many works of contemporary academic theology. In his theological writings, Fr Michael remains deeply rooted in the tradition of the Orthodox Church, not trying to supercede with his own private opinions any revelation that the Church has handed down to us.... his intent here is to write about exactly what the Church teaches -- what pastors can give to their flocks as the certain, unchanging teaching of the church -- and not about what is \\"disputed\\". There is a distinct wholeness in Fr. Michael's approach, which allows for no confusion over the Church's actual teaching. Another advantage of this book, especially for pastors who deal with converts to Orthodoxy from various religious denominations, is that it contrasts the traditional Orthodox teaching with the errors and innovations of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.\\"And further \\"Fr. Michael is the last surviving graduate of a pre-revolutionary Russian theological academy (that of Kiev), and is therefore one of the few living contacts we have with the long-standing centers of traditional Russian theology, the direct inheritance of the Byzantine Fathers. Always faithful to the instruction of the Church, his actual \\"school\\" is, ultimately, the Church herself\\".I love this book. I love this book because while it is scholarly, and in fact is used as a text at the Holy Trinity Seminary in Jordanville, New York, it speaks to the heart. This is terribly important as Orthodoxy is a faith which speaks to the heart. \\"The soul... naturally seeks a personal God\\" (God's Revelation to the Human Heart, Fr Seraphim Rose, p6). \\"Why does a person study religion?... to come into contact with reality\\" (ibid, p 13), \\"a person must be in a religious search not for the sake of religious experiences, which can deceive, but for the sake of truth.\\" (ibid, p18) \\"If you look at a textbook of Orthodox theology, you will find that the truth cannot be found by the unaided posers of man. You can read the Scriptures or any holy book and not even understand what they say..\\" When in Acts 8 (28-39) the angel of the Lord spoke unto Philip and told him to go south toward Jerusalem, and along the way he encountered the eunuch, the eunuch requested of Philip that he tell him what it meant. \\"There are several supernatural, mystical elements in this account... there was something else that affected him: not miracles, but something in his heart.\\" (ibid, p 19)\\"When Philip spoke to the ethiopian eunuch, something in the eunuch's heart changed.\\" This is the reason the eunuch was baptized and became a Christian.This is how God reveals Himself to mankind, in a personal way, He speaks to our hearts. This book speaks to the heart. It is written in a personal, kind and loving way to tell the truths of the Orthodox Church. It warms the heart and inspires the faithful. That is wonderful, simply wonderful in a teaching book. There are many good theological books out there, very scholastic. However to find one which speaks to one's heart, this is a rare gem. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition","review":"This book sets out the essentials of Orthodox dogma. It reads beautifully (thanks to the the translation by Fr Seraphim Rose) and brings one closer to a sens eof God's presence through its themes. I have bought a number of copies of this book for new converst - I am a Greek orthodox priest and not a new convert, but i find it extremely informative."},{"Title":"Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition","review":"\\"Dogmas,\\" according to Father Michael, are \\"...the definitions of truth declared by the Church\\" [31]. While the meaning of dogma between Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Roman Catholic and Protestant) Churches diverges in significance [cf.20,373-4: by Blessed Seraphim], Father Michael's definition of dogma would meet little resistance when compared with official ecclesial documents outside the Orthodox Church. I will explore divergence later in this review; my point at the start is only to state obvious comparisons.For example, 'Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy' from the Second Vatican Council [cf. fn. 289; added to 3rd edition (2005)] altered the 'lingua franca' of the Liturgy, reversed the position of the priest, added the common cup as well as much more because of conciliar truth declared by the Roman Church. Moreover, Aquinas would have agreed with Father Michael's definition for dogma by his own use of \\"scientia,\\" for dogmatic theology was the principal and primary science for Thomas. Father Michael does not identify such given the scope of the text.Thanks to the author's and translator's literary economy and non-affected style, readers from any Christian tradition can experience encouragement in the book's invitations to draw closer to God. For example, the author's discussions about natural virtues, such as humility and continence [157,264-65], attract readers to cooperate with the Holy Trinity in cultivating the virtues as part of their own salvation in Christ.However, Father Michael clarifies dogma \\"in situ\\" across 372 pages of text, which Blessed Seraphim translated from Russian. \\"In situ,\\" as I use this Latin phrase, conveys Father Michael's goal for dogmatic theology in Orthodox tradition [cf. 46: specific 19th-C Russian citations]. His goal is to make clear statements about the teachings of the Apostles for contemporary readers [46-9]. It would be impossible to do more, such as \\"...develop more completely or go deeper into the truths of the faith than the Apostles\\" [47].As dogmatic theology applies the faith to contemporary issues [48, 355-71], it reinforces collegiality among bishops who share responsibility to obey what has been handed down from the Apostles. Another way to speak of shared responsibility is to speak of dogma residing within the Orthodox Church and not independent from her [46,92-3,246-8,267-9,295-6]. Just as the Church lives, breathes and prays her dogma to remain \\"one body, one faith,\\" active participation by all members in the Orthodox Church is the author's meaning of shared \\"consciousness\\" in the Church [236-7,294-6].Having laid a foundation for dogma in the Church, Father Michael addresses important differences pertaining to (1) sources of truth and (2) assent to dogma between Christians, east and west, on the nature and practice of theology (\\"theologizing\\") and ecclesiology [234,303]. In particular, Father Michael's definition of dogma \\"in situ\\" presents an alternative and ancient understanding of practicing theology--\\"theologizing\\"--and the Church [427-50]. Therefore, non-Orthodox readers among Christians would benefit most by turning to chapters five and six, where Father Michael lays out the topics of evil, sin, and the salvation of the human race [150-228].Thus, any dogmas that have been declared after the 11th-Century schism that separated the Patriarchal Sees of Constantinople and Rome [92] must be judged by criteria of \\"truth\\" as set before the Great Schism in the seven Ecumenical Councils. Revelation is the only source of truth [29-30], as Father Michael puts it, whereas \\"opinions\\" have been introduced as dogma in the west after the Great Schism [362-4].After the Great Schism, Aquinas introduced an opinion concerning salvation that Father Michael addressed in a footnote to the first Russian edition published in 1911 [214]. He critiqued a passage from Thomas' 'Summa' (III, Q.49, art.4) in which Aquinas deduced that God had been \\"appeased\\" by the sacrifice of Christ. A dogma of appeasement had been a logical extension of Augustine's doctrine of sin, a point which Father Michael considered in chapter five [cf.165-6, and editor's fn. on 165 in 3rd ed.]. Therefore, Father Michael identified the origin of what he considered the \\"one-sided interpretation of Redemption\\" [214] of the \\"Latins.\\"I give the book four stars, and not five, for a couple of reasons. First, the text does not present a method of critical reasoning that even Orthodox theologians must employ when communicating ancient truths to contemporary people and situations. Second, the Brotherhood of St. Herman continues to publish the text and provide updates.

The indicated that the next downturn of business cycle would bring disappointment to those who relied on the prognosis of just a mild recession. Among the early indicators of becoming depression were labor market and capital market trends as well as indicators of change in the international division of labor and technological change and substitution. In modern industrial civilization, the boundary between nature and culture become increasingly fuzzy, and many of the social economic forces manifest themselves in the use and creation of artifacts. Therefore, indicators on the great and direction of industrial innovations can be expected to tell us a good deal about change within a changing economy."},{"Title":"Stalemate in Technology: Innovations Overcome the Depression.","review":"I read this book in the late 1970s and my trying to find a copy of it.

In humans, our language capacity enhanced and favored a more verbal socialization, and successfully identified paternity, whereas our nearest primate relatives, the bonobos, retained a highly visual socialization based on a primary maternal separation/individuation process, and intensely centered on visual displays and reaction to the highly visible female estrus.(Frans de Waal, in his book Bonobo: the Forgotten Ape details the prototypical bonobo pre-oedipal separation/individuation crisis in pre-pubertal and adolescent bonobo females on pages 116-117 of his book, which I recommend as a companion book for discussion of the primate origins of adaptive, highly visual sexuality).Socarides' theory explains, in a rich, deep, and satisfying way, why male reparative homosexuals, for example, may continue to lack visual erotic attraction to females even after they spontaneously achieve full heterosexuality in therapy, since the perversion itself, namely homosexuality, originally served a self-reparative function, in a pre-oedipal splitting of the maternal imagos into a pathological(rejecting or intrusive) pre-visual, sensual mother on the one hand, versus an intensely visual, eroticized, idealized maternal substitute(the perversion)on the other. The perversion is always a regression to the pre-oedipal point of earliest separation/individuation crisis and fixation, and it creatively attempts to serve a reaffirming function, namely, self-cohesion and preservation of self-identity, in the face of the young child's overwhelmed attempt to self-repair and restore the original maternal union.Socarides' theory further explains 1. the exclusively visual sex of pornography and the sex industry, which reveals an unconsciously retained and problematic pre-oedipal primary feminine identification in both males and females and 2.the now omnipresent visual separation &quot;traumata&quot; displayed by some youth, in extreme piercings, tatoos, and other visual body modifications, that also signal a pre-oedipal separation/individuation crisis."},{"Title":"The Letter to Philemon: A New Translation With Notes and Commentary (Eerdmans Critical Commentary)","review":"Markus Barth (son of theologian Karl Barth) and his student Helmut Blanke's \\"The Letter to Philemon\\" is a *comprehensive* commentary and analysis of Philemon. It is highly recommended for background reading on slavery and the social setting of the New Testament and the book of Philemon, as well as for deep critical and textual analysis. Barth and Blanke's work is appropriate both for scholarly study and for sermon preparation. The book can be read at a moderate pace; it contains substantial information but is not overly dense. If one were to purchase only one book about Philemon, this should be it.The first 100 pages deal with slavery and social setting. The authors are methodical in their approach and take appropriate liberties without employing wild imagination. This section of the book reads like a novel in places.The next section of 140 pages explores \\"Literary, Biographical, and Contextual Issues,\\" includes a summary history of Philemon interpretation, as well as a foray into Liberation Theology.The third section, which comprises more than half of the book's 500 pages, is an in-depth verse-by-verse commentary with excursuses into relevant historical and theological issues. Syntax and grammar of the Greek text are not the foci of the commentary; for those things I commend Murray Harris' bookExegetical Guide to the Greek New Testament: Colossians and Philemon. Barth and Blanke's work focuses mainly on translated text, and employs transliteration when the Greek text is addressed.At the time of this review, May 2009, the Hardcover edition is available for about $11 shipped. I did not see any difference between it and the more recently printed paperback edition which was $50 at my local bookstore."},{"Title":"The Letter to Philemon: A New Translation With Notes and Commentary (Eerdmans Critical Commentary)","review":"You won't find a more comprehensive commentary on Philemon.

They tend to belittle any interpretation that does not line up wit theirs. Not as strong on lexical issues as other critical commentaries."},{"Title":"An Interactive Introduction to Mathematical Analysis Paperback with CD-ROM","review":"Well, what can I say. I enjoyed this book much more than I normally enjoy mathematics books, and I do have a healthy liking for mathematics.I believe this is Professor Lewin's life's work, and it shows. Mathematical analysis is not an easy subject, and Lewin has made a genuine effort to make this subject accessible to all students. That is not to say this book is \\"for idiots/dummies,\\" but for the intelligent mathematical analysis neophyte looking for a book to ease him into higher mathematics. The writing style is informal and straight to the point.So what can you expect to learn from this book? If you don't know what mathematical analysis is at all, you'll read about that too (as well as the subject matter itself!) The examples and problems are wonderful. They are at just the right level for an engaging introduction that will give you a place to stand to take further courses. You can understand and enjoy this book with a modest mathematical background (high school only, and not necessarily any calculus courses!) and average grades. You will need to go slowly and think, but Lewin masterfully guides you through.This book is a welcome change from enormous encyclopedic works that present page after page of mind-bending symbols and leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out what it all means. The authors of these wretched books think a quick paragraph is just fine. I disagree, and so does Lewin. This book is a pleasure to *read*, and you will learn about mathematical analysis, too! This book can serve as a good introduction to higher mathematics as well as calculus. Lewin provides early instruction in the \\"vocabulary of mathematics\\" and proofs before getting into the subject matter of the book.Lewin makes mathematical analysis accessible for everyone, even those with a modest mathematical background, and even makes it a pleasure."},{"Title":"An Interactive Introduction to Mathematical Analysis Paperback with CD-ROM","review":"This is actually an excellent text as a supplement for students of advanced calculus. There are many simplified examples and a lot of explaination, perhaps too much. The author starts with logic, which is good since most students have difficulty with understanding the contrapositive, converse, and proof by contradiction. He gives a lot of information on the subjects that are covered (there are a good number of subjects not covered) and talks (perhaps rambles) a lot on these subjects. However if you could dig through the jargon and appreciate a bunch of nice examples and fundamentals this is a book for you. I didn't look at the CD."},{"Title":"Long, N. J. & Long, J. E. (2001).

Everything you want and need to know about it for both film and digital.But Focal Press once again comes through with crappy illustrations. The key to the zone system is being able to discriminate tones. The copy of the book I received has such muddy printing that it is impossible to see any difference between zones 0 to II and VIII and IX on the step diagrams provided. The black and white photos used for examples are equally muddy, making it difficult to follow the discussion in the text.Text gets 5 stars, production gets 1, average = 3"},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"This is one of the easier books to understand on the zone system. It does not get too tied up in the details of the system but describes enough detail to allow the reader to understand the basics of the system. This book is really targeted to someone who is not familiar with the zone system or who has studied it in more complex books and did not really comprehend the system. For this intended audience the book is right on target. It takes the complex issues of the zone system and removes the calculations and just gives you what you need to know. Think of it like the difference between an art teacher who says \\"Color the grass green\\" versus one who says \\"The grass must be green because chlorophyll absorbs the green portion of the light spectrum and so reflected light appears that color\\". If you just want to know how to use the system without a lot of detail behind why the system works then this is a good book selection for you."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to the Zone System. If you are looking to learn about the Zone System, it is hard to go wrong with this book. However, if you are somewhat familiar with the Zone System and are looking for more advanced info, this may not be the book for you. I had read Ansel Adam's book &quot;The Negative&quot; (which is an excellent book if you are looking for a bit more technical and in depth study) before this book so I felt that the book was a little simple. However, the thing I love about this book are the appendixes Chris includes. In them are a wealth of info for developing times for many developers and films, as well and a plethora of additional useful information. I also found the two testing methods Chris provided to be extremely accurate and useful. In summary, this is an excellent introductory book on the Zone System, and intermediate users will find the appendixes extremely useful. However, if you consider yourself an expert in the Zone System, I would not recommend this book. However, if you consider yourself an expert, you probably won't be looking for a book anyway."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"This is a clear and excellent description of what the zone system is and does. Useful are the included tables for various film development times and chemicals. It is ironic however, that the litho plate print examples of the different zones are not executed carefully enough.

It's to the point, and has great examples, especially explaining the effects of development time."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"I never developed a film in my life, but despite the fact that the original edition did not deal with digital photography and this book still talks a lot about film photography, this is one of the best most useful books on photography I've read so far. The author emphasizes important points by repeating them many times, so if you want to save some time I recommend reading this book in a different order. Start with Chapter 10, which is about Digital Photography. Most concepts are pretty intuitive and because this is the last chapter, he does not repeat them so much here. It is actually easier to see the important ideas in this chapter because he explains the differences between film and digital photography. Then read Appendix D because that's where he explains in more detail what makes digital photography different, i.e. why you expose for highlights and process for shadows in digital, instead of exposing for shadows and processing for highlights in film. Then go read Chapters 4 and 5 where the zone system is explained, now it will take you at most a couple of hours to finish these chapters since you pretty much saw it in Chapter 10. Play around with your camera as you read, it makes a lot of sense. Skip chapters 1,2 and 3; you will get bored before you get to the main point. Appendix A on Color Management is a must read!!! I am using Gimp to process my photos and I could never understand why the colors of my photos look different in gimp, in preview, in quick look, after applying g'mic filters, after uploading on flickr. I read a good book on gimp and it just glossed over Color Management, saying most people will never need to worry about this. Wrong. Most people need to understand it right away; and I didn't even start printing yet! The same with gimp documentation, no details at all! Anyway, after reading Appendix A, I selected my mac LCD display color profile as a monitor profile in gimp preferences (do not trust gimp to automatically select it!), changed color profile to Adobe RGB 1998 from a small color profile sRGB, and now everything looks great and consistent!To summarize, it was a very informative great book! Just save your time and read in the order I suggested above."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"This book is a waste of your time unless you have extensive experience with black and white film photography. For those working digitally, the author recommends reading Chapters 1 through 6 and then proceeding to Chapter 10. The first six chapters focus on black and white film exposure and development. Chapter 10 addresses digital. This progression is evidence of someone who knows little about teaching. Because the author apparently grew up on black and white film photography, the digital user is first required to learn everything the author knows about film photography so that the user can then understand how the author learned to convert his life lessons in film to a digital world. An excellent teacher would develop new analogies, stories, examples, and other ways of teaching for people who only know digital. The author's approach results in the absurd situation that in Chapters 1 through 6 you learn why your exposure bias should be for the shadows (Zone III), only to learn in Chapter 10 that in the digital world you bias should be for the highlights (Zone VII). That's the central message of the book.Why should I waste my time learning about film development and high and low contrast photo paper? I am living in an inkjet world. Although I think the author is open to digital photography, his approach is evidence of a latent snobbery regarding the superiority of film to digital. That may still be true with black and white photography, but by every account I have read, it is not true when it comes to color--digital is better. Moreover, the availability of digital technology is making film photography a dying niche. The film folks had better accept reality, at least if they want to teach people who are coming of photographic age in the current enviroment.Although the author claims he will not get into technical material, that is exactly what he does in Chapter 10. You read about scanning film negatives (again the bias toward film), Photoshop theory, bit depths, tone charts, etc. Bit depths strike me as largely irrelevant if you are shooting in RAW format, which I suspect most people who buy this book already are.A far more productive book would contain 200 photos with the zones marked on each photo so the reader can begin to see how zones and color align in the real world. Under each photo would be a discussion of how the scene was metered and why. In other words, when I am walking down the street and want to take a photo of four people talking and they are in a park, what should I meter to get a good exposure? The grass, the sky, or their faces? Does it make a difference if they are light or dark skinned? What about if they are wearing mostly white clothes or colorful dresses? Suppose it is a bright sunny day or a cloudy day? Etc. etc"},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"I wish I had this book 30 years ago. I knew of the Zone system, but heard people talking of measuring densities and base fog and it sounded like a lot of effort.

My copy is getting dog earred already. This is not just for film. He relates this to the digital world as well. If you aspire to move beyond PHD-(push here dummy) photography, this is essential reading."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"The zone system was developed by Ansel Adams, who had a consummate grasp of all the technicalities of photography and used his knowledge to depict the wilderness areas he loved and wanted to preserve. However, most serious photographers do not have that technical expertise and do not work with the equipment used by Adams. This book is an excellent account by a current teacher of photography who makes the system understandable and useable in the modern context. It gave me a clear understanding of the way in which to control exposure. Having said that, I have used a different set of recommendations in carrying out black and white film tests, as I found those in the book over-complicated; nevertheless, the book gave me the essential understanding that was crucial to carrying out the film tests correctly and understanding the results."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"A re-hashed book with a poor effort to update for digital photography. I found it very difficult to read. There was very little new information for any serious amateur, e.g. \\"What is a pixel?\\" and other useless tidbits for anyone who has some experience (which I'm assuming is the target audience). There was only one chapter where I found any new information. If you're looking for film specific stuff, this might be your book; it has thousands of development time charts, paper type references and other film centric information. My guess is that most of the potential buyers are using digital.I was mad at myself that I wasted so much time trying to wade through this book. Save your money, read Ansel Adam's \\"The Negative\\" to hear it in the master's words and then search the internet for any of the well written papers on the digital zone system (search on Chuck Gardner Digital Zone System for a favorite)."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"Another book needed for my course.

I'm glad to say my \\"first\\" edition does not suffer from this problem. It is easy to see the differences for each zone, the black and white imagery is beautifully reproduced. Do yourself a favor and find one of these 1986 editions and compare them."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"As a novice, when one reads a lot of the photo blogs and websites these days there are lots of references to differences between film and digital capture and processing. One of those differences is that you can know absolutely nothing about photography but, if you're in decent light, your digital camera will make a nice photo. You need no understanding of ISO, aperture, shutter relationships. To use that film camera, however, does require an understanding of how these things relate ... and anyone who wants to be at all creative with his/her digital camera will need a solid understanding of how these things interrelate ... But if want to learn more about how exposure works when using film, or more about exposure, in general ... if you want to understand an important aspect of using large format cameras ... or if you just want to learn more about this \\"Zone System\\" thing you keep reading about or seeing/hearing referenced, then I think this book is a wonderful addition to one's collection. Now, I should say I haven't even read the digital portion of this book, principally because I have lots of other books that are solely focused on digital techniques. But prior to reading this book I thought the Zone System was super-complicated, highly-mathematical system ... and even if it is ... this book shows that you don't need all of that to have a solid working understanding of how to use the Zone System. I guess I'm interested in learning as much as I can about various photography techniques and this book adds to that. Again, perhaps the photos used aren't the best (but that's probably more a publisher rather than author decisions) and perhaps it's not adequate for some readers primarily interested in digital, but it met my expectations."},{"Title":"The Practical Zone System: For Film and Digital Photography","review":"This book is a clear and well organized review of the Zone System. It includes the Zone System for both traditional film and for digital. The system means properly exposing for certain levels of gray that may appear in your frame. For film, a person may want to properly capture the dark tones in a photograph, and then shorten or lengthen the development time (time the unexposed film spends in chemical developing) in order to achieve the level of brighter tones in the photo. For digital, it's the oppposite. Properly expose the frame for the brighter tones (so they are not blown out), then adjust the dark shades in Photoshop. I liked the book.

Mary Jane loves to play with the lipstick and perfume and she sprays her mother new perfume, Mischief, in the air. A strange woman appears at her doorstep wanting to be let in. Mary Jane won't let her in because she is a stranger and in her fury the woman leaves in a huff, forgetting her cat in the process. Mary Jane and her mother take in the cat, and name her Cinders because she likes to dust, and they live happily for a few days until the witch, noticing that she has lost her cat, returns on her magical vacuum cleaner to get her.Mary Jane and her mother are reluctant to give Cinders back but have no choice since she is not their cat. Cinders escapes once again but not before the witch managed to snip her down to miniature size; Cinders is now small enough to fit into a child's doll house! In all the ensuing drama the witch's magical vacuum cleaner, James, gets left behind with Cinders the cat. What happens when the witch realizes that she is without both of her precious possessions? To what lengths will she go to get them back?Somethings don't make complete sense with this book, as is sometimes the case with books for the younger set. I'm never sure quite how old Mary Jane is, but whatever her age, it doesn't seem to stop her from having the autonomy of a much older teenager (she and a friend go on an unchaperoned picnic and mom doesn't bat an eye). But whatever. I willingly suspend my disbelief, and it doesn't really interfere with my enjoyment of the story.Mary Jane is a load of fun and constantly getting into mischief. It's fun to see what she and Cinders get into with the magical vacuum cleaner, James, that the witch has left behind. It's even more fun when the witch shows up and Mary Jane has to take her on and figure things out so that Cinders and James will be safe from the witch's retaliation.

Trevelyan.Real power in England (King, nobility, Church, Papacy)The King and his government were powerless to enforce the law or to act against the nobility because their sole military resources were those commanded by the nobles themselves.The Church was a giant privileged political, judicial and financial powerhouse. Being a part of the Catholic Church, the English Church transferred a big chunk of its revenues abroad (the Papacy, France - in war with England!).The immorality of the ChurchThe Church treated sin and fear of Hell as a means of filling her coffers, preying on the vices it was supposed to correct. The sale of pardons and the venality of the confessors were in fact encouragements of sin.Her enormous real estate wealth was the result of a custom of bequeathing land and/or money to churches and monasteries in order to secure the repetition of masses for the soul of the dead donors.The poorThe Manorial System was based on serfdom. But, the System was undermined by the Black Plague (up to one half of the population died). The farm wages trebled and the serfs fled the manors in order to sell their labor to the highest bidders.The Peasant's Rising of 1381The sparkle which ignited the revolt was the levy of poll-taxes (three times in four years). The real causes, however, were the demands for a general charter of liberation of the serfs (complete personal and economic freedom) and the regulation of wages.On the religious front, the peasants' leaders asked for a disendowment of the Church properties and the abolition of her hierarchy.After the Rising, all socials concessions were shamelessly withdrawn by the wealthy few.John WycliffeJohn Wycliffe supported England against the Papacy and the State against the Church. He accepted the rights of property and the performing of services even for sinful lords.His main preoccupation, however, was the living conditions of the poor.He pleaded for the disendowment of all religious properties, hoping that this measure would relieve the pressure of taxation on the poor. His backers within the nobility, however, saw here an opportunity to claim the restitution of the wealth given to the Church by their forebears out of fear of eternal burning. He also proposed to severe the link between the clergy and the State (State offices).He called the religious regular orders (monks, friars = the Pope's agents for the sale of indulgences) useless and attacked the Transubstantiation theory.With his impeccable reputation he could impose his moderate view against the call for bloody revenge from the nobility against the peasants after their Revolt.Ultimate resultsThe spirit of liberty (also of thought) courageously shown by John Wycliffe, as well as the spirit of resistance to tyranny, continued to live among the population. They secured an early abolition of serfdom and feudalism in England.The struggle against the power of the Church culminated into the changes imposed by Henry VIII.This book, which read like a thriller, is must read for all those interested in English and medieval history. One easily understands why John Wycliffe was considered as a dangerous heretic by the Catholic Church.N.B. I am not a professional historian. Some commentators consider G. M. Trevelyan as a partisan political (liberal) historian. Corrections on his vision are welcome."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I've read SHADOWS OF GLORY, FADED COAT OF BLUE, and CALL EACH RIVER JORDAN and Owen Parry is rapidly becoming one of my favorite writers.Although I'm a Civil War buff, I think it's the protagonist's &quot;voice&quot; that does it. The main character is a little Welsh immigrant named Major Abel Jones, a British war veteran and a hero of Bull Run. He's also an investigator for the government. Parry does a wonderful job with this guy's accent. Just one example, &quot;It is a pickle you are in, then?&quot; He does use &quot;But let that bide&quot; a bit much, but you barely notice it after you've read a couple of the books.CALL EACH RIVER JORDAN centers around the Battle of Shiloh, which Jones becomes enmeshed in as he tries to report to General Grant. Everyone's running away, so Jones takes charge of a few of the more malleable of the scared soldiers and forms them into a unit.We eventually meet Grant and W.T. Sherman and P.T.G. Beauregard, of whom Jones doesn't think much, and we get to the jist of the matter, which is to find out who's been lynching slaves. The most recent case is the hanging of forty men, women and children at a crossroads.I always find that the best mysteries are those in which there's some humor to go along with the suspense. Some of that occurs when Jones falls captive to some Confederates on his way to see Beauregard. One of them is a fellow Welsh immigrant, whose accent Jones recognizes as being from a certain village near his. Jones compares the man's accent to his own, which he thinks is devoid of any trace of his former brogue. Jones also hates horses and he's given one named Rascal, that's way too much horse for him.Parry employs a standard cast of characters: The rogue Molloy, with whom he fought in India, is getting married and isn't in this one, but the moody Doctor Mick Tyrone is shown sawing off arms and legs in the aftermath of battle. Jones and Tyrone are usually in the midst of some philosophical discourse. My favorite is Mrs. Schutzengel, Jones's landlady in Washington. She's a socialist, a devotee of Karl Marx. Jones also has a wife, Mary Myfanwy, whom he dearly loves but rarely sees.Once again, this is one of those novels where the characters are so great that you just want to look in on them to see what they've been doing lately."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"Let me first confess that I've become a big fan of Owen Parry's work, so this review is not unbiased. With that said, however, I think this is the best yet in the Owen Parry series of Civil War mysteries. It is a remarkable, textured, gripping, delightful, suspenseful page-turner of a book.If you are new to the series, I would recommend that you read the first book first: *Faded Coat of Blue.* Then read the second one, *Shadows of Glory,* before turning to *Call Each River Jordan.* That way I think you'll better come to know and appreciate the main characters. *Faded Coat of Blue* is a wonderful book and a great introduction to the series. *Shadows of Glory* changes the setting and has a mystical, wintry, and scenic air to it. And *Call Each River Jordan* refocuses the reader into the hell of the Civil War and its hatreds and terror. All are vivid, intriguing, and tremendously enjoyable.Why do I think this is the best yet in the series? In *Call Each River Jordan,* Parry draws us more deeply into battle--this time in the fires of Shiloh--and then he draws us more deeply into the personal bitterness of the war. He shows us scenes in the deep south of 1862 that we've never viewed before and the gruesomeness of that conflict both on and off the battlefield. His descriptions are powerful--we see the flames and smell the smoke. His characters, as in the earlier books in the series, are colorful and believable. I particularly enjoyed getting to know a little better one of the characters we met in *Faded Coat of Blue,* Dr. Mick Tyrone, who provides an interesting counterpoint to the dominant and accurately portrayed religiosity of the era. One point of caution: Most of us are offended by the &quot;N&quot; word today. Good for us. But Parry's characters converse in the language of the 1860s. They would not ring true to life if they didn't. Writing or reading authentic accounts of the Civil War era requires an understanding that it was a far different time in our country's social progress. Beyond that, some of the hellish scenes Parry paints are not for the squeamish.When I first read *Faded Coat of Blue,* I wondered how the author would be able to sustain in subsequent books in the series the stylishness of that first book, its authenticity, and the terrific mystery of it. He has succeeded wonderfully. The three books in the series so far are all delights, each with a different flavor, but all sustaining the quality of the series, providing remarkable authenticity in describing the historical era and its settings, and developing the characters and story lines beautifully. And they're excellent mysteries, too.If you enjoy murder mysteries and have even the slightest interest in the Civil War era, read all the books in this series. You might choose to dive right into *Call Each River Jordan,* and if so, I think you'll enjoy it very much. But as I tell my friends and relatives, I think you should start with *Faded Coat of Blue,* then read *Shadows of Glory.* You'll get to *Call Each River Jordan* in due time. And then you'll look forward, as I do, to the fourth book in the series."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"In FADED COAT OF BLUE, Owen Parry invented a new fable out of an old American tragedy. In SHADOWS OF GLORY, Parry found his voice, allowing us to share the unconventional Civil War adventures of his intriguing Welsh-immigrant, ex-India Army protagonist, Major Abel Jones of the Union Army. Now in CALL EACH RIVER JORDAN, Owen Parry truly hits his stride.The story opens with Abel Jones inadvertently caught up in the slaughter of Shiloh. We meet the laconic, unpretentious Grant and the firey Sherman, who send him on his new adventure behind Confederate lines to solve the mystery of 40 murdered slaves. Parry's discriptions of the preening Beauregard and the ponderous Halleck are pure poetic mischief! And we meet the delightfully odd figure of the transplanted Englishman Barnaby B. Barnaby, a truly stalward fellow one would hope to encounter again. Parry's clever insights into immigrant Welsh-Irish-Scots-English tribal bigotry get better with each installment. His writing scatters gems of wit, wisdom, whimsey and pathos on every page.For those those who have followed Parry's telling of Abel Jones' adventures through the back alleys of the Civil War, here is the best volume yet. For first-time readers, start at the beginning, but be sure to buy this one!There is tragedy aplenty in Owen Parry's yarn. Some of it is a vehicle for suspense to draw the reader along. But the fundamental tragedy depicted is one that stains our noble history to this day. The epic struggle that resulted - and its rightful outcome, however incomplete - is what made America modern. Parry has few peers in the telling of it, because he makes it a human progression.Look you! All will want to know of Abel Jones' next adventure and what Owen Parry next will reveal to us about ourselves. Seems we are next to find Abel in Blighty! One must hope he eventually will go with Sherman to the Sea. But let that bide."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"This excellent book begins with a depiction of some of the most exciting, interesting and well-written Civil War battle scenes I have ever read. For that first chapter alone, the book is worth reading, but it is more than a battle book. Once again, the author has woven a tightly bound mystery into the Civil War era, and placed the intrepid Abel Jones right in the middle of it. This time, he goes into the Confederate lines to help find out why runaway slaves are being massacred. It's quite an exciting story, and the plot is moving forward even when you don't realize it. The writing is uniformly excellent, as usual, and all of the scenes are important, in addition to the depiction of actual historical characters. This is developing into a tremendous series, and I look forward to the next book, when I assume our hero will be overseas."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"This is the best novel so far in a consistently wonderful series. Parry's remarkable, soldier's eye view of the battle of Shiloh is easily the most realistic, stunning picture of Civil War (or any) combat I have encountered. But this book is about much more than just that tragic battle. It's a dark (yet sunlit), riveting journey into the South of 1862, an honest, fair and complex portrait of slavery, and as beautifully-written as any novel I have read by a living American writer. The prose is musical, poetic, yet clear as clean glass, and the characters, from the wonderful Abel Jones to the Pickwickian Barnaby B. Barnaby make this an unusual novel at a time when characterization of the first order seems out of style in contemporary literature. I could ramble on about how much I loved this book--for which I was waiting anxiously--but I'll end by saying that, yes, it is a page-turner mystery--but the real mystery is how anyone could capture a lost world so beautifully and heartbreakingly on the page. Very strongly recommended for all who love good fiction, historical, mystery, or in any other genre!"},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"In the third Abel Jones mystery, the Major has been summoned to Tennessee to General Grant's army, to solve a series of mass murders where the victims are all runaway slaves. When he arrives, he stumbles into the middle of the battle of Shiloh, and makes himself useful scraping up a group of men to fight. When the battle's over, he gets to investigating, and soon is among the Confederates, under a flag of truce, searching for the killer.Parry does three things well with this series of mysteries. First, the plots themselves are worthy mysteries. Though not of the Agatha Christie variety, they are believable, and complex enough that you must pay attention. Second, the author uses the historical setting and the main character to take you on a guided tour of parts of our Civil War. In this installment, we meet both U.S. Grant, and William T. Sherman, and later P.G.T. Beauregard. The portraits of all three are wonderful (the author doesn't think much of Beauregard, who comes off a preening idiot; from what I've read, he's not far wide of the mark) and not just hung onto the story: all three have roles to play in the story. And third, the whole of the book is told in vernacular, so that it reads as if this Welsh veteran of the Sepoy Rebellion were actually talking to you. This is a remarkable accomplishment, and well worth the effort by itself.I can't emphasize how good this book is. Parry seems to be getting better, if that's possible. It's as if George MacDonald Fraser wrote a Civil War mystery story with a Welsh protagonist as its narrator. It's that good."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I live just a stone's throw from the Shiloh battlefield. I have walked that once blood saturated ground an untold number of times. I've read, seen, visited, even picnicked where wholesale slaughter was the once the game, but nothing I've encountered before was as vividly real and tangible as the first 25 pages of \\"Call Each River Jordan.\\" The quality of the writing is beyond description. Read it ... just read it!And then there is the plot. If the book has a weakness, it is in promising suspense and not really delivering. However, the atmospheric tension and characterization is fine enough to cover the the lack of plot twists and other devices synonymous with mysteries.President Lincoln hand picks Major Abel Jones to solve the mass murder of 40 slaves attempting to escape to the North. In order to do so, he must obtain the cooperation of the Confederate Army following their humiliating defeat at Shiloh. Aided by a young southern aristocrat and his English manservant, Jones travels the hills, the fields, and the swamp bottoms of Mississippi, meeting both blacks and whites of all social stratas.This isn't a cozy, comfortable book. Slavery was ugly. The Civil War was ugly. Mankind can be incredibly ugly. The only beauty in this novel is in the polished writing. Fans of quality literature and history buffs will find it as difficult to put down as I did."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"This beautifully-written novel is almost magical in its ability to make the past live again. The first-person account of the ferocious battle of Shiloh is simply the best description of combat I've ever read, while a later cavalry skirmish superbly captures the feel of fighting on horseback (if you've ever ridden, you'll recognize the feel), and a final, dark-of-the-night climax gets at the brutality of war, at any time or place, better than splashy CNN coverage or even the best non-fiction works. There are two more areas where Parry truly excels: The flawless recreation of the voices--the accents, rhythms and prejudices of the past--and the creation of living characters. The narrator, Abel Jones, who has appeared in Parry's two previous novels, deepens and deepens, revealing ever more about himself, while the supporting characters range from the Falstaffian (or Dickensian, to be more accurate) Barnaby B. Barnaby, a killer with a soft heart and a soft belly, to a unique, subtle take on some Southern cliches. In Parry's novels, no character is ever as simple as he or she seems at first--we meet people who live convincingly on the page. Overall, this series is the most &quot;adult&quot; I've ever read--not in terms of explicitness or vulgarity, but in terms of emotional depth and realism. If Parry can sustain this quality of writing and storytelling in his future works, we just may have a fictional re-telling of the Civil War to rival Shelby Foote's non-fiction. And, by the way, this book is enormous fun to read. I would give it more than five stars, if I could."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"Every writer of fiction strives for the deathless opening sentence, the string of words so powerful they remain burned into the reader's memory long after he has put the book aside. &quot;Call Each River Jordan,&quot; Owen Parry's third book in his ongoing chronicle of Abel Jones's adventures during the American Civil War, begins with a stunning opening sentence:&quot;I remember the burning men.&quot;That was Shiloh, April 6-7, 1862, and Abel Jones, gimpy leg and all, is right in the thick of it. This opening chapter of &quot;Call Each River Jordan&quot; is a riveting and emotionally exhausting tour of &quot;Bloody Shiloh.&quot; You know that in real life Mr. Parry must have walked over the battlefield but what elevates his recreation of that climactic event above the mere analytical military study is the eerie sense that Parry was THERE, that through some myserious ability he was able to look back in time into the Maelstrom of the battle. This kind of historical insight characterizes Mr. Parry's previous books, but here it virtually overwhelms you. That's the kind of writing that marks a truly great literary talent.Oh, and there is a great mystery here too. Someone has committed a mass murder so terrible, so potentially damaging to both the Southern and Northern causes, that Major Jones is sent under a flag of truce behind the Confederate lines to seek his enemy's help finding the perpetrators. Here Mr. Parry's ability as a portraitist of human character shines through in the likes of Billy Sherman, P. T. G. (&quot;Old Borey&quot;) Beauregard and the ragtag soldiers he led. All these people are seen through the eyes of the abstemious Abel Jones, loyal Union man bred in the strict tradition of Welsh Methodism. If Jones appears a little too righteous at times and a little too opinionated, well, that's our Abel, and in real life (which these books are becoming to me!) we'd expect him to be no other way.Now I have written fiction in my time and even gotten some of it published. I have read good stuff too, the Sharras, MacKinley Kantor, Bernard Cornwell, Joseph Stanley Pennel, Mary Johnston (yes, give the lady credit, you'd think she marched with Stonewall Jackson) and those writers, while they have often written stuff as good as Owen Parry's, none of them, not one, has written better than you'll read here."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"There is something sublime about this book.It would be easy for Parry to follow the easy path to Civil War fiction that so many other authors have followed. But, instead, he chooses to probe the depths of slavery and abolition and Union versus Confederacy.Although this book is billed as a historical suspense/mystery novel, it is far more. The murder plot is merely a device the author uses to explore the depths of human character and the interplay between Whites and Blacks during the Civil War. All of Parry's characters are very human, including his main hero and his major villain. The terrors and bloodlust of war are portrayed vividly. And, to Parry's credit, not all of the action takes place on the battlefield.Main character Abel Jones is a Welsh major hired by President Lincoln to solve the mass murder of some Blacks barely over the Shiloh battle lines. To do so, he must coordinate his activities with officers from the Confederacy. The Union blames the Confederates for the murders and the Confederacy blames the Union. But Abel is Able as he solves the dilemma. But, as I said, the mystery plot is secondary.Abel struggles with the line between Christian non-violence and wartime bloodshed. Some characters struggle with loss of life and property while others struggle with the concept of true freedom.The only negative to this book is its obvious setup at the finish for a sequel. I don't dislike sequels or series novels, but the setup is too obvious.Nonetheless, this book is glorious and there really is something sublime here that I can't pinpoint. A treasure."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I found this Abel Jones mystery the best yet. It has great characters and a plot that kept me engaged.If Abel ever returns(come on Owen Parry...give us more)it would be nice to have a sequel to this novel."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"Awesome. The most amazing protagonist, superb writing, beautifully diverse and crackling with reality. The author brings to life that everyone's story is different, every view of war is different, and this tale of mystery comes along with all the details that you didn't know you never knew, or hadn't thought of. Fantastic. I've read \\"Faded Coat of Blue, and just finished \\"Shadows of Glory\\". I cannot wait to read the next in the Abel Jones series, \\"Honor's Kingdom\\". I do wish for a bit more of Mary Myffanwy and their son John. They, of all people, seem the most distant in a way. Maybe there is a reason for it."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I had spent years searching every bookstore I came upon for this book,\\"Call Each River Jordan\\" the only one in the Abel Jones Mysteries series I had not gotten my hands on, and was delighted to get it so easily and quickly once I had access to Amazon! Each book in the series deals with an entirely different view of the Civil War period both geographically and in subject matter. It is so interesting and refreshing to get an entirely different view of that conflict, which can be so deadly boring and romanticized. Abel Jones is a very interesting character, one of strong prejudices,common to the time and his background, which he is intelligent and man enough to shed when he sees them for what they are.The author pulls no punches as to the horrors of war and the stupidity and heroism of both the CSA and the USA (and the Raj conflicts as an added interest). All I wish is that Owen Parry would give us another adventure soon."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"Have read all three in the series, and the interest, perspective, and just plain enjoyment that author Parry obviously has as he writes these, is happily infectious. If you are just starting, I recommend that you start at the beginning, so you can keep up and get all the benefit of the fun."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"In this, the third volume in this magnificent chronicle, Owen Parry lets us ride along with Major Abel Jones as he travels into enemy territory to investigate a series of brutal murders.By the time you have fought your way through the Battle of Shiloh alongside Abel Jones, you will have developed some appreciation for the barely controlled chaos that characterized most Civil War battles. The account of Jones'subsequent adventures will provide you with an appreciation for the principal characters in this series. They continue to develop as you become more familiar with each of them; just as they would if we were truly a part of their world.I have already reserved a space on my bookshelf for the next book by Owen Parry."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"With 'Call Each River Jordan,' (the third episode of the &quot;Abel Jones series&quot;), Parry explores the Civil War in the Deep South. It begins with a harrowing account of the battle of Shiloh then proceeds deeper into Dixie, as the hero investigates a massacre of slaves. Parry's elegant prose is one of the greatest pleasures of this book and of the series, but I'm also struck by the greater complexity of the characters in this volume. It's also beatifully paced, with a finely judged accumulation of momentum. Some of the scenes, such as Parry's account of a horse race (in the voice of protagonist Abel Jones) are superb.The three books (so far) taken in sum add up to a major statement about the war. Newcomers to the series need not read them in order, but having read one would probably want to read the others."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"The opening scene in &quot;Call Each River Jordan&quot; is perhaps the most evocative battle scene I've every read. It is a haunting depiction of the events at Shiloh--I cannot imagine there is a better portrayal of this anywhere in fiction or nonfiction. The writing throughout this wonderful historical novel is just beautiful, and the plot will keep you turning the pages. When Able Jones, a Union soldier caught up in a war to preserve a country he struggles to understand, travels behind Confederate lines to unravel a mysterious massacre, he discovers much more than the forces behind this strange and horrible event. This book, the third in a series of historical novels featuring the quirky Able Jones, may be Parry's most interesting so far. Parry is undoutably one of the greatest American writers of our time."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I've followed Abel Jones from the beginning, and though I'm not willing to say they get better (simply because the first two are likewise excellent), I suppose it's fair to say that with every book the series becomes more immersive. If you jump right in on this book, you might not fully understand some things, I would suggest purchasing &quot;A Faded Coat of Blue&quot; first and starting from the beginning. That way you get to know Abel from the ground up!"},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I am not the one reading this book or the others by the author but my father and he loves them. He's anticipating the next sequel book to the above title."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"One of the harder things to achieve in a series is to have the main character continue to develop. After all, a developing character is the centerpiece of Western fiction, and without development or growth, a character becomes inert, predictable, and...dull. In a mystery series especially this danger lies in wait for its protagonist, who usually is fully developed by the end of the first novel.Owen Parry, author of \\"Call Each River Jordan,\\" avoids this trap, and this book is as fresh and intriguing as his first book in his Abel Jones' Civil War mystery series, \\"Faded Coat of Blue.\\" (If you're not already familiar with Parry, Jones, or the series, run - don't walk! - over to \\"Faded Coat of Blue\\" and pick it up! Now!)\\"Call Each River Jordan\\" is the third book and sends Abel Jones south to visit a plantation and solve the mystery of who's behind the ritual butchering of runaway slaves. Jones confronts his own racism, meets the enemy in the current conflict, and is continually reminded of his own part in previous butchery.The book starts with a bang, right into the midst of the battle of Shiloh, and Parry's storytelling skills shine. The battle description is as vivid as any I have ever read about the Civil War. Jones - and Parry by extension - shows an intimate knowledge of musket battles, and we're caught up in his expertise.But more engrossing is Jones' visit to the South, because that's where Jones learns something about race and the cause of the Civil War: slavery. (It's refreshing to read a book that firmly attributes the cause of the Civil War to slavery.) A remarkable confrontation, Jones against his own prejudice, which is a common theme in the series, but takes on a wider, more vital role in \\"Call Each River Jordan.\\"But this book is not perfect. While Parry is a genius at characterization and voice, his plotting tends to be forced and unnatural. Minor characters pop up and provide crucial clues at just the right moment. Life-threatening situations arise, and Jones is rescued from harm's way by an opportune intervention. The typical heavy-handed \\"deus ex machina\\" stuff of lesser genre fiction.Nonetheless, Parry rises above his genre and is producing quality literature with his Abel Jones series. Can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"This is the third, excellent volume in the author's series that follows the detective work of Major Abel Jones during the Civil War. This time, the author's masterful style immerses you in April, 1862, with its odd speech (to the 2007 ear), its stomach-turning savagery in the Battle of Shiloh, and its well-mannered relationship between Union and Confederate officers off the battlefield. Someone has brutally slaughtered forty slaves, men, women, and children, in the no-man's land between Union and Confederate lines. General Grant sends Major Jones on a hazardous trip through the lines with a request that Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard cooperate in investigating this terrible crime. Beauregard agrees and assigns Confederate Lieutenant Drake Raines to aid Jones. The two officers follow a frightening path as they track down the murderers and barely prevent another mass killing. The story is full of action, and the plot twists wonderfully."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I've traveled in Wales, know Welsh history back to the early Middle Ages, and even studied the language some years ago. I recognize Owen Parry's Union officer, Abel Jones, as the counterpart of some of the sturdy people of that splendid land. I've now read all three of Parry's Civil War mysteries available in paperback, and each new one has been better than the last.The only mystery writers of comparable talent who've dissected the physical, mental and moral tragedy of war are Charles Todd and Reginald Hill. But Parry, writing in the voice of a deeply religious, highly puritanical Welshman of the mid-Nineteenth Century, is unique. I doubt that there are very many better first-person stories out there in any genre.The plot and characters of this latest novel have been covered by other reviewers (with whom I soundly agree). I only want to suggest that if you haven't yet heard the voice of Abel Jones, go thou and do so."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"In this third book in his Civil War series, Owen Parry plunges his unique and inimitable character Abel Jones into the heat and horror and hell of the War. At the core of the novel, as it was at the core of the War, is slavery. Parry handles the issue, and most importantly the people who asserted their humanity in the face of crushing forces denying that very humanity, with an uncommonly deft and graceful touch. Abel Jones is a thoroughly decent man but also a man of his times. He loathes slavery but cannot see the full humanity of slaves. Abel's quest to solve the mystery surrounding a ghastly massacre of slaves takes him on an inner journey at the end of which he reconciles his conflicting views on slavery and the enslaved. This is a sublime and quiet moment in a climax otherwise full of clamorous rage. For anyone who has affectionate familiarity with Abel from Parry's previous books, the moment of revelation is enormously satisfying. Abel Jones is not only an engaging character but one who endures in the heart and soul of the reader.As we've come to expect from Parry, an intriguing tale is told masterfully, in language consistently beautiful even when brutal. This is Parry's finest work to date. While reading the two earlier titles in the series is not necessary for understanding CALL EACH RIVER JORDAN, it really would be a shame to deprive yourself of such perfect reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"Owen Parry has done it again. This Civil War murder mystery, the third in a series, moves Abel Jones, wounded veteran of Bull Run and reluctant detective, into a new venue -- the Deep South.The first tale took us through the dark corridors of corruption in Washington, DC, and the second unearthed a grisly Fenian plot in up-state New York. Now Abel, borne upon the transcendant prose of a master story-teller, moves further from his beloved Mary, through the blood of Shiloh, and into plantation country, where his doubts about Southern culture undergo a profound re-thinking. Incisive sketches of the famous (Beauregarde, Grant,Halleck,and Sherman)mingle with sympathetic portrayal of the pain of anonymous Confederate soldiers, the GIs of 1861-1865, who bore the sufferings of a nation torn.This fine book, clearly from the pen of a man who has seen real war, is a rich mixture of flawless history and compassionate insights into the spiritual turmoil of Rebel and Yankee alike. From Alabama to Maine, it will warm the hearts of those who value a good story, well-told and full of surprises."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I loved the first Abel Jones Civil War mystery (Faded Coat of Blue), but was sorely disappointed by the second (Shadows of Glory), so it with great relief that I can report that this third in the series displays much (if not quite all) the skill Parry brought to Faded Coat of Blue. The story kicks off with a serious bang, as the first thirty pages or so throw Major Abel Jones into the messy battle at Shiloh in early April 1862. From the very first sentence (&quot;I remember the smell of men burning&quot;), the reader is immersed in the chaos and confusion that is war, and it's hard to imagine any work of nonfiction\\\\ able to compete with the &quot;you are there&quot; sensation these pages impart. In this in initial bloody action, the ever-stern Jones rounds up as many of those fleeing the battle as possible, and rallies them into a little unit, fighting through the day.It's only after the battle that we finally learn the purpose of his foray into the front lines. As outlined in the previous books, the Welsh immigrant and former soldier Jones has been transformed from an army clerk into a special agent of President Lincoln's. Here, he sent is to investigate the massacre of forty runaway slaves, an atrocity discovered by advancing Union troops in Tennessee. Jones meets with Generals Grant and Sherman (and his friend Dr. Mick Tyrone), and is escorted to the Confederate side as an emissary to General Beauregard to discuss this heinous crime. Of course, this isn't as simple as it sounds, and Jones goes through a few adventures before he's able to team up with an young aristocratic (and Harvard educated) Southern officer to unmask the killers.Actually, the book's one significant weakness is that there is a great deal of buildup to the mystery, but once the investigation is underway, the killers are identified with very rapidly (not to mention that the answer seems obvious the moment the villain is first seen). As in Shadows of glory, the emphasis is much more on mood and atmosphere than actual suspense. Much of the story seems designed to have Jones come to the realization that slaves are humans too, and perhaps are worth fighting a war over. To that end, a number of the supporting characters aren't nearly as well realized as they are in either of the two earlier books. Jones' Confederate liaison is a textbook golden-haired young Southern gentleman, and there are a smattering of basic rednecks and slave types as well. One notable exception is the Barnaby B. Barnaby, the Cockney gentleman's gentleman to Jones' liaison, who provides comic relief and a vivid voice. Of course, the strongest voice is Jones' own as narrator, and his telling is robust with the Welsh idiom, cadence, and priggish prejudice of the earlier books. Phrases like &quot;he was as full of tricks as an Irish barrister&quot; abound, and add much to the story.All in all, the book is satisfying reading, if not as outstanding as Faded Coat of Blue, which just had everything going for it. The series continues with , Honor's Kingdom and Bold Sons of Erin which I will definitely be seeking out."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"In the third installment in Owen Parry's Civil War series, hero Abel Jones finds himself at Shiloh. Surviving the battle, described in horrific detail, Jones is sent in front of the advancing army to solve the mass murder of forty escaping slaves. In \\"Call Each River Jordan\\" Parry's writing is getting stronger. He has found his voice. Jones' Welsh dialogue is wonderful and witty and self-deprecating and unmatched. Each character is carefully drawn: the legless confederate officer, the stoic elderly slave, the eccentric British servant. Each is unique and carefully crafted. The story bounces easily and predictably to its satisfying conclusion. Another great story."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"Frankly speaking, Parry's historically-based mystery was hard to put down. With his evident skills of historiography and literary imagination -- as he exhibits through all his novels -- Parry gives us life in all its complexities. The man has done his research with the skill of a cultural historian. In this reviewer's opinion, Parry is much better than John Jakes. For this genre -- from the vocabulary of his characters to his descriptions of America at civil war, Parry proves much more evocative than that of his peers. He is a refreshing contrast with the timidity and limpness of 'respectable' novels of today."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"This is a very well written historical mystery, with what I personally found to be a fatal flaw.Parry's description of the Battle of Shiloh in the opening scenes is magnificent. It represents far better writing than I have seen from him before. I was stunned. He continues to write from the POV of Abel Jones -- fussy, Puritanical, strongly accented despite insisting he's not, deeply prejudiced in many ways, brave and extremely appealing. I've rarely seen character building in first person done so well.The plot here is marginally believable -- large groups of African Americans have been murdered, and for some reason the Union Army cares enough to have this investigated, and for some reason the Confederates accede to this. I'm not sure, sadly, that either army would really have lifted a finger. But it was believable enough to go on with.Now we come to the fatal flaw. No one expects historical fiction, particularly when written from the point of view of a non-impartial character, to be unbiased. But one does expect it to be believable. All of Parry's Southern characters, black and white, are caricatures -- the fop, the redneck hunter, the brave but misguided young man, the Uncle Tom, the innocent slave girl, the wise African American preacher... and so on. I felt the story would have been stronger if all of the characters had been as human and complex as the protagonist."},{"Title":"Call Each River Jordan","review":"I'm always wary of historical novels, since they have a tendency to transfer 21st Century sensibilities to their subject matter. Owen Parry (whose real name is Ralph Peters, the great Russian expert and strategic thinker) avoids that, creating a hero and a story which live and breath the Civil War era. I was impressed, although not overly so, with the first book of the series, but I am increasingly moved by every addition to the series.Major Abel Jones is pompous and priggish and if weren't so clever in solving murder mysteries, he would be a classic comic figure (one on-going theme is the pride this Welshman takes in his singing voice, when it's obvious (though not to him) that it's rather awful).The walk on parts of various historical figures is impressive. I always judge the walk ons in historical novels by using as my gold standard the Abraham Lincoln in George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman series: lovely little vignettes which both capture the essence of the man and allow the reader to see his hero in a new light. In River Jordan, Parry manages a General Grant who is every bit as real as Fraser's Lincoln. That is the first time I can say that about anyone's novel about any era."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"Love this book.

The book is geared for kids, but the recipes are great for adults. Dr. Fuhrman has some interesting takes on treating kids' illnesses. Some I agree with, but others I don't agree with. I give my kids fever reducers like Tylenol because the consequences of not giving it are worse and can be damaging or lethal. The rest of the book is fantastic. Kids' diets are really bad.

As the parent of a 14 month old, I have always been very conscious of what she eats.

The doctor puts forth all his information in a clear and concise mannner that anyone can understand. This book is difficult to debate because there is so much support for what he is saying. He has numerous citations in the back of the book for the many, many different scientific studies that support the book. He also tells of his own personal experience with patients. This book has even convinced me to drastically change the way I eat.I highly recommend this book for any parent who wants to give their child the gift of a lifetime of good health!!Thank you Dr. Furhman!!"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"I am battling cold after cold with my 5 kiddos this winter. when I stumbled upon this book, I figured I would give it a try. I read the book in one weekend and here is my honest opinion of the book. First off, the book points out, with lots of supporting documentation, that we are basically setting up our kids for disease and early death by their eating habits. I totally agree to this. But the problem I have with the book is it just repeats the same things over and over. I get that we should breast feed our babies until the age of 2. But do you have to make us feel guilty over and over because we did not do that? My kids are 8 yrs to 17 months (stopped breast feeding him when he was 13 months old ). I understand the need to to inform us, but this book is way too redundant....to the point where it is annoying. I also think he over uses soy products which have been known to cause problems with thyroid. I currently have thyroid disease and I honestly believe it was caused by over consumption of soy products. Also, I fear this way of eating is a bit extreme and I wonder how long my family will last on this.With that said, I can say this book made me realize that I do have to change habits in the house. So we are taking the leap and going for it with modified changes regarding the soy. I like the recipes in the book the most. They seem easy to make, but there are a few ingredients that may be difficult to get. Oh and another thing I am saddened by is his money hungry way of handling things. The guy is already selling countess books and making a killing off them, so why does he implement a pay-for members only system on his website to take advantage of benefits, such as comments on blog, when these should be available to all? He also mentions in the book there are hundreds of recipes on the website, but you have to be a member to access them spending a hundred dollars a year fir the cheapest membership. It is rediculous and doesn't seem very caring to me and a bit over zealous with regards to money. If he really wants to help us, those things should be readily available to us free of charge."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"This changed the way I thought about food, how I feed my kids and my husband.

Neither our daughter nor our son has ever had an ear infection, they have never needed antibiotics, they have never needed to take tylenol or any other prescribed or over the counter medication. Eating predominately fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds is the secret formula to raising healthy children. And if you want to get your kids excited about eating fruits and vegetables, you should check out the new children's book series written in collaboration with Dr. Fuhrman called The Secret Life of Mitch Spinach.

I wanted more specifics about what and how to eat for a healthy kids diet. The recipes are the back third of the book. Some are inventive but nothing I could not find online.

In this book, Dr. Fuhrman explains the difference between macro-nutrients (meat, dairy, wheat) and micro-nutrients (vitamins, minerals & phytochemicals).He explains why 80% of our population ultimately die of Heart disease, Cancer, Diabetes because of the food choices modern Americans make. He explains how this starts in childhood and kids follow their parents examples; lots of meat, diary and processed foods and very small portions of vegetables and fruit. He makes specific dietary recommendations for all types of issues kids have as well as diseases. You will close the book understanding why our bodies are starving for micronutrients and why this information isn't being disseminated by the medical community. After reading this book, you will have more exposure to natural health and nutrition than most doctors you will ever visit.I believe all new moms should be given this at the OBGYN instead of free formula and diaper bags. If you have a friend or family member who is pregnant, get her this book! Optimal future health of children starts in the womb. I wish I would have known to eat tons of veggies and fruit and not so much dairy when I was pregnant.Note: Dr. Fuhrman is a vegan and although he recommends a vegan, whole food, plant based diet (which some of the reviewers here disagree with and because of this, gave this book a 1 star rating) he does give an alternatives for those who do not want to forgo meat.

Dr. Fuhrman offers practical, straightforward informantion and anyone can comprehend and apply to their daily lives. His plan is simple and makes complete sense as we are faced with daily pressure to eat fast food,junk food and foods loaded with sugar, fat and preservatives.

I don't doubt that this would be extremely beneficial for my kids.The chapter on how to actually accomplish this seemed insufficient to me. The advice boiled down to: just do it. Don't feed your kids unhealthy food, don't even have it in the house, and they'll have no choice but to eat their veggies. Perhaps this would work, but I don't feel able to follow this advice at this time. I have two-year-old twin boys, and I am often by myself. It's hard enough even to follow the routine as it stands now.Perhaps someone with a more manageable situation could \\"just do it.\\" My plan is to try a bit later, when I can reason with them a bit more (perhaps rewarding them for trying new things, and the like).In the meantime, this book has made me feel constantly guilty about the diet I feed my children. I do keep trying to get them to eat vegetables, but of course, if they have a choice they choose something else.I suppose I'd recommend this book with the caveat that for most people, eating this way would be a major change."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"I bought this book for my daughter and her family.

We have taken some gradual steps to get there... learning how to cook differently and changing our taste buds (they do change from diet) & thoughts on meal planning. We do feel better and are working on eliminating all medications. This book has been the best tool to help us make successful changes in our diet.As most Americans, I have been a meat & dairy eater my whole life until reading this and \\"The RAVE Diet & Lifestyle by Mike Anderson. I thought that my family was eating a healthy diet - making my own breads, drinking low-fat milk, using only olive oil, eating a lot of rice, lean beef, chicken, wild salmon, fish-oil, Greek yogurt, Breyers ice-cream & low-fat cheese, eggs along with our vegetables and fruits. Now some of these foods are great for us, but adding all that cholesterol, salt & refined sugars was certainly not helping - hurting us in fact. I did not know until reading this book how significant the diet was during childhood in order to prevent diseases in adult life! Also, before reading this book, I worried about getting enough protein & calcium in my families diet each day. Ha!Do you want to minimize your family's change of getting cancer, remove the chance of a heart attack or strokes, eliminate adult-onset diabetes, reduce medications by a third for Type I diabetics, even eliminate a simple condition of acne? Then stop buying into the pharmaceutical, beef & dairy industry lobbying groups of America. Read this book! As Americans we place way to much importance on protein (beef) and dairy products. I believe that doctors really want to help, but are usually too quick to prescribe and recommend pharmaceutical drugs. Maybe most don't understand nutrition and/or don't think that patients will actually change their lifestyles? I know as Americans that we generally don't like limiting ourselves. We like to have our cake and eat it too!Another tip... please try new foods more than once. Sometimes it takes your taste buds changing over time. Keep reintroducing new foods up to 16x's before your children accept them. Encourage them to keep trying. Please read \\"Disease-Proof Your Child\\" by Dr. Furhman if you have children in your home. This book will help your family so much in improving your health."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"This is a easy read, it reinforces a lot of things I already believed in, namely that diet controls a good portion of our health. It takes that concept further than most doctors would, not only preventing the big killers (Heart attack, heart disease, diabetes, etc.) but also the common flu, allergies, and other childhood illnesses. He has a no-holds barred attitude about society's norms and morales, and it's a refreshing but not overly paranoid view of the food world we live in.I'm already a vegan but it gave me some great ideas on some things I should be adding to my children's diet as well as my own.

Several parts of the book touched on the correlation between ADD and ADHD and a child's diet, but also suggested dietary changes to fix that behavior. Several studies and examples throughout show the suggestions to be effective.This book is very clear - it is not intended to be a weight-loss diet, nor is it entirely vegan. It encourages flexibility according to the child's level of activity and age, and recommends foods that help children grow and mature physically and mentally. It is an excellent guide book for any parent that is concerned about feeding their children the healthiest of food."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"This book offers valuable information for parents on how to make intelligent food decisions for their kids.

A large number of the healthy recipes that are recommended have nuts. The author continues to recomend nuts and nut oils and nut butters over and over again to the point where I just want to stop reading because I CAN'T use that. I really wish he would provide at least a section of the book giving sugggestions on how to modify the diet he recommends for those who can't use nuts. At this point my purchase was a waste of $."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"First of all I have to express a great deal of sympathy with the author's contention that bad diet lies at the heart of many health problems. The typical American diet seems constructed with the sole purpose of driving people into ill-health as rapidly as possible. It is really hard to imagine how one could over-state how absolutely disgusting the majority of American food is, consisting as it does of artificial junk largely derived from corn in one way or another. It is incomprehensible to me, as a parent, how anyone could feed such utter rubbish to their offspring, no matter consume the stuff themselves. Yet people do, every day, and as a result the vast majority of Americans are overweight or, increasingly, obese. Americans have the unfortunate distinction of being the first people in history to be under-nourished yet over-fed. America has become a nation of sick people waddling towards an early grave. So clearly the first step has to be to clean up the diet. To this end, Fuhrman's enthusiasm for fruits, nuts and vegetables is entirely understandable and commendable. He's also entirely correct in stating that \\"diets\\" are useless with regards to losing weight and becoming more healthy - it's all about lifelong habits, not temporary quick-fix tricks.Unfortunately the author allows his enthusiasm to run away with him, which leaves two problems with the book. The first is that he overlooks the fact that biology clearly shows we're omnivores, not primarily vegetarians. While it's true that we eat far too many animal products today, it's also true that a balanced diet requires more flesh than Fuhrman would have us believe. It's a shame he doesn't agitate for red meat that is far healthier than the corn-stuffed hardly-able-to-walk cows that make up the bulk of the American red meat diet today. Venison and bison are both excellent low-fat, low cholesterol sources of protein and iron and are both raised without artificial corn diets and all the rest of the disgusting paraphernalia of the US agricultural system. The second problem is that the author entirely overlooks the issue of physical activity. All the data (and common sense) shows that we need regular and vigorous physical activity in order to achieve and maintain good health. Unless we are active, our cardiovascular system won't function properly. Unless we stress our muscles regularly our production of growth hormone (essential for tissue repair) will decline. Unless we stress our bones with weight-bearing exercises we will gradually develop osteoporosis.So not only does Fuhrman over-sell his diet (cancer can strike even the healthiest eater sometimes) but he also overlooks equally essential components of a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps someone will combine the best parts of his book with the missing pieces and thus come up with a book that really does hit the spot. Meanwhile, for those who genuinely follow through and banish junk from their homes, at least his nutritional recommendations are, for the most part, helpful and healthy."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"This was a gift for an employee with a new baby. I didn't read it. But I believe in Dr. Fuhrman's candidapproach showing how most US citizens are eating themselves into disease & early death with the current government approved diet. I think the sooner people get on a healthy diet, the better. Our own First Lady is pushing a proper diet......even if the US Health Department isn't . Wish she would march over there and crack the whip at them.....revamp their department. I guess it's a little hard to advise US citizens to give up meat, eggs, milk & cheese given the huge number of US citizens who make a living bringing those things to market."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"I love this book and recommend to all parents especially since we are tired of colds all winter and great for ear infections"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"I have read other books by Dr. Fuhrman and pursued his website enough to have most of the knowledge in this book already. However, if you are new to the concept of health from the inside out, serving real foods that are essential for your kids' health now and in the future, then this book will be very helpful! We cannot underestimate the power of vegetables and fruits in our children's developing bodies and immune system! Please read Dr. Fuhrman's materials and make a difference in your family tree!"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"Worked like a champ. I don't know why the require 20 + words for silly things like this that worked fine!"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"Disease-Proof Your Child does two things no other book has ever done. First, it clearly and persuasively presents scientific research that shows what our children eat now will more or less determine their risk of developing cancer and other killer diseases as adults. After reading the first few pages, you will never again view sodas, donuts, fries, pizzas, candies and other \\"All-American\\" junk foods as innocent again.Allowing and encouraging our kids to eat this garbage on a regular basis is excusable only when we don't know what we're doing. Now that Dr. Fuhrman has exposed the truth - we can cause or prevent 99% of all diseases by what we eat - no parent who reads this book will be able to allow their child to develop \\"cancer on the installment plan\\" through malnutrition. And if you're not into long-term thinking, Dr. Fuhrman also demonstrates the link between the Standard American Diet and the national epidemics of childhood asthma, ear infections, colds, flus, and allergies.So a warning: do not buy this book unless you're willing to exert your responsibility to protect your children. If you read it and do nothing, you'll go through hell as you watch your kids poisoning themselves with their favorite addictive substances and starving their immune systems by not eating nutrient rich foods.Which brings me to the second thing this book does that no other has: it provides tools and a roadmap and a philosophy for transitioning your family to a healthy diet. Remember paint by numbers? This is the diet transition equivalent. From practical ideas (the \\"refigerator advertisements\\" is a wonderful example) to over 50 recipes (\\"string beans and almost dust\\" will blow you away with its simplicity and how much your kids will love it) to lists of delicious \\"non-recipe snacks\\" that ensure you'll always have healthy alternatives to junk fod - Disease-Proof Your Child is a well-written and well thought out \\"operations manual\\" to your most important job as a parent: setting your child up for a lifetime of health and happiness.In Disease-Proof Your Child, Dr. Fuhrman explains:- how to prepare your home for eating healthfully before making the shift- why \\"three meals a day\\" is a recipe for failure when it comes to feeding kids right- why focusing on quality, not quantity, is the key to healthy eating- why \\"consistent but not perfect\\" is more effective than 100% \\"compliance\\"- when and where it's OK to compromise- how to teach your kids never to \\"diet\\"- how to reform the picky eaterDr. Fuhrman is not an armchair researcher. He runs a family practice, and offers many case studies that show exactly how families transitioned successfully to a healthy diet - even when both parents thought their child's eating habits were a lost cause.After reading the first half of the book, you will be shocked, angry, and motivated like crazy to do something to save your kids from a lifetime of obesity and disease. The second half of the book, the solution, is going to get dog-eared and underlined and photocopied and food-spattered. You're going to want to recommend it to your friends, mostly because you won't be able to part with your own copy. I already find I need two - one for my study and another for the cookbook shelf.There are few books ever written that have to potential to have such a huge positive impact on the well-being of your family. Is it easy to put this into practice? Not at first. But is it worth it? Try the following thought experiment:It's 35 years from now. Your child is a grownup, with a kid in elementary school and another in high school. You get to choose one of the following scenarios: a) your child is a healthy and vibrant adult, at the prime of life; or b) your child has just been diagnosed with cancer, possibly fatal within 3 years.I know that's stark. But the links between what we feed our kids now and their health as adults are that real. Try the thought experiment for 2 minutes and see what moves within you.If you're not able to link current behavior with the long-term future, here's another experiment:What if you were able to prevent most of the ear infections, allergies, colds, feveres, and severe asthma attacks that your child gets on a regular basis? The long nights up with a crying child, the endless trips to the doctor for another round of antibiotics, the missed events, the feelings of \\"when will they outgrow it\\"? That's a real outcome too.Please - as a health educator, as a parent, as someone who cares about the world we're sending our kids into - I urge you to get and study this book."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"... Unfortunately, that's not how it works after their taste buds are now addicted to nutrient poor, super stimulating foods that haven't provided the nutrients they've needed, but haven't gotten, for likely some time.When they try to eat better \\"Nutrient Rich\\" foods, especially the way most parents serve them in the typical \\"eat your veggies\\", \\"side dish\\" kind of way, what would normally be great tasting, nourishing, fulfilling and make them feel great with a smile on their face, tastes bland compared to the junk they've been eating; junk that's \\"designed\\" to make food addicts out of them. When this is the case, they rarely break out of poor eating patterns on their own.Dr Fuhrman hits the mark with Disease Proof Your Child, and your childs health depends on you reading it and \\"getting\\", that you are literally setting your kids up for health, success and sustainability or, disease, failure and a life cut short, each and every time you feed them. It's a cumulative thing.Dr Fuhrman not only explains the basic science confirming \\"why\\" you want to feed your kids Nutrient Rich foods in great tasting ways, but he also explains how. And when it comes to eating better and kids, \\"how\\", is everything. Starting with his 50 kid-tested and proven recipes, this book is a big deal.Dr Fuhrman is America's Doctor, because first and foremost he has your best interests at heart. He is in the business of getting you well. With all the competing interests promoting foods that do the opposite, I don't think he'll run out of customers any time soon, but make sure you and your kids are his customers so that you don't have consider yourselves part of the ever-growing statistics on overweight, obesity and sickness.The statistics are getting crazier by the day and all it takes, first and foremost, is ensuring they get better quality food, rich in the nutrients they need to succeed, and without all the crap that doesn't serve them.Today's Kids, perhaps your kids right now, are toxifying their undernourished, getting-more-unhealthy-by-the-day bodies, and their bodies are waiting for the opportunity to clean up and get healthy once again. But they need your help.And you need help to. That's why Dr Fuhrman is here. We all need to get re-educated and shed most of what we've learned about eating in the past 50 years.I can't recommend anyone better for the job, of steering you and your family in the right direction. He is the real deal, a successful family man of four with a dog, leading physician, world champion athlete, and successful businessman, in part because he eats to live well and boy does he live well.With great tasting food he and his family enjoys day in and day out they live free of disease and feeling powerful to pursue their interests. He wants the same for you and your family and he can show you how.Help yourself in the process and make it a family affair. You need to disease proof your kids at a time when what they eat is going to set the trend for their life. Their taste buds, and their desires are being built right now, and it will show in their weight and health, if not already, in the very near future.Are you setting your kids up for success, or failure? Are they eating foods that are promoting their health or disease?Read this book, its worth is weight in your child's well being.Don't read it and let your child make the decision to eat better when they're older and by then it may be too late.Read it and disease proof your child, bring their taste buds back to earth, nourish and protect their bodies and set them up for success, moving forward.If you could accomplish all this, and enable them to look better, feel better and perform better, while they enjoy great tasting foods, that you'll love too, would you do it?Then do it!All my best."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone who has a child (or one on the way) or who works with children. Rather than pumping our children up with sugar, toxins, carcinogens and frankenfood and then medicating them for the side effects, why not just feed them what nature intended and watch them thrive. Behavioral issues as well as serious health concerns can be resolved, alleviated, or completely avoided with a few lifestyle adjustments.Dr. Fuhrman drives home an important point: it's one thing to trash your own health with poor choices, but it's irresponsible to trash the health of trusting children.The tone of the book is not scolding however, just direct. In fact when he's done explaining the consequences of poor food choices (diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc.), he comes accross very upbeat and and encouraging with ideas for coping with the bombardment of toxic food out there. He also has great suggestions for meals and treats.Forget about what one reviewer said about nut allergies. This book not only has alternatives for eating nuts, but offers suggestions to help Prevent nut allergies. I also don't agree with the person who says it's \\"difficult\\". It's very simple and straightforward and really the only thing making it difficult is lack of education, unscrupulous marketing techniques, and the limiting belief that children won't eat healthy food.This is a book full of hope and an important work. At long last, an MD is addressing children's diets in a real way. Two books that go along quite nicely with this one is THE CHINA STUDY by Campbell and GREEN FOR LIFE by Boutenko. The former illustrates in great detail with hard evidence why a vegan diet is necessary and the later focuses on greens. GFL gave me the idea for green smoothies (example: bannanas and greens such as kale or swiss chard) which are a fantastic way of getting the daily comsumption of greens Dr. Fuhrman recommends. I have never been a fan of Kale, but you honestly cannot even taste it when prepared this way and kids Love it! You will need a high powered blender for this (Fuhrman recommends Vitamix, but I prefer the Blendtec) which is expensive, but worth every penny. In the end, this diet is way cheaper than the standard American diet (SAD).This book is the real thing, nothing gimmicky at all. Read it and thrive!"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"This is one book that no parent(s) or \\"potential\\" parent(s) should be without.

It also talks about how children that are breast fed longer (1-2 years) tend to have higher IQ scores in studies.One thing about Dr. Fuhrman is that he is a Medical Doctor (not a nutritionist) and he has 4 kids of his own and he has read and reviewed over 60,000 medical studies. he bases everything off of solid facts/studies. He does not favor just one study, he makes sure lots of studies agree on something, so there will be no science fiction in this book, everything is heavily referenced in his books.You must read this book, I personally gaurantee you will buy more than one copy it is such a great book!!"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"..That is all I can say.. I was so excited to receive your book today! You are an amazing man and I thank you so much for somehow finding the time to write this!\\"Disease-Proof Your Child\\" shares with us the wisdom and knowledge we need to make the right decisions in our children's lives and future health. I LOVE IT! There is SO much fascinating information in this book. The RIGHT information finally! From vitamins... to supplements... to foods... to understanding causes of illness and disease.... I couldn't stop reading and learning.. It is all written in your easy to read and understand manner. You truly want to give us the tools and knowledge we need to make informed decisions about our own as well as our families health. I only wish this book were available years ago!! We really are what we eat and unfortunately lots of us are paying the price for what we ate when we were young. We (and our parents) did not have the right information. Now, thanks to Dr. Fuhrman, we do and children who are lucky enough to have a parent who learns this way of eating and living will not have to suffer from many of the health issues so many of us are trying to undo!If you are pregnant or planning to be or are a parent who wants to get off the cycle of ear infection...Dr visit...prescription..ear infection..Dr visit etc.... or have a child diagnosed with ADHD and you want alternatives to drugs or you want to prevent illness or you have a child who is a picky eater and need help getting them to like good healthy food this book shows you the way. Dr Fuhrman also shares advice on pregnancy, nursing, hormones, pesticides, antibiotic use, foods to avoid (at least) until first birthday, his ten super foods to use in menu planning, making over your kitchen...school lunch tips...and more!

I am so grateful to you!"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"It is books like this one that fuel revolutions. Our society, now facing a frightening cancer and heart-disease epidemic, is hearing information from all sorts of \\"reliable\\" sources on how to find a solution, none of which seem to be working. Hospitals continue to overflow with disease-stricken patients (many of whom, unfortunately, are poorly-nourished children) who could have avoided medical intervention through better nutritional choices. We are blessed to live in a world where we can decide what kinds of food we put in our bodies; why do people keep bringing food into their homes that cause such harm to their families?! Our children are depending on us to provide them with food that fuels a healthy immune system so they have a chance at a disease-free and enjoyable life. You owe it to your family to read this book right away.Our health-conscious and educated family has always been open to various alternative \\"remedies\\", but we have often felt confused as to whether they were helping promote our family's core health or if these approaches were just addressing the symptoms. Dr. Fuhrman goes STRAIGHT to the core of our health. \\"Remedies\\" are not necessary in our lives if we build a solid foundation for our body's immune system from the get go. This book explains, in a no-nonsense manner, how to do this through nutritional excellence.I thought our family ate well. In comparison to most families, I'm sure we did. I still felt that there was room for improvement. I bought this book when my son became a toddler and wanted to drink things in addition to breast milk. We were told by nutritionists and doctors to \\"feed him whole milk, melt butter and cheese on everything he eats, feed him meat, and give him peanut butter\\" to \\"get his weight up\\". My instincts instantly screamed at me to research this because it felt wrong to me. I never thought the word \\"vegan\\" would have a place in our home, but after reading this book, we are now near-vegan, consuming mainly plant-based foods. We have totally eliminated dairy and sugar (except naturally occurring sugars found in fruit and dates). We still eat eggs and small portions of meat and fish on occasion.If this type of diet sounds extreme to you, as it did to us, don't let it deter you from reading this book. If anything can convince and assist you in changing unhealthy eating habits or to revise semi-healthy eating habits, this book can. If you want to spend more time with your family free from illness and disease, read this book. If you want your children to use their bodies sand brains to their full potential, read this book. If you want to prevent or cure ear infections, ADHD, or cancer read this book. It is a quick and easy read but is packed full of information covering nearly every aspect of nutrition I wanted to learn about. It provides simple to follow plans to rid your home of junk food and recipes that will make your family squeal in delight.This book is extremely well researched, drawing clear and precise conclusions supported by up-to-date scientific studies. It gave my husband and I ammunition to stand up to other family members who believed that children can't receive proper nutrients/fats without animal products in their diet. This book has inspired me to start studies to be a Nutritionist. Nutritional excellence truly is the key to better health and longevity. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"I am the mom of an 8-month-old and I turned to this book for advice on how to feed her. I am an omnivore, but I have cut back on meat and dairy consumption in the past few years for health reasons after reading some vegan and vegetarian blogs. I read about this book on one of the blogs.I read the book with the sinking realization that Dr. Fuhrman was advocating, ideally, a vegan diet for our family. I say \\"sinking\\" because I don't think our family will ever be able to go that far as to cut out all meat and dairy. Still, the doctor makes a highly convincing case for cutting way back on dairy and meat, and increasing consumption of veggies/fruit/nuts/beans/whole grains. I thought it was funny that Dr. Fuhrman seemed to avoid the terms \\"vegetarian\\" and \\"vegan\\" as much as possible and instead replaced them with his term \\"nutritional excellence.\\" I can only assume that lots of people have negative reactions to the idea of becoming vegetarian or vegan, and so he has adjusted his terminology, which makes sense.Dr. Fuhrman nicely synthesizes convincing evidence on the link between disease and poor nutrition. The book convinced me to make a concerted effort to reduce the meat and dairy in our home. I appreciated that Dr. Fuhrman conceded that there is no evidence of a health benefit of being totally vegan versus eating very small amounts of meat and dairy. I think you have to be a real zealot about health to make the effort to follow a totally vegan diet, but there is enough here to convince those of us who aren't quite as disciplined to make an extra effort to cook healthier for our families, and he tells us how.The one thing I didn't like about the book were the recipes. I love veggies, fruit, etc., but many of his recipes sounded truly disgusting! Cabbage raisin soup? Chocolatey lentils? Tofu pizza slices (ingredients: tofu and tomato sauce)? Bleh. On a daily basis I read vegan blogs that have MUCH more appealing recipes that make even more use of fresh veggies and fruit. Oddly, the doctor recommends dried soup mixes and dried spices like Mrs. Dash. And he has many recipes that involve soaking dried fruit in soy milk, and lots of soy milk recipes in general. I am not convinced that soy milk is a healthy substitute for cow's milk because of the estrogenic properties of soy. The recipes seemed like updated versions of 1950s cooking--yuck. He says the recipes have been tested on kids, so I can't argue with that, but I would not try most of these.I also would have appreciated more advice on feeding babies through age two, such as ways to get necessary fat into the diets of weaned older babies who aren't eating dairy and who can't yet eat nuts.These reservations aside, this book is a wake-up call for parents to clean up their cooking and take charge of the kitchen.My review is really 3 1/2 stars, not 4."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"I have found this book to be very informative. We are a vegetarian family and I have always wondered if my daughter is getting what she needs from her diet. Not only did he confirm the fact that she/we can be healthy as vegetarians he gave wonderful tips and recipes as well. I feel very comfortable with his recommendations and feel the book was very well done. It's one of those books that I want to read again and I'm excited to try more of the recipes!"},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"Today's parents are *so* fortunate to have this book. \\"Back in the day\\" parents like me trekked endlessly to doctors for yet another ear infection, yet another scary asthma attack and/or hospitalization, and yet another round of antibiotics.We had no idea that we could put an end to this relentless cycle simply by understanding the nutritional basis for these totally unnecessary assaults on our children's health and by changing our family's food intake. Now, it seems like \\"Duh...\\" because of course what goes *in* our children's bodies affects the *health* of those precious bodies.Dr. Fuhrman is like a bright shining light in a dark tunnel of fast food, endless fake-food advertising, and learning of yet another person you know who has just been diagnosed with heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.Dr. Fuhrman doesn't sugar-coat the research facts on the direct correlations between the Standard American Diet and the Standard American Diseases. But the fact that we can actually put an end to this vicious cycle--with delicious, health-promoting food--is nothing short of revolutionary. And in the simplest and most basic of ways, to boot.The kid-tested recipes are also great for adults, and this will definitely be a family affair. What an adventure, and what a gift to children, parents, and to a future of health instead of disease."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this book. Had I known how extreme his diet advice is -- no salt, no oil, no cooking except at low temperatures, animal products limited to a couple oz of chicken breast and an egg per week -- I wouldn't have bought it. I'm all for healthy eating (all of the food recommendations are things we have in our refrigerator and eat regularly). And I know how diet can radically improve health (our 2-year old had always had asthma symptoms and was diagnosed with asthma -- all symptoms ended when we took him off all dairy products and gave him a strong probiotic.) We feed our children whole foods with an emphasis on fruits, vegetables & whole grains as well as wild caught fish and pasture raised meats. I was hoping for some good ideas for recipes that would appeal to young children and menu planning. I guess I just don't believe that it's necessary to go to these lengths for good health.My 3 problems with the book:I'm really tired of very extreme diet advice. I always go back to the way people have been eating across the globe for the last few thousand years. Most cultures have traditionally cooked their food (there's a sentence in the book that says to throw out any food that has developed a golden or brown color from cooking.) Most cultures have traditionally used oil and salt in cooking. Most cultures have traditionally eaten some fish and meat. The diseases discussed in the book are new or much more prevalent in the U.S. in the past 30 years or so. Most of all, I am completely suspect of \\"experts\\" who denigrate all animal product consumption based on the problems of modern U.S. factory farming. It is disingenuous to condemn meat due to presence of antibiotics, growth hormones, bad Omega 6 to Omega 3 ratios etc. None of these things are a problem in pasture raised animals (how animals have been traditionally raised.)I don't believe what he says about toddlers magically loving vegetables if presented in the right way. He has a big thing about not forcing any food on a child - just present healthful options and they will choose the right one. If left to their own food preferences, my toddlers would only eat nut butter sandwiches and fruit. They have been exposed to every possible kale preparation since babyhood and I can honestly report that it is not one of their favorite foods. They love hummus & bean dips but they will always choose the bread and not the steamed or raw vegetables for dipping. I bought this book to find better ways to increase vegetable intake. Blithe statements about his children loving raw string beans and kale in a particular sauce are not helpful.Lastly, his recipes are really unappetizing. In most cultures, having a starting point of no oil, no animal products, no salt and little cooking would eliminate how flavors are developed and how food is made to taste good. He compounds the problem by having a bit of a sweet tooth. Most of the recipes feature a really sweet dried fruit. For example a \\"Cabbage Raisin Soup\\" with lemon juice, onions, split peas, pearl barley, cabbage, raisins, walnuts, soy milk, apple juice, carrots, oregano & dehydrated vegetable soup mix. It's a particular palate that wants a cup of raisins + 2 cups of apple juice with their cabbage, split pea, barley soup. If you have that palate and you want new recipes you should buy this book. Otherwise, you might want to give a miss to flavor combinations like dried peaches, fresh peaches, lentils, onions, leeks, carrots & spinach."},{"Title":"Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right","review":"The information is good but the authors writing style is terrible. He repeats the same thing over and over in what seems to be in an attempt to make the book longer. This book could have been half the size it is if he didn't repeat himself. It also makes you feel as if you are screwed being the adult if you didn't eat perfectly your whole life. Wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"The classical moment problem: And some related questions in analysis (University mathematical monographs)","review":"this book explains the classical moments problem, which can be applied to reconstruct distribution functions, electrical conductivities tensors...in plasmas, partially ionized gases, etc."},{"Title":"Speed Bump","review":"Fantastic book.

Less harsh and misanthropic than Unger, not quite as bizarre as THE FAR SIDE, way funnier than many-many-many of THE NEW YORKER frames, often very cleverly drawn, Coverly's SPEEDBUMP is a real delight. The stuff he does with the animal world contains some of the most effective, contemplative, gentle satire I've come across in the 'toon realm. I'm a big fan of HERMAN and THE FAR SIDE--and a not particularly easy person to please--so for me to say that this is a keeper is a pretty kinda/sorta big deal. Seriously."},{"Title":"Speed Bump","review":"Never have I seen so many great ideas in one book! I'm sure a lot of people would compare Dave Coverly's Speed Bump to The Far Side because of it's single panel format. I consider myself one of the biggest Far Side fans in the universe, but I can say in all honesty that this book has more outstandingly hilarious jokes in it than any Far Side collection I've read (and I own almost every Far Side book ever published!) Some of Coverly's ideas will make you say &quot;Why didn't I think of that?&quot; while you are holding your stomach from laughing so hard. I'm sure many, many people will be using some of these comics for screensavers or wallpaper on their computers. I really hope Mr. Coverly blesses us with more collections and I also hope he gets the same sort of newspaper distribution that some of the other great comics are getting. This book ranks up there with the funniest things I've ever read, and I'm sure you will feel that way too.

So many parts of this book pertained to my life, and I think that, even though he writes with a lot of brashness, it is just the 'medicine' that I need to try to get with the program: decluttering, trying to cut housework, etc. We are all managers, and we are the only ones who can change things: nobody is going to do it for us.I also am keeping the words &quot;look at cleaning up after [something] as the restoration process,&quot; so now when I'm taking care of the house, I'm not simply &quot;cleaning&quot; it but &quot;restoring&quot; it.I got this book through an inter-library loan but am thinking about purchasing it used thru this website and using it as a reference whenever I need a boost..."},{"Title":"How to Handle 1000 Things at Once: A Fun Guide to Mastering Home and Personal Management","review":"If you enjoy Aslett's books on clutter, then you'll probably enjoy this one too.

While Aslett comes across as somewhat of a workaholic, his methods of getting more done are useful for those of us with much less on our plate as well.One of the most useful techniques I found was \\"piggybacking\\": using the time between tasks to get other stuff done. For example, boiling pasta for your kids' lunch while you write a review for Amazon.com (as I'm doing now).I've read a few of Aslett's books, but this one is my favorite.

This book will help you handle yourself and your domestic responsibilities. Aslett writes that \\"the biggest management challenges in life are not in the boardroom, but the living room. Yes, at home, where we have to deal with and juggle family and friends, near and far, schoolwork, shopping, cleaning, home maintenance, car maintenance, yard care, finances, health, grooming, community and church activities, and service. Even pursuing our own and our children's favorite sports and hobbies, taking a hassle free vacation, and pet care - it's all management.\\"Aslett contends that it is at home and in personal life where 90% of management is needed. In this book, he sets out to help the reader manage this real business, the business of home, self, family, and friends. And I believe that anyone who reads this book and implements some if not all of Aslett's strategies and suggestions will undoubtedly find they are handling more things at once, maybe even 1,000 or more.If you are familiar with Aslett's style, you will know that his is a blend of humor, cartoon illustrations, and direct no nonsense get to it advice for being productive. I personally have enjoyed every one of his books I've read, and think he is right on with most of his suggestions. I say most, because I still wear button down collars at times, and I remember in his book \\"How to Have a 48 Hour Day\\" also published as \\"Done\\" (great book by the way) he suggested not wearing button down collar shirts to save time. JAnyway, as I said, I have really enjoyed all of the books of his that I have read, and I plan on picking up a couple others this year to read too.

Staying Out of ProblemsThe reality is we each have 24 hours a day. No more, no less. If you don't have the money to hire people to manage the daily necessities we all must have done, you will have more time for the productive and enjoyable things in life if you manage the daily tasks with more efficiency. (and even if you do have the money to hire people to do some of your daily chores, you will still be left with many personal and home things to manage) So, the best thing to achieve time to do the fun things or the special things you want to accomplish is to handle the 1,000 things that need to be done in the most practical and efficient way possible. Reading this book will give you a lot of doable strategies to help you with your home and personal management and the motivation to fuel your productivity into overdrive.\\"How to Handle 1,000 Things At Once\\" is humorous and informative, and the advice might just spill over into your work life and make you more productive and successful there too.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From The School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"How to Handle 1000 Things at Once: A Fun Guide to Mastering Home and Personal Management","review":"I have read just about all of Don Aslett's books and this is his best on organization and multi-tasking.

The back cover notes that over 1,500 collectible pieces are pictured and profiled in this book. This book is stunningly beautiful--it's full of detailed, full-color photographs that are accompanied by a well-written and informative text. Many different types of jewelry are depicted in these 256 pages--earrings, necklaces, bracelets, cufflinks, pins, etc.The book is full of fascinating and useful features: profiles of major designers (Chanel, Christian Dior, Hattie Carnegie, etc.), a glossary, a section depicting designers' stamps and copyright marks, reproductions of vintage magazine advertisements, and more. The international directory of dealers, auction houses, and museums includes addresses, phone numbers, Web sites, fax numbers, and/or e-mail addresses. There are sections highlighting interesting trends: suffragette jewelry, cut steel jewelry, etc.The book is full of intriguing sidebars about many different topics: the manufacture of faux pearls, the Surrealist influence on designer Elsa Schiaparelli, etc. There are also a number of spreads on &quot;Hot Collecting Fields,&quot; such as Austrian crystal fruit pins and Bakelite jewelry; I was especially impressed by the 4-page spread on Scottish agate jewelry.The book really covers a broad range of costume jewelry. Many different styles are depicted. The jewelry covered also represents a large range of materials--Berlin ironwork, Whitby jet, rhinestones, aluminum, poured glass, Lucite, rhodoid, copper, wood, faux coral, and more. I also like the fact that a broad price range is covered. There are many pieces that are under $50, as well as many that are over $1,000. But in the end it's the beautiful pictures that really blew me away--some pieces are elegant, some whimsical, many bursting with color and life. It's like a huge museum in a book, with an expert tour guide (the text) to accompany you."},{"Title":"Costume Jewelry (DK Collector's Guides)","review":"I love this book, it has some of the best photographs of jewelry to come out in years. If I could look at only one vintage costume jewelry book for an entire year, THIS would be it. There are tons of photographs of jewelry across the price spectrum, and at least a little bit of information about a lot of designers and companies. There are a few errors, such as some of the Bakelite she has pictured is actually Lucite or plastic, and some of the plastic and Lucite she has pictured is Bakelite. And while some of the pricing is exactly in line with what you would expect to fairly pay, some of the values are outrageous. But in a book this big, it can't all be perfect. This is the best book for new collectors, as it hits all the &quot;big&quot; names, doesn't gloss over the &quot;little&quot; names, and covers so much. It is also a great book for long time collectors. I have collected vintage costume jewelry for over 15 years, and I have over 50 cj books in my reference library; believe me when I say this book is wonderful eye candy."},{"Title":"Costume Jewelry (DK Collector's Guides)","review":"A beautiful book that covers an exaustive list of designers/makers. It's great for quick reference of designer bios and their notable pieces, or simply for enjoying the high quality photos. However, I find this book inadequate in terms of in-depth information on period/designer indentification based on material, craftmanship or markings. As a relatively new collector of vintage jewelry, I find it a good place to start, but it's by no means an all-in-one type of reference book."},{"Title":"Costume Jewelry (DK Collector's Guides)","review":"This book was one of my first books on costume jewelry, and it is so easy to learn from. I know, because I have an online vintage jewelry site, \\"Enchantment Vintage Costume Jewelry\\" and I still reference this book frequently.The best thing about this book, besides the clear & colorful eye candy, is that it gives a rundown on different jewelry eras--from Victorian through 1980s glitz! There are aslo sections on a great many of the most collectible designers and the characteristics of their jewelry. It also includes a section on unsigned jewelry, which is good because most costume jewelry was unsigned.One of the most helpful aspects is that the jewelry is dated, so that the reader can learn to start assigning dates to the different styles of jewelry. You can't go wrong with this one.I also recommend \\"How to Be a Jewelry Detective,\\" by Jeanenne Bell."},{"Title":"Costume Jewelry (DK Collector's Guides)","review":"This lavishly illustrated book is an excellent example of why many librarians love Dorling Kindersley books.

For each designer, a brief history is given, which is them followed by numerous colour pictures and 2003 values. A brief appendix of makers marks is included at the end, to allow readers to identify pieces of jewellery which they may own, as is a comprehensive index.This book is aimed squarely at novice jewellery collectors. It gives the reader a good idea of the different styles of costume jewellery available and is a wonderful book for fueling dreams. However, it lacks much of the information that more advanced collectors may be looking for, such as detailed information on dating jewellery and advice on which are the best pieces to collect.There are a lot of similarities between this book andCollecting Costume Jewelry 101: The Basics of Starting, Building & Upgrading (Collecting Costume Jewelry 101). Both are visual guides to American costume jewellery makers, although I, personally, prefer \\"Collecting Costume Jewelery 101\\". It contains more advice on collecting than this book does. Nevertheless, both books are very good and if you are a beginner and you can afford it, I would recommend that you buy both."},{"Title":"Costume Jewelry (DK Collector's Guides)","review":"This book is a good one to have in your costume jewelry library. It begins with interesting background on costume jewelry through the ages followed by twenty in-depth designer profiles with example pieces. An interesting feature of these first designer profiles is the \\"Good, Better, Best\\" designations for examples of the same type of piece, such as necklaces or pins. The third section is entitled the \\"A-Z of Designers and Makers,\\" which includes less in-depth information on the company or designer with photos of pieces. Interspersed among the A-Z designers are sections entitled \\"Hot Collecting Field,\\" which deal with topics such as Christmas tree pins, Scottish agate jewelry, Bakelite, Coro duettes, etc. It took me a while to figure out this interruption in the A-Z organization. One surprise in the A-Z designers is that DeLizza & Elster (Juliana) is not included. The book concludes with a \\"Gallery of Unsigned Pieces\\" with some rather hodgepodge categories, such as \\"Miscellaneous Pins.\\" The index is good but alphabetized by designer last name in contrast to other sections of the book which may be alphabetized by designer first name. The jewelry included in this book definitely leans toward the high end. In addition, values seem to me to be inflated in relation to eBay averages. The photography is beautiful. I would recommend buying a used copy for your costume jewelry library."},{"Title":"Costume Jewelry (DK Collector's Guides)","review":"I really like this book because the is alot if information on alot of different makers.

It contains some introductory material to help people understand what images are and how to process them. The majority of the text, however, is for experienced people wanting to look up topics.This book is big. It is about 8&quot;x11&quot; by 900 pages. It contains material from 100 different professionals on 50 different topics.The style is academic. The editor is the editor of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. The page style is similar to what you would see in an IEEE Transaction.There is plenty of math. The text explains the mathematics, but not to the depth I would like to see.The authors illustrate the techniques with many images. If there are no &quot;before and after&quot; images in an image processing book, reject it. Well, this book has plenty of images. That is a strong point.A week point is there is no source code illustrating the techniques and algorithms. I find this a major weakness, but one that is not unique to this book.The authors leave much to the reader. This is not a read from cover to cover book. The reader must go slow, take notes, study, and read again to understand the material.All in all, this is a good source of knowledge on image processing. If you work with images and write software to process images, you should have this book on your desk."},{"Title":"HANDBOOK OF IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING","review":"This is a very nice reference work for image processing professionals. It is a collection of articles by various experts in aspects of image processing, reporting on the state-of-the-art in their particular domains. The coverage is broad and deep. However, it is not for everyone. The writing style is that of a refereed journal. If you are not comfortable with that style of exposition, or if you are simply trying to find a snippet of code to implement a particular algorithm, this is not the book for you. At the other extreme, do not expect to find new and startling insights into the field that you did your dissertation on.

The Environment of Evolutionary Adaption, which was the savannas of Africa, disappeared for most of us long ago; but genetically and phenotypically speaking we have changed very little. Thus the first four words of the title are beguiling; the rest after the colon, I suspect, was something formulated by a committee of book biz editors trying to spice up the presentation.This is evolutionary psychology written by a journalist, readable with some worthwhile insights. It should be compared to Richard Wright's The Moral Animal (1994) and Matt Ridley's The Red Queen (1993) from the same time period. This is a comparison that could be extended to other books on evolutionary psychology, including anthropologist Marvin Harris's Our Kind (1989): sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson's earlier, On Human Nature (1978); Robert Jay Russell's The Lemur's Legacy (1993); Richard Wrangham's Demonic Males (1996), etc. Incidentally Amazon has all these books and others, so you might want to do a little comparison shopping. What one notices is that Allman's book is, relatively speaking, a feel-good, sanitized narrative. Our stone age ancestors did not kill a cow and cut up its carcass and distribute it to others in order to enhance their power and prestige and to gain reproductive favors, as most &quot;observers&quot; would have it; but, according to Allman, to share &quot;with friends and neighbors&quot; and &quot;courting lovers.&quot; It is amazing what a difference terminology can make. Allman almost allows us to embrace evolutionary psychology and its rather unflattering insights and keep the rose-colored glasses on. The tone is positive and reasoned. The book is also as politically correct, although not as annoyingly PC, as Wrangham's Demonic Males.I should mention that one of the major themes in this book and in recent evolutionary psychology is that our brains grew big and smart to deal with the our complex social lives. This is the current wisdom. Well, as Satchel Paige said, &quot;The social ramble ain't restful,&quot; and as I've always said, socializing is a lot of work. Yes, I think this really does explain how our brains got to be so big. We needed to be really smart to outsmart the other guy. We needed to be smart to juggle all those intrigues, social, political and sexual. I like the way this insight fits with the female's abhorrence of nerds: the fact of the matter is, not being social is also not being smart! So there, nerds!Like Harris, Allman does not see civilization or the rise of agriculture as necessarily a good thing for the average Joe. And he is firm in discounting the idea that human beings represent &quot;progress&quot; on the evolutionary scale. Interestingly, Allman reports extensively from Robert Axelrod's work on cooperation in an attempt to make us look like good guys. Axelrod is the guy who devised the computer models testing the prisoner's dilemma and held the competition that revealed the now well-known and celebrated &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; strategy that won it (initially cooperate and then act toward the other as that other has acted toward you: tit for tat). Tit for tat also appeared in Wright's The Moral Animal and in Ridley's The Origins of Virtue and elsewhere. I think Axelrod might have had a press agent. At any rate, tit for tat is now seen as needing a random and forgiving variation in order to defeat various other strategies, including ruthlessly non-cooperative ones.This is a pretty book, originally from Simon &amp; Schuster, very well edited and copyread (thank you!)."},{"Title":"The Stone Age Present","review":"My feelings about this book are twoflod. On the one hand, Allman presents a good overview of how the human psyche developed during the last tens of thousands of years. He provides a comprehensive survey of how external challenges faced by our Stone Age ancestors developed behavior traits that characterized the human spices at the end of the Stone Age (roughly 8000 years BC). I'm not an anthropologist nor an evolutionary psychologist to give a professional judgement here, but for me his story seems logical and sound.On the other hand the premise on the first cover of the book and the key message of it are in my opinion too dangerous and misleading. Allman focuses on explaining how evolution has shaped modern life, almost rejecting that behaviour (and thus values) of modern human should be caused primarily not by evolution (nature), but by the value system that has been designed and adopted by our very best specimen contrary to our [still Stone Age] genes. Consider two different characters: the pagan hero and Jesus. As Allman explains, in cooperating with other humans our ancestors evolved and followed a \\"Tit-for-Tat\\" strategy, that is \\"act toward the other as that other has acted toward you\\". The behaviour of the praised pagan hero was mostly in accordance with it. But what Jesus preached is entirely different: \\"offer the wicked man no resistance. On the contrary, if anyone hits you on the right cheek, offer him the other as well\\" (Matthew 5:38-39). The difference between the Stone Age and modern behaviour is also clear in relations between sexes. The pagan hero's desire to have plenty of women is a direct result of our male ancestors' instinct to spread his genes into as much females as possible, to guarantee descendants and thus continuation of his genes. Thus the pagan hero felt no guilt and saw no harm in having affairs with different women. Christianity shifted the emphasis from sex to empathy and love, something that is completely useless in terms of evolution but absolutely necessary for realization of our spiritual life. What the Buddah preached is also extremely different from the Stone age behavior: just feel the difference between the goal of Nirvana (buddhism) and the goal of material posessions (Stone age).My key message here is that biologically we do still consist of mostly the Stone age genes (Allman is right), but only because not enough time has passed to modify them to the necessities of new reality. We now have a completely different set of challenges and goals (external as well as internal), to which our Stone age genes are often counter-productive. Thus our key challenge in mental development is to overcome most of these genes, and we really have a mental capacity to do it - just look at Buddha, Jesus, Mother Teresa and many others.The sad truth is that although the key challenges of the Stone Age are now extinct (the problem with food and production is generally solved, at least in Europe and USA), in modern society we still have much more beings with the Stone Age behavior (and thus values) than the martyrs of love and faith. And the biggest danger of this book is that it emphasizes in no way how important it is to overcome our Stone age genes and instead develop what is so necessary for our new way of life: love, faith, reason and spontaneous activity that emerges from the heart.I recommend this book as a historical overview of how the psyche of human beings had developed from dawn till dusk of the Stone age, but please do not interpret the findings of this book as a guide for action. We now face different challenges that require completely different attitude and behavior, and it's a pity that the author does not emphasize this obvious fact."},{"Title":"The Stone Age Present","review":"Each chapter in this book is devoted to a different topic: language, culture, cooperation, sex, among others. Each one of these topics can be covered by itself in a whole book. Given that, the book does not tell you much about each topic. Second, even though the title of the book is stone age present, most of the experimental work discussed in the book is from nonhuman primate studies. The book is however interesting, easy-to-read, and a good start for non-academics."},{"Title":"Valuing the Earth: Economics, Ecology, Ethics","review":"As a citizen who is concerned about the health of the environment, I was enlightened by the essays in the first section of this book. The authors leave little room for doubt that the Earth can sustain a finite population, and for a finite length of time. Without any of the hysterical rhetoric which so often characterizes the political debate on this topic, these scholars demonstrate the fact that our existence on this, the eastern shore of Eden, is ephemeral.As a student of economics, I was impressed by the lucid exploration of free-enterprise, steady-states, and market forces in the third section. This section is home to some of the best essays in the book: T. H. Tietenberg's exposition of free-market solutions to the pollution problem as well as Ken Townsend's expert discussion of the ecological problems facing the nations of the former communist world are as important as they are timely.But, the most important respect in which I was struck by this book was as a human being. It is in the second section that Daly and Townsend--with the help of such friends as C. S. Lewis and E. F. Schumacher--address the important issue of morality. Are humans obligated to preserve something off this planet for future generations? How much consumption should we engage in? Does our economic system promote an ungodly destruction of the world in which we live.The reader should not come to this volume without a willingness to challenge his own deeply held notions about the state of the environment or the economy's role in creating that state. Neither should a reader open this book if he is searching for easy solutions to our environmental problems.Those readers with the courage to think, however, will not be dissatisfied."},{"Title":"Valuing the Earth: Economics, Ecology, Ethics","review":"For the advanced student of the discipline of ecological economics this essay-collection provides a handfull of the most influential classics of the field, of which many has been hard to come by for years. The essays by Garrett Hardin, Herman Daly, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Paul and Anne Ehrlich are among the most frequently cited essays of the field - and for good reasons."},{"Title":"Valuing the Earth: Economics, Ecology, Ethics","review":"Edit of 21 Dec 07 to add links to more recent books that build on this.This is one of three books that I bought for review with the intent of selecting one for broad pro-bono distribution. Although I chose \\"For the Common Good\\" and I recommend \\"Ecological Economics\\" as the one book to buy if you buy only one (see my reviews of those books at their own pages), this book is a treasure chest of original and current thinking that should certainly be in your hands if you can afford all three books. As another reviewer has noted, it finally re-publishes some of the hard to get original thinkers from the steady-state economics era of the 1970's. However, it does so with an ample leavening of 1990's authorship, and hence could reasonably be regarded as a first-class \\"readings\\" complement to the text book (\\"Ecological Economics\\").There is a chart on page 20 of this book that is quite extraordinary. Titled \\"The ends-means spectrum\\", it brilliantly runs down from the top: Religion and Ethics as guidelines to ultimate and intermediate ends of humanity; to the middle Political Economy as a means of managing the factors of production to specific political ends; to the bottom: Technics and Physics as the \\"ultimate\\" foundation or \\"ground truth\\" of flow-entropy-matter-energy that must constrain political and religious ends.This book, in which Kenneth N. Townsend is the second contributing editor-author, blends practical, political, economic, and theological writings, over several decades, in a most pleasing manner. E. F. Schumacher's \\"Buddhist Economics\\" jumped out at me, reminding me that our predominantly Protestant corporate capitalist ethos is very far removed from the realities that guide and repress billions around the Earth, all of whom have fewer options than we do. With that thought in mind, I strongly recommend William Greider's \\"The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy\\" as a very current complement to any of the books that Dr. Daly has helped bring into the marketplace of ideas.See also, with reviews:The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About ItNatural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial RevolutionGreen to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage"},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"This book provides substantive and accurate scholarship. It helps to dispel the misleading image of Mormonism created by the LDS Church's professional public relations firm. The latter is a rosily inaccuate portrayal that all too easily seduces the subjective, feelings-oriented mentality that is so prevalent today. The book is historically, theologically and philosophically excellent. It will be recognized as such by those having more than a superficial knowledge of Mormon doctrine and history. For example, it is abundantly clear from Joseph Smith's &quot;Inspired Version&quot; of the Bible that he did, indeed, intend to write himself into Old Testament prophecy. Those who take the trouble to read the early diaries and historical documents of the Church do not doubt this. This book is an absolute must read. I would give it more than five stars if I could."},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"The best chapter in this book is by Francis Beckwith, a philosophy professor who has written an academic monograph on Mormonism as well as a number of academic articles (which means, I presume, that he knows something about Mormonism). Ron Rhodes's chapter is second best, but Geisler and Roberts could use some improvement. I think a project like this is good, but it should be a little more tight. It is written clearly and intended for a wide audience. The book is worth buying just for Beckwith's well-reasoned critique of the Mormon concept of God."},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"talk about an all-star crew of authors!! I'm in Phil Robert's chapter in the book right now. The book was written from an evangelical standpoint for a reason- Mormonism is a divergent, created belief system which has absolutely NO basis in Historic and Biblical Christianity aside from Smith's plagarism of a KJV Bible and his 'modifications' in the so-called 'inspired version'. Not too much new info is presented to those who are already familiar with the LDS (and with older titles on the subject) and their divergencies from Historic Christianity, but for those unfamiliar, this book makes it easy to learn."},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"This 1998 book contains chapters by noted apologists and anti-Mormon authors: Norman Geisler, Francis Beckwith, Ron Rhodes, Phil Roberts, and Jerald and Sandra Tanner.The Foreword states, \\"While this book is partly a response toHow Wide the Divide?: A Mormon & an Evangelical in Conversation, its purpose is much broader than that. With Mormonism claiming more fervently than ever that it alone represents the fullness of true Christianity, it is more urgent than ever before for biblical Christians to speak up for truth...\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"Actually, this so-called 'Inspired Version' of the Bible has been an embarrassment to the Mormon Church. It was never published during (Joseph) Smith's lifetime, nor has the Mormon Church ever made an official publication of it. It was given in 1886 by Smith's wife Emma to the Reorganized Church... Their edition of 1887 is even sold in the Mormon Deseret Book Store and is cited by Mormon scholars.\\" (Pg. 28-29)\\"Most orthodox Christians admit (1 John 5:7-8) is an interpolation. Why an inspired Mormon Prophet who rejected the doctrine of the trinity would miss correcting this verse is not easy to explain.\\" (Pg. 30-31)\\"Finally, the Inspired Version corrects verses in the Bible which are cited by the inspired Book of Mormon as true. It would follow logically that at least one, if not both, of these books is not inspired.\\" (Pg. 32)\\"(T)here are no biblical passages that either explicitly or implicitly teach that God is by nature a physical being... although there are passages ... that explicitly teach that God is by nature a spirit.\\" (Pg. 81)\\"For some unexplained reason the Holy Ghost became a God without going though an earth existence and receiving a physical body.\\" (Pg. 194)"},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"This book was written in response to the alarming acceptance of Mormonism as a Christian denomination and, in particular, to Stephen E. Robinson's book \\"How wide the divide\\"?I have read countless books on the Mormon cult, so I did not expect to find anything new on this one, but I was surprised to find out that I was wrong.\\"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism\\" is divided in five main chapters, each one written by a well known counter-cult Christian author.The first chapter was written by Norman Geisler and deals with the LDS view of Scripture; Dr. Geisler briefly explains the evangelical view of the Bible, followed by the LDS position on the Bible and the other Mormon \\"standard works\\". This chapter is very interesting and contains some information I had never read before; on the other hand, Dr. Geisler is clearly preaching to the choir and some of his reasonings have not entirely convinced me.The second chapter is a philosophical analysis of the Mormon concept of God, authored by Francis J. Beckwith. This brief essay proves Mormon concepts such as eternal progression to be logically inconsistent, and shows without a doubt that the Mormon god Elohim is definitely not the living God of the Bible. This chapter is truly inspiring, but it should be noted that Professor Beckwith says that he can't thoroughly analyze all possible Mormon comebacks because of space constraints, yet he finds enough space to advertise three of his books and, in one instance, goes out of context in order to do that.The third chapter is an analysis of the many differences between the Mormon Jesus and the biblical Jesus, written by Ron Rhodes. Dr. Rhodes is a very talented writer with a special gift for explaining even the most complicated concepts with clear, easy to understand language. Much of the material presented in this chapter is basically the same as in the fifteenth chapter of Rhodes' \\"Reasoning from the Scriptures with Mormons\\", but it is still worth reading.The fourth chapter deals with the differences between the Christian and the Mormon plan of salvation. Here Phil Roberts carefully analyzes the Mormon struggle to obtain salvation by doing good deeds in contrast to the wonderful Gospel of grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is my favorite chapter of the book.The fifth chapter, written by the Jerald and Sandra Tanner, is a classification of the main differences of terminology used by LDS and Christians, how the Mormon Church have distorted the meaning of some biblical terms, and the fact that most Mormons do not clearly understand these definitions.The book closes with an invitation to our Mormon friends to trust in Jesus Christ, rather than a human organization, for salvation.Overall, this is an excellent reference for people interested in Mormonism, or for those Mormons who started to question their organization.So, to conclude, I think that this book decisively answers Dr. Robinson's question: \\"how wide is the divide between Evangelicalism and Mormonism?\\". The divide is wide indeed!"},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"As an atheist who recently became somewhat familiar with several online mormons, I obviously have no bias towards Mormonism, but have knowledge of their beliefs. I bought this book so i could challenge them with hard hitting questions, but even as i read it, I knew there was no reality in this book. Being written from an evangelical standpoint doesn't help matters. Though some of it is true (Mormons don't believe in the Trinity, etc), much else is misleading (such as the charge that in Joseph Smith's Inspired Version of the Bible, he wrote in a prophesy that mentioned him by name-- when in fact it mentioned only his first name, not his whole name). Don't waste your money unless you want a bunch of anti-mormon rants that have no real value. There is plenty wrong with the Mormon belief system, so it is curious that the authors have to make things up!"},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"This books was a disappointment, to say the very least, in acting as a rebuttal to recent Evangelical-Mormon discussions on similarities and differences of faith (e.g. \\"How wide the Divide\\").Time will not permit me to discuss the dozens of falsities packed in this small book, but here are a few from Norman Geisler's essay entitled \\"Scripture.\\"Gesiler claims that LDS scripture is counterfeit as changes exist between the 1833 Book of Commandments and subsequent printings of the Doctrine and Covenants, and cites Jeremiah 36:28. However, he fraudulently ignores verse 32 of that same chapter, that shows Jeremiah added unto his original writings, supporting, not negating, what Joseph Smith did.Also, Gesiler caims that Joseph Smith was a false prophet based on a number of passages from writings. However, some come from vitolic 2nd-hand sources (\\"An Address to all believer's in Christ\\" by David Whitmer) or are unfulfilled _commandments_, not prophecies, such as D&C; 84:3-5 (see D&C; 124:48-52)Also, Geisler on page 12 cites Jeremiah 36:28 to show that no Prophet ever tampered with scripture. However, if he read verse 32, he would realsie that the opposite is true - here Jeremiah added \\"many like words\\" to his original writings that had been burned in a fire by the King of Judah.This work, alsongside all works critical of Mormonism from Harvest House, inclusive of a lot of the works by the individuals involved, are counterfeit representations of Mormon beliefs, and are full of eisegetical interpretations of the Biblical text, alongside LDS scripture, to disprove a straw-man."},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"This book really does, as one of the reviewers here notes, represent an all-star cast of anti-Mormons. Its poor quality is all the more striking for that very fact.Several fundamental problems mar the book. For one thing, its authors consistently offer up the most damning possible version of Latter-day Saint belief -- often in a form that few Mormons, if any, would be willing to accept. Then it compares that caricatured version to the authors' own less-than-obviously-true understanding of the Bible or of Christianity, as if their interpretations were the only ones on the market. Moreover, the authors don't always seem to know much about their subject. (Geisler is a particular disappointment in this regard.)And, of course, the book's relentlessly antagonistic attitude toward the Latter-day Saints and their faith shouldn't exactly inspire its readers with confidence in the fairness of its approach. But then, lack of fairness probably won't matter to a considerable proportion of the book's audience, who may well get too much pleasure out of seeing the Mormons trashed to worry much about such matters as bias, accuracy, and context."},{"Title":"The Counterfeit Gospel of Mormonism: The Great Divide Between Mormonism and Christianity","review":"My only complaint: Let's just take it a step further and say &quot;The Counterfeit Religion of Christianity&quot;.

From the dawn of civilization to the modern era, Wells takes you along the journey of civilization (and pre-civilization -- the first few chapters of the book cover geology and evolution). This tome, and if ever a volume merited the word this is it, carries you along the way with Alexander, Persian Kings, Khans, Crusaders, Chinese Emperors, Popes, French Citizens, Tsars, and Kaisers. The sweep of characters, times and places includes a wonderful vista of history, all together and seen in relation to its entirety.Yes, it's dated. Yes, it's slanted. H. G. Wells is very Victorian in his ethics. His politics were Fabian Socialist so you will find a distinct undercurrent for a socialist world government driving the story along. He is as un-Eurocentric as you could expect for the time: Europe and the Middle East take up the majority of the book, China and India play the next biggest role, followed distantly by Africa, Australia and the Americas.The flaws are few given the task, the style is immensely readable, and the man who wrote The War of the Worlds, Time Machine, The Invisible Man and the Island of Doctor Moreau knows how to tell a story. Wells had the nerve to take on the World and the world gets a ripping good yarn with Mankind as the hero. You're part of the story; why not read it?Also if you liked this book, you might enjoy:Guns, Germs, and Steel : The Fates of Human Societies by Jared DiamondDemocratic Ideas and Reality by Halford J. Mackinder"},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","review":"This is the book that had such a powerful impact on Malcolm X. Its easy to see why. The history of the world is vividly outlined in an erudite and readable style. (Ever since I read \`The Time Machine' when I was sixteen, I have considered Wells to be the clearest writer of prose in the English language.) Wells takes us from the very beginning of life right up to the League of Nations in 1922, stopping off at most points in-between: Neolithic cavemen, Periclean Athens, Roman and Byzantium civilisations, the life of Jesus, Confucius and Lao Tse, the rise of Islam, the Dark Ages, the Renaissance, discovery of America, the Industrial Revolution, World War I, and so on. The book is breathtaking in its scope, but Wells manages to give a succinct, vivid and comprehensive view of world history. I have found myself re-reading many of the chapters and I do not doubt that I will soon be re-reading the book in its entirety. There is little to criticise in this book - maybe it is a little Euro-centric; in the last chapters he does tend to labour his point a bit; and the early chapters are a little dated as we now know so much more about the evolution of our species. These are mere quibbles. Read it and become informed. Read it and be entertained."},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","review":"H.G. Wells... Can any more be said?? This book is historical (no sci-fi). From the Beginnings of known time (a little bit dated...), to the present (dated, once again). This work will fill your mind with all types of historical knowledge spanning, anthropology, paleontology, religious history, and any other empirical science, to explain what happened by a man who's gift for words and explanations rivalled C.S. LewisMere Christianity (C.S. Lewis Signature Classics)and Richard DawkinsThe Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","review":"This has to be one of the most remarkable books I've ever read. According to John Strachey and other contempories of Wells, it represented the first attempt in modern times to compile a complete history of mankind. Wells' writing style is essentially journalistic. It's easy to read and full of colorful facts that make you quite sad they never got round to teach world history in school.Wells starts at the very beginning, describing the extent of scientific knowledge in 1922 regarding the formation of the earth and the planets. He then traces what was known (based on fossil records) regarding the origin of life, evolution, and the drastic climatic changes associated with successive geologic periods. He talks about the two known (at the time) pre-human species - Neanderthal and Rhodesian Man. He doesn't even try to speculate exactly where the first true man originated. However he talks about caves in France and Spain where artifacts have been found, suggesting there true men living in Europe at the time the last Ice Age receded. He moves on to talk about the beginning of cultivation 10,000 years ago and to outline the ethnic origins of the primitive tribes present in most parts of the known world at the time of the great Greek and Roman civilizations.He then takes us through the origin of written language in Sumeria and the civilizations of Egypt, Babylon and Assyria. This was my favorite section of the book. Prior to reading A Short History of the World, my only knowledge of these cultures came from the Bible. He covers the Persian empire then, as well as the history of the Jewish people. After covering Greece, Rome and Carthage, he devotes two chapters to the history of China and two to the life of the prophet Mohammed and Arab civilization.As a European, he devotes the latter half of the book to European history through the Middle Ages, the Reformation, the Industrial Revolution and the great revolutions that overthrew feudalism. His first edition ended with World War I. However in 1946 he updated the book to cover European history through World War II.By Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, author of THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACT: MEMOIR OF AN AMERICAN REFUGEE"},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","review":"In addition to all of the other glowing and positive reviews below, I'd like to humbly add the following......When it came to my O'levels (GCSE's), I was given the choice of History or Geography; looking back I think it was unfortunate that I chose Geography.I stumbled across an earlier version of this book about 30 years ago and have never looked back. For me it made the subject so interesting and accessible. The read is absolutely captivating and you really won't want to put it down once you've started.Obviously because of the author, the book only goes up to around the time of WWII. If you enjoy this book as much I have then you may wish to expand your knowledge with dynamite read by \\"J.M. Roberts\\" called \\"The New Penguin History of the World\\".Both of these books are classics, or certainly will be and really ought to be in pride of place in all school book library history sections if not on each student's desk during history lessons!! Essential reading and fantastic reference for any history buff."},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","review":"Writing a history of the world that is fun to read, easy to understand, and not a gazillion pages long is no easy task. Wells has done it in a masterful way.This is a book for all ages as it is written in an extremely simple and clear manner."},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","review":"Part of the fun is reading H. G. Wells' sweeping generalizations written at a time when the British Empire was still in business. Not very scholarly, lacking documentation, this series of verbal snapshots of world history is enjoyable in itself and a good refresher text on Western Civilization in a global setting."},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","review":"This is a review of the Kindle version of this product which does NOT have drawings, pictures, maps etc. This detracts from the book tremendously.The writing is excellent and pretty easy to follow. The chapters are well arranged to take the reader progressively through history. His analysis of history is normally spot on. Here is an example of the author's comments on the Treaty of Versailles: \\"The treaty of Versailles was intended to be exemplary and vindictive; it provided tremendous penalties for the vanquished; it sought to provide compensations for the wounded and suffering victors by imposing enormous debts upon nations already bankrupt, and its attempts to reconstitute international relations by the establishment of a League of Nations against war were manifestly insincere and inadequate.\\" (Kindle Locations 5473-5475). That is about as good an analysis of the Treaty of Versailles in one sentence as you could ever get.Mr. Wells also lets us know when he is speculating about history. Note: \\"And now let us indulge in a very interesting speculation; how did it feel to be a man in those early days of the human adventure? How did men think and what did they think in those remote days of hunting and wandering four hundred centuries ago before seed time and harvest began.\\" p.24 Kindle Edition. H.G. Wells clearly labels his comments as speculation. This is not usual for writers of history. Historians often tell us what happened in an era long before writing as if it were taken off of live film footage. Wells, at least, tells us we are guessing.The author's discussion of Socialism, page 152 - 156, is excellent and worth the price of the book.The book ends before the great depression, but that is OK as other books can take us from the 1920's to the present day. The writing is a bit out of date as their has been significant historical progress in many areas since Well's wrote; however, just keep in mind that some of the facts recited by the author may be dated. His conclusions of where history has been and where it may be headed are still excellent. Of course, Wells does not adopt the view that history is random with no overarching themes. He writes from the point of view that people have progressed from the early days of scratching in the ground for a living to a modern and very complex world. Progress is assumed and the theme of man's progress from primitive to modern is put forth without question. The reader should be aware that this reviewer has the same viewpoint; however, the newer views of history have changed this assumption dramatically. (See: Jeff Riggenbach, Why American History Is Not What They Say It Is - available on Kindle).Overall, an excellent work but I would advise buying the hard copy version for the maps and drawings. They are really first rate and help the reader follow the flow of history.AD2"},{"Title":"A short history of the world (The thinker's library)","review":"Material is a little dated, but it an excellent book to read to get a \\"quick\\" (it is not a short book!) history of civilization.

This history ends in the early 1920s, and although there are many details that we now know are different (the editors do a great job here), it doesn't make this work less relevant to modern readers.Wells takes a high-level view of events, and focuses mainly of two threads: the societies and empire formations through the interaction and clash of races; and the emancipatory (moral) power of the main monotheistic religions. Each chapter is self-contained, but this motif is never lost of sight. Wells comes back to it throughout the book.It is redundant to remark that Wells is a great writer and that the prose of his short history is direct and engaging. This is no minor detail in a book of this breath.

Or the pinpoint assertion that if you drop your kid off at any mall, \\"he'll quickly learn that community and commodity are not easily discernible from each other\\"? Or: \\"The only thing that kept Burning Man out of Business Week was that no one would admit to making -- or seeking -- a profit\\"? And really, you can find as good or better a bon mot on any of the pages of this book.Even from the mid-1990s, this book is a breath a fresh air from today's world of multimedia mergers, where reporters chase each others' tales in conflating and inflating pre-conceived notions and prepackaged soundbytes. Who today proclaims as forcefully -- or anywhere near as literately -- that the emperor has no clothes even as the mainstream media sources compete for more vivid adjectives to describe the non-existent garments?While the book has its faults and there were certainly better essays than some of the selections, it more than holds its own with any contemporary commentary. A full decade before VH1 announced its sure-to-be-craptacular series \\"Web Junk 20\\" as the latest lowest-common-denomination demon spawn of TV and Internet, Suck explained why attempts at merging the two media only seem to cull the worst of each and draw into sharp detail the differences -- not the similarities -- between technology's long-lost kin. With today's breathless tech reporters and hypesters trying to convince you that watching a movie on an iPod is somehow as good as enjoying it in widescreen, and a supplicant media (owned by those releasing those movies) coo their approval, the absence of sarcastic outsider wisdom by the likes of Suck is more missed than ever.While this book will not cure what ails society, consider it a drinking binge from the fountain of knowledge that won't leave you with a hangover in a stranger's apartment.

While Wills appears to have led a charmed life - breaking easily into conservative journalism and finding love at the same time - it is the essays that are in my opinion the best part of the book. In them, he argues with great sense about why the lack of hard and unyielding convictions in politicians is a good and useful thing (it is their job to horse trade); and why radical change can destroy more than help (society is like a complex living organism). I have thought about these simple, pragmatic ideas for years, and he articulates them better than anyone. The art of politics in democracy is careful change, when society is ready but also when it becomes necessary. He also takes cynics, like Tom Wolfe, to task for ridiculing the liberal and radical pretentions of celebrities.This is a truly wonderful book, which too few people have ever read, from one of America's best political writers. It is ironic that, while he identifies himself as a conservative, the drift to the right of American politics in the last 25 years makes him sound more and more like a liberal."},{"Title":"Knielen op een bed violen","review":"\\"Horror uit de biblebelt!

Warmed by the Kachelofen at their home in the Wittenberg university, with Johannes, Magdalena, Martin, Paul, Margaretha - and who knows how many children from the neighborhood - at his feet, one can well imagine how father Martin would have acted out the stories with feeling, laughter and a bit of homemade, dramatic flair.Contrary to widespread opinion, the evangelical Reformation of the 16th century did not find its primary driving force in the court of Charles V or in the academic halls of the university of Elector Friedrich the Wise. It was driven rather by the creative energies of common people who suddenly discovered the freedom of the gospel through the letters, prayers, songs and sermons that found their way from the pens of the Reformers to the printing shop of Lukas Cranach, and from there into the homes of people all over Europe. What won the hearts of the common people was not so much the erudite theological treatises - as important as these were - but the concrete expressions of the proclaimed Word through devotional literature, stories, hymns, puppet dramas and plays that brought delight to the masses, especially to the children. It is in this powerful tradition that this most recent book of sermons for children by Ruth Gilmore finds its place.To understand the heart of the evangelical Reformation one must seek to catch a glimpse of the family gathered around the hearth to listen to father or mother read from the Small Catechism or pray a prayer from Luther\`s equally popular, A Very Good and Useful Book of Prayers It is to follow evangelical theologian Argula von Grumback as she traveled to villages in Bavaria, telling stories, encouraging the role of mother as house preacher\\" and speaking about the power of baptism to eradicate the barriers of gender and class. It is to listen in on the conversation of the women who gathered with their children in the sewing rooms to read the latest pamphlet and talk about the meaning of the gospel for their daily lives.The children's sermons by Ruth Gilmore's represent a genre that fits nicely within the grass-roots movement that swept through Europe in the 16th century. The ability to capture the meaning of faith for daily life is her very special gift to the church. If the book has a weakness, it lies in an occasional lapse into sentimentality and moralizing. But the overwhelming majority of sermons are filled with realism, surprise and sheer delight, allowing the living Word to take flesh, not only in the lives of children, but in the lives of the adults who listen in. An Advent sermon, for example, calls for the children to be on \\"sharp lookout\\" (Mark 13: 32-37) for the story-teller's return through a door off the chancel. When the children are \\"distracted\\" and miss the return, they learn something profound about the watchful attitude of Advent. The meaning of repentance as \\"turning around\\" (Mark 1, 4-11) is illustrated by a walk down the aisle and an abrupt about-face, while the tearing of a sheet provides immediate insight into the meaning of a difficult passage (Heb. 10: 19-25) about the high priestly role of Jesus. The children will not soon forget their discovery of God's \\"precious gift\\" (Ps. 127) when they open the lid of the box and see themselves in a mirror.Although Sitting on the Rainbow is designed for the children's sermon time in the worship service of the congregation, there is no reason why it might not also be used in the home. Such a practice, it might be recalled, was well known in the household of Katharina and Martin Luther. It contributed in fact to one of the most powerful movements of evangelical renewal in the history of the church."},{"Title":"Riding the East Wind","review":"When I visited the Yasukuni Jinja, the shrine for Japan's fallen war heroes, in Tokyo, I was immediately drawn to the picture of the pilot with the Caucasian face among the hundreds of Japanese faces. I was saddened to read his story at the shrine of how he came to be in the Japanese army, despite his mixed blood, and how he died in service of one country that represented only half of himself while fighting against the country of his other half. I could not imagine how he must have been torn apart each day.Then I saw the same haunting picture on the cover of Riding the East Wind by Otohiko Kaga and I immediately grabbed it up. I enjoyed this book thoroughly as I was transported into the world of the man in the picture. This is an excellent book that describes the desperate situation in Japan during the war that the Japanese military caused to be inflicted on the Japanese people and the individual story of the Japanese diplomat married to an American woman and the fate of their mixed-race children.Even though I knew the eventual outcome of the war and the fate of the man in the picture, I was totally absorbed into this book."},{"Title":"Riding the East Wind","review":"&#8220;Riding The East Wind&#8221;, is not only a great story, it is also great History. From the photographs of Mother and Son on the cover, to the notes at the book&#8217;s end recording what happened to the Family and their friends after the War, this work is excellent. The translator is the award winning Mr. Ian Hideo Levy, and he has created a wonderfully readable version of Mr. Otohiko Kaga&#8217;s first book presented in English. This is a fascinating story of the days leading to the bombing of Pearl Harbor through the end of World War II. The only aspect I found very puzzling was the total lack of comment on either Hiroshima or Nagasaki. The fire bombing of the B-29 Bombers was discussed at length, and perhaps the Author felt this was enough, for the firestorms these raids often brought about literally erased cities. ....The book is a sweeping view of Japanese Culture, how they viewed themselves, their allies, and their enemies. While never mentioning the actions of the US, great irony is demonstrated as the woman on the cover was American, and while despised was not interred in a camp as Japanese were in this Country. The book speaks in depth of the actions of the Kamikaze Pilots and Submariners that many found impossible to understand. ....The Author explores citizenship based on blood, birth, and personal beliefs, together with the complexities they give rise to. Relations between Family, and romance between others is never maudlin, rather they illustrate the ability of the individual to stand alone with his or her own morality, when humanity at large has forgotten what the word means.This is a great reading experience, and I recommend it without qualification."},{"Title":"Riding the East Wind","review":"by the circumstances of his birth.This book isn't so much about how a family in Japan survived through WW2 as it is the story of a young man (Ken), half Japanese/half American during WW2. Ken fights battles throughout the novel--with himself, with fellow officers in the Japanese Army Air Corps, with ordinary citizens as a victim of mistaken identity. Ken, although he has been raised in Japan for the majority of his life has Caucasian facial features.The book is extremely well written. I found the relationships within the family to be extremely diverse. There was a focus on the father and mother, but not so much on the children (except for Ken). The diferent personalities of Ken's friends were each part of a larger picture--there were the fanatics, the artists and the ones who just wanted to survive. It was a good presentation of what makes up a nation during war.The first part of the book is about Saburo (the father) and his diplomatic efforts in the United States right before Pearl Harbor. I found this part to be particualary interesting, as it has been a matter of debate for the last several years. The issue of how much Roosevelt knew before December 7 rings especially true now.I would recommend this book to anyone. It will hold your attention for days..."},{"Title":"Riding the East Wind","review":"I read this book in the original language as a teenager many, many years ago. The plot is compelling, and the intense narrative is absolutely riveting.However, this translation basically has only the first half of the original, and the second half is summarised in but a page worth of epilogue. All the agony after the major climax and the post-war life of the family which illustrated how the family lived as a Japanese family are missing. What a pity."},{"Title":"Riding the East Wind","review":"This totally absorbing novel was written originally in 1982 as a pop novel for Japanese consumption. Now translated into English, it is the very personal, emotional story of the effects of political forces in both the U.S. and Japan on a bi-cultural family in the days leading up to World War II and its immediate aftermath. In its honest, straightforward, and completely unashamed evocation of the heartfelt feelings and conflicts of Japanese family members, people we truly come to care about, the book may be unique--we are so rarely allowed to see inside such a family and to share its joys and heartbreak. And this is truly the book's strength.The Japanese father, American mother, and their children have always been able to straddle the cultural divide, comfortable in both countries, as the father engages in his diplomatic duties. Betrayed by the Japanese hierarchy and naive to the fact that Japan has planned to attack Pearl Harbor even while his attempts to avert war are continuing with President Roosevelt, Saburo Kurushima, his American wife, and his family suddenly find themselves without an identity. Unable to accept the Japanese betrayal but obviously unable to live in the U.S., they return to Japan to try to put together some semblance of a life, additional and unlikely victims of the Pearl Harbor catastrophe. Although a book written for Japanese domestic consumption might have sugarcoated the issues which still make Pearl Harbor a living sore for Americans, Kaga's integrity and honesty are admirable here. Anyone who has enjoyed Wouk's War and Remembrance or Piercy's Gone to Soldiers will find this book a fascinating and unusual companion to those."},{"Title":"Riding the East Wind","review":"This book really gives the reader an understanding of Japan leading up to WW II and during the war.

A must read for people interested in Japan."},{"Title":"Archaeology and the religion of Israel","review":"This book is a supplement to the material treating Israelite religion in Albright's more famousFrom The Stone Age To Christianity - Monotheism And The Historical Process. Albright says his purpose 'is nothing less than the ultimate reconstruction, as far as possible, of the route which our cultural ancestors traversed in order to reach Judaeo-Christian heights of spiritual insight and ethical monotheism' (p. 4). And he meant it, with emphasis on the 'Judaeo-Christian heights' bit. The evolutionary developments are traced, but key to the focus are the contrasts between the nobilities of Yahwism and the profligate religions of other ANE cultures. These are typical sorts of romantic statements:'The most exalted emotional experiences known to man, the experiences of religious conversion and mystical union with God, are unknown in the ancient Near East outside of Israel' (p. 24)'But the God of Israel was so far superior to the gods of the pagans, both conceptually and ethically' (p. 94)'No other great religion of the past can compete with Judaeo-Christianity as a phenomenon of historical order' (p. 176)The 5 chapters run the following outline:1. 'Archaeology and the Ancient Near-Eastern Mind'Albright discusses the importance of ANE archaeology for the history of religions and 3 facets of human psychology. In the first of these he descants ancient aesthetics in art forms: graphical, musical, poetical, concluding that Israelite poetry in particular is 'curiously modern' and the exemplary ancient medium of spiritual values. The next deals with archaeology and human emotion & spirituality. Here again, in Albright's opinion, Israelite literature excels the rest (pp. 23-5.) The last investigates 3 gradations of historical human reasoning: 'prelogical, empirico-logical and logical'. Needless to say, in many respects, biblical tradition brags the preponderancy of the 2nd which outshines the rigidities of the 3rd, even today (e.g., p. 33.)2. 'The Archaeological Background of Old Testament Religion'Various relevant textual and unwritten ANE sources are scoped out for studying Israelite religion with caveats for their application in the hands of the underdisciplined or tendentious.3. 'Archaeology and the Religion of the Canaanites'Explores Canaanite mythology and practice, drawing mostly from Ugarit. The names and characteristics of a number of gods are illuminated, and from their myths a few parallels are drawn from the bible. For instance, standing behind the lament for the king of Babylon in Isa xiv.12ff is a Canaanite poem probably connected to the Canaanite deity Ashtar, the hermaphroditic morning and evening star who was ineligible to accede to the dead Baal's throne in the mythical North (see pp. 84, 86, 195 & n. 10.) But amidst all this Yahwism retains its sublimity, having chiseled away the polytheistic repugnancies.4. 'Archaeology and the Religion of Early Israel'Albright starts out investigating the social constitution of early Israel. They were 'ass-nomads' of medley origins. The Conquest of Canaan is affirmed, cultic centers and their functionaries are discussed, and there is an enlightening treatise on the Levite caste. Being a 'Levite' wasn't the monopoly of ancestral heritage, but was more of a titular office paralleled by pagan priesthoods with cognate designations. The biblical portrait of a Levite progenitor (a son of Jacob) simply isn't accurate (pp. 109-10). During the time of the judges there was sporadic paganism in Israel, and even an assimilation of Yahweh to Baal (e.g., Psalm xxix), but predictably Yahweh is unequaled, and this picture persisted into David's reign. Albright argues some psalms may be Davidic.5. 'Archaeology and the Religion of Later Israel'Preliminarily, Solomonic politics are addressed, and in the next section follows an analysis of the Solomonic Temple, its cosmic symbolism and its pagan comparisons. But the materiality of its architecture and cultic items was the only compromise. Its Yahwism remained strictly monotheistic. Only after Solomon do we find the religious syncretisms adulterating official religion and reprehended by the prophets.Much of the information here is superannuated. For example, hardly any contemporary scholar would embrace the Conquest of Joshua-Judges. It is a rare view that retrojects monotheism in Israel to the time of the judges (much less the 'Mosaic' era), and crediting the Iron II structures at Gezer, Hazor, and Megiddo to Solomon has been called into serious question. The large-scale imperial and trading policies of the united monarchy envisaged by the Deuteronomist are a matter of historical controversy. Nevertheless, tip-top in its own generation, this book has its uses as one would expect from the legendary human cache of knowledge and learning that was Albright. His erudition was immense and shows up no less in this small volume.(P.S.: this review is for the 4th edition, Westminister John Knox, updated to 1956)"},{"Title":"Archaeology and the religion of Israel","review":"I have just perused a few parts of the book.

However, that is not necessarily a waste, simply because etymology by definition traces a word back to its etymon, and, as more and more etymologists are starting to recognize, a reconstructed hypothetical word or base while it has great value in the study of comparative linguistics, is far away from being considered as an etymon.One possible snag with the book is that an average reader will not only need some knowledge of Latin but also must be able to at least read Greek, in order to follow the Latin words to their Greek etyma.This is a dictionary that must have its place in the library of a student of Latin language and/or anyone who is interested in the science of etymology."},{"Title":"An etymological dictionary of the Latin language","review":"This book is a xerox copy of a very old tome that came before the days when they knew how the Indo-European languages were related. The core assumption of this book is WRONG, that is, that Latin springs from Greek. We all know now that Greek and Latin are cousin languages which both sprang from Indo-European. This book, besides this major misconception, is riddled with errors.

Johnny Tremain slowly grows from a Prima Donna into an enthusiastic team player. Our own (Whig) leaders are flawed, human. The enemy (British & Loyalists) are human, with sympathetic aspects. Yet the Cause is just and defense of Bostonians is worth Johnny's sacrifices.Rab is Johnny's older role model with young women as with revolutionary patriotism. Steady, persevering, full of inner fire, Rab is all the older brothers and friends who volunteered early in our wars. Johnny is the younger youth inspired to follow as soon as age permits. That Forbes wrote in mid-war cannot be coincidence.Forbes' wise compassion in letting Johnny (and her young readers) experience the death of their Hero in advance of their own first taste of battle is mediated by the kind revolutionary physician Joseph Warren. Readers who research beyond the novel will learn that Dr. Warren himself would die in battle a few weeks later at Bunker Hill. The irony and poignancy of that foreknowledge colored my re-readings as a teenager. Johnny's lot is to be a soldier, not a silversmith, and the first surgery suffices him.Likewise, Forbes' tasteful handling of Johnny's successive sexual attractions to Lavinia Lyte and at last to Cilla, his former pal, shows the superiority of mature love (without preaching). \\"Spinal tingles\\" have their good place, the wise woman writes for boys in an era before the sexual revolution.This is a bildungsroman--novel of youthful formation into adulthood--that never preaches its lessons. Like Huckleberry Finn, it lures with sophisticated subtlety disguised as artless simplicity. Forbes never preaches--but do we learn!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain was an ok book for a couple of reasons. First, i HATE historical fiction! So since it was ok for me it is probably a great book for anyone that likes that sort of thing. It gives great detail and makes you feel like you are Johnny and are there in Boston during the time of revolt. It is about a 14 year old boy living in Boston during the preludes to the revolutionary war and just a tad bit into the Revolutionary War itself. He starts out as a silversmith, an awesome one at that. He is apprenticed to Mr. Lapham, an old almost senile silversmith that in his day was a really great smith But now Johnny pretty much rules the shop even though he is younger than a lot of tht other boys. He is the best, but is very arrogant. One day Mr. Hancock brings the Laphams an enormous assignment, that if done correctly could put the Laphams back on top and Mr. Hancock's sliversmith. He orders his Sugar Basin by Monday Morning early and it is about Thursday. Mr. Lapham does all of the hard stuff that Johnny has not learned yet and Johnny does the rest. By Saturday night they were almost done, except for the handles. Though Mr. Lapham is very religious and forbids work on the Basin past dark. So the next day, while Mr. Lapham is gone to church, the whole household works on the basin. Though because Johnny is so good and arroganthe has earned some enemies in the House, namely Dove. When Johnny asks for a mold. Dove hands him one with a minute crack, hoping that the silver will leak a little and cause the handle to have a minute blemish to teach Johnny a lesson. But to Dove and everyone elses surprise the mold explodes and the hot silver burns Johnny's hand. His thumb grows together with his forefinger and he can no longer be a silversmith. He goes in search of other work. When he finds Rab. A printer and a Son of Liberty. Johnny joins the revolt and is in for a world of adventure."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I teach sixth grade students who know little of the Revolutionary era.

It is not that exciting but if you like history you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I love this story. To all of the people who can't understand this story, don't write bad reviews about it. I think I could recomend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction or nonfiction. This book shows me that you shouldn't give up even if everything gives up on you. You should not give in to defeat, but pull yourself out of the depths and keep trying to live a great life. Johnny burns his hand making a sugar basin handle for American Patriot, John Hancock, on Sabbath Day, which was breaking the law and working on that day. The Laphams did not enjoy his presence so he went to Mr. Lyte. When Mr. Lyte has him arrested for theft of the cup Johnny really owns. In trial, Precilla Lapham testifys because she has seen the cup before the date Mr. Lyte said it was stolen. Johnny is proven innocent but tries to sell the cup to Lyte. Lyte takes it and gets his poor relative, Sewall, to think Johnny came to give it back. He threatens to send Johnny to Guadalope but Johnny runs out and is faster than them all. He goes to the Boston Observer and stays there with a boy a few years older, named Rab. That's about half. If you want to know what else happens, read the Newberry Award-Winning Novel, Johnny Tremain by Ester Forbes."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain is a beautifully written classic novel about a young apprentice that struggles to live in colonial Boston during the time of the American Revolution. The author, Esther Forbes is a historian and the novel is based off of historical facts and events. Louise Cowan would probably identify Johnny Tremain as a classical novel because Forbes displays her characters in a way that highlights their humanely ways, both positive and negative. Forbes creates a plot in which the main character discovers himself and grows from a proud young boy to a strong and humble man.Louise Cowan would probably describe Jonathan Lyte Tremain as a very complex character due to his lack of respect towards some and his great humility towards others. Johnny's character started out as a proud fourteen year old boy who worked as an apprentice for a skilled silversmith and ended as a humble and brave sixteen year old who sets off to fight in the American revolutionary war. A good example of how proud Johnny was as a fourteen year old is on page ten of the book when Priscilla Lapham, Johnny's friend and the granddaughter of Johnny's master says, \\"When the meek inherit the earth, I doubt Johnny gets as much as one divot of sod.\\" As Johnny grew older, he became more determined with everything he did. In the last chapter of the book, he decided to have surgery done on his right hand without any medication and with no one to hold his hand down but him, all so that he could hold a gun to fight in a war. Johnny was also always very intelligent. When he worked for Samuel Adams, James Otis, and John Hancock, he picked up information about what the British would do next from his sluggish friend Dove, who was working in a British stable at the time. Johnny Tremain had wonderful characteristics that grew so much during the two years before the revolutionary war.Johnny Tremain had values too. He valued the ability he had to use his hands in his craft and he looked down on people with lower- class work. This can be proven by his first meeting with Rab, his best friend. When Johnny first walked into the small printing shop of the Boston Observer, he saw Rab sitting there, taking notes for a newspaper piece advertising a lost pig. When the lady whose pig was lost finally left after confiding her sorrow for her animal in Rab, Johnny felt like he could confide in Rab also, even though he didn't even know Rab and he had no idea if Rab even cared. After Johnny had told him about how he had lost his job and was looking for a new one, Rab suggested that Johnny look around Hancock's Wharf ,but Johnny refused to do work that didn't involve much talent or skill such as he had had in his silversmith apprenticeship. One other thing that Johnny valued was the freedom of all men. A good example of this is on page 241 when he said, \\"We are fighting, partly, for just that, because a man is a private is no reason he should be treated like cordwood.\\"Johnny Tremain is definitely something that Louise Cowan would call a classic. She would say that Esther Forbes creates a world like ours, where life is many- sided and the people have good and bad sides to them, a world where people grow and fall, a world where life and death exist together, and where people can be good to one person and bad to another in one moment. Johnny Tremain takes its place among the many classics that I have read as a favorite."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"The time I laid eyes on the book Johnny Tremain I didn't know what to expect I thought it might be long and boring. As I read so many events happened that kept my interest, it was like no other book I've ever read before. It is a book that describes real life situations even as relating to today. The things people will do for money or rights for themselves. The conflict for taxes also that we have today. It is based in Boston at the beginning of the Revolutionary War.Merchant Lyte tried to buy the cup from Johnny. But they argued about whose cup it really was. Then the merchant told Johnny to describe the cups details. For Johnny the cup had significant meaning from his past. It represented a powerful and wealthy family and his only connection to the Lyte family.I would think it would be Johnny's cup because he made the cup. After that Johnny didn't have a safe place to put the cup but then he realized he didn't have any clothes, food nor any money. He thought if he sold the cup it would be worth 4 pounds of old silver. He seen later that the cup matched the others and it could then be worth 20 pounds of old silver. Unfortunately he didn't sell the cup instead he put the cup back in the bag but then Mr. Lapham snatched the cup with his quick fingers and said you stole this beautiful cup and told him I'll see you at court.Everyone thought Johnny stole some shoes. But Johnny bought the shoes with his own money from the silversmith job. Although he told everyone no one believed him.But since Mrs. Lyte caught him she got the sheriff. And the sheriff put shackles on Johnny and walked to the jail cell but they said nothing to each other the whole walk to the jail cell. Then when they finally got to the jail cell the sheriff asked Johnny does he have any family or friends that can cover him in court but Johnny answered Rab the sheriff asked isn't that the kid you took the coat from. Johnny didn't answer. Johnny slept well on the tiny hay bed.Sadly soon Rab died. During the first gunshots of the Revolutionary War. The British killed him before he could use the musket Johnny gave him. Rab was Johnny's friend. He would be by Johnny everyday even when Johnny needed him most. But he wasn't able to be by Johnny when he died.Rab was at Dr.Warren's house when he died. But Johnny wasn't able to get there in time to see Rab's last moments of living. Johnny slept at Dr. Warren's house and went to a town nearby.In Boston, Massachusetts,1775 British soldiers were on every corner. You see men in stockings and pants ending at their knees. Grocers, pubs and the printer. Cats in malt houses, Granaries and mansions everywhere. In stables horses were shaking their halters and whining. Sleepy women and sleepier children waking up to work. Young women swept. Streets were busy. The cocks in Boston backyards had cried long before the day came. On rocky Islands gulls woke. Fiery furnace awaited their silversmith users. Everyone worked from people along with children to animals.The British were taking too many taxes and the colonist didn't like that. So that led to the Revolutionary War. In the Battle of Lexington the colonist had 70 men when the British had 700 it was basically target practice, an unfair battle indeed. But they still had the Battle of Concord.The colonists won the Battle of Concord and became independent by separating from the British. After they won the battle of Concord. And the Battle went on for several more years. One of the strategies they used to win the war was 1 by land two by sea. And that meant 1 lantern the British are going to travel on land and 2 lanterns meant the British are traveling by sea."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This is my daughter's favorite book.

He then becomes an outcast of society. Unable to find work, he nearly sinks to theiving, but luckily stumbles upon a printer's assistant named Rab who befriends Johnny and helps him find a job. Rab is an intriguing type of fellow. He was my favorite character in this book, even though he's not the main character.Rab introduces Johnny to a wonderful world of secrecy, excitement, and intrigue with the Sons of Liberty, who are plotting America's independence from the tyrannical British government. Johnny develops into a rather likable sort of chap before the book's end. Such American immortals as Paul Revere, Sam Adams, John Hancock, and Joseph Warren are skillfully interwoven by Forbes into this delightful piece of historical fiction. I highly recommend this book to children around 12 on up but I believe it is just as enjoyable to adults. I am in my 20's and I really enjoy this book still. If you are an American history buff or simply enjoy a good book with an old-fashioned flavor, buy this book and read it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain is one of the best books I have ever read. It is the story of a fourteen-year-old silversmith's apprentice who is very talented, but a bit proud and arrogant. His life is suddenly completely changed when an accident leaves him with a maimed and useless hand, and he is unable to continue his trade. Johnny eventually befriends and older boy called Rab, and is thrown into the fear and excitement surrounding the Revolution when he begins working for a rebel newspaper, The Boston Observer. Although this is a wonderful and masterfully written book, I thouroughly warn teachers against assigning it to their History or Social Studies class. Kids either really love it, or really despise it, and some parts are a bit dragged out."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Cocky, insecure Johnny Tremain remains on of my favorite fictional people. And his book remains one of my favorite stories. A few reasons why:The characterizations in this book are wonderful. No one is painted in strictly black and white. Even the apparent villains have their good qualities.The setting, as well, is fascinating and well-researched. Esther Forbes did, after all, win a Pulitzer Prize for history. She knew what she was describing and presented it well. The whole book has a great &quot;you-are-there&quot; quality.I first read Johnny Tremain in the sixth grade and must have read it twenty times in a row (mostly skipping the ending, which is sad). Then I got out the encyclopedia and read the article on the American Revolution. Now I'm majoring in history."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This children's book won the 1944 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. It is regarded by many as being a landmark in the development of historical fiction for children and should be on the shelf of any serious student of children's literature. The story centers around a couple of years in the life of a young silversmith apprentice, Johnny Tremain (or, Jonathan Lyte Tremain) in Boston near the start of the American Revolution. At the beginning of the novel, it is 1773 and a fourteen-year-old Johnny, who is very good in his work but is also excessively proud and arrogant, has an accident when working on the Sabbath when a crucible of molten silver breaks. His right hand is severely burned and he feels he can no longer become a silversmith. He begins to roam throughout Boston with despair and finally obtains a job at one of the Boston newspapers. There he comes in contact with some of the early heroes of the revolution: John Hancock, Sam and John Adams, Paul Revere, Dr. Warren, etc. Johnny, and the reader, see the events leading up to the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 and the very start of the Revolutionary War at the Battle of Lexington and Concord in April of 1775. I read this book a second time when I was in my 50s and it is still great to read. And, reading the comments of the other reviewers, it is apparent that most of today's young adults like it as much as I did in the late 1950s. And, it is so much better than the Disney film."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"When I went to read this book for school, my older brother said, &quot;Oh yeah, I read that and it was real good up to the part where he burned his hand, but after that it was real boring.&quot; Well, as usual, I have to disagree with my ignorant brother who totally missed all of the great character development that Johnny goes through as a result of his injury. Reading this book is like having a ringside seat at the opening battle of the Revolutionary War. We studied the American Revolution in Social Studies right after I read Johnny Tremain and I could just picture Rab standing there on the Lexington Green, facing down all those British officers on horseback with that gun he loved so much. Rab was like my brother: always looking for something violent and gross to get involved in. You'll see what happens to him (not that my brother was probably paying attention.) I felt the sorriest for Pumpkin. I think he would have been very happy as an American if he'd only been given the chance. Overall, I'm glad we won the war. I guess we have guys like Rab to thank for that. God bless America!!!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"JOHNNY TREMAIN is not an easy read though it is a worthwhile one. The book was first published in 1943 (think that was during World WarII!) so it may seem a bit dated to the youngest readers but the well realized setting of Revolutionary War era Boston and Johnny's many adventures stand up to time. Forbes writing style is not difficult to follow once the reader or listener is engaged with the story though the vocabulary she uses is quite advanced for a book purported to be at the fifth grade reading level. And the book can be rather detailed especially in regards to some of the finer points of 18th century silversmithing. Yet I despair of the readers who give this a one star review saying it has no plot! The book is extremely rich in plot, characterization, historical detail, adventure etc. Consider it as a read aloud if you are a teacher or parent whose kids just can not \\"get into it\\". They will be pleasantly surprised once they meet Johnny and the other residents of colonial Boston."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Esther Forbes' award-winning novel of a youth caught up in the turmoil of the American Revolution is a timeless classic that today's parents can enjoy again with their kids.

The book draws you to its beautifully crafted and placed words; alongside the way it makes you feel involved.In Johnny Tremain, a young teenage boy named Johnny Tremain serves as an apprentice to an old silversmith with 2 other useless boys. He becomes arrogant, and bosses the other apprentices around, igniting hatred towards him. He then accidentally burns his hand with hot silver while making a sugar basin and his thumb becomes connected to his palm with silver. He searches for new work, as he cannot work as a silversmith with his crippled hand. He then works for the Silsbees as a newspaper delivery boy, and finds himself at home with them. He also finds himself getting involved with the Revolutionary War and its leaders, and tries to help despite his hand.I think Johnny Tremain is a must read book for both young and old. It will grab your attention as it did mine, and keep it until you finish the book. And even then, you will read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain is a historical book about the Revolutionary War, focusing on a young silversmith named Johnny. Johnathon Lyte Tremain is a slilversmith apprentice to the Lapham family, in Boston Massachussets. He is a cocky young man, and believes that the world revolves around him. He is rude to the Lapham family, who took him in when he was young and believes he is the best silversmith in town. One day, when an order comes into the shop, Johnny is working on it when he has a terrible accident, which leaves his hand crippled from a bad burn. Since he is no longer able to become a silversmith, the Lapham family decides he is no longer worth the keep, and kicks him out. While he is wandering about the streets, Johnny gets into some trouble which scars his name and ruins part of his reputation. Since he is no longer the center of attention, he is left to fend for himself. While strolling through the streets of Boston, he meets a boy named Rab, just a bit older than him. They quickly become friends and Johnny scores a job at the Boston Observer (Rab works there too), (a newspaper printing company). But as the British become more demanding than ever, Johnny and Rab wind up getting involved with the Sons of Liberty, and take part in momentus historical moments. When Rab goes off to fight for the Patriots, Johnny can't help feel lonely without his presence. After a sudden death, Johnny's life will change forever, and at last, his life will feel renewed.I believe that Johnny Tremain was a good book in the sense that it is extremely good for learning history. When you are reading (or at least in my experience), it really feels like you are in Boston during the colonial times. It also had exciting moments that were suspenseful and thrilling. Like times where you might say, \\"ahh! What's going to happen next!\\" But I understand why some of my friends didn't like the book very much. For younger readers it's hard to understand, and at a lot of moments, you might be confused....but overall, in the end the story comes together to make a thrilling novel that deserves a sequel.- Sophia - Grade 5"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I must admit, this book is EXTREAMLY well written, Esther Forbes portrayed the characters and events really well. But sometimes it doesn't always matter how well-written a book is (I hope you know what I mean by \\"well-written\\"), because there's also a story line that is to be needed. and I must say, this one drags.For some reason I did enjoy the chapter: THE FIDDILERS BILL. That, and the ending chapter A MAN CAN STAND UP, seemed to have captured me. But the rest wasn't so \\"exciting\\", but instead boring to where the paragraphs couldnt be any longer. It was givin to me as a reading test in History class, where we had to read it, and answere questions on what happened in each chapter.Other students agreed that it was extensivly boring so I'm not the only one who belives so. Even when I tried to get interested in it, I just couldn't, so I tried to like it, but the story line doesn't seem to go anywhere; it takes too much time to get exciting. And I personally like diolag, but this book is full of too much explaining about his feelings, and whats going on, instead of talking, which really irritated me (I guess thats why I 'liked' THE FIDDILERS BILL).So basically, I would most definatly recommend this book to Revolutionary War and way way back then History lovers (they will get hooked on it). But as for people who like action, and fun . . . well - No! Maybe the fact that I got forced and stressed to read it (and under a certain amount of time), I didn't like it too much.

So even thought he can't be a silversmith anymore, he still is very talented.In the book, you'll read about many famous people you have probably heard about, like Paul Revere, and other famous things that happened like The Boston Tea Party. You'll see who was a part of the Boston Tea Party and the group of boys that dressed up like Indians and used fake tomahawks to break open the boxes of tea.The book is very exciting because you get to see what the revolutionary war was like, even if you were just a young boy.

Esther Forbes portrays the characters vividly, maybe even overstating them at times, and logically describes the setting. In her novel, she explains factual events, (e.g. the Boston Tea Party, the Boston Observers' Meetings, and the Battle of Lexington at Concord) that led to the Revolutionary War. The reader follows Johnny's life from his adolescence to adulthood. When Johnny was younger, his mother gave him a family heirloom, a goblet, before she passed away. Johnny's mother belongs to a well-known family and he believes that he belongs to the \\"Merchant Lyte\\" lineage. The reader follows Johnny's journey to become part of this new family and goes through the obstacles he faces, as well.Each chapter is fairly long, but the book is worth the read in the end. I was disappointed at how dull the book is, especially since I find history textbooks more attention-grabbing than Johnny Tremain. Although there are a few scenes that Forbes leaves her readers in suspense, the rest is uninteresting to me. If this book were lying on a bookshelf at my school library, I would not pick it to read at my own leisure. I rate Johnny Tremain 3 out of 5 stars and recommend this book to avid history readers.

Johnny has an accident, and his thumb becomes fused to his palm on his right hand. from thereon, johnny is a streetrat until he meets Rab, who is a Son of Liberty. The Lytes are loyalists so they get into quite a bit of trouble. Rab dies in the end. I think this is a good book if you aren't forced to read it like I am. Otherwise, its actually a good book for learning about the revolution. I don't reccomend it to those who like comedy books or fantasy, because there's no comedy, and it's based on actual events."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain was a book about revoloutionary New England. This book was not only about the struggle of the new world, but also of a young boy named Jonathan Lyte Tremain. This boy, who lost his parents to death, was a silversmith's apprentice, and an extraordinary one at that.I read this book because I have always liked historical fictions, and this book is one that I would add to my list of favorites. The theme of this book is summed up in a single quote \\"A man can stand up.\\" If you believe in something, you should stick with it and stand up to any challanges, this is what Johnny did. When the world turned its back on him he kept trying, and he never gave up.

And when I first saw it I (being a 7th Grader) thought 'another 300 page boring historical fiction novel'. But immediately when i started to read this book i got hooked! I was never a big fan of learning about the American Revolution, but now that i have read this book I want to find out more and more about it. It brought it to life with characters that I could identify with and put me right in the middle of the action of the Boston Tea Party and the Battles of Lexington and Concord. It also worked in famous Whigs like Sam Adams and John Hancock and Paul Revere into the story to make for an action-filled adventure through the past. This is a must read for all young readers and adults alike. I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Hard-to-follow, not too exciting, and it dragged. Forbes' novel is slow-paced and un-realistic. Although it stated great moments in history, the characters are too involved. Johnny is a teenage apprentice, and then he is in war dealing with some of the top revolutionary leaders. Set in revolutionary time, the characters are living in a perfect world and doing ordinary things in the beginning of the book. Then, there is a large leap in the middle of the book and the character's are in war. The book would be much better if the author concentrated on making fictional parts seem more realistic. In that time, people were not as happy-go-lucky. I would recommend this book to people who like a boring historical fiction book."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

The book also gives you a better idea on what life was like during colonial times. This book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This book's title is Johnny Tremain, written by Esther Forbes, which got a 3 star rating from me.Johnny Tremain is about a poor boy named Johnny Tremain who works for a silversmith. He injures his hand making a special sugar basin. Then while looking for work he meets a boy named Rab. After having no luck finding work, he remembers that his mother had said that he was related to the merchant Mr. Lyte. When he tries to reveal his relation, Mr. Lyte accuses him of stealing the cup from his home and takes him to court. Luckily Johnny had shown his cup to Cilla Lapham before the date of the robbery. So he was found innocent of the crime. But later in his time of need he tries to sell the cup back to Merchant Lyte, but Mr. Lyte steals the cup from him.After this horrible event, Johnny gets a job with his new friend Rab as a horse boy. Getting this job gave him a place to live, people to clothe and feed him. While working for Rab's Uncle Lorne, he starts to get involved with The Sons of Liberty. Although Johnny was too young to be a son himself, he was still allowed to help. Johnny's main job was to blow a whistle to alert the Sons whether to go and dump the tea off the ships or too go home. Then Sam Adams had signaled to go in for the attack on the ships. I don't really want to give away the entire story though, you'll have to see for yourself what happens if you're interested. I gave this book a 3 star score because for me it wasn't all that great to read all the time. But besides that it is a good book to read in your spare time.Some other titles I'd like to recommend would be Number the Stars, The Tale of Desperaux, and Maniac Magee. My name is Marquis and I'm 11 years old. I hope that you'll really enjoy the book Johnny Tremain. I enjoyed it myself and I might look for other books by Esther Forbes, maybe you could too."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Even before his mother died Johnny knew what he wanted to be, a silversmith. The last thing she did for him before she died was to apprentice him to a silver maker. His mother had given him a silver cup the, this cup was the reason he wanted to be a silver maker, he wanted terribly to make things like it. Johnny Tremain is a book full ofThe characters Johnny encounters are all unique and original. Johnny and his dying mother came to Boston so Johnny could fulfill his dream of becoming a silversmith, the master silversmith, Mr. Lapham would teach him everything he needed to know about silver making, along with being a master silversmith Mr. Lapham was also a deacon, and a very pious one at that, he lived with his daughter-in-law and her four daughters, one of them Cilla, a girl of Johnny's age, who is kind and brave. Johnny was a hard working boy before his terrible accident, spilling molten silver on his hand, crippling it.The story is a real page turner. One of the most exciting parts occurred right after Johnny's accident was left with a terrible dilemma, the Laphams are not a rich family and could not afford to have Johnny stay without doing silver work, Mr. Lapham, being the pious man that he is could not bear to put Johnny out on the street, though it was well understood that Johnny was to begin looking for work right away. Johnny is embarrassed by his crippled hand and tries not to show it to anyone, but when the youngest Lapham daughter yelled at Johnny and told him how ugly it was. This was to much for Johnny, who left the house for good. Another suspenseful part happened when Johnny was out on the street, alone. Johnny Tremain's life is full of anticipation goes to Mr. Lyte, who his mother told Johnny he was related to, Mr. Lyte tricks Johnny into his home, he sues Johnny for stealing \\"his\\" silver cup, actually the one that Johnny's mother gave him. Johnny comes out the winner because of a lack of evidence on the part of Mr. Lyte.Historical events filled the pages of Johnny Tremain, although most main characters were fictional Johnny did encounter many real revolutionaries, such as Sam Adams and Paul Revere, Johnny also took part in many historical events, the Boston Tea Party, the Sons of Liberty, and the early battles of the Revolutionary War. When Paul Revere asked for Johnny's help to spread the word that the British were coming, Johnny does so willingly. Another historical part of the book took place because Johnny finally finds work at an anti British newspaper, his friend and coworker Rab later goes off to fight at Lexington, word is slow to travel and Johnny does not know if her friend made it through the battle. Johnny latter meets Rab, he is seriously injured and passes quickly after he sees Johnny. At the very end of the Johnny's story he is preparing for surgery on his crippled hand so that he can fight for freedom.Johnny Tremain was a great book, because it took place in the late seventeen hundreds it was full of historical information, it was also suspenseful and was full of great characters. I would recommend Johnny Tremain to anyone who is looking for a great book, probably on a middle school reading level.C.

His friend, Rab, lets him use his horse, Goblin. Goblin is a very rough horse and Johnny learns how to ride him very quickly which is amazing because most excellent horse riders can't even ride him. So even thought he can't be a silversmith anymore, he still is very talented.In the book, you'll read about many famous people you have probably heard about, like Paul Revere, and other famous things that happened like The Boston Tea Party. You'll see who was a part of the Boston Tea Party and the group of boys that dressed up like Indians and used fake tomahawks to break open the boxes of tea.The book is very exciting because you get to see what the revolutionary war was like, even if you were just a young boy.

He believed in the Yankees and found himself unable to attain his position because of an accident. Rab is more of the take action for freedom type of character. He meets Johnny because of the newspaper both boooys woek for. They are so different in personality, that you'd never believe either of them could stand each other. The struggle for freedom, most likely, overcomes their differences. Johnny and Rab take on life-threatening mission because they share a belief for freedom.Johnny Tremain basically describes teh fight that the Yankees fought in order t live in peace and to live freely. That story intertwines with these young boys' lives. It tells about the struggles that families had to take on, and the hardships they lived through. Many other boys like Johhny and Rab's age also fought for what they believed in. This wasn't an easy time in the United State's history. People were forced to decide what \\"side\\" they would fight for. Men adn women became blinded to what they really stood for. Despite these select people, others did struggle in the battle for freedom from England. This story describes this event in time and discusses the life of Jonathan Lyte Tremain.Personally, I believe that Esther Forbes did an amazing job developing the character of Johnny Tremain. Rab was a more under-developed character. He didnt' have as much thoughts of ideas as Johnny did. This is a spot where Esther should have put a little more work into. Rab could have been more discussed all over. This is just about the only character development flaw that Esther Forbes created while writing Johnny Tremain. She did an astoundig job in every other aspect of writing this book.

My guess is that perhaps there was a shortage of quality book [sic]. This book is painfuly [sic] bad.\\"That's from a student writing a thesis! Another difference between today and the time Johnny Tremain was written: back then, college students could write a decently constructed sentence."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"What makes Johnny Tremain so intriguing is the way it weaves the fictional life of Johnny Tremain to the real-life situations of colonial America. It somehow brings to life the viewpoints of average people during the pre-war period, while keeping up with adolescent pressures with romance and finding a place in life. All the characters are well developed. For me, the only major setback of this book is the drag in some parts. For example, even though I could vividly imagine the Lapham's home, the early descriptions of the home were not really needed, as the majority of the story did not take place there. Other than that, it is a solid read, good for anyone interested in the American Revolution. In fact, I remember watching the Simpsons one time, and there was an episode where Bart had to read Johnny Tremain- and liked it, quoting \\"they should call this book Johnny's Deformed Hand.\\" If even TV's worst child read the book and got some knowledge out of it, can't everyone?"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This is fascinating historical fiction, for Esther Forbes has seamlessly woven a good Colonial yarn about an aspiring apprentice silversmith into the tapestry of New England's grievances, which culminated in the American Revolution. One could almost believe that Johnny--quick, bright, cocksure, ambitious--actually lived and rubbed shoulders with the brilliant and fervent Boston patriots: Paul Revere, John Hancock, Sam and John Adams.What a wonderful parallel read for English-History classes, which will definitely appeal to boys (who crave literary action). The hero is an impoverished youth who loses his job and ultimately his place in a modest craftsman's home when he burns his hand beyond folk healing. He struggles to find a new position, new friends and a sense of self-worth, since his silver dream is shattered. But Johnny also undertakes a personal quest--a legacy from his poor mother: to be recognized by a wealthy merchant's family as a direct heir. But was this spirited and talented fellow meant to be a nobleman? Ultimately he learns to value nobility of the Heart.Gradually war clouds loom over disgruntled Boston, changing Johnny's outlook and refining his American loyalty in a crucible of patriotic hope--fired by James Otis' empassioned oratory. For the coming Revolution will stand as a beacon to oppressed people the world over, even back in &quot;mother&quot; England! Johnny learns to curb his temper (somewhat) as he comes of age and suddenly performs a Man's job by defending his values in perilous times. An excellent read which will hold your interest because of the intensely personal storyline plus true historical detail. This book makes you proud to be Yankee born!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain, a story of a talented silversmith with a cocky, I-am-better-than-everyone-else attitude. This story takes place in colonial Boston, in the time of the Revolutionary War. Johnny Tremain, a young apprentice of a family \\"the Lapham's\\" has a skill for being a silversmith. IN the family there lives Mr. Lapham the grandfather of Madge, Dorcus, Cilla, and Isannah. One day, while prideful Johnny was working in the smithing areas trying to complete a silver sugar basin for rich Mr. John Hancock his rival apprentice, Dove, tried to teach Johnny a lesson. The marshmallow like Dove gave Johnny the broken crucible as revenge. Little did he know that this incident was to ruin Johnny's life. It changed and deformed Johnny's hand making two of his fingers stick together. This incident banned Johnny from silversmith and pretty much everything forever. This also puts down Johnny's confidence and makes him more aware of his surroundings. This badly told story by Esther Forbes is badly written with several grammar and punctuation mistakes. Also, it is very unclear in some parts that are very important and correspond to the main part of the story. Later in the story, while Johnny is looking for a new hobby, he meets Rab. Rab, whose uncle owns the printing shop, becomes Johnny's new companion and offers Johnny a job there as a rider. When Johnny goes to Jonathan Lyte, the merchant kicks him out. When he finds out about Johnny's cup, he asks to see it. Johnny tells Rab about his visit to Merchant Lyte and finds out that Merchant Lyte is a traitor. When Johnny takes his cup, Merchant Lyte accuses him of stealing it and has him arrested. With the help of Rab and through Cilla's testimony, Johnny is freed. He then takes up Rab's offer to be a rider for the Boston Observer.Meanwhile in the story and important battle is going on in Lexington. Mrs. Forbes does an atrocious job of describing to people who have no background in that area what is going on. Johnny meets with important leaders such as John Hancock, Paul Revere and Sam Adams to talk about the Boston Tea Party. Johnny takes part in the Boston Tea Party there and then he meets up again with the one who ruined his life, Dove. The conflict in the story seems to be Johnny trying to find himself, the aloof, shy nobody, or the strong, confident apprentice. Johnny works with Cilla and figures out through research and his supposed aunt Lavinia Lyte that the Merchant Lyte is his uncle. Johnny lives through this part showing more about Johnny's character and that he is a strong person on the inside. As Rab and Johnny's connection grows tighter Rab decides to leave to join the Minute Men to fight in Lexington which makes sense because Rab is from Lexington. Johnny is devastated but makes it through because it's Rab's dream and Johnny is a good friend. This is the climax of the story because Johnny has to live on his own and not have Rab there for support. In the war Rab gets wounded and Johnny's life is crushed but he is assured that Rab is a strong man and that he can make it through. Alas, Rab dies from loss of blood, but Johnny learns to move on, and that is the best part of all. For the solution is that Johnny finally finds his true self. Overall, this book is more about American History than just fiction. This book was a major disappointment to me because in chapters and big chunks of the book you could understand what was going on. Also, what majorly turned me off was this, when the book ended usually I feel sad when it ended because I feel attached to the characters, even the rude ones. They usually grow on me. With this book, I was glad it was over, it was a drag. The characters never really connected with me the way I wanted them to. All I have left to say is, good bye Johnny Tremain, and good riddance."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain is an old book, but still loved by kids today!I read this with my \\"historical fiction class\\" (ages 12-16).

It won the 1944 Newbery Medal.This is an historical fiction novel that takes place in Massachusetts in late 1700s before the American Revolution. Although the character of 14 year-old Johnny Tremain is a fictional hero, Forbes weaves many genuine historical figures throughout the story, including: Paul Revere, General Thomas Gage, Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Doctor Joseph Warren, Governor Thomas Hutchinson, John Pitcairn, Francis Smith, Josiah Quincy II, and James Otis, Jr.At the outset, orphaned Johnny Tremain is working as a silversmith's apprentice. He shows real promise and skill in his craft but, unfortunately, one of his hands is burned by molten silver. Unable to perform the delicate work any longer because of his injured hand, he is forced to find another trade that he can learn. He is steadfast in trying to find skilled labour but is unable to find someone that is willing to employ him, so he takes a job delivering newspapers on horseback for the Boston Observer which is run by the Silsbee family. He learns that secret meetings are being organized by the Silsbees and are being attended by local businessman known as the Sons of Liberty. Johnny participates in the Boston Tea Party which is organized by the Sons of Liberty, and he also aids Paul Revere in warning the Minutemen that the British soldiers are coming.Forbes goes into great detail describing the Boston Tea Party, the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Paul Revere's Ride, and the political differences between the Whigs and the Tories. For the most part, my 9 year-old remained engaged in the story even through the lengthy historical narratives. We all loved Johnny Tremain and the fictional story lines, and it was nice to see Johnny's growth in maturity as a result of what he went through.Overall, we really enjoyed the story.

When he maims his hand, he is forced to find another profession and home. Slowly, he gets involved with the local patriots who want to free America from Britain. The author does know her history and she brings life to the story. The author, Esther Forbes Hamilton, certainly knows details and writes about life in colonial times.The book has a slow start for me which is one of the reasons that I deducted a star. But the Disney film certainly didn't do the story justice. It was one dimensional film about Johnny Tremain. In this historical fictional account, Johnny Tremain's life and history come alive even slowly. The novel is about 300 pages long and it can help students or young readers identify with Johnny's struggle and his heroics. Johnny becomes a likable character after all.The author deserved the Newbery Medal for the book itself. The author has done a superb job in creating Johnny Tremain's life in colonial times in Boston, Massachusetts. She has captured the life, history, and the world of the time period. This knowledge takes years of research before internet. The author has done a remarkable job in making history exciting and worth reading especially for the younger readers who might resist at first.I highly recommend this historical novel in covering the American literature and the events of the Boston Tea Party, the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and the world of colonial Boston seen through the eyes of teenage Johnny Tremain."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I read this book as part of an 8th grade English/Literature/Reading class assignment.

He is befriended by a kind boy, Rab, and together they are able to earn money by caring for horses. The job allows the boys to come into contact with British soldiers and to obtain secret information the boys can then pass on to the revolutionaries.I wasn't as satisfied with the story as I'd thought I'd be. The characters, especially those who were actual people from history, felt flat, one-dimensional. Johnny seemed too prideful, too selfish, too judgmental for a reader to love, to serve as a main character.

Forbes writing style is not difficult to follow once the reader or listener is engaged with the story though the vocabulary she uses is quite advanced for a book purported to be at the fifth grade reading level. And the book can be rather detailed especially in regards to some of the finer points of 18th century silversmithing. Yet I despair of the readers who give this a one star review saying it has no plot!

Children can relate with Johnny and can understand what it may have been like for a boy his age to make the decision to join in the battle for independence.

He begins as an apprentice for a silversmith, and he meets the girl he is to marry there. Then a burn cripples his hand to the point where he cannot work with silver anymore.

The book is written by a woman of the late 1800's and about half the 1900's. She had written many books, but until her two famous books were released, her books were not well known. The book that got her well known, which was the one just before Johnny Tremain, was a true biography of Paul Revere who was also a very important character in Johnny Tremain). Soon after, she wrote her Newberry Award winning novel Johnny Tremain.Johnny Tremain became popular, for it was one of few books which were successfully written as an exciting story, that stayed within historical fact.

The story opens when Johnny Tremain is a young fourteen-year old boy and his mother has just died. However, before his mother has died, he was given a silver cup. This cup signified that he was a member of the Lyte family, which meant that he was related to the rich and famous merchant Lyte. After his mother's death, he signed up with a silversmith as an apprentice. Johnny as a young apprentice, showed much promise of becoming an accomplished silversmith. Another apprentice, jealous of Johnny's skill, caused him to be terribly burned by molten silver, and as a result, Johnny's right hand became useless. When Johnny was working, he asked another apprentice to get him a silver melting pot. Being jealous, he gave him a broken one, which then spilled molten silver onto Johnny. In time, Johnny becomes a paper delivery boy, becomes a messenger and spy for the Sons of Liberty, and spends some of his time with some of the most famous leaders of the Revolutionary War. Besides covering pre-war historical events and Boston's political climate, this book gives its readers glimpses into 18th century medicine, Boston's legal system, religion, newspaper publishing, literacy, treatment of children working as apprentices and servants, and the broad differences between the upper and lower classes."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Every once in a while, an author publishes a really good book that actually has something to learn from it. Inevitably, teachers seize the oppurtunity and force kids to read it.I just came out of the 8th grade exhausted. My English class had spent over 6 months on Johnny Tremain! My teacher practically ripped the book apart, so that every single one of her students could recite the 47 themes in Chapter 5 (such as a routine to to the well actually being a lifelong journey of hope). This teacher had been using Johnny Tremain so long, she could actually RECITE THE FIRST CHAPTER! And the chapters are not very small at all.Anyway, after school was over, I picked up my copy again. I was hooked. It was actually fun reading the book when I didn't have to note the conflicts between Johnny and Rab in Chapter 9. The story is very well written, and it teaches important lessons about life today as well as in the 18th century. My only gripe is that it seems that Esther Forbes tried to write a book that was pretty much a compilation of every other coming of age story. People don't have &quot;growing up realizations&quot;, girl troubles, freindship disputes, family trouble, a burnt hand, and a national revolution all in the same week!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Unlike most books, this one started out with pizzaz and was interesting from the very beginning. The end (or mostly the second half of this book) was dull, dumb, lifeless, boring, ambigous, and altogether a terrible read. I forced myself to finish it and found myself asleep with the book on the floor next to me quite often. If the beginning of this book wasn't so good I would give this book a one star rating, which it doesn't even deserve. For those looking for historical fiction wrapped in drama and excitement you won't find it here."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"It has a good plot, but the book overal was boring!

It is a classic for a reason. The settings and characters are richly described and totally believable.It's an entertaining story, and your children will REMEMBER it. Several moving speeches about mankind's thirst for liberty.It won a Newbery in 1943, just like all Newberys, it seems to push the envelope. I noticed three things:1) The beginning of the book is very heavy on how God's! Punishment! is! Falling! on! Johnny! in! Payment! for! his! Sin! of! Pride! This drum is beaten over and over.2) The Sons of LIberty (Hancock, Revere, Adams and the gang) are shown as deliberately provoking the British into outrageous acts, in order to bring about their desired end: war.3) Plenty of language that we as a family shy away from repeating. Examples: sluts, hell-for-leather, plenty of swearing-to-God, damned Yankee (many times), damned (many times), hell (as an interjection). Anyway, I read aloud to my kids, and I can edit those out.Update ***** The binding of my book (the soft-cover pictured) disintegrated the second time through the book. Too bad."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"The book Johny Tremain was a hard book for me to get into simply because the subject matter does not interest me in any way. That doesn't mean I think it is a horrible book though. This book is well written and filled with a great deal of historical information. The book also has a lesson to it and that is, don't be arrogant because you never know what might happen.This book is like caviar. Even though I find caviar to be quite gross, many people find it amazing and are willing to spend a lot of money for it,because it is their acquired taste. That's how I describe Johny Tremain.

I'm an advanced reader for my age, and the old English vocabulary is hard for me to tackle. The plot is mostly boring, but there are some exciting parts, such as the Boston Tea Party. There isn't really a plot line, so you never know where Esther Forbes is going next with the story. In other reviews, people have said that its really boring in the beginning, but gets better at the end. This is true in the beginning, but I'm past the middle of the book and this has not changed.

The book is one of that sort of historical fiction that seems sickeningly contrived, attempting against all better literary judgement to pack in extra \\"historical facts\\". In style, it most resembles one of those unhappy nursery stories that we tell to disobedient children in order to make them feel guilty and scared and turn from their wicked ways. In the process, characters are created whom readers have no empathy for, whose sole purpose is to make us vow never to be as stupid as they are. It makes readers wish they would just drop off the face of the planet before we have to hear anything more about them. Not only that, but the story is not even accurate to history or human nature; its unconditional portrayal of Americans as heroic men and women (except, of course, the contemptibly immoral main characters) and villification of every last action of the British create an unbalanced perspective which seems rather wrong to teach to children. I vote to remove this book from every required reading list known to man. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. This concludes our merciless pounding of this dreadful work of literature (if you can call it that with a straight face)."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"No one needs night time medicines anymore!

I don't mind books about history; I don't mind reading, and believe me, I WANTED to enjoy it. But by the time I got done the first chapter, I knew this book was horrible, yet I continued to read it. I did not HAVE to read it, I could have just gotten the answers from someone else, but I read it anyway. This book was horrible. It was unrealistic and had almost nothing at all to do with history. The plot line (if you could actually call \\"that\\" a plot line) had nothing to do with anything, the so called adventures this dumb Johnny Tremain kid got himself into were things that would never ever happen EVER. It had nothing to do with anything in history and tried to drift more of your attention to this dumb kid who got some stupid silver cup stolen. It was the most boring book I have ever read.If you are actually considering buying this... PLEASE for the sake of your poor kids or students or whomever, RECONSIDER. If you want to buy them something educational or something that portrayals early American life, DO NOT buy this. I forced myself to be bored with this dumb book about three quarters of the way through, and then I could not take it anymore. There was nothing I found remotely interesting; I would not force my worst enemy to read this book. It would be more fun and interesting watching someone pick the lint of their socks.If one was not the lowest number I would rate this book a zero, it deserves a negative 200, but that would draw too much attention to a book so dumb it does not deserve ANY attention. I feel so strongly about this that I am actually wasting my summer to come and type this to help prevent some poor soul from going through the torture I went through. Why this book won a Newberry metal, I don't know, something seriously went wrong, but look at the other books on that list... SHILOH? I personally think that someone was held at gunpoint to actually PUBLISH this book.Don't waste your time with this waste of paper. Incase you are wondering, I got a 98 on that test without even reading a lot of the book and the other parts I actually did read I was too busy banging my head into the wall or falling asleep, the only thing that stopped me from shredding this book in the Garbage disposal or a cuisinart was that I might break one of them on this useless [book] and that I would not pay the school even 10 cents for this horribly written garbage."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"While both my parents and my parent's friends are always raving about this book, i find a good many things that bother me.

I was like oh great a boring historical book, but it is really interesting. It's about Johnny Tremain, a craftsboy who is the best at his craft, but an accident ruins his future as a professional craftsman. Being an indentured servant, he has to leave and find new work. In a plot with twists and turns, Johnny finds himself in the middle of the Revolution. In the book Johnny finds out that friends are the most important thing and finds love where he never thought it existed. A very good story with a big surprise and adventure filled plot to a bitter-sweet ending."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain was a book about revoloutionary New England. This book was not only about the struggle of the new world, but also of a young boy named Jonathan Lyte Tremain. This boy, who lost his parents to death, was a silversmith's apprentice, and an extraordinary one at that.I read this book because I have always liked historical fictions, and this book is one that I would add to my list of favorites. The theme of this book is summed up in a single quote \\"A man can stand up.\\" If you believe in something, you should stick with it and stand up to any challanges, this is what Johnny did. When the world turned its back on him he kept trying, and he never gave up.

Read for pleasure though and the book is not too bad. I really enjoyed the book's descriptions of Boston and the activities of the Whigs. The story of the lead character also gives an interesting glimpse into the life of apprentice workers during the pre-Revolution. This novel also does well with historical accuracy considering that it is written for younger readers and that much of the best research on the American Revolution wasn't available on a wide scale till after 1975. The historical backdrop for the story contributes greatly to the reader's interest as well. I recommend this book as an interesting read and for good entertainment value."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I use this book as a novel study with my fifth grade students, and every year it is a favorite. The kids get so emotionally involved in Johnny's world, and they come to see the important figures of the Revolution (Paul Revere, Sam Adams, James Otis, etc.) as their personal friends, not just names in a Social Studies book. This year I took my class on a trip to Boston, and they were thrilled to see the places Johnny saw. The book is challenging reading, but it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I enjoyed this book.

There is plenty of DRAMA!This is a moving, well-written story about a young boy in a turbulent time in history, his role in the war and his eventual self discovery.

The story starts out slow, but then starts to progress. My favorite character in the book is Johnny Tremain because he reminds me a lot of myself. He is a boy about my age that I can relate to in many ways. The setting of the story is just before the Revolutionary War. Almost all of Johnny's actions and decisions are related to the setting. Johnny participates in the Boston Tea party which was a main factor in how the war started. I recommend this book for kids who are in sixth or seventh grade.

It is a good book, but for '90s readers, I am sad to say, perhaps not the best choice. Historically it is both accurate and informative. At times it is exciting, but overall, if today's readers are told it is a suspenseful book, they are bound to be disappointed. In 1943, when it was published and received the Newbery Medal, it was undoubtedly popular with young teenage boys. I recommend it only for adults and YA's who enjoy history.

Although I note some of the young people who have reviewed it here thought it was boring, my brother and sister and I were transported right back to the Revolutionary War days and hung on every word.

She described Boston Massachusetts through the eyes of 14 year-old Johnny Tremain. The description was so good that I could even picture it in my head. The cobblestone streets, horses everywhere, open-air markets, and the water pump in the middle of the street, etc. I was all very well described.In the story, Johnny Tremain is a silversmith apprentice to Mr. Lapham. He has great skill and promise. He has a great future ahead of him until one day when a silly trick by a fellow apprentice destroys it all. He takes a new job as a newspaper boy.Johnny joins the \\"Sons of Libert\\" and becomes a fellow whig(rebels) along with other famous men such as John Hancock, John Adams, Samuel Adams, etc. In the story, the \\"Sons of Liberty\\" were the ones that attacked the ships and dumped thousands of dollars worth of valuable tea into Boston Harbor. This is known as the Boston Tea Party.Then cames the Revolutionary War. Johhny's friend Rab joined the minutemen. Rab worked with Johnny as a newpaper boy for the \\"Boston Observer.\\" They shared the same attic and became close friends.I think that this was a great book.

In this historic novel,a young silversmith apprentice,Johnny, gets caught up in the Revolutionary War against the British. After burning his hand as a silversmith's apprentice, Johnny is hired to deliver a popular newspaper at the time. As Johnny delivers newspapers, he meets with the some of the Sons of Liberty and Rab.After the Boston Tea Party that Johnny helped in, the citizens of Boston were to pay taxes. Most people refused to pay and were to be punished.When the governor of Boston had to go back to Britain,a governor chosen by King George III,steps in for the job. With him, the new governor brings many soldiers to Boston. The people of Boston were not very happy about that.Soon after the battles of Lexington and Concord and the midnight ride of Paul Revere, the Sons of Liberty plan and defeat the British after many battles.The American Colonies were then free from the British rule. The thirteen colonies were then called the United States of America.After all the troubles Johnny and the thirteen colonies went through, there was one more trouble Johnny had to face-the death of Rab, his best friend that comforted him throughout the war.This novel is one of the best novels that I have read.

However, you will not be sorry after reading it!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Our home schooling family has enjoyed Grace Conlin's reading of Esther Forbes' Johnny Tremain for at least two years now. I would recommend ripping the discs to mp3 files shortly after the original discs arrive lest you lose this wonderful investment (but no sharing or making copies!) This story is a regular favorite.Johnny is an orphan boy apprenticed to a silver smith. Another apprentice, tired of Johnny's arrogance and continually bested by Johnny's skill, decides to sabotage Johnny's work. That results in a debilitating injury. Johnny Tremain is principally the story of a young man's life as he learns valuable lessons about people against a historically rich backdrop. The story is set in late colonial America and includes many fictional characters as well as a few factual persons (engaged in both actual and fantastical action). The great value of the book lies equally in its ability to evoke a time period and a context for history, and in its many moral lessons. It is a wonderful preface to studying the colonial period.My 11-year-old son has a much better grasp of the Declaration of Independence, The U.S. Constitution and the reasons behind the founding of the United States than I had after my government class in 11th grade when I was 17! I credit this audiobook with laying a rich foundation upon which I have been able to build.It's a great audio program for ONE listening with the grown-ups.

Johnny lived in Boston when the United States and Great Britain were preparing for war. He was very eager to go fight in the war but could not do so because he was an apprentice for a silversmith. One day, although the silversmith was away attending to another matter, Johnny worked on a job that he was not supposed to. While working, he mishandled the silver and crippled his hand.He still wouldn't give up his dream of fighting. He was forced to find a new job and becomes a horse-boy for the Boston Observer. He also became a messenger for the Sons of Liberty, a famous patriot group. Johnny meets important figures like John Hancock, Samuel Adams and Dr. Joseph Warren.I really liked this book because it shows that things are not always as they appear.

Reading this book I could feel Johnny's excitment as he took part in the Boston Tea party and I could feel his sadness as he struggled with loss at the battles of Lexington and Concord.

Since its publication, \\"Johnny Tremain\\" has remained one of the best known children's books ever written. It won the 1944 Newbery Award and is still read by schoolchildren everywhere. Heck, even Bart Simpson was lured into reading it in a \\"Simpsons\\" episode (Marge tells him that it's about a boy with a deformed hand and he' intrigued). Newbery award winners come and go. Sometimes they're remembered (ala \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\") and sometimes they're rightfully forgotten (ala \\"Daniel Boone\\"). \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is different because even reading it today the book remains readable, thoughtful, and interesting. It deserves its praise.Johnny Tremain is an apprenticed silversmith of one Mr. Lapham. Unusually skilled in the trade, Johnny's the star of the household. The other apprentices envy and hate him and the members of the Lapham family love him. Just the same, Johnny is unaccountably vain. Boastful and overflowing with pride, he lords his superior abilities over everyone he meets, even catching the eye of the greatest silversmith in Boston, Paul Revere. Yet when a broken crucible maims Johnny's hand with silver, the life he had planned for himself can never be. Desperate for work, he finally finds a place with the Boston Observer, a Whig news publication. Soon Johnny finds himself rubbing shoulders with the men of the Revolution. His life becomes enmeshed in the spy networks and fighting words that lead up to the American Revolution. In doing so, he becomes a major player in the creation of a new America.I read this book in elementary school and, sadly, remembered very little of it. What I did remember was Johnny's hand. Honestly, I think this book would sell like hotcakes if it was retitled, \\"Johnny Tremain: The Boy With the Deformed Hand\\". Not that I'm seriously recommending the change. What really struck me, when reading this book again today, was just how well written the little bugger is. First of all, it begins with an unsympathetic protagonist. Up till now, most Newbery protagonists fell somewhere between saints and perfection incarnate. But Johnny is just the kind of little snot who needs to be taken down a peg to become a better person. This isn't one of those books where the hero gets hurt and suddenly makes a miraculous transformation from bad to good either. As you read the story you see Johnny's progress. He grows and learns from his injury, yes, but he also grows and learns from meeting and speaking with other people. Which brings me to the second remarkable aspect of this book. The English, awful as they are sometimes, are not evil cackling villains. Johnny meets and even, to some extent, befriends British officers. He finds himself pitying the English wounded and sympathizing with their pain. Likewise, not all the American Revolutionaries are perfect gods. John Hancock comes off as a bit of a rich fop, and Sam Adams is seen gleefully rubbing his hands together over the prospect of upcoming destruction. So many stories create villains so ridiculously evil that they haven't a single solitary redeeming characteristic and heroes pious to the point of sainthood. \\"Johnny Tremain\\" could easily have fallen into that trap, but it doesn't. Instead, it gives a remarkably thoughtful approach to the nature of enemies, war, and freedom.The book is long, granted. Also, there are numerous spying/battle sections in which I had to continually backtrack through the text to figure out, \\"Now why is Johnny doing that?\\". The best way to lure kids today with this book might be to sell it as a Revolutionary spy book. I mean, Johnny really does become a kind of secret agent for the Yankees. He knows how to get information out of people and how to find out important English secrets. Best of all, the story has a naturalistic writing style that's easy to get through once you get going. If you want to give your kids a Newbery award winner that's as memorable and fascinating today as it was the day it was written, I cannot recommend, \\"Johnny Tremain\\" enough. Ignore the picture of the saintly boy on the cover. This is a book of adventure, pride, and war."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"JOHNNY TREMAIN is a magic book for me. It takes me back to 1966 when I was in fifth grade at Stadium School. We had a student teacher named Miss Greenberg who announced to us that she was going to begin reading aloud to us every day after lunch. We were ten and eleven year olds and highly insulted that the teacher wanted to read to us like babies! Then Miss Greenberg started reading JOHNNY TREMAIN. Within a week none of the kids in class could wait to get back from lunch, even the boys who professed that they \\"hated books.\\" There were two copies of JOHNNY TREMAIN in the school library and after that first week they were reserved for weeks in advance. I begged my mother for a copy for Christmas; she had to go crazy to order one because they were out of print back then. She finally found a teacher's edition that had study questions at the end of the book. I loved the portrait of Boston in the 1770s and although Johnny was a little too arrogant for my taste in the beginning, I grew to like him as he changed in the course of the book. My favorite character has always been Cilla Lapham, but I love Johnny's horse Goblin as well, and Rab and the Lornes and Miss Bessie, the Lytes' cook. They are all welcome friends."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This is a wonderful children's book that most adults would also probably enjoy. \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is a classic that tells the story of a young boy caught up in the turmoil of 1773 Boston and the start of the American Revolution.This is the type of book that can get kids interested in history. The book really is brilliantly written for the age group it is intended for."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I must have read this book ten? twenty? times as a teenager, and so when I found it recently in the basement I started reading again to see if it was really as good as I remembered it. Better! \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read, even as an adult. So imagine my surprise when I noticed that Amazon readers rated this only four stars?For starters, this is not a children's book. I see fourth, fifth graders reviewing this book, as part of an assignment - and as a mother myself, this bothers me. This is a great book - but, I think, way over a fifth-graders head. Maybe *your* fifth-grader is brilliant and will absolutely understand everything completely - but for a classroom setting? What are these teachers thinking?But for a teenager - \\"Johnny Tremain\\" brings to life the times of the Revolutionary War era as no other book, or history lesson, possibly can. Couple that with a brilliantly portrayed cast of characters - complex, vivid characters - and exceptionally vivid, emotional and fast paced writing - and you have the ingredients for a really good book. Maybe I am prejudiced - I love historicals, and always did, but perhaps it is the other way around - perhaps \\"Johnny Tremain\\" influenced me in the way that this book showed me how fascinating history can be.\\"Johnny Tremain\\" is the story of a boy - fourteen years old - who is apprenticed to a silversmith, whom he calls his \\"master\\". As an exceptionally capable, talented young man - not to mention an exceptional aptitude with silver - he quickly steps into his master's family to find his niche as the head of the household - if not in name, then in actions (beint that his master is elderly). But how easily are the mighty fallen! For Johnny burns his hand on hot silver and, medicine (or midwifery) being what it was, it never healed properly. A future as a silversmith is out. Overnight, Johnny went from being a capable, bright boy with an exceptional future ahead of him to a nobody.While this is an excellent story about Johnny, it is the times that he lived in that makes this book such riveting reading. Not only do we get to meet all the famous people who populate pre-Revolutionary Boston, we also get an excellent, clear picture of the everyday life of the people of that era. The way they lived, the things they ate, the way they operated - almost everything is touched upon in this extra-ordinary novel.Johnny Tremain somehow gets tangled with the Boston patriots - and is right there in the thick of things just as the Revolutionary War has started. This is the only part of the novel that I found a bit too coincidental - but extremely interesting, nevertheless.\\"Johnny Tremain\\" is one of the best books ever written, but would more easily be appreciated and understood by an older student, in my opinion. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Esther Forbes' story of young Boston boy's adventures during the early days of the American Revolution, &quot;Johnny Tremain,&quot; is a classic of children's historical fiction. As such it has been required reading for generations of middle school students, and assigned reading material, regardless of quality, will always raise the hackles of some students. Thus the bad reviews here should be taken with a grain of salt.The strength of this book is how it weaves the fictional story of Johnny Tremain, who had been a promising silversmith apprentice until an accident crippled his hand, with the historical events and people of Revolutionary era Boston. Johnny deals with the loss of his trade, his attempt to reclaim his birthright, a burgeoning romance with the daughter of his former master, and an increasing involvement with the revolutionary activities of the Sons of Liberty. The book brings to life the era of the Revolution and reminds the reader that the simple hope &quot;that a man can stand up&quot; did not come without tragedy. &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; is a true classic, and makes for a great read. (Even TV's worst student, Bart Simpson, loved reading it- &quot;They should call this book Johnny Deformed Hand.&quot;)"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"...seems as if some disgruntled teenager is getting revenge for having, heaven help us, to read a book!

When we meet the title character, he is an indentured apprentice to a master silversmith. The novel follows Johnny as he becomes involved in the revolutionary movement.Forbes skillfully weaves together the story of a boy's journey to manhood with a slice of the story of a new nation's birth. Johnny is an intriguing character. He's an admirable but flawed hero who encounters serious misfortune but keeps striving on his quest towards responsible manhood. The book is filled with fascinating details about life in Johnny's 18th century world--its economics, food, politics, clothing, social structure, and more. Particularly fascinating is the author's exploration of the craft of the silversmith. Forbes seamlessly blends the historical and cultural details into the overall story.The story involves a number of additional interesting characters. Also noteworthy is Forbes' presentation of the military situation, particularly the implications of a clash between Britain's professional army and a force that is seen as consisting of \\"peasants\\" and \\"yokels.\\" The novel looks at the impact of war upon society without sugarcoating the situation. \\"Johnny\\" is both a gripping tale and a significant volume in the canon of American novels about war."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I've read Johnny Tremain several times, and each time I am fascinated by the characters. The town of Boston and the culture of the times also come to life in this story. Characters involved in the Revolutionary War seem like real people in Esther Forbe's portrayal -- such as John Adams; the English deserter \\"Pumpkin\\"; the typical un-famous soldier signified by \\"Rab\\"; and the tories & revolutionaries who harbor a large number of opinions on the English king and the revolt. The book provides a good smattering of men and women, boys and girls, each with their unique problems in that society. I enjoyed that the plot included more than just a reaction to a quickly-forming war, but also a family mystery, class conflict, coming-of-age romance, friendship, loyalty and even loss -- you know, all the good themes :) This story makes the Revolutionary War memorable. It does heroicize certain characters, but life includes heroes and there is enough black, white and gray in the myriad of personalities to learn about human nature. For someone who loves to read about people and ponder why they do what they do to make them who they are, this is a fun read. It is also for those who like the details that bring you into the sounds and smells and history of a place."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"As a 5th grade teacher of gifted &amp; talented social studies students, I found &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; an excellent tool for teaching the American Revolution.

I'm so glad that I did.Although it is considered a novel for young adults, this older adult reader was highly caught up in the story about the young, pompous, and very talented silversmith who had his whole future changed in an instant when a work accident burned his hand. His entire life's work came to a screeching halt. His transformation from braggadocio boy to patriotic spy was a realistic journey that taught me much about life in Boston just before the American Revolution.Forbes' characters are enchanting even when they are annoying, and this reader grew to appreciate all the hard-earned lessons in life that transformed Johnny into a mature, likeable fellow.

This book has a lot accurate historical facts, and readers learn about people like Paul Revere and Sam Adams. This book is worth reading because it shows how Johnny grows up and changes and how, at the same time, the colonies get ready for war. The reader learns about the Sons of Liberty and the Observer's Club which were held in secret and helped unite the colonists against the British.In the beginning of the book, Johnny is only concerned about his career and himself. He feels sorry for himself because he loses the use of his hand in a terrible accident, and he can no longer be a silversmith. He is denied the right to join a family that he belongs to and finds himself with no friends and no future. When he meets another young man named Rab, his life changes. He begins to work for a group of men who seek independence from the British because they believe the colonists are not being fairly treated. He learns how to ride a horse and practices writing with his crippled hand. Johnny participates in distributing Whig publications around Boston and the surrounding towns. Johnny participates in the Boston Tea Party and then becomes a spy for the colonists.Slowly, Johnny realizes that the making of his new country is most important in his life, and he forgets about his all the other things that caused him problems in the past. While working for the colonists, Johnny proves to brave and loyal. He is willing to take risks and even have a very painful operation to repair his hand so he can fire a musket and help fight on the battlefield. He can also see the good in other people, especially the men who are willing to die for the colonies. Johnny is very proud of them. At the end of this book, Johnny is mature and not afraid of his future. At the same time, the war has started and a new country is born.I recommend this book to all fifth graders because this book has action, adventure and a lot about history. It is a great way to learn about our Revolutionary War and the events that led up to it. It also shows the great sacrifice many people were willing to make to separate from the British and start a new country.

Lavinia Lyte seemed liked a nice girl, maybe a little vain, at first, but then my opinion totally changed. I loved Johnny and Cilla's relationships, it was fun, and innocent at first, and progressed slowly. Johnny's jealousy helped too.Rab was a very interesting character, I always wanted to know more of him. But it seems you weren't supposed to know him all that well, and that was fine with me.I did have to go back, remember what it was that I was reading about in several situations, make sure I understood what characters were doing why, why Johnny was doing so, but all in all, greatly written and I would suggest it to friends.

It could almost be the same story.I think there are some books that are meant to be read throughout your life, &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; and &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; are two and so is &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot;."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"The book was good but not great.If your into wars and battles this book is good ,but if your not the war type I wouldn't read it you won't be instrested."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"My opinion is simple: This book is boring.

The plot becomes so thick when you start to read that you begin to yearn to finish this terrible book. Johnny's poor attitude causes you to have no sympathy for him once he burns his hand. There are a lot of characters involved, and are again individuals you will have no empathy for. This book is very boring, but the Boston Tea Party part was mildly entertaining. Johnny Tremain does not have the energy that some novels do, which make you want to turn every page to see what will happen. It's a book that you just want to get through to finish. I'm giving it two stars because I like Rab's demeanor in the story, and I like the way Johnny grew and became more mature toward the end of the novel. Only read this one if absolutely necessary.

He is apprenticed to be a sliversmith. Johnny is the alpha cocky, bossy, annoying boy that lives with a family called the Laphams. But once he burns his right hand with molten sliver, that all turns around. Mr. Lapham tells Johnny that he should find something that he is good at and that he can do with his injured hand (because Johnny can not be a sliversmith with his burned hand.) But Johnny is turned down for most jobs. One day Johnny meets Rab, who works for his uncle(Uncle Lorne)at the Boston Observer. Johnny decides to start working at the Boston Observer as a horse/delivery boy. This is how he gets connected with famous patriots like: John Hannock, Sam Adams, and Paul Revere. He goes on adventures that include the Boston Tea Party and The Battle of Lexington. So this book was okay but I wouldn't read it again. It seemed too long and it also seemed repetitive. It seemed as if it was so long that I forgot about the beginning. I think it was reptitive to me because I just learned about all this stuff in class and it took a long time to explain something that most students will cover quickly in class.. But if you are looking information about the Revolutionary War it would be an okay source to use but not the best one there is out there. I personally thought it was ok and not fun. During class we were asked what was the most exciting part of the book and I think burning his hand was really it.

I don't mind books about history; I don't mind reading, and believe me, I WANTED to enjoy it. But by the time I got done the first chapter, I knew this book was horrible, yet I continued to read it. I did not HAVE to read it, I could have just gotten the answers from someone else, but I read it anyway. This book was horrible. It was unrealistic and had almost nothing at all to do with history. The plot line (if you could actually call \\"that\\" a plot line) had nothing to do with anything, the so called adventures this dumb Johnny Tremain kid got himself into were things that would never ever happen EVER. It had nothing to do with anything in history and tried to drift more of your attention to this dumb kid who got some stupid silver cup stolen. It was the most boring book I have ever read.If you are actually considering buying this trash, PLEASE for the sake of your poor kids or students or whomever, RECONSIDER. If you want to buy them something educational or something that portrayals early American life, DO NOT buy this. I forced myself to be bored with this dumb book about three quarters of the way through, and then I could not take it anymore. There was nothing I found remotely interesting; I would not force my worst enemy to read this book. It would be more fun and interesting watching someone pick the lint of their socks.If one was not the lowest number I would rate this book a zero, it deserves a negative 200, but that would draw too much attention to a book so dumb it does not deserve ANY attention. I feel so strongly about this that I am actually wasting my summer to come and type this to help prevent some poor soul from going through the torture I went through. Why this book won a Newberry metal, I don't know, something seriously went wrong, but look at the other books on that list... SHILOH? I personally think that someone was held at gunpoint to actually PUBLISH this book.Don't waste your time with this waste of paper. Incase you are wondering, I got a 98 on that test without even reading a lot of the book and the other parts I actually did read I was too busy banging my head into the wall or falling asleep, the only thing that stopped me from shredding this book in the Garbage disposal or a cuisinart was that I might break one of them on this useless piece of (crud) and that I would not pay the school even 10 cents for this horribly written garbage."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"First off, I can't figure out how or why Johnny Termain won the Newbery award. My guess is that perhaps there was a shortage of quality book. This book is painfuly bad.I'm doing my thesis on the Revolutionary War at the Elementary level, and I was told I should read this book. Thre are so many other books that are so much better. If you want to read about the Revolutionary War, then I suggest some Dear America books, and My name is America books, and MY Brother Sam is Dead.The problem with Johnny Termain is that the war isn't mentioned until 1/2 of the book is over. The author just prattles on about nothing. It briefly mentions the Boston Masscure, and the Boston Tea Party. They are two events that are reasons why we went to war, but the author just skips over them.As a character, Johnny is a smart mouthed little punk. The reader never really cares about what happens to him. In the story, Johnny gets injured on his silversmith job, and has to find other work. The problem is that we don't read that much about the war, and that's what this book is suppose to be about.There are a lot of fictional books that are a good read that deal with the Revolutionary War.....Johnny Termain isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This book is so dull.

They couldn't even make you sad when Rab died, and you knew this character from the beginning. If I could've I would've rated it -100,000,000,000. The romantic junk between Cilla and Johnny was the same old thing. I felt I was just reading the same story over and over again (If you're gonna do that at least read something worth while). Cilla likes Johnny, she doesn't care, Cilla likes Johnny, she doesn't care, Cilla likes Johnny, she doesn't care. It was the same thing. They could've put more suspense and details. It didn't even teach you much about history. I could've watched a movie and gotten more information. If you want to learn about history read a history textbook or go to school. Yes, even homework is worth not reading this disgusting horrible, dull book. I absolutely hated it. When they told you Rab died it should've been more sad. You weren't even sad when Johnny burnt his hand. You knew everything that was gonna happen, and of course the same old ending (The hurt or sick person is cured.)

He's very good at working with silver, and thinks he's the best. He treats the other people in his master's family and the other apprentices like garbage. While working with sliver, Johnny burns his hand and can't work any more. Then he gets treated badly, and the mother in the family kicks him out of the house. After wandering the streets, Johnny finally takes a job delivering newspaper for a printing shop. He makes friends with Rab, another boy who works at the printing shop. Every one at the shop is a patriot, and there are secret meetings at the printing shop. Soon Johnny helps out by spying on the British, because his horse is in the same stables as the British horses. But eventually the British go to war and Rab goes too, to fight for the rebels. When Johnny discovers that many rebels were killed in battle, he makes his way over to see if Rab was killed.Personally, I hated this book.

It's take on historical fiction has kept it in the hands of school children for over 50 years.What I find truly remarkable about the book is not its description of Boston in the mid-1770s. I find JOHNNY TREMAIN really stands out in its description of how a young arrogant boy matures into a young man who takes responsibility for how he has treated others in the past and how he continues to connect to his own emotional life. Johnny changes significantly from the beginning to the end in understanding himself. Metaphorically, it is much like this nation -- arrogant, changing, proud, young... though this country still has a lot to learn.With an excellent middle school vocabulary, this book remains truly relevant to today's middle school reader. It is challenging reading, particularly with the details of people and places as there are plenty of each.I read this book thirty years ago as a child and the only thing that I remembered before recently picking up this book again was the incident with Johnny's hand and the molten silver. But is better than I remembered. It deserves to be turned into a television series (one season) that tells this story intimately without cutting any of the material.

If you have a lot of free time then read it because you won't want to stop. It is about a fourteen year old boy that is and apprentice for a silversmith. He is so good at his work that he gets to boss the older kids around. One day he is working on something and he drops one of his tools in. Without thinking he grabs at it and the hot silver burns his hands. His hands basically get melted together in between his fingers making them look webbed. Now obviously he can't do the silversmith work as good as he used to so his master tells him to go find new work. Johnny goes out and finds a printing press and quickly becomes friends with the owners son, Rab. Johnny finds things being printed about the British that are bad. Johnny decides to take it into his own hands and basically runs a postal route so he can get letters from the British and show Rab's father. You'll have to find out how it ends."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This is fascinating historical fiction, for Esther Forbes has seamlessly woven a good Colonial yarn about an aspiring apprentice silversmith into the tapestry of New England's grievances, which culminated in the American Revolution. One could almost believe that Johnny--quick, cocksure, ambitious--actually lived and rubbed shoulders with the brilliant and fervent Boston patriots: Paul Revere, John Hancock, Sam and john Adams.What a wonderful parallel read this is for English-History classes, which will definitely appeal to boyswho crave literary action. The protagonist is an impoverished youth who loses his job and ultimately his place in a modest craftsman's home, because of an accident in which he burns his hand beyond folk healing. He struggles to find a few position, new friends and a sense of self-worth, since he realizes that his silver dreams are shattered beyond repair. But Johnny also undertakes a personal quest--a legacy from his poor mother: to be recognized by a wealthy merchant's family as a direct heir. But was this spirited and talented fellow meant to be a nobleman? Ultimately he learns to value the nobility of the heart.As war clouds loom increasingly over disgruntled Boston, Johnny's outlook changes; his new, American loyalty is refined in a crucible of patriotic hope--fired by the empassioned oratory of James Otis. The coming Revolution will stand as a beacon to oppressed people the world over, even back in &quot;mother&quot; England. Johnny learns to curb his temper somewhat, as he comes of age and suddenly must perform a man's job by defending his values in perilous times. This book is an excellent story which will hold the reader's interest because of the intensely personal storyline, plus accurate historical details. This book makes one proud to be Yankee born!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I'd highly recommend this book. There's a bit of everything a book should have-pride, a theme, history, action, death, and a touch of realization.The prize apprentice silversmith of Boston, Johnny Tremain is proud and arrogant. He has a silver cup which shows his true ancestry. He is actually the grandnephew of a rich English noble family, the Lytes. He is forbidden to show this cup to anyone, but he shows it to his master's daughter, Cilla Lapham. This is handy later, but when he gets back home to the Laphams, John Hancock arrives and orders a silver sugar basin. Of course, Johnny is given the most difficult part, the handles, as he is the better of two other apprentices, Dusty and Dove. Yet, Johnny can't get the handles right and is forced to work through Sabbath. Dove on purpose hands him the cracked crucible, and Johnny cripples his hand. He is useless for silver work, but the Laphams don't turn him out yet. Still, his pride is also crippled, and he goes door-to-door looking for skilled work. He is rejected by everyone until he comes to the printer's shop. There, he meets a boy named Rab Silsbee. Rab works for his Uncle Lorne and aunt. Johnny knows he can't stay in their hospitality forever, so he goes to the rich Merchant Lyte for help and shows him his cup. Merchant Lyte accuses him of stealing that cup on August 23rd that year. Now, Johnny has a witness: Cilla. The case is dismissed, but Merchant Lyte cheats Johnny out of the cup. Johnny finds out Rab is a Son of Liberty. He joins in with some of their actions, such as the Boston Tea Party. He helps spy on them by sending letters for the British army. Then, Johnny went to the last meeting of the Sons of Liberty. He would never forget James Otis lecturing about how some would give everything just so a man can stand up. Before he knows it, war starts and Lavinia Lyte, who took Cilla as her servant and Isannah as her prodigee was going back to London with Merchant Lyte. Cilla is staying, and before she leaves, Lavinia explains how she actually admired his mother and how her father, Merchant Lyte did not mean to cheat hikm out of the cup, he thought he was taking back his own property. Eventually, Johnny discovers a few more-than-best-friend feelings about Cilla, and happily discovers she has them too. Rab goes to war, but is killed, leaving the theme of \\"A man can stand up\\" supported.And so the book ends, leaving the book reader at the same time satisfied and disappointed, wanting to know more and having fun guessing what would happen to the characters.

Character development is key here--perhaps all readers can cite the historical events around which this story is crafted--don't expect new revelations or quick action here. Instead, the richness of this book is the glimpse of truly believable people amidst the growing turmoil that envelops them during this distant but so significant time.

Johnny Tremain lives in Boston and works as an apprentice to a silversmith. He's talented and arrogant, lording it over the other apprentices until his right hand is badly burned. His nearly-unusable hand means that his apprenticeship is over.Now more humble, he makes friends with the calm, enigmatic Rab, a boy a few years older than himself, who works for the Boston Observer. Soon Johnny gets a job delivering newspapers--on horseback. The publisher of the Observer is very political, and Johnny learns about the Whigs, who want freedom from England, and the Tories, who are loyal to England.A secret group of Whigs regularly meets regularly in the newspaper offices. Before long Johnny is delivering coded messages to the members, including Paul Revere. The Whigs are incensed that England is charging the colonies a tax on tea, but the real issue is freedom. As one Whig leader says, \\"We give all we have, lives, property, safety, skills...we fight, we die, for a simple thing. Only that a man can stand up.\\" Johnny too is becoming inspired by the cause of freedom.The Whigs organize the Boston Tea Party in December of 1773: sixty young men dressed as Indians, including Johnny and Rab, board three British ships and dump the tea into Boston Harbor. By June of 1774, British soldiers and officers fill the streets, Boston is blockaded, and the air is filled with talk of war. On every village green in New England, men and boys are drilling, but with only ancient squirrel guns and flintlocks as weapons.By early 1775, the Whigs suspect that the first British attacks will be at Lexington and Concord. Johnny's friend Rab goes off to Lexington to fight, but insists that Johnny, who is part of Paul Revere's spy network, must stay and report on British plans and troop movements. War is inevitable, but what will it bring for Johnny and Rab?This book, which won the Newbery Medal for 1944, brings to vivid life the beginning of the American Revolutionary War as no history book ever could. Disney made a movie of \\"Johnny Tremain\\" in 1957.

The teen's boss, though once masterly at his trade, is now past his prime and has, along with his family, hung all his hopes on the hard-working young man. Johnny Tremain works alongside two less able boys (one older, one younger) who envy his skill, drive, and the high level of responsibility the elderly silversmith has bestowed upon him. Observing several contentious interactions between the teen and his fellow apprentices, his employer admonishes him for the sin of pride, about which, he warns, God might choose to punish him. Expectedly, He does, in the form of a career-ending injury. The family tries to get by in spite of their star student's disability, but it doesn't take long for the burdensome situation to take a toll on everyone. Johnny, with help from a friend, must find a way to make a living wage and eventually signs on as a messenger, helping out in support of the Whigs. He also becomes embroiled in controversy surrounding his family heritage. Due to his involvement in these situations, Johnny learns a lot about politics, sticking up for what's right, and, the price of war, (p 253) \\"...some of us would die - so other men can stand up on their feet like men.\\" Although Esther Forbes' writing style feels (forgive me, Forbes fans) dated, reading Johnny Tremain, with its excellent character development and descriptiveness, is a great way for young readers to learn about events leading up to the Revolutionary War.

Most people refused to pay and were to be punished.When the governor of Boston had to go back to Britain,a governor chosen by King George III,steps in for the job. With him, the new governor brings many soldiers to Boston. The people of Boston were not very happy about that.Soon after the battles of Lexington and Concord and the midnight ride of Paul Revere, the Sons of Liberty plan and defeat the British after many battles.The American Colonies were then free from the British rule. The thirteen colonies were then called the United States of America.After all the troubles Johnny and the thirteen colonies went through, there was one more trouble Johnny had to face-the death of Rab, his best friend that comforted him throughout the war.This novel is one of the best novels that I have read. I recommend this novel to be read. This exciting tale is brilliantly written. I liked Johnny Tremain very much and I think you'll like it too."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"And therein lies the premise for the colonial revolutionaries of the 1770s, as Forbes has written in her storied historical novel of Johnny Tremain.Decidedly American, this story of the young protagonist Tremain in 1774-1775 colonial Boston could really be enjoyed by any reader who appreciates historical fiction. Though the story's premise is the beginning of the American War for Independence from England, the story has all the elements of a good book, even for those that may not have a stake or interest in the specific elements of American history or independence. There're also the traditional elements of just a good story: love and affection, espionage, conflict, loyalty, tragedy turned to fortune, suspense and a climactic point near the end of the book.Written to a teen audience, Forbes demonstrates great skill (obviously, as this book has stood the test of time, being copyrighted in 1943) in writing a book easily read and understood by her intended audience, but still very enjoyable to the adult audience. I've now read this book three times (I think the only book I've ever read 3 times), and recently for the first time in 26 years. What impresses me most now is how Forbes doesn't display the colonial revolutionaries - the Sons of Liberty - and their renowned characters, men who became the Founding Fathers of America, as near perfect and saintly men. She developed them as men with flaws, wavering allegiances, questionable faculties, but also men resolute in their cause and demonstrating gifted leadership abilities. Likewise, the British army and occupiers of the colonies were displayed not as disdainful, brash and belligerent, but as men who did not wish for war against what they felt were their fellow Englishmen. Forbes put a face of humanity on the entire circumstance whereby the reader today, even 233 years after the first shots were fired at Lexington and Concord, can be touched personally by the events in which Johnny Tremain found himself."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I first read this book when I was in fifth grade and enjoyed it more when I reread it decades later. I still consider it one of the best books of historical fiction ever written. Johnny Tremain is an apprentice to a silversmith in Boston as the ferments of revolution are beginning to boil. American leaders are beginning to believe that the only course of action open to them is an open rebellion against the British crown. Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Paul Revere are three of the Boston-area leaders that Johnny encounters.When is hand is maimed in an accident, Johnny is forced out of his apprenticeship and forced to live on the streets. Fortunately, after a spot of bad luck he becomes associated with kindly people who let him work with a horse and then use it to deliver newspapers. These people are strongly sympathetic to the revolution and Johnny is caught up in it.The most striking aspect of the book is the way the British troops are portrayed. They are described as being kindly, doing what they can to avoid conflict with the population. When Johnny plays a trick on a British officer that lands him in a mud puddle, the officer laughs and does not retaliate. Major Pitcairn is characterized as being quite popular among the people. Of course, history runs its inevitable course and the initial clashes occur at Lexington and Concord, igniting an open war. The patriots are also sometimes characterized as nothing but thugs, ganging up on Loyalists in the guise of being patriotic.This is a book that should be read by every American youth and I can report that all of the schools I know of require it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I read this book when I was young. Must have read it 20 times. I bought this book for my 10 year old nephew so he could enjoy like I did.Book goes a long way to teach some values."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"As a homeschool teacher I found Johnny Tremain a wonderful aid in helping my students learn about the events that led to the Revolutionary War. Set in the growing city of Boston, Johnny Tremain is a young teenage boy learning about the trials and tribulations of being a silversmith's apprentice. Johnny learns a hard lesson when he rushes to finish a silver pitcher and burns his hand terribly. Unable to continue his apprenticeship, Johnny is forced with a life changing decision, what shall his trade be now that he has this disfigured hand?The book gets exciting at this point and Johnny meets Mr Lorne and his nephew Rab. They run a printing shop called the Boston Observer. They take Johnny in and give him a job riding a skittish horse named Goblin. Johnny's new job requires he learn to control his horse Goblin and deliver the Boston Observer to men on the outside of town. Johnny quickly becomes informed about the currents events transpiring in Boston. He attentively listens to the leaders of opposition and becomes an ardent Whig. Very much interested in Politics and wanting to make a difference, Johnny shares that he will do whatever it takes to help his fellow Wig. Johnny becomes a strong force in the Boston Tea Party, gathering young boys and men to dress up as Natives and dump the english tea into the Boston Harbor. These events anger the British terribly and they want the colonists to pay for the destroyed tea. The rest of the book describes the Boston colonists fighting against Tyranny, demanding representation in the English Parliament, the famous words are written Taxation without representation is tyranny.This is a wonderful book to share with young students, they can relate to the character because he is a young boy that is driven to make something of his life. In addition the students can get a taste of the importance of standing up against tyranny at all costs. Johnny is truly a remarkable boy and participates in the changing of American History.I highly recommend this book to any teacher who is interested in integrating Social Studies topics with English and Writing activities. Our school used this book to write a paper about the events that lead to the Revolutionary War and how Johnny Tremain helped his fellow colonists overcome the Tyranny of the British."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"When I first started reading this book I was not hooked at all. To understand just the first chapter I had to read it two or three times. This book has a slow start but then it does eventually build up.Johnny Tremain wants to become a silversmith. When his hand was burned and eventually covered in silver his dreams were crushed. Although this did happen he did not give up all together. He earns a job as a paper boy, delivering papers by horseback.After working here he becomes a strong supporter of the Sons of Liberty and becomes a spy as well as a part of the Boston Tea Party.This was a very good book and I highly reccomend it. Usually I don't enjoy history but reading this book was actually an enjoyable way to learn about the Boston Tea Party, Lexington and Concord, and many other important events of the American Revolution. I was able to relate to Johnny very well which was not expected. He doesn't give up very easily and neither do I. All in all I really recommend this book to anyone, children ands adults included."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"The moment I began to read Johnny Tremain, I was hooked. The way the author describes the setting and characters makes you feel like you're really there. In fact, this book felt like a window to the past that I could climb through and experiance Boston during the American Revolution.Throughout the whole book, you love the main character, Johnny Tremain. Being a very bright, slightly arrogant, young silversmith, he is immediantly swept into the action of the Revolutionary War. He plays a large part in events such as the Boston Tea Party, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, and secreat meetings going on between the Sons of LIberty.The only part of the book that I found was dissapointing was the fact that the book is too short! If you like books with a bunch of action, a little romance, some suspence, and plenty of American history then you should check out Johnny Tremain!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This book came pretty quickly except we werent sure at first that it was the right book because the cover is not the same as the one listed."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I strongly disagree when people say this book is, \\" boring, hard to read, ( it sucks) \\". This book is about a despisable character who is degraded to nothing by a hand accident suffering him to complete rejection from society. Then he finds work and brings his life back to shape.When I read a couple reviews that said this book was slow moving, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It's not slow moving... it's called a story! Not every book has to be like a reality TV show or action movies. Johnny Tremain is a book I'd recommend to anyone for it's wonderful story as well as meaning.I wish I could go higher than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I purchased this audio recording of Johnny Tremain for my classroom. It is the unabridged recording of the book and a great value for the price. The CDs track every three minutes, and Grace Conlin does a fine job narrating the story. My students have been able to follow along with the text while listening, and they can easily use the CDs on their own. Personally I much prefer George Guidall's narration (from Recorded [...]); I think that it is a more dynamic and enjoyable recording. However, if you are looking for a basic recording of Johnny Tremain and don't want to spend a fortune, these CDs certainly do the job."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This novel is severely underappreciated because of its standing as a \\"kid's book.\\" I first read Johnny Tremain more than a decade ago in elementary school, and I've read it at least once a year, every year, since.If there is one complaint that I do not understand when reading negative reviews, it is the claim that these characters are 'flat'. They are anything but. I'd even venture to say that Johnny is one of the most well-written characters in literature. Forbes writes Johnny so that he grows and matures as the novel progresses, without shoving it in the reader's face. His transformation is subtle; unlike many writers, Forbes doesn't spell out every little detail for the reader, and thank goodness for that. She trusts that her audience is smart enough to see how Johnny changes. This reason alone may be why so many kids despise J.T. They want it spelled out for them, otherwise, they don't (can't?) understand.As for the plot, it's tight (and I don't mean \\"cool\\"). So many times you read a novel and wonder where it's headed. More often than not, authors seem to throw in the towel at numerous points, as though they've gotten themselves backed into a corner, either because of poor execution of the storyline, or because their story becomes too complex and they get flustered. Not the case here- Forbes knew her beginning, middle and end, down to the very last sentence. Every word has meaning, every storyline makes sense, every character is significant.This is one of my top three novels of all time, so I admit I am biased. But I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so. It's a quick read, but it's an impressive one. There are only two books I think are practically flawless: Johnny Tremain and The Count of Monte Cristo. Both are outstanding, not just because of the plot (TCoMC is far superior, in my opinion, to every other book), but because of the characters."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Many are already familiar with the story of \\"Johnny Tremain\\", either through the book or the Disney movie. It is worth reading whether you have read it before or not. I have recently read it for about the fourth time. It is, of course, the story of the silversmith's apprentice, Johnny Tremain ,who becomes involved in the events leading up to the Boston Tea Party and culminating in the battles of Lexington and Concord. Through Johnny's eyes we see Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and Dr. Warren. We also get a glimpse into the world of Eighteenth Century Boston with its merchants and apprentices, landmarks and social conditions. The story is enhanced as we watch sixteen year old Johnny form his standards of right and wrong, feel out his relationships with girls and, under the tutelage of his new friend Rab, enter the world of men. We also see Johnny mature as he comes to know himself.\\"Johnny Tremain\\" received the John Newberry Medal for excellence in Children's Literature. This speaks to its quality, but does not indicate a limitation on its appeal. It is an excellent book for teenagers, but should not be ignored by adults either. I have read and re-read it repeatedly and never tire of it. It is an excellent book to read before a trip to Boston because so many of the places you will visit as you walk the Freedom Trail and the persons referred to along its cobblestones are included in this book. It will help you to a deeper understanding of the Freedom Trail and the role of Boston in the Revolution.

However, this is the book that hooked me on history.Our media, books, television, films, are full of the American Revolution and its heroes and heroines now, but back in 1952, things were pretty quiet on the American History front. We were making our own history with WWII, the Marshall Plan, the Korean Conflict, the red scare et al. In spite of all that, this book set me on fire. I wanted to know more about the foundations of our country, and I went on to read everything I could set my hands to. I am still doing it, but that is another story.\\"Johnny Tremain\\" is still a wonderful book. It tells the story of a teenaged apprentice who learns the hard way what is his real value to his country. Of course, you can't mention silver and the Revolution without bringing Paul Revere into the story.

Johnny starts out as an apprentice silversmith with a unusual amount of experience. Two other apprentices, Dove and Dusty, hate him because he bosses them around and acts like a know-it-all. Angry at Johnny for bossing him around, Dove hands him a cracked crucible. When the silver spills out he tries to save it but he slips and his hand falls into the furnace. Without the use of his, hand Johnny has to find a new job. That's when he meets Rab in a printer workshop, moves upstairs with him and begins working with the Sons of Liberty.

Lyte says the cup belonged to him and was stolen. He calls the sheriff and Johnny is arrested. Proven innocent Johnny participates in the Boston Tea Party while working with the Sons of Liberty. At the battle of Lexington Rab is shot and Johnny comforts Rab as he lay dying, receives his musket and Doctor Warren fixes his hand so now he can become a soldier.There are many settings in the story.

His mother and father died when he was very young so he has been living with another family through his years as a skilled apprentice being a silversmith. He's very cocky and thinks he's all that. He doesn't get along with the other family members and treats them like garbage. After a messy incident working, Johnny gets a permanent burn on his hand from the hot metal. He is PERMANENTLY scared and cannot use that hand anymore. Now that he is useless the family starts treating him like garbage since he is no use to them anymore. The mother kicks him out and Johnny has to find a new job that he can work in with his crippled hand. While looking he makes friends with a quiet, friendly, yet intense patriot named Rab. Rab works at the Boston Observer, a newspaper publisher run by his uncle, and they offer Johnny a job there delivering the newspapers and a place to stay. Johnny starts realizing how humble Rab is and becomes a new person now since he isn't viewed like an amazing skilled silversmith anymore but just another civilian. After working at The Observer for quite awhile now, Johnny finds out something about his mother and father from his so called \\"enemy\\" (the Lyte family) in the book. What he finds out may change his life forever. As he becomes in the loop of the patriots plans, he helps them spy and try to defeat the British. Will he go off to war and sacrifice himself for the new born country? Or will he stand by and watch? Who will he lose along the way? Personally I really hated the book.

One thing I didn't like was that Mrs. Lampham(Cilla's mother) should have gotten Doctor Warren instead of a midwife when Johnny burned his hand. We studied the American Revolutionary in fifth grade (last year) and I felt this book reflected it wonderfully. Thank you, Esther Forbes, for you have the talent of a true writer."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain I thought was a very good book. It was very real life and you can understand how disappointed he was when he had to find a new profession because he had a disability.

I saw through the book how blessed our nation is that we do not have to fight on our own nation's soil, as they did in, &quot;Johnny Tremain.&quot; The characters had distinct personalities and mannerisms, allowing me to picture them in my mind. &quot;Johnny Tremain,&quot; is a book I would recommend to my friends as a informative elaboration on the daily life af an American during the Revolutionary War."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This was a good book.....not as good as my brother sam is dead.Everything was good except the ending.

It didn't grab my attention that well."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Well I'm not complaining but Johnny Tremain is not the best book ever (Well for me at least. I like to read about mythology and about wonderful make-believe lands. Also classics like Wuthering Heights.) I think that the author had a great point of view and made the book that much more interesting but it still didn't please me. On the other hand I don't like learning about U.S. History even though that's our heritage. I go for the more adventerous like Greece and Rome. So anyways Johnny Tremain is basically a story about a boy who has a crippled hand after a bad accident where his thumb attaches to his hand. He has to quit his job and find a new one and along the way he meets Rab who is very rebelious to the British. Since the family he worked for kicked him out he decides to work with Rab and he soon finds more of his history. Especially the fact that he is related to a very rich guy in town but he can't seem to get along with him. In the end Rab dies but what's important is that Johnny found the courage to go to war for him and have his hand fixed. And again it was Ok but not the best. I might have enjoyed it more if our teacher didn't force us to read a certain number of chapters a week (I like to read at my own pace. Sometimes I can finish a book in a day other times in a month.)

It is boring and far to indepth reading for children in my age group. Their AR scores on the test were so bad we had to delete them. Even my straight A students failed it.

He becomes very skilled at his work and is expected to do very well once he opens his own silver shop. Tragically one day while he was building a sugar basin for John Hancock he burned his hand because another one of the boys that works for the same master became angry because Johnny kept bossing him around. He was helping Johnny but when Johnny asked for a crucible he intentionally gave him a cracked one so that the silver would spill and Johnny would become embarrassed but the joke went bad and Johnny slipped on something and his hand landed in the hot silver that had spilled out of the cracked crucible and got burned severely. He was no longer a help to the Laphams silver shop so he decided to leave because he was not earning his food and while the others had to work for it. He looked around for another job for several days, sleeping in the cometary and getting any spare food he could find. Eventually he met Rab Silsbee, he worked for the Boston Observer which was a patriot newspaper company, Rab let Johnny stay with him in the attic of the \\"Observer\\" if he would do jobs and help around the house. After Johnny and Rab became pretty good friends and Rab trusted Johnny, Rab let Johnny help set up one of the secret meetings that took place in the attic where they slept of the sons of liberty, the sons of liberty consisted of people like John Hancock, Paul Revere, Sam Adams etc. Johnny soon became a familiar face at the meetings and was trusted by the important group of patriots. Johnny helped during the Boston tea party, delivered messages and news and did lots of jobs like that for the sons of liberty. After many meetings fighting finally broke out at Lexington and Concord, Rab was there and helping fight the British, unfortunately he was badly wounded before he even fired a shot. Johnny did not know any of this and did many different things to find out if Rab was okay after a lot of trouble Johnny finally found Rab wounded, soon after he found him Rab Died."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"The book Johnny Tremain took place in the time of the revolutionary War in Boston, and a bit before that. It was about hard times, and an apprentice silver smith caught in the middle of it all. Johnny, the main character, crippled his hand and cannot do what he longs to be... a silver smith. Johnny leaves his master and tries to find work in the hard times. While looking, he becomes friends with a boy named Rab, a patriot. Johnny moves in with Rab and his Uncle, and Johnnie's new life begins there-a boy with a crippled hand in the time of the Revolutionary war. This book was interesting, but it dragged on! I couldn't stand it while reading, because of the fact that most of the chapters made no sense and they went on and on about how they were so mad, but it took too long for them to do something, which made the book drag on! The emotions in the book were good, but not great. If you were reading about a book in the times of the Revolutionary War, you would expect anger, sadness, excitement, but I felt none of that while reading this book! In conclusion I would not recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"I think that Johnny Tremain is an awful book; it has almost no excitement or suspense. I thought most of the characters were very dull and nondescript, especially the protagonist, Johnny. The plot tells the story of Johnny, who lives in Boston, Massachusetts at the time of the American Revolution. He is a silversmith's apprentice, but when he burns his hand, his dreams of being a master silversmith disappear.Ultimately, he finds work at an important Boston newspaper, and he meets many famous Patriots who are planning to overthrow King George III. Johnny is thrust into the middle of the Revolutionary War. At the end, a tragedy strikes Johnny's life. (I'm not going to say what it is, for those who are unfortunately reading the book.) But it doesn't all end sadly. Doctor Warren, the town doctor, says he can fix Johnny's hand. If you want to know exactly what happens, read the book. (Even though I would advise not to read it at all.)Overall, there was one part, ONE PART, in the entire book that I liked . . . where Johnny's hand gets burnt. To me, it was the only exciting part in the book. Maybe the reason I didn't like the story is because it doesn't make the history seem alive to me. Also, there were four girls in the book, and none of them played a substantial role in the novel. Only Cilla, Johnny's fiance&eacute;, plays a little part. I do not recommend this for anybody who likes American history."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johnny Tremain SummaryThis story takes place in the pre-Revolutionary era of the city of Boston in 1760.

He now lives with Rab, Uncle Lorne, and Aunt Lorne and delivers the Boston Observer, a Whig newspaper.Johnny participates in the Boston Tea Party by throwing tea into the harbor. The fiddler's bill, the bill for the tea, is to be paid, but never is. The punishment for not paying is that the Boston harbor is closed. British soldiers start to occupy the city to begin war. Rab, Johnny's best friend, goes off to fight in the war. The war begins on April 19,1775 and many men are killed. The liberty that the men are fighting for is that \\"A man can stand up\\". Rab dies because of serious wounds. Johnny finally lets Dr. Warren examine his crippled hand. Dr. Warren thinks he can heal Johnny's hand by cutting his thumb from his palm by scar tissue. If Johnny is brave enough, this can happen, and Johnny will be able to fire a gun to help his fellow patriots. While the doctor gets his instruments ready to use, Johnny takes a walk.

Same with a couple other parts such as, Johnny \\"falling in love\\" with Goblin at some stables that I did not know of, and when Johnny got the bunch of money and was spending it and walking through the towns (I think). In conclusion, I don't think this was the right book for me, but it was a well written book with a lot of potential."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Johhny Tremain? Bo-ring! Set back in the 1770s, about the time of the Boston Tea Party and the Revolutionary War. Johnny Tremain is a 14 year old silversmith that receives an unfortunate burn that cripples his hand. He cannot work as a silversmith for the Lapham's so he starts to work for another family and gets wrapped up with the war. Before he was burnt Johnny reveals his family secret to Cilla Lapham, who Mrs Lapham wants Johnny to marry. Before Johnny's mother died she revealed that he was related to a wealthy Boston merchant named Jonathan Lyte. She also gave him a silver cup featuring the Lyte coat of arms but told him to not make contact with them unless he became desperate. But that only gave him more trouble with Mr. Lyte himself. When he moves from the Lapham's he starts to work with a boy named Rab. Rab is a bit older than Johnny and is willing to fight. He does just that one night leaving Johnny mad and betrayed. Basically this book is about the war, which was a very big problem. But in the end Johnny understands what he needs to do and also understands he needs a fresh start. He knows he needs to forget about Lavinia Lyte adopting Isannah Lapham because of her beauty and stealing her from Cilla, he is going to forget about his crippled hand. He is going to look to the future and forget about some very unfortunate deaths regarding his mother, someone that wanted another life that was executed, and a very good friend. Now it may seem the book is interesting. But it drags on and on and on until you are so uninterested you don't understand what is happening. Sure, it does teach you some good history, but if you want a good book it needs to captivate the reader's attention. That's just my opinion."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"This book was so boring i fell asleep every other pagealso there are other good historical fiction books out thereand ones about the civil war or w/ethis book is so incredibly tedious that if i had to read it in one sitting i would diedo not make your students read this they will try their best to skip reading itbelieve me my class was forced to do a literary curve and everybody went online and cheated because they read most of the book and found it so boringplease have a heart, and don't make your students sufferPLEAsEPLEASEnobody cares its a \\"good reading tool\\" if you want people to be encouraged to read don't make them sit through the boringest book ever writtenjust listen to me and rethink getting thisHAVE A HEARTi am afraid if i am forced to read something this boring again i will die of boredom"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain: A novel for old & young (Yearling book)","review":"Not only was this book totally boring, it seemed like everything terrible happened to Johnny. I had to read this horrific book in the fifth grade, when we were studying American history, and now I unquestionabley hate any book or movie that has to do with American history around the time of the American Revolution. I mean, I'm all for the American Revolution, I think it was amazing and I love the fact that we're not governed by an island all the way across the ocean that's like a millionth of the size of us. But this book was terrible representation of that time and didn't seem that realistic. And it put me to sleep many times. But if you're into that type of stuff, this might be a good book for you."},{"Title":"Abel's Daughter","review":"This was a great read. At the start it was a little slow, but soon picked up. The detail was great and it had some interesting twists to keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"Get past the title, and the authors' \\"we are totally right\\" style, and you'll find good material in here. \\"This book is about ... choos[ing] ... the most effective ways of working with people, [and] refocusing on outstanding organizational performance.\\"It tells you why most formal appraisal systems have a lot of good goals, but the negative side-effects of trying to reach them through a regular, compulsory, recorded system prevent most people from reaching them. Suggests abolishing the single system, reviewing the goals, and setting up multiple voluntary systems to do the job better.Read this book to remind yourself what real personal and group improvement communication is about, so that you can include it in your daily work."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"Coens &amp; Jenkins's APA speaks no nonsense, particularly on critizing the modern appraisal systems. Yes, our appraisal systems were and still are well-embedded in a very subtle mentality: The tendency to control. I must say that I have been finding for a book that can challenge the existing appraisal system, but I was disappointed. Though I think Peter Block's Stewardship did something great on the discussion, however, there's no book which has devoted totally on this measuring tool. So, I really once thought that it's a kind of un-challengable, and un-discussible in the business world. Thanks Coens &amp; Jenkins for proving me wrong.APA takes a very thorough penetration into the appraisal system, and at the same time, beat the system form inside-out. And they really know all the details on our way to 'evaluate' the employees. But what I appreciate most is their intention to give direction and guidance toward a more healthy state of organizational life. Since there are enough books talking about heading into a so-called 'new paradigm' of management, but their action is not congurent with what they espoused, or they just simply have no actionable steps! Coens &amp; Jenkins have invest a lot on 'What to do Instead' in each chapter. These are important, solid and also challenging advices that worth to try on, at least you can have a picture of what will be. That's an important distinction with other management books.As a consultant, I committed to act on what Coens and Jenkins advocate, and waiting to test the validity of their claims. Moreover, APA gives me solid information on how the appraisal systems can backfire our well intentions. This confirms my hunch concerning the current appraisal systems.Besides, due to its highly detail descriptions on the HR's way of doing things, it also can be viewed as a treasure education on the new paradigm of HRM.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"Do high performance work systems and knowledge driven work designs need to incorporate performance appraisals? As business leaders move rapidly to transform organizations,they are forced to grapple with what to do about a performance appraisal system. Tom Coens and Mary Jenkins draw from an extensive bibliography of practitioner and academic leaders plus extensive personal experience to say,&quot;abolish it!&quot; Yes! Abolish your appraisal system and replace it with custom-designed decoupled systems for pay coaching,counseling, mentoring,development, and legal justification of personnel decisions. This book is aimed at practitioners and leaders but should be assigned in business schools. It is a provocative and powerful counterpoint to scholarly and professional books that reinforce the old thinking of bundling everything into one appraisal system. This old style approach has plagued managers, employees, and their organizations for the last century.
