Beginning with the paintings from the Middle Ages preoccupied with the blood of Christ as a symbol for both death and life, this survey is wonderfully illustrated with high quality reproductions of paintings, etchings, sculpture from the past down to contemporary art of video and installation performances that focus on blood as the single most important source of life, death, sickness, health, miracles, power, domination and subjugation.Not always for the faint of heart, Bradburne includes images of Gunther Brus in his self-mutilation performances, drawings of the elements of blood, references to blood as the transmitter of AIDS and other past and present atrocities. The spectrum of the topic extends from the art houses and cathedrals to the media and cartoons and is fairly complete in the resonance it creates in the dichotomy of positive and negative.Would that there were more exhibitions of this quality and bravery! But what remains is a book that makes for fascinating reading and looking, and more than that an isolated exhibition cannot hope for as an extended life! Grady Harp, March 05"},{"Title":"Paradoxes for Living: Cultivating Faith in Confusing Times","review":"A paradox on the surface appears as a contradictory statement but on closer reflection reveals a fundamental truth. Christians live in a faith full of paradoxes but find themselves unable to fully understand their meaning. Is Jesus really serious when he says in order to become strong, we must become weak? Are we expected to become like children before we can enter in the kingdom of God? None of the above makes sense but in order to understand our role as Christians in this life we must struggle with these statements and many more.Paradoxes For Living is an invitation for us to explore these numerous paradoxes in our faith and go through the process of embracing them in order to live a full life. N. Graham Standish brings to us those scriptures that seem so contradictory but through study and reflection we see where these verses call upon us to live a more authentic Christian life. Our author is not squeamish in having us deal with the issues of power, suffering, self-examination and other topics that confronts our tendancy to become comfortable in a world whose mores we fail to question.Standish's book is not just a theological treatsie for one to debate in the classroom. Nor is it just a simple Bible study resource where we can gloss over its meaning. Paradoxes cuts deep into your soul and calls you to further cultivate your faith in these chaotic times in which we live. After each chapter, the reader is given reflective exercises to do as well as questions to reflect upon. The author also provides you with additional resources to help you in your spiritual growth. This is an excellent book for both individual as well as group study in fostering spiritual maturity."},{"Title":"Paradoxes for Living: Cultivating Faith in Confusing Times","review":"This book has helped me to dive deeper in my own personal spiritual journey. It has helped me make sense of so much about Christian faith and spirituality that mystified me before. What's ironic about his is that this is a book that stresses true faith and spirituality as becoming comfortable with mystery. The whole point is that it is by living paradoxical lives that we grow closer to God: by becoming weaker we become stronger; by becoming child-like we become mature; by knowing ourselves we know God; by living through pain we discover joy; and so forth. This allows me to live in a way that lets go of compulsions, and instead is willing to live in ambiguity and faith."},{"Title":"Night Terrors (Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Simon Spotlight))","review":"NIGHT TERRORSAlice Henderson (2005)RATING: 4/5 StakesSETTING: Season TwoCAST APPEARANCES: Buffy, Willow, Cordelia, Xander, Angel, Joyce, Giles, Principal Snyder, Oz, Ethan RayneMAJOR ORIGINAL CHARACTERS: The Night Terror (demon)BACK-OF-THE-BOOK SUMMARY: \\"Banished to the realm of dreams, the Night Terror stalks its victims as they sleep. By replacing another's soul with its own, the demon can assume anyone's body and wreak havoc in the real world. But the effect is short-lived. Human bodies soon break down under the tremendous stress of the transfer, and the Night Terror is forced to find a new body to inhabit. That is, until it discovers Buffy's secret and imagines the Slayer would make an ideal-and permanent-host. . . .\\"REVIEWNight Terrors will always hold a special place in my heart because it's the first Buffy Choose-Your-Own-Adventure (\\"Stake Your Destiny\\") book I've successfully completed on my first try. Indeed, one of the aspects that sets this book apart from most others in the series is the wide range of possible endings, ranging from complete success to mediocre survival to outright death.The core plot of the book is an attempt by a demon, the Night Terror, to take over the bodies of residents of Sunnydale by entering into their dreams. This leads to some really interesting and fun dream sequences with Buffy, and shows us examples of how White Hats like Giles, Joyce, and Angel would be like if evil (of course, this last one we know all too well).The writing is smooth and the dialogue is appropriately quirky. In addition, crisp action scenes and a well-researched bad guy help keep the plot moving. Definitely one of the better Stake Your Destiny books.Jhaeman's Buffy Reviews: www.geocities.com/jhaeman"},{"Title":"Night Terrors (Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Simon Spotlight))","review":"This is a pretty good Buffy book. Not the best but not the worst. I enjoyed the story. A demon named Mare, the Night Terror, takes control of peoples bodies while they're sleeping. After awhile their astrol cord will break and the persons body will go into a coma. My favorite story in this book is when the Mare takes of your, Buffy's, body and she gets banished into the realm of dreams. It's cool to see what the the other characters are dreaming. The other major story in this book is when the Mare takes over Angel's body. This brings out Angelus too. Ethan Rayne is also involved in part of this book. There is also zombies and a mummy. If you are a fan of Buffy then I think you should pick up this book.

I admired him as both an actor and comedian. No doubt Orson Welles nailed it on the head by dubbing him, &quot;The Great One.&quot; I found this to be an unknown gem of a book on the life of Jackie Gleason. Unlike the reviewer before me, I found this book to be written quite well, lending itself a nice/personable, friendly aura to it. Actual quotes from those Gleason was close to are included and I doubt were embellished or are outright false. I also believe that this book in no way tries to cut Gleason (the man and the actor) down. On the contrary, I believe Weatherby held a certain feeling of awe for the man. Yes, he points out his highs and lows, his good traits and bad -- but is this not what a biographer is supposed to do. As a reader and fan of Gleason, I thought this to be an intersting, fun, quick, personal read. I would highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates Jackie Gleason. How sweet it was!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"A love/hate experience. Glad I read it, but also glad to finish it. The characters are aggravating and the story seems irrelevant. However, it's by F. Scott Fitzgerald - and the man can write."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"A reader of Fitzgerald will not be surprised of the themes or characters they find in this book. Here is a writer who worked out the demons of his own life, on the page, for all of us to watch. He showed us the bright light of the beautiful people that draws us close like moths at night, and the inevitable shabbiness and death of the real light of next morning.Here, as begun in \\"This Side of...\\" and ended in \\"Tender is...\\" is Fitzgerald's complicated struggle with art and love and fame. We see him force his characters to deal with the things he could not resolve in his own life: the battle with writing, and the causes of his block, the ever-present spectre of infidelity, the loss of youth, and finally, madness. We experience as he experienced, the great lie of a golden age.I can't say this was my favorite among his works, but I think it certainly sets the stage for his later works and is clearly a place where he was working on that lyric style he so perfected in \\"Gatsby\\" and \\"Tender is...\\" It is not a place to start reading Fitzgerald but offers the fan something worth their time."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Some readers discover Fitzgerald by accident, by reputation or, perhaps in school. My exposure came via the first possibility through a worn paperback copy of 'The Crack Up' soon afterward I read a paperback semi-bio called 'Crazy Sundays, F Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood'. This was in the early Seventies and at that time I couldn't find anything in print and only found his books at yard sales and used book stores. I read Gatsby, Tender is the Night and even a collection of short stories reprinted from Fitzgerald's magazine writing. Now, over thirty years later I have re-read many of those books and I find his short stories mildly enjoyable and his novels, flowery and antique. Sure, you might say, they are old books however, I re-read my other favorites from my Seventies bookshelf: Sinclair Lewis and Mark Twain and find that their styles have aged very well by comparison (and of the two, only Lewis can be considered a contemporary, Twain is even older). What does this have to do this novel? It holds-up the best in the ways that his work generally has not held-up. Perhaps it's the themes or the biographical elements but either way, this book deserves a look if you have already read his other novels and are giving up on him!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"\`\`The Beautiful and Damned,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald's second published novel, is a penetrating portrait of the idle rich. It is vital social commentary that previews themes the author would deal with in his next and best book, \`\`The Great Gatsby.''The greatest strength and greatest weakness of \`\`The Beautiful and Damned'' is that it doesn't have even one likable character. The closest we come is Muriel Kane, the friend of Gloria who volunteers for World War I nurse duty, and Joseph Bloeckman, the producer who tries to get Gloria into the movies. Bloeckman's line of work leads one to think his friendship is illusory like a movie.The story revolves around Anthony Patch, grandson of multimillionaire Adam Patch, and Gloria Gilbert, Anthony's wife. The family name is a clue that something is being masked the way a patch covers a hole. This turns out to be grandpa Patch's sleazy life as a Wall Street operator. His fortune secured, Adam Patch attempts repentance by becoming a social reformer and prohibitionist. If alive today, the senior Patch would no doubt have a talk show on right-wing radio.Anthony, an only child and layabout Harvard grad, is waiting for his grandfather to die so his life can begin in earnest. Gloria is equally aimless (who says alike repel?). Gloria, also an only child from parents living above their means, complains regularly about odors and people's cleanliness. Gloria doesn't complain about the cleanliness of boozer and smoker Anthony because he comes with the most pleasant smell of all -- the sweet savor of money.Grandfather Patch proves rather durable and this causes the marriage of Anthony and Gloria to become nearly unendurable. Money gets tight and the couple ventures out into employment with humorous and sad results -- Anthony as a stock salesman and Gloria as an actress.Fitzgerald's legendary wit is fully on display throughout. He roasts situations and institutions as well as his characters --On war (p. 249 of the Penguin paperback edition): \`\`Wilson and his cabinet -- a cabinet that in its lack of distinction was strangely reminiscent of the twelve apostles -- let loose the carefully starved dogs of war, and the press began to whoop hysterically against sinister morals, sinister philosophy and sinister music produced by the Teutonic temperament. Those who fancied themselves particularly broad-minded made the exquisite distinction that it was only the German Government which aroused them to hysteria; the rest were worked up to a condition of retching indecency.''On peace (p. 319): \`\`Over in Europe the usual number of children had swollen stomachs from starvation, and the diplomats were at their customary business of making the world safe for new wars...Peace had come down in earnest, the beginning of new days.''Anthony, survivor of a Job-like experience, finally gets what he thought he wanted. Gloria is back to her essential self. A happy ending? Not exactly. Purposelessness has taken its toll.There is much biography weaved into \`\`The Beautiful and Damned'' and that adds poignancy. The lives of Fitzgerald and wife Zelda greatly mirror Anthony and Gloria. It is amazing how a man can embrace a lifestyle yet mercilessly criticize it. This is testimony to Fitzgerald's uniqueness and power. Less honest and less talented people could not produce such work."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I believe this to be Fitzgerald's second best novel, behind &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; It took me just a few days to read because it was so captivating. For anyone who romanticizes about a fairy-tale relationship, the one between Anthony and Gloria was just that, in the beginning. Although they waste a good portion of their youth waiting for Anthony's grandfather's fortune, it's still a very romantic book. This was thoroughly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"this is a copy of the real book. don't buy it. no publishing info, no page numbers. find the real thing. really disappointing to receive."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I'd read that F. Scott Fitzgerald, older, a full-blown alcoholic with his wife in an insane asylum, went into a bookstore to find all of his books out of print and no longer on the shelves. Not even THE GREAT GATSBY. Wow.If it wasn't for the personal history of the author, I don't think I would've enjoyed Fitzgerald's second novel, THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED. The first half of the book follows a young couple living the high life in New York City, partying every night, waiting on a rich grandfather to drop dead so they can get their hands on his fortune, annoyed by World War I for interferring with their travel plans. I didn't like these people. They were snobbish and superficial, the worst kind of social climbers since they never accomplished anything. Anthony was horrified at the thought of actually working at anything and Gloria coasted along on her looks, flirting with a movie career until her looks fade away.Fitzgerald's own snobbery is evident throughout. On page 59, he turns up his nose to describe \\"The Public\\" (or \\"the Consumer\\"), the common folks out trying to enjoy themselves, and he also can't hide his distaste for the poor Southern mistress Anthony uses during his military service.I don't think I would've noticed it as much if he'd turned his critical eye to the arrogant fops who were Anthony's Harvard classmates. But they end up rich, so Fitzgerald lets them spout their pretentious and shallow philosophies unchallenged.What was really interesting to me was that THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED was written before Scott & Zelda Fitzgerald lived their own beautiful damnation, venturing much further into the dark than \\"Anthony & Gloria\\" and denied the \\"happy ending\\" manufactured for them.The Barnes & Noble Classics editions of classic novels are definitely worth reading. Pagan Harleman's Introduction perfectly sets up this novel and the footnotes and endnotes help to broaden the reader's understanding."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I bought this book because I love Fitzgerald and I hadn't read a complete Fitzgerald book. Now that I've read it, I love this book, Fitzgerald ist just impressive!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I love literature, but I make it my mission to collect the most beautiful editions of every book I adore. As soon as I opened up the package containing this item, I couldn't believe how gorgeous the cover is! So shiny! And beautifully art deco! I love it, I love it!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This book was very hard to get into. I picked this one up because I am a big fan of Great Gatsby. This is yet another reason that one should look at more than just looking for an author to select a book.The book starts out telling the story about poor Anthony Patch. His parents died when he was young and he was raised by his millionaire grandfather. He had every advantage growing up going to the best schools and had money available to him at all times.Anthony spent most of his time with his two best friends, Maury and Richard, discussing philosophy. He had never felt true love until Richard introduced Anthony to his cousin, Gloria. The love story in the beginning is entertaining to follow with Gloria's resistance and Anthony's persistence, but after they were married, the book got painful to read.I had a hard time to continue reading after constantly hearing Anthony's 'woe is me' attitude and Gloria's fickle behavior. The reason I gave the book three stars was the beautiful descriptions and imagery present. Wouldn't waste my time reading it again."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This novel turned out to be much better than its first 75 pages would suggest. On the other hand, it's no \\"Great Gatsby.\\" At its best, it is a complex portrait of a disintegrating marriage. Fitzgerald is interested in the changes love undergoes within a marital relationship, and he approaches his subject from unexpected angles; his main characters, shallow in themselves, acquire surprising depth as partners in a failing romantic enterprise. At its worst, the novel is juvenile, immature in its subject matter and its style: Fitzgerald satirizes easy targets (e.g., fat women; social climbers trying to pass themselves off as members of a higher stratum; a Japanese servant with a limited grasp of the English language, etc.), and the plot eventually devolves into lurid melodrama. The ending is almost farcical. One gets the sense that Fitzgerald grew weary of the novel at a certain point and just decided to wrap it up quickly, ripping off \\"Sister Carrie\\" and \\"L'Assommoir\\" for a sensationalistic ending.The novel is divided into three sections. In Book I, we are introduced to the protagonist, Anthony Patch. He is a good-looking Harvard graduate, presumed heir to his grandfather's fortune, who resides in languorous splendor in a Fifty-second Street New York apartment. We also meet Gloria Gilbert, a beautiful and self-possessed young woman with whom Anthony falls in love. The back-cover of my Scribner paperback version describes the novel as \\"a devastating portrait of the nouveaux riches, New York night life, reckless ambition, and squandered talent.\\" This is a bit disingenuous. The novel talks a little about New York nightlife, but there's nothing about \\"reckless ambition.\\" In fact, the principal characters are utterly without ambition beyond a vague desire to be wealthy and fabulous. This is part of their problem. Anthony and Gloria have no specific goals, no hobbies, no passionate interest in anything except themselves and alcohol. \\"Squandered talent\\" is also a stretch. Anthony is presented as a flawed individual from the onset, but in Book I Fitzgerald is trying to convince us that his main character is nonetheless brilliant, a man of unlimited potential. Unfortunately, this is difficult to swallow. Anthony's supposed brilliance is on display when he engages in intellectual arguments and clever badinage with his Harvard buddies, but the dialogue is stilted and artificial. Fitzgerald fails to convince us that Anthony embodies youthful promise. Instead, Anthony comes across as a fop whose sense of entitlement is unjustified. This is a great weakness of the novel because in order for Anthony to fulfill his role as Talent Squandered in Book III, his potential for greatness should have been established in Books I or II.Book II, in which the marriage of Anthony and Gloria is dissected, is very well done. Although they initially were drawn to each other for reasons that do not bode well for a marriage - Gloria admires Anthony for being defiantly useless, \\"a brilliantly meaningless figure in a meaningless world,\\" while Anthony is entranced by Gloria's beauty, self-absorption, and indifference to him - for a while true love blossoms. It is an intense love, destined to burn brightly yet briefly. As the fervor cools, Fitzgerald traces the relationship's decline in meticulous, chronological detail, lingering over each stage of waning love and burgeoning contempt. Both characters are well delineated; they come to life in the reader's mind and seem ever more real as they grow further apart. Among other things, their marriage is affected by the simple fact that Gloria and Anthony are growing older and more mature. As far as Fitzgerald is concerned, maturation is not a good thing. Fitzgerald's fascination with youth is famous. His belief that life is effectively over after, say, the age of 23 is in evidence here, and anyone who believes that our nation's current obsession with youth is unique to this country or to our era should revisit Fitzgerald (or Boccaccio, for that matter) to be reminded that by the age of 29, a man has \\"ceased to be an individual of mental adventure, of curiosity, and (has) become an individual of bias and prejudice, with a longing to be emotionally undisturbed...We substitute rules of conduct for ideas of integrity, we value safety above romance, we become, quite unconsciously, pragmatic.\\"In Book III, Fitzgerald reexamines the philosophy upon which Anthony has structured his entire existence, the belief that \\"nothing much is worth doing.\\" Fitzgerald's characters are now approaching early middle age, and the author seems to be mourning the loss of their youthful arrogance. There's nothing wrong with being lazy and useless, Fitzgerald argues, as long as one is lazy and useless with panache. Only the young can pull this off successfully; middle-aged people, lacking bravado, merely become ineffectual. Likewise, only the young can be spectacularly callous like Gloria in Book I. Self-doubt and a sense of conscience creep in at a certain age. Anthony and Gloria are no more flawed than they were at the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald seems to be saying, but now their flaws are less attractive.All in all, not bad. I give it 3.62 stars."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fitzgerald's farce or satire on upper crust New Yorkers can only be described as being realty becoming greater than fiction. Proclaiming the story \\"was all true\\", Fitzgerald intimated that this book was something akin to a kiss-and-tell novel about what had happened within America's richest crowd during the time of World War I.\\"Anthony, Maury, and Dick sent in their applications for officers' training-camps and the two latter went about feeling strangely exalted and reproachless; they chattered to each other, like college boys, of war's being the one excuse for, and justification of, the aristocrat, and conjured up an impossible caste of officers, to be composed, it appeared, chiefly of the more attractive alumni of three or four eastern colleges.\\"Princetonian Fitzgerald created a Harvard protagonist Anthony Patch whose birth right is basically his only strong characteristic - at least so at the end of the novel. During his venerable youth, he locks eyes onto friend Rick's cousin, beautiful Gloria, whose unique spirit and vivaciousness make the self-described bachelor become betrothed.The book follows the couple for a period of just less than a decade, during which time they fall into numerous elations, and depressions. This see-saw bipolar personality/lifestyle depiction is all-too-common in Fitzgerald's novels. Such was well accentuated in Fitzgerald's doctor and patient relationship in \\"Tender is the Night\\" as the patient is ultimately cured and the doctor falls into a deep feeling of desultory depression -- dipsomania. Another of Fitzgerald's common themes is of men chasing after beautiful women who make the boys feel blushing discomfiture. Well depicted here with Gloria as well as in \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and its Amory Blaine who constantly trips in his whirlwind attempts to conquer beautiful Rosalind (whose personality and looks mirror those of Gloria).As the book progresses, you see the self esteem of Anthony deflate, while his wife amazingly awaits him to recover, by miracle or otherwise, and be the man she grew to love at the tender age of 22. Like \\"Tender is the Night\\", alcohol interferes with the person and with his relationships -- Anthony becomes a drunken \\"bore.\\"There are points of this book you have to think - is this a hypothetical autobiography. Had \\"Tender is the Night\\" bombed instead of won critical acclaim, would not Fitzgerald have fallen into the liquor bottle like Anthony? I am sure he wondered as such.But, as sad as the book can be, Fitzgerald had times of folly and humor. Even a self-deprecating humor. He writes, in one discourse where the people talk disapprovingly about the new novels: \\"You know these new novels make me tired. My God! Everywhere I go some silly girl asks me if I've read \`This Side of Paradise.' Are our girls really like that?\\"Amazingly well written, and even more astonishing in that Fitzgerald was 25 years old when he wrote this novel, this book deserves its acclaim and infamy."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Anthony Patch is the hero. His wealthy grandfather supports prohibition, and THE BEATIFUL AND DAMNED is the best temperance tract ever written. It's frightening to see that even in his mid-twenties Fitzgerald was already working his favorite theme: the degeneration and final collapse of a promising man ruined by a woman, by drinking, and by the shallow life of a partier. What he learned from his wife's mental collapse before he wrote TENDER IS THE NIGHT he already knew more than ten years earlier, when he started THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED. He rejected twentieth century capitalistic social values in order to produce beauty; his wife rejected them more simply, just by being beautiful. In THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED this brave decision, beauty before everything else, leads to triumph and collapse -- and neither the author nor the reader can tell whether the triumph is worth the collapse, or the collapse proves the triumph is just an illusion. Or whether it's all just an alcoholic's dream.Fitzgerald himself appears in the novel as a minor character, a friend of Anthony Patch's with a successful first novel who degenerates into a writer of popular trash. That was how Fitzgerald saw his own short stories, but the serious novels he really wanted to write were deliberately, terrifyingly empty, and in a way THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED is more open about its emptiness than THE GREAT GATSBY. Gatsby is able to work and thinks the wealthy Daisy whom he loves is a wonderful person. He doesn't get her, but he keeps his illusions. Anthony Patch knows he has nothing to live for, and he is incapable of Gatsby's kind of work and dedication. He loves only beauty, and he knows his love will destroy him. He uses alcohol, which he swears he'll never give up and predicts will kill him at forty (just like it would kill Fitzgerald) -- he uses alcohol to make sure his destruction is as ugly and humiliating as possible. Meanwhile his wife Gloria, beauty itself, just grows old and ugly, as beauty always does. And that's the whole book, unless you want to go along with one of Fitzgerald's many drunken jokes, and see it as Anthony's grandfather's triumphant proof that beauty is worthless and business is all.It's a great book that got great editing (from Maxwell Perkins, perhaps the twentieth century's greatest editor), and it is meant to be one of the saddest books anyone ever read. I take away one star because I don't think the characters had much potential to begin with -- but that's part of the point Fitzgerald is trying to make: nobody has enough potential to beat the emptiness of life. Okay, then I take away one star because the book glorifies drinking -- but I can't forget all the great poems that do the same thing. I take away one star because I have more sympathy for Gatsby and Dick Diver of TENDER IS THE NIGHT -- but I suspect that's because those books are less honest than this one."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This novel pretty much hits you over the head with its message, which is that people have to have some purpose in their lives (besides being rich and beautiful).Fitzgerald's protagonist, Anthony Patch, is a young man of leisure who expects to inherit substantial wealth one day. He marries a beautiful nihilist, Gloria, and lives a life of pleasure seeking with her until he becomes an alcoholic and approaches his ruin. He's a mean drunk, too, and in case the reader has any remaining sympathy for him, Fitzgerald has him tell a story about once kicking a kitten.While it is beautifully written, and probably has value as a cautionary tale, more subtlety would have made this a better novel."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The Beautiful and Damned:A Look into the Elite&quot;As you first see him he wonders frequently, whether he is not without honor and slightly mad.&quot; This type of confusion is typical when following the characters through their whirlwind lifestyles in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, the Beautiful and Damned. Fitzgerald portrays the rich and shameful through the eyes of one of New England's socialites. Fitzgerald holds nothing back when his characters come in contact with alcohol, nightlife, and women in 1910's New York. Having wealth doesn't always bring the happiness and comfort that every human needs and wants.The action begins by trailing Anthony Patch and his friends fresh out of Harvard. His social status comes from his grandfather, who was a big reformer back in the late 1850's. Anthony and his friends, Maury Nobel and Richard Caramel maintain a lifestyle of extravagant meals and lavish Broadway plays. Anthony's life suddenly takes a turn when he meets Gloria Gilbert. Soon after meeting her, he falls head over heels in love, then beginning a romantic journey with Gloria. Anthony and Gloria finalize their love with marriage. The story unfolds through the trials and tribulations of marriage life for the two.The realistic setting of 1913's New York City and the Boston area is one of the most important elements of the book. The events that occur could only happen in the New York night life. Each character slowly realizes that they would never live anywhere else in world. Through the book, Anthony &quot;found himself thoroughly enjoying New York.&quot; Fitzgerald drew from his own experiences in New York, one of the most influential cities of the 1920's and 1930's. Some other major U.S. cities came into play for the happy couple on their honeymoon. They travel to places like &quot;Chicago, Hot Springs and the West.&quot; Without the setting the story would never work out the same.The protagonist, Anthony Patch is a tall and thin, 25 year old, meek and simple man, who aspires to be an aesthete. He also looks for love in the big city. Sure enough he finds it with Gloria Gilbert. After the honeymoon, he soon realizes that his new wife becomes dependent on material things. Anthony soon finds his life falling into a financial downward spiral. Gilbert, the antagonist, is a 22 year old free spirit coming from the mid-west. After marriage her true colors bleed through, making Anthony realize that she is not the woman he thought. Gloria realizes that he becomes boring to her and she doesn't love him, but she stays for the financial security. Maury Nobel and Richard Caramel are long time friends of Anthony. Richard, a best-selling author, feels much older than the others. He is a short, bald man. Maury, tall and thin, nervous man, meets his best friend at Harvard.The pace of the plot starts out slow, but then picks up. All the elements of the book come together very well. Fitzgerald takes the reader to 1913's New York to the life of Anthony Patch. His fast pace lifestyle reflects into his marriage, which is run by greed and alcohol. The plot moves smoothly and is simple to understand, which makes it easier to have fun reading this book. Fitzgerald's rendition of a new couple in a big city relates too much of the population.The type of language Fitzgerald use is sophisticated yet casual English. The diction shows the readers that both Fitzgerald and the characters of the novel have high levels of education. The language explains one of the most important factors in the book: money. &quot;A classic is a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation,&quot; this quote is classic for some of the conversations between Maury and Anthony. The chance of higher education gives the characters multiple opportunities for a better life.The Beautiful and Damned depicts the stereotypical views of the wealthy not having problems when in fact they have many of the same problems as everyday, ordinary people. When all the events of the book join together, it becomes a wonderful piece of literature. Some of other Fitzgerald's novels in include The Great Gatsby and This Side of Paradise. This book is beautifully written and very entertaining to read."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"It's hard to believe The Beautiful and Damned was written by the same author as The Great Gatsby. It's like Fitzgerald wrote this before he met Hemingway and Hemingway taught him how to write. I should like this book: I love The Great Gatsby, I enjoy ornate prose, and I appreciate watching a character slowly spiral downward. But it just does not work for me here.The main character is the scion of a wealthy family, a 1920s socialite, and a terrible drunk. The book mainly consists of his alcohol-soaked escapades as his life slowly disintegrates. What else is a wealthy couple to do? The ending is more than a bit manufactured and takes away from the rest of the novel."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Thought provoking and heartfelt, you get to know all of the characters intimately. And, as with all F Scott Fitzgerald books, it's very beautifully written. This is as much a poem as a fiction story."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This is the first F. Scott Fitzgerald book I ever read and I felt like my reading experience was accentuated by recently having read a biography of Zelda Fitzgerald. I know that Fitzgerald used Zelda's actual expressions and writings when creating his female characters and it was interesting to have the context to be able to see it. It is absolutely chilling to know that Fitzgerald will drink himself to death while you're reading about a potentially talented young man who is drinking himself to death.The story is engaging and immediate. There were multiple points where I stopped to admire the language or reread a passage. When I wasn't reading the book, I was thinking about it. I did feel that Fitzgerald showed an over-reliance on some words (\\"fatuous\\" appeared way too often) and at times I felt like stuff was just being thrown on the page indiscriminately. I also wish that Fitzgerald hadn't delivered portions of the story with lengthy dialogue in play-style.I'm glad I read and I plan to fill in the gaps in my reading by adding more Fitzgerald to my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"When I finished reading this book, I felt conflicted and a little confused about whether I liked it or not. An inner dialogue ran thus: \\"What?\\".I understand the impatience that some may feel for the rambling tone of the book. I have left many a book unread for just that reason. However, this one kept me going back for more. Knowing FSF, I was fairly certain it wouldn't lead to a predictable conclusion, but that didn't mean it would lead to a good one.Though I knew the title, I hadn't really ever heard much about this book before. I think I understand why now, it is definitely not one to be cubby-holed.If you are a moralist, you may be outraged at the end. If you are a keen observer of humanity and know how floppy we all really are, you'll understand and laugh at how the author ended it. I know I did, once I got over being nonplussed."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Being a long-time fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald, I was not at all disappointed with this novel. The language was masterful and romantic, drawing me into the beautiful and oftentimes sad and frustrating tale of Anthony and Gloria. The first half of the book was enjoyable, filled with the dreams of every young person who falls in love with the boy she never thought she'd like or the girl he never thought he would get. The second half is relatable and sad, as the couple discovers aspects of the other that he or she never thought would be seen. All the while, the common elements of the 1910's and 1920's--drinking, parties, and the promise of fortune--pervade the novel.There were some confusing points where Fitzgerald writes in the style of a play, and the characters are acting as on a stage. I was a litle thrown off by these interjections in style, but that did not make the story any less enjoyable. Overall, I enjoyed the novel, and would recommend it for Fitzgerald fans."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"For those who have read F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous 1931 short story \\"Babylon Revisited,\\" this 1922 novel reads like a prequel, detailing the descent of a couple too beautiful for their own good. It's a mesmerizing, brilliantly written book that still leaves a mark.The Pagan Harleman introduction to my excellent Barnes & Noble edition notes \\"The Beautiful And Damned\\" is \\"Fitzgerald's least-known novel,\\" but it could also be his most intrinsic. Fitzgerald will, and should, always be known as the man who wrote \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" but this lines up more with what we think of when we think of him, of rich and bright young people throwing their lives away in search of elusive pleasures and verities.\\"Things are sweeter when they're lost,\\" observes the novel's main protagonist, Anthony Patch. \\"I know - because once I wanted something and got it. It was the only thing I ever wanted badly, Dot. And when I got it it turned to dust in my hands.\\"Patch is speaking here of the novel's other main character, his partner in dissolution, Gloria. If his first novel, \\"This Side Of Paradise,\\" serves as F. Scott Fitzgerald's literary introduction, \\"Beautiful And Damned\\" is when he unveiled the other half of his legacy, Zelda. As he writes of Gloria Gilbert, he might have written for Zelda Fitzgerald, \\"whose radiant fire and freshness was the living material of which the dead beauty of books was made.\\"Gloria doesn't exactly line up with the former Miss Sayre; at one point in the novel she brags about not reading books whereas Zelda was quite a literary-minded person. But as a Southern belle of decided caprice and high temper, Gloria clearly is based on Scott's then-new bride to a great degree, and that knowledge adds to the experience of reading this book. How did the bedroom conversations go while Zelda read this over his shoulder?Not too terribly, I think. Gloria is presented as a bit of a headcase and the butt of some comedy in the book's earlier, lightest third. As the novel develops, however, our sympathies move from Anthony to her. She's stronger, and despite her words, more reliable in action. Her worst fault may be in sticking with Anthony as long as she does.Anthony is the novel's problematic center, a shiftless layabout at the mercy of whatever wind catches him, content to await the inheritance of his grandfather's Midas-like legacy. Fitzgerald's great achievement here, other than his constant amazing flows of descriptive prose and his deft shifts from comedy to tragedy, is his ability to keep us sympathetic to Anthony despite his many failings. His plight is fully self-made, yet you feel for him like you might a moth at a candle.Are there flaws here? Yes, but they work in the context of the novel. Minor storylines regarding such things as the religious leanings of Gloria's mother disappear unresolved, while others like the interest in Gloria of a moviemaker mutate strangely into relative dead ends. These feel less like missteps while you are reading, though, and more like the rushing flow of life one experiences when young. Fitzgerald's racial and social biases are on stark display at times, but they reflect the thinking of his characters and the narrowness of their world, and so work, too.Most amazing to me was that Fitzgerald was only 25 and at the height of his fortune when he wrote this mature and prescient tale of trouble ahead. It's a fine companion to \\"Babylon Revisited\\" that way, too; a worried look forward rather than a wan look back."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I love this book, I have read this one 3 times. It's about a very young, beautiful, concieted, explosive couple That keep making the same bad decisions over and over until they realixe in the end their lives are over and miserable and they are damned. I love to hate the 2 main characters. Read it."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"\`Beauty will be born' as a flapper. Ushering in an era, something new and complex that people will love but will equally taint and be tainted by having existed at all.Essentially the story of Anthony & Gloria Patch. The prior, an intelligent, striking fellow educated at Harvard and able to woo just about any woman he'd desire. The later, a \\"vamp\\" of emotion, incredibly striking, pushy but devoted. The two are intending to live off of Anthony's inheritance once his grandfather passes but during the meantime they intend to revel as much as possible and work the opposite - so it's done.This is a progressive story which sees the characters initially very young, nave and rather unshaped. However, as the story progresses and the characters develop they turn into solid figures but none-the-less shells of their former selves.Alcoholism and moral depravity abound as frequent drunken revels and the youthful philosophizing of life turn into hatred, squalor, carelessness, dispassion and a dropping of the youthfully optimistic veil that hides the true cruelties of life. These become increasingly more evident as Anthony drags Gloria down the socio-economic ladder and both are gradually abandoned by their \`friends' as the couple tread closer to destitution.Passion ebbs, flows, dies, revives - thoughts disappear because thinking is frugal, this replaced by hedonism and loathing, both of the \`self' and of \`anyone who does anything'.In the end Anthony considers himself to have won the fight (or the goal to do as little as possible but \`enjoy life') while positing that he was always alone and that anyone whom he'd let in had become an adversary at some point - he beat them but at what cost?"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald will forever be known for his immortal staple in the curriculum's of so many high schools across America and abroad -- The Great Gatsby. But for those readers who really want an insight into the life and style of the writer, I would certainly recommend this book. I found this more pleasurable to read than even This Side of Paradise. I also find it would be foolish to claim The Beautiful and Damned wasn't a premonition of what Fitzgerald saw in his personal relationship with his wife Zelda. Alas, Anthony and Gloria possess the same hedonistic materialism that he found in themselves. Regardless of how or why he created this work, I'm extremely glad he did. Fitzgerald is a writer that I enjoy introducing to others, and I'm pleased that most people are willing to know him as more than just the \\"guy who wrote Gatsby\\".Good reading to all!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"As anticipated, Fitzgerald's writing is electric and beautiful. The story, however, is a sad account of two people's plummet into depression and despair. I wish I could have walked away feeling some kind of excitement or lesson learned from this book, but I instead came away with a dark outlook on humanity as it pertains to money and lust."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Recently sauntering into a Fitzgerald phase, after rereading (or should I admit, like a former lackadaisical high schooler, reading for the first time) the Great Gatsby, I selected a second Fitzgerald for comparison and contrast. The similarities are obvious, a cast of characters ensconced by the status of wealth in the early 20th century. I believe Beautiful and Damned arrived previous to Gatsby, and whereas it has less popularity I would hesitate to suggest that it lacks worthiness. It is heavy in melancholy. It is generous in melodrama, more than Gatsby. An excellent read, a depressing read, it is a Henry Jamsian entreaty on the emptiness of the (dare I type it) American Dream, when coupled with haughty aspiration, and betrothed to hedonistic materialism."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This was a great book that highlighted the classic character development that Fitzgerald is so popular for. I hated some of the main characters, which for me is a positive, because they made me feel something. Nice story with lots of sub-plots. Great, but frustrating ending!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I absolutely love Fitzgerald. And this books written about the Jazz Age are my favorites of his. The characters are complex and the story is intriguing. I couldn't put it down. What makes a book stand out for me is whether or not it made me think, and this book definitely did. I recommend this 100% for any fan of The Great Gatsby or other Fitzgerald novels or short stories."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Length:: 5:04 MinsIn this video review I give a plot synopsis, read a passage, and give my overall opinion of the book. More info at http://owenhorwitzhonors.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"It's satirical, it's touching, it's a brilliant capturing of the era. I'm amazed this novel isn't read as widely as Gatsby. I love Gatsby and think it is one of the best American novels ever written, and I enjoyed The Beautiful and Damned just as much. The Roaring 20s certainly are captured well here in all of their booming and partying excitement. It's a time period I'd certainly love to have experienced."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The American reading public seems to reduce \`classic authors' to one-hit wonders: The Stranger, Catcher in the Rye, Vanity Fair, Frankenstein, Catch-22, Oedipus the King, etc. One great work seems to exhaust us and we move on. The only real exceptions are situations in which the author has two great works of moral equivalency: Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-four, Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Iliad and The Odyssey.A victim of the one-book limit on our memories is The Beautiful and Damned. No, it's not as good as The Great Gatsby. But then again -- to paraphrase Joseph Heller -- neither is any other American novel. If it weren't for Jay Gatsby, however, this other work by F. Scott Fitzgerald would likely often be raised up as a candidate for \`the Great American Novel'.I was blown away by it. It's divided into roughly three parts, following the third decade of life of a useless Harvard alum living in New York City named Anthony Comstock Patch. The first period is youthful exuberance. It reads like it was written by a kid who woke up one day being after being anointed the Chosen One by the gods of literature. It's got this \`Wow, I can write beautiful prose about anything!' euphoria to it. The prose bedazzles and astonishes, careening as it does from one pointless bit to another as it lampoons the East Coast elite. It shifts tenses for no reason, abruptly goes into the format of a play for couple of pages at a stretch and generally dances its way through the nonadventures of several extremely wealthy young men. The words on the page are relentless brilliant. Even getting up to leave is memorable: \`Anthony arose and punched himself into his overcoat. . .'This first section is hilarious. Typically, when I discover something from before WWII that was meant to be humorous, I cringe to myself because it's not funny anymore. The opening of this book, after a slightly dry description of Anthony Patch's familial background, satirizes the wealthy, their pretensions, their sense of entitlement, their superiority, with unerring accuracy. It's laugh-out-loud funny but never mean-spirited.I hate spoilers. Suffice to say that the second and third sections get uglier as relationships get more serious. What we forgive in the young we find more disappointing in people as they age. (A Peter Pan with a puffy-eyed hangover at thirty is not a pretty sight.) The prose, however, loses little momentum as the story flirts with disaster.In addition to the writing itself, what really struck me was how Fitzgerald could create a sense of empathy for such appalling characters. If Anthony Patch was a real person, he'd be the poster child for Marxism. Yet Fitzgerald can get us to care about him and his ilk, people who are in truth little more than lazy, absentmindedly racist, decidedly misogynistic alcoholic snobs. (Indeed, this novel could be read as the parable about the consequences of misogyny on men.) If someone told me that it would be possible to write a novel in which you feel for a character who jokes about kicking a kitten -- we're left hoping it was a joke -- I would have said it was impossible, but there you have it.The novel also makes the time period covered, from shortly before WWI to the Roaring Twenties, come vividly alive. Anthony Patch becomes the embodiment of America, starting in innocence, becoming disillusioned with war and ending in the boozy disillusionment of Prohibition. (And no, that's not really a spoiler.) It's not simply Anthony that oozes a sense of time and place: the novel is animated by consumer products of the period, suggests a critique of suburbia forty years head of its time and is filled with fascination with those new technologies, the car and the feature-length film.In short, The Beautiful and Damned probably offers more per page than just about any other novel you might read. Except The Great Gatsby.This review is based on an out of print hardback from the library, not this particular edition."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I recently went to see Gatz, the wonderful adaptation of Gatsby by the Elevator Repair Service, and it inspired me to go back to Fitzgerald's body of work. I had read all the major the major works except for The Beautiful and Damned, and I decided to remedy that gap.The Beautiful and Damned is an interesting book-- I probably liked it the least of all the Fitzgerald works, but I like his work enough that this is far from a bad thing. I could have lived without the overly obvious moralizing genaralities, but Fitzgerald himself recognized that this book had been written in too much of a hurry.The major strength of the novel is, of course, the characters. We have all known versions of Gloria and Anthony Patch. We went to college with them. They were the social butterflies who seemed to have no worries, no weaknesses, and no real cares. We all assume that somewhere along the way they had to have stopped partying and found something to do-- you cannot imagine these people at 30. The Beautiful and Damned is something about what happens when the butterflies of the world keep going well past the point of excusable youthful mistakes.People who already enjoy Fitzgerald should give The Beautiful and the Damned a read. It is certainly no Great Gatsby, but still contains much of the style and talent that made Fitzgerald so justly famous. Pay particular attention to the language and the turn of the phrase-- even in his lesser works, Fitzgerald is unparalleled at his particular kind of style."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This story follows the lives of two good-looking, hip, and sufficiently wealthy people. They do not need to work, and in a sense don't know how, and this, among other privileges, eventually leads to their undoing. Their leisure condemns them. I read this book while I was going through a season of envying the people in my life who are independently wealthy, and don't have to punch an alarm clock each morning to \\"join the fray.\\" They seem oblivious to the frustrations I encounter working two jobs, watching my budget, buying sensibly. This story served as a reminder that, while challenging, my lifestyle of \\"earning my living\\" provides a healthy groundedness and sensibility that I may not get any other way."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This is perhaps Fitzgerlad's most touching and beautiful work. He is one of the very few novelist who has the ability to draw the reader in and make him feel the story personaly. Fitzgerald's lyrical flow will sweep up any intelectual reader and forever change him."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"i enjoyed this book much more than The Great Gatsby. I true masterpiece and a must-read for all thinking young people."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This is my favorite Fitzgerald novel. Because the main characters were supposed to be based on Fitzgerald and his wife, the relationship between Anthony and Gloria was especially interesting. The 1920s are a period that fascinates me, so the background of this story was exciting for me. Fitzgerald's writing is great, and he has his usual sharp insights into society."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Set at the dawn of the Jazz Age in a blooming New York that is at the same time the picture of decadence and searing poverty, this story centers on the generation of aimless wealthy who, as the descendants of hard-working pioneer fathers and grandfathers, have been handed their money and privilege without too much toil on their part, thereby playing out that ages-old cautionary tale about the children of the rich who grow up listless, jaded, and a little cold because they can't even begin to grasp the morality and ethics of the working class who afforded them the privilege in the first place.Forwarding the story here is Anthony Patch, a layabout if there ever was one since he's banking wholeheartedly on inheriting his grandfather's millions. Not that he's entirely unlikable; when he's not partying or sleeping off the latest booze-fest, he can wax philosophical with a few friends and even manages to join the army for a brief stint, although what could be a promising career is soon derailed by his usual bad behavior. Anthony's counterpart is his wife Gloria, a Midwest beauty of the genteel poverty station in life who enraptures Anthony with her blend of outrageous flirtatiousness and astonishing narcissism. Equally directionless, Gloria too shows glimmers of insight and intelligence on the few occasions she's not shopping for a new dress or obsessing about getting older (she nearly commits suicide as the doddering old age of 26 looms). Both of them obsess continuously about \\"the inheritance\\", drink too much and live far beyond their means, and after only a few years of marriage find themselves knee-deep in the kind of gradual deterioration that eats slowly away at love, like a book left outside in the rain. It's still hanging on, but a shell of what it was. According to some sources it's loosely - or not so loosely, depending on who tells it - based on Fitzgerald's own marriage to Zelda Sayre.Written a few years after The Great Gatsby, The Beautiful and Damned was not the commercial or critical success Gatsby was, but I found it fascinating. I think Fitzgerald is the 1920's version of Bret Easton Ellis in the way he examines the American upper classes, especially the tendency for succeeding generations to become less and less useful or motivated, a sort of dilution in progress, a result of too much given and not enough taught."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I have never read a book quite like this. It was written in 1922 supposedly, yet feels unbelievably modern. It's funny and sardonic and heartbreaking and very very real. The way Fitzgerald observes his world, in such ripely vivid and specific detail, with little overly portentious and self-aware \\"symbolism\\" makes it seem like you could reach out and touch it. Fitzgerald's flair for capturing people, both in their best and worst selves, his uncanny self-knowledge, his ability to understand and beautifully elucidate the problems of his group, while caught so inexplicably and fatally in their grasp is incredible. Anthony and Gloria are true originals, although I believe they are highly based on Scott and his wife Zelda. One of the things I really liked about this book is that it lacks the polish and spareness of Gatsby although that is one of my favourite books too. The characters are really allowed to breath in this novel and if the plot is rambling at times, it is nonetheless compulsively readable.The amazing thing about this book is that Anthony and Gloria should, on the surface be completely unsympathetic characters. They are rich, trust fund kids who are excellent at partying and spending money and terrible at the practicalities of making money and unprepared for the practical business of being adults. Yet their Fitzgerald never looks down his nose or laughs at them and even through what might seem like inexcusable behaviour I never lost my attachment for either character.Some of these reviews I've read here condemn Fitzgerald for moralizing with this book, that the whole message of it is \\"to do something with your life.\\" Yet I don't think that's it at all. Basically in the book we have two characters who are deeply in love with each other and formed partly by their innate natures and partly by the way they were raised to be unsuited to the business of work and practical life. Yes, the characters are at fault, but Fitzgerald subtly indicates that part of the fault is American society itself, with its ridiculous military traditions, elevation of banality to a high art (the inspid \\"Heart Talks\\" pamphlets) and the hypocracsy of the great \\"moral reformer\\" who would cut his only heir out of his will for drinking. Gloria is an amazing character, a marvel of specificity and close observation. I love her because she is quite unappolagetically herself. A woman who as wretched as she may be at times is perfectly comfortable in her own skin and feels no need to bend to the \\"proper female image\\" of her time. While she is selfish and cruel at times, there isn't a malicious thing about her. If they are both snobs, well they freely admit it. The only thing I dislike is the ending, which I find doesn't quite do the complex Anthony justice and is not really realistic in terms of the character's mental health. Fitzgerald reveals his own flawed soul on the page with such honesty. Never before have I read of a relationship that felt so real to me, that is reflected on with such honesty and generosity of spirit. Fitzgerald was truly a master of his art and I am only sorry he was underappreciated in his time."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"As a fan of Fitzgerald's writing, I was truly disappointed bythis book. Verbose and somewhat boring early on in the text, the bookhas none of the best qualities of his better works. His tendency to write the elegant sentence is taken too far too often in this text, having the effect of a continual stream of unnecessary adjectives normally associated with writers below his caliber. The work also seems thrown together, with pieces of stage script and overly-sentimental poetry splashed among the pages. I can't help but think, with respect to how unpolished the product was, that he had an idea and a deadline and the deadline won. Better books to read by Fitzgerald are The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and even the unfinished The Love of the Last Tycoon. His collected short stories also offer enjoyable reading. I realize I am at odds here, but I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fitzgerald's farce or satire on upper crust New Yorkers can only be described as being realty becoming greater than fiction. Proclaiming the story \\"was all true\\", Fitzgerald intimated that this book was something akin to a kiss-and-tell novel about what had happened within America's richest crowd during the time of World War I.\\"Anthony, Maury, and Dick sent in their applications for officers' training-camps and the two latter went about feeling strangely exalted and reproachless; they chattered to each other, like college boys, of war's being the one excuse for, and justification of, the aristocrat, and conjured up an impossible caste of officers, to be composed, it appeared, chiefly of the more attractive alumni of three or four eastern colleges.\\"Princetonian Fitzgerald created a Harvard protagonist Anthony Patch whose birth right is basically his only strong characteristic - at least so at the end of the novel. During his venerable youth, he locks eyes onto friend Rick's cousin, beautiful Gloria, whose unique spirit and vivaciousness make the self-described bachelor become betrothed.The book follows the couple for a period of just less than a decade, during which time they fall into numerous elations, and depressions. This see-saw bipolar personality/lifestyle depiction is all-too-common in Fitzgerald's novels. Such was well accentuated in Fitzgerald's doctor and patient relationship in \\"Tender is the Night\\" as the patient is ultimately cured and the doctor falls into a deep feeling of desultory depression -- dipsomania. Another of Fitzgerald's common themes is of men chasing after beautiful women who make the boys feel blushing discomfiture. Well depicted here with Gloria as well as in \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and its Amory Blaine who constantly trips in his whirlwind attempts to conquer beautiful Rosalind (whose personality and looks mirror those of Gloria).As the book progresses, you see the self esteem of Anthony deflate, while his wife amazingly awaits him to recover, by miracle or otherwise, and be the man she grew to love at the tender age of 22. Like \\"Tender is the Night\\", alcohol interferes with the person and with his relationships -- Anthony becomes a drunken \\"bore.\\"There are points of this book you have to think - is this a hypothetical autobiography. Had \\"Tender is the Night\\" bombed instead of won critical acclaim, would not Fitzgerald have fallen into the liquor bottle like Anthony? I am sure he wondered as such.But, as sad as the book can be, Fitzgerald had times of folly and humor. Even a self-deprecating humor. He writes, in one discourse where the people talk disapprovingly about the new novels: \\"You know these new novels make me tired. My God! Everywhere I go some silly girl asks me if I've read \`This Side of Paradise.' Are our girls really like that?\\"Amazingly well written, and even more astonishing in that Fitzgerald was 25 years old when he wrote this novel, this book deserves its acclaim and infamy."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Tragic, but I keep going back.

The substance of The Beautiful and Damned is essentially trivial, and yet the novel is transcendentally moving. Anthony and Gloria Patch are hardly sympathetic personages, but by the time the novel reaches its climax, you care about them, you want them to win. They persevere in their dissolution and are rewarded by an after-the-fact imprimatur. You feel that, like Fitzgerald, they will not see old age, but they've got what they want now, which is what counts. The language, of course, is (no other term will do) beautiful.

Scott Fitzgerald's powerful penning, I suggest you avoid this audiobook. While undoubtedly well-meant, the narrator's obsession with enunciation becomes quite annoying when prolonged over a 15-hour period. Passionate dialogue and magnificent descriptions rapidly grow dissatisfying and forced when inflicted with the meticulous pronunciation of even the most common words.

Whilst Fitzgerald is undoubtedly an excellent writer, this novel left me cold. The descriptions of the places and the atmosphere of the setting were really evocative, however I found the main characters, Anthony, Gloria and their friends cold, calculating and shallow. Gloria is obsessed by her looks and Anthony thinks of himself as an intellectual too good to have to work. They are complacent, and their apathy towards anything but their pursuit of pleasure and their inheritance comes through. Although I do not doubt that Anthony & Gloria loved each other, they loved themselves more. Their passion for each other was lacking.

I felt that the content of the story is still timely, but I also felt that it would have had more of an impact on the populace of America in the '20s. Today's men and women have changed from the attitudes projected in Beautiful and Damned. It is definitely interesting as a window to the past, but I didn't feel it speaks loudly to this generation of young lovers."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The reader witnesses Fitzgerald's characters as they pass the time and age, but refuse to grow. The main character emerges from a priviledged upbrining and proceeds to alienate those around him with his destructive behavior. Through ironic plot twists and an extremely ironic ending, Fitzgerald question the morals of this and every following generation."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Anthony Patch, undeserving heir to a multi-million dollar estate, grows increasingly annoying, petty, and selfish as this novel progresses. He is an admirable college student as the novel begins, seemingly trying to 'find himself' and live up to his grandfather's expectations. But as his financial security destabilizes, so does his moral character. It's an interesting progression, all the more fascinating because it gives us working class types an opportunity to despise the filthy rich. There are definitely some slow moments in the novel, alot of forced philosophical musings, but the prose and the soap-opera like ending make it worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I quite liked this. His style is meant to be savoured - it's rich and magical and dense in imagery. There is a lyric quality in his descriptions now - he has a fine ear for language, for stringing words and ideas together to present beautiful and innovative images. It especially comes out in his descriptions of New York in the first section, where, instead of giving you an exact idea of what buildings there are and which people are walking past in concrete terms, he recreates a vivid mood and atmosphere that is sparkling with life.This is again about the rich and privileged, who have the double fortune of being beautiful and charismatic as well. Anthony Patch and Gloria Gilbert are quintessential Fitzgerald characters - the handsome and intelligent man who is undone by his weakness and apathy; the woman defined by her impossible beauty who is nevertheless childish and immature. It places them at the pinnacle of high society in 1920s New York, then charts the breakdown of their lives from a whirlwind of pointless pleasure and parties to poverty, alcoholism, despair and finally madness.The romance between Anthony and Gloria is finely detailed once they are married, but appears superficial till then. No compelling reason is given for Gloria's change of heart; it's a bit strange to believe that such an avowedly selfish creature would love Anthony so much. There is no climax, but perhaps that was Fitzgerald's intention; that their existences would simply sputter to a pathetic and unprepossessing halt, and therein lies the tragedy.One thing I find a bit iffy is how come Anthony managed fine all his life living as a gentleman of leisure who, surely, spent a lot; then fell apart once Gloria came along. Also, why exactly were they so bent on seeking pleasure at all costs? Fitzgerald speaks vaguely of finding an emptiness in their lives after they'd become accustomed to being married; and needing to fill that up with parties and invitations - but why? Were they simply such weak individuals that they could not restrain themselves? That isn't quite a satisfactory answer.The question is - could they have stopped this disaster from happening? Was it pre-determined or could they have turned things round for themselves? I think the answer would be yes. It seems impossible, reading about them in the first section, to imagine them in the state they were in by the book's ending; or vice versa. There were so many opportunities - Anthony getting jobs, becoming a war correspondent for instance; apologising to his grandfather, although that was tough; just plain bloody stopping the parties. But I think once Anthony became an adulterer, their fate was sealed. That was, in a way, his ultimate fall from grace; and it was a short way to disillusionment and alcoholism from there."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I downloaded this because after reading the Great Gatsby I was a fan and I wanted to check out some of his other works."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"THis work is absollutely brilliant. Althoug it often gets lost when compared to Fitzgeralds other works, it is still among the best works that arose from the 'lost generation.' Although it follows, in many ways, fitzgerald's usual style, it is very different from his other works. This is a true classic and a must read for any fan of modernism."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I was first swept away by the writing of Fitzgerald, as I suppose most people were, in his classic text, The Great Gatsby. This book also chronicles romance and &quot;the fast life,&quot; but is not nearly as captivating. For those who love Fitzgerald, this is still a good read. However, I would sooner recommend Gatsby, or This Side of Paradise."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fitzgerald is considered to be an important early 20th century American writer. I bought and read Fitzgerald's five major novels (\\"This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and the Damned, The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and The Last Tycoon\\") plus one book of short stories plus the biography \\"Some Sort of Epic Grandeur\\" by Matthew Broccoli.His first major novel, \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" along with \\"Gatsby\\" and \\"Tender is the Night\\" are considered to be great novels, and I enjoyed the reads. The other two, including the present, have a few flaws, or simply put: they are not as good. Interestingly, the Bloomsbury Guide does not rate any of the five well known Fitzgerald novels as masterpieces. His best or most complicated work is \\"Tender is the Night,\\" but it is less well known than \\"Gatsby\\" which became a successful film.Fitzgerald wrote about half a dozen novels and over 100 short stories between approximately 1917 and 1940. The short stories were done largely to make money to support his life style. In later years, he worked on a number of Hollywood film scripts. He died poor in Hollywood in 1940 at an age of just 44, leaving an insurance policy as his main asset.Riding on the success of \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" Fitzgerald created the present novel with a lack of care. The novel is one of his longest and it follows the life of a young man, Anthony Patch, who has a modest trust and lives in New York. We follow his turbulent marriage, and the life of the couple outside New York in rural Connecticut. There is a tremendous variation in his writing. The first two novels, including the present, feature good prose. But, here he stumbles. This present book is probably his worst novel, but with so much variation in his work, you can also make a case for \\"The Last Tycoon\\" as being the worst; since, it ends abruptly at page 150 due to Fitzgerald's sudden death from a hearth attack.Early parts of the book remind the reader of \\"This Side of Paradise\\" but the book goes off the rails from time to time in the story and the author insists on having short lectures on his point of view thrust into the novel. Those subtle lectures along with the turbulent plot - the chaos of the plot reflects his well known marital problems, the excessive drinking that lead to an early death, and a mentally ill wife Zelda - all taken together tend to ruin the book, or at least brings it down a notch. For that reason, the book was not a great success.In his next major work, \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" he pulls himself back from the chaos and presents a refined and polished short novel. Fitzgerald kept a diary, and he was fully aware that he had to put more work into his next novel and he was determined to make a comeback with \\"Gatsby.\\"Here we have excellent writing, beautiful prose, and an example of an early twentieth century American novel. It is mostly entertaining but a notch or two below his best work."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The Beautiful and Damned is probably one of the best character studies I've ever read. Every nuance of these characters is fully fleshed out. They could be psychological character studies. Fitzgerald's writing and the setting of the nineteen twenties is a perfect combination. It's exciting, and it's well written. Those are the two things that keep me happy as a reader."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fitzgerald's tale is obviously a classic, but which edition is the best buy? There are so (or is \\"too\\"...) many available. Personally, I like this editonThe Beautiful and Damned(yes, you need to click the link to see which one it is as Amazon combines many reviews together), especially because of the captivating cover shot. A great value IMHO."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Beautiful and the Damned\\" was published in 1922 by Charles Scribner. It is written in a naturalistic style by the 26 year old author who had risen to fame due to his first novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\" That novel chronicled the life of a Princeton man.This long 450 page work deals with the lives of Anthony Patch a Harvard graduate who wastes his life. Anthony refuses to work depending on an inheritance from his wealthy grandfather. The grandfather lives in Terrytown New York where he is a pious prohibitionist who disdains the laziness of Anthony. Anthony fears he will be disinherited with granfather walks in on a wild, drunken party which Anthony is conducting at his summer home.Anthony becomes infatuated with the Kansas City beauty the cold but regal Gloria Gilbert. She is based on Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald. The two wed and party their way through California and New York. Gloria is self-centered, vain and selfish. She is a materialist who wishes to be worshipped as a glorious being of sublime beauty.The Patch marriage is a disaster. They fight and spend money as if it were going out of style. Anthony's has to sell bonds to keep them afloat. He is drafted into the Army in World War I. He never goes overseas. Instead he is posted in a southern town where he has an affair with the dimwit belle Dot. He breaks off the affair when the war ends.Meanwhile, Gloria has remained faithful to him during their separation. She does, however, resume friendships with former beaus who pass through New York in connection with their military assignments. Gloria is as cold as a cucumber and a demandiing hard to please person.The marriage resumes following the armistice. Anthony briefly takes a job as a salesman but is a total disaster. He drinks and parties with disreputable characters falling down drunk in the street. Gloria can't abide him and does not want a child. Her belated attempts to enter the movies when she fails a screen test arranged by an old beau who has become a movie producer. She fears growing old as the lines across her face warn her that all beauty is ephemeral.Both of these characters are lazy, mentally inactive crybabies. The novel ends when Anthony receives a thirty million bequest in his grandfather's will.. Anthony and Gloria's romantic and emotional future is bleak though they are as rich as Croesus. The final scene portrays them sailing to Europe where one expects them to waste their days in gluttony, casual affairs and drinking to oblivion.Fitzgerald based this novel on Zelda and his own dissolute lifestyle of wild carousing and boozing in America and abroad. He is able to use dialogue well and his poetic prose sparkles. After over eighty years the novel still holds interest due to the precise characterization of Anthony and Gloria, the prose and the ability to weave a plausible story of decline. These two characters are both beautiful and damned."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The Beautiful and Damned, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a tragic tale of a man named Anthony, struggling with several issues. It begins with his own laziness and social anxiety, only to continue with an effort to achieve the love of a beautiful, yet seemingly unattainable, woman. War, alcohol and other women also play a large role in the struggles Anthony encounters throughout the novel. Ultimately, this book portrays the life of a man whose lackadaisical attitude about life, eventually leads to his own downfall and inevitable insanity.Fitzgerald wrote this piece in order to analyze the time in which it was written. Throughout the entire novel, there is a specific reference to prohibition and how alcohol was used not only for pleasure, but also as an escape. Throughout the story, as Anthony's life becomes more troubling and hard for him to handle, the reader is able to see he resorts to alcohol more and more and it eventually ends up consuming his life. His addiction and lack of purpose in life eventually leads to his downfall. By the end, Anthony is unable to go one day, let alone a few hours, with out getting drunk and spends the little money he and his wife have to obtain more alcohol. This drunken scene only continues to grow worse after he enters the war scene.Another significant event perceived by the author through this piece is the war. Fitzgerald was in the army, following his senior year at Princeton, and due to this, many of the details of the war in the novel may have been significant memories to Fitzgerald in which he wished to reveal to those who were uninformed. The war played a large role in this novel as a whole. While things were growing dull in Anthony and Gloria's marriage, issues in the world were elevating. When Anthony goes to enlist, their marriage is given time to breathe and recuperate while they are apart. Yet, Anthony's faithfulness is questioned once he has been away from Gloria for a while and he begins to forget his life back at home. While providing an escape for Anthony and Gloria's' marriage, the war changed their relationship. It seemed to be a turning point at first with Anthony's return, yet after the first week they were reunited, the couple was once again back to their fighting, drinking and partying away what little patience and money they still obtained.Much like Anthony's character in the book, Fitzgerald's involvement in the war efforts had a large impact on his life. This greatly influenced the details of the war and Anthony's romantic love affair in the novel. While Fitzgerald was at one of his army posts, he met a girl named Zelda Sayre, who may have been represented by Dorothy's character in the novel. Yet in the novel, Anthony's affair with Dot was what eventually ate away at his pride and confidence. He had worked so long and hard to achieve Gloria's companionship. He had fought so hard to obtain what he thought to be unattainable, a beautiful, young, and full of life, woman. Yet, in the end, he allowed this relationship to disintegrate, and found himself in the arms of another. His guilt eventually became so great that he was unable to deal with it. This guilt lead him to eventually push away all of Dots' affections and do the only thing he knew how to do, drink her out of his memory. In the end, when Dot reappeared at his apartment door, begging for his love, no matter what the circumstance, Anthony's guilt, insanity and drunken state gave way to his need for her extinction. Following this instance, Anthony had nothing left to look forward to, and retreated into his mind, to a place in his childhood where he found comfort. There he stayed, no longer caring whether or not his grandfather's money was obtained or anything else, except his small stamp collection, living content only through his memories of the past.Another conflict of society at this time in which Fitzgerald attempted to portray was the carelessness of the upper class and their inevitable downfall. The Patch couple is a prime example of such social standings. Both came from relatively well off families, yet instead of taking responsibility for their lives and their future life together, they depended solely on the possibility of wealth from Adam's grandfather throughout their entire marriage. In any attempt to find a job to support themselves, they were easily distracted. Although eventually they won the lawsuit and the money Anthony's grandfather had unintentionally left, by this time it was pointless. It took five years to gain the money they had been waiting for, for so long. Ironically, it was not until Anthony had given up both physically and psychologically, that the money was obtained. This symbolized how hard and long someone can work for something, eventually driving themselves to insanity before the goal is reached and once it's actually achieved, one is too exhausted both physically and mentally to care anymore.In this novel, the author accurately portrayed life during this time, and showed his feelings on issues such as war, love, money, social standing and sanity. The author's indication of how these issues correspond with and affect each other as well as the outcome of the combination of such issues is revealed through this novel. This allows the reader to get an accurate sense of life during this time, both of the prosperous and those who struggled. The war had a great affect on the sanity, monetary situation, and relationships of many men at this time allowing for the creation of such characters as in The Beautiful and Damned. Yet Fitzgerald took it one-step further and created a dramatic and eventually tragic love story that grips the reader until the last line of the story with Anthony saying, \\"I showed them...It was a hard fight, but I didn't give up and I came through!\\" (449)."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fitzgerald's second novel shows a maturation rather than maturity. It is a no-frills, yet poignant and focused portrait of the profoundly amoral young aristocracy boozing up the 1920s, rather than a predictable rise-and-fall morality tale. Here, Fitzgerald holds the reins over his language; he is firmly in control, cutting down on some long-winded passages and verbosity seen in This Side of Paradise.B&amp;D is true to the values of its hero, Anthony Patch, a superfluous and utterly indolent Harvard graduate who's far less sure of what he wants and likes than what he doesn't, except of course, for Gloria, a beautiful and narcissistic partner whose taste is compatible with his own.Awaiting his grandfather's demise, the young couple drinks away their days and nights because there is nothing else they can conceive of doing. Their friends are a philosopher whose fundamental maxim is that there is nothing worth doing and a writer whose early promise deteriorates into banal tripe - a tragic waste of talent he is blind to.Fitzgerald's prose and story are so deceptively fluid that the reader can miss many passive and active attitudes, bereft of any values or standards (other than aesthetic ones), towards life, family, fidelity, war, and death. In this world, marriage is a refuge from boredom (albeit a hopeless one), work is debasing, war is a decoration of the moneyed class, and wealth itself is a presumption.As, usual, Fitzgerald's strengths (reaching the acme in Gatsby) are in his ability to describe feelings and moments. From Anthony's courthship of Gloria to his military affair with Dot, FSF never loses the palpable understanding of his own characters to satisfy effect."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"As the star of his own life and F. Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, Anthony Patch is what the protagonist of Fitzgerald's debut \\"This Side of Paradise\\" would have become had he been allowed to grow up without the wizening experiences Amory Blaine suffers. But, though older and richer than Amory, Anthony truly suffers more; in fact, following his alcoholic downward spiral creates a great deal of suffering in the reader, even as the prose is lovely and the characterizations full. At least Anthony (and the reader) has the stunning Gloria Gilbert to accompany him on that cirrhotic journey.Anthony and Gloria would have fit right in among the Bright Young Things of Fitzgerald's English contemporary Evelyn Waugh's more satirical, far less meaty novels of callous behavior and insincere rich people. Fitzgerald's characters are sincere, however--sincere about expecting that the world should fall at their feet forever, and that earning their way by honest toil isn't the way to go about it. This book is a tale of a destructive marriage in which neither party is more at fault than the other, and in which the greatest sin of both is narcissism (though despair is often not far off as the story moves along).You've got to hand it to Gloria, though: feminists and individualists of all stripes and sexes will appreciate her paean to self-actualization:\\"What grubworms women are to crawl on their bellies through colorless marriages! Marriage was created not to be a background but to need one. Mine is going to be outstanding. It can't, shan't be the setting--it's going to be the performance, the live, lovely glamorous performance, and the world shall be the scenery. I refuse to dedicate my life to posterity.\\"Wouldn't it be fun to listen to this woman tell stories if she lived to be 80?For all its beauty, \\"The Beautiful and Damned\\" can wear the reader down. It's too long, for one thing, and Anthony and Gloria keep repeating the same mistakes long after Fitzgerald has established that they are the kind of people who don't learn from their mistakes. Fitzgerald fans should definitely give it a try, and if it wears on you by the middle of the book then you should feel no guilt about letting it sit for a while. I should also add that the first seven pages are as enticing an opening as any I've read in an American novel. Every era needs its portraits in fiction, and the 1920s belong to Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"fitzerald once again entertains us with the same basic plot but with different characters. it's amazing that an author can continually draw the reader into a story that sounds vaguely familiar with characters that have similar weaknesses. his magic is in bringing that golden era to the present. it's like reading an autobiography of the author himself. the emotions, the enjoy life at all costs attitude, the failures and successes. it's all there as in his other works. in his day some of fitzeralds works where met with minimal praise. we love him more today because he is one of the only authors that have described that era so intricately."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"We're coming into an age referred to by many as the &quot;Cocktail Nation,&quot; and our youth is experimenting with swing dancing, swing music, making bathtub absinthe, and trying to recreate the air of my most favorite decade of all times: the roaring '20s.&quot;The Beautiful and Damned,&quot; is by far the best work by the man who almost single-handedly created the image of the flapper. F. Scott Fitzgerald was as much the voice of his generation as we claim modern alternative musicians are the voice of ours."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"At first it is hard not to fall in love with Gloria Gilbert who, like all the self-besotted children of the heady and hedonistic Jazz Age, is so riotously frivolous, so ingenously self-centred. You excuse the fatuous languidness of her husband Anthony Patch as the transitory aimlessness of youth. But you know that these two have it coming when Gloria - in what FSF calls her \\"Nietszchean moment\\" - declares \\"I don't care about truth; I only want happiness!\\" While the rest of the Ivy League brahmins live out their dreams as writers and movie-makers, Gloria and Anthony squander their money and beauty on endless parties and clubs. At the end they are the flotsam of the Jazz Age. This tale strains at tragic grandeur without quite achieving it, chiefly because its two main protagonists remain essentially unlikeable, without any redeeming attribute that would stir our sympathy. The prose drips with lyricism, but it is without grace, poise and maturity. FSF was only 26 when it was first published, and this book displays a raw diamond that would attain polish a little later."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"\\"It is the manner of life seldom to strike but always to wear away.\\" In The Beautiful and Damned, the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald creates a compelling struggle between life and his two dynamic characters Anthony and Gloria. Fitzgerald inserts his own questions of life and relationships in the offhand statements of his characters, usually too well placed to even be noticed by the reader. And such is the manner of The Beautiful and Damned, to strike at the soul and mind and to wear away our own definitions and conceptions through silent screams of indecision, fear and regret.Fitzgerald uses his understanding of literature and the power of words to convey two stories: one on the surface, and one, hidden below all plot lines, running deep within each character and within all people who have ever dared to live. He uses color and imagery to clue his readers to this underlying message. Also, Fitzgerald writes in a \\"play-like\\" manner, with certain character dialogues, a sense of staging, narration and even in some parts of the book even special \\"play-like\\" formatting. This method creates an image of the surface plot, the plot the reader can tangibly grasp: the raised print on the page, the crisp sheets, the grammar and the structure of the story. These elements leave behind all that the reader feels and understands on a deeper level inside the mind, making each reader digest all this information alone, because it is not just bluntly stated by Fitzgerald on paper. This story allows the reader to just read a story, or to jump into the structure of the mind and soul, freeing locked feelings and questions. Fitzgerald's power is to massage his words giving each phrase the power to strike the reader and let them see themselves for the first time."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Wow! I was ecstatic to find a wonderfully vintage version of this book..truly one of the great classics of American literature, which I teach in summer sessions in the Yucaipa, California School District. Fitzgerald needs to be continually read..and this vintage version is tops!!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Semi-autobiographical story that captures the essence of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and flamboyance. The characters care most about having a good time, no expense spared, even when it means living seriously above their means. The real story of Scott and Zelda, especially during their early marriage, is eerily similar in some ways, with Scott eventually dying of alocholism and Zelda ending up in an asylum.The novel is truly captivating, especially if you want to know more about the glitter of New York City in the 1920's (the \\"CITY\\") and America life during that period in general."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I've probably read The Beautiful and Damned ten or more times--it is a very compelling story, although it also contains many annoying flaws. It, as others have stated, is somewhat verbose and seems as though it was not edited as heavily with Maxwell Perkins (as Gatsby later was.) The third person omniscient narrator is somewhat preachy--and obstructs much of the action, but there are passages of absolute brilliant, clear description of self-destruction and living in the moment. The narrative is almost bone-crushingly linear, as Gloria and Anthony fling themselves toward their inevitable, terrible fate. They \\"achieve\\" their notion of the American dream, in the end, but at a terrible cost to them both...The topic and the structure of this book is echoed amazingly in Hubert Selby Jr.'s Requiem for a Dream. The characters in that book also lose sight of the reality of their lives in their desperate pursuit of their \\"dreams.\\" It would be interesting to know if Selby might have been inspired by this Fitzgerald novel. It certainly reads as if he did."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fitzgerald wrote this novel immediately before he wrote The Great Gatsby, to my mind to best American novel of the twentieth century. So I picked this book up with considerable interest. There are points in the book where Fitzgerald reaches some of the heights of Gatsby. The description of Patch's descent into alcoholism, his regrets and weird investment in his own nihilism and deterioration, and the extraordinary description of the dysfunctional co-dependency between Patch and his wife Gloria are truly great. This part of the book is riveting.Also worthwhile is the humor and satire of the book, something that really is not present in Gatsby. While in some respects, the book pokes fun at everyone, including Patch's crusading reformer of a grandfather and his novelist friend Caramel, I don't think Fitzgerald is himself a cynic or nihilist. The descriptions of what Patch's more idealistic Harvard classmates do and Patch's transient regrets about his wasted life, clearly reflect the conventional moral lesson that Fitzgerald is trying to deliver: do good; make something of your life.But the book is not in Gatsby's league, and Fitzgerald at this early point in his career (he's only 25) is still developing as a writer. The early chapters of the book are written with an irritatingly intrusive narration, and the reader must have patience to stick with the book. Fitzgerald seems to find his voice a third of the way through, and the novel then just takes off. The ending of the book is disappointing and contrived. It serves Fitzgerald's ironic purposes and digs at the idle rich, but it's not believable. Also, Fitzgerald does not understand the legal system that is at the heart of Patch's struggles and completely bungles his description of how the appellate process works. And the title of the book -- please. Couldn't he have come up with something better than that? It sounds like something his character Richard Caramel would use for one of his many bad novels. This book would have been much improved with editing or a rewrite.In any event, a lesser work by Fitzgerald is a masterpiece by anyone else's standards. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"&quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; vs. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;-obviously the verdict reached by the general reader and critic gives the laurels to the latter. But I don't think this book was meant for either, hence its low estimation in their minds. It was meant for readers who, like the book's hero (or what we might nowadays call antihero), Anthony Patch, see clearly: the emptiness of all endeavors in life not involving beauty. I was reminded in reading this work of Yeats' lines &quot;What portion can the artist have who has awakened from the common dream but dissipation and despair.&quot;The book is not even truly a novel to my mind but rather as Tolstoy said of his &quot;War and Peace&quot; -&quot;a great swath of life.&quot; Only &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; which parallels &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in thissense, did Tolstoy dub his &quot;novel.&quot; This may be another way of saying that the book is what another reviewer denominates &quot;Naturalistic.&quot; But, whatever it is, I much prefer its poetic lyricism to the arid artifice that constitutes &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; much as I infinitely prefer &quot;War and Peace&quot; to &quot;Anna Karenina.&quot;The flaws in the book (and the reason I gave it only 4 stars) arise when Fitzgerald veers from this three-dimensional writing style to the vapid and two-dimensional characterizations of many of Anthony's acquaintances: What is lacking is texture and background here. Proust wrote about inane decadents as well, but did so in such a way that the reader gains perspective and insight into their condition. This richness is sadly lacking in &quot;The Beautiful and Damned.&quot;But, aside from this somewhat technical flaw, the book's essential theme and philosophical import-that those who worship exclusively at the altar of Beauty must anticipate a high cost-make it one of the most important works of this century. For beauty in all its earthly incarnations is quintessentially transient. This is nowhere made more clear than in Anthony's soliloquizing to Dot &quot;...you can't have anything at all. Because desire just cheats you. It's like a sunbeam skipping here and there around a room. It stops and guilds some inconsequential object, and we poor fools try to grasp it-but when we do the sunbeam moves on to something else, and you've got the inconsequential part, but the glitter that made you want it is gone-&quot;Thus, the book is authentic tragedy, with a note of triumph. I won't give away what other reviewers seem to find the controversial or ambivalent ending. But I, for one, found the words of Paul coming to mind, &quot;I have fought the good fight. I have kept the faith.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This was my first Fitzgerald book and I was unable to put it down. He takes us on an adventure through two peoples lives - people with hopes and dreams and what they believe is a promising future. He grafically describes the events throughout Anthony and Gloria's life together, portraying not only a rich society, but the lowest of societies. He entwined characters in ways that will make you always remember them. I picked it up and couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This book really wasn't that great. It was slow and hard to get into. Many incidences were repetitive and the book was a whole lot of nothing. The ending was a let down, and I grew to have a strong feeling of contempt for many of the characters. If you like Fitzgerald, stick with the Great Gatsby or Tender is the Night. Otherwise you'll find reading this book is boring and you'll be damned to want to finish it."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The book is a classic, and if you like Fitzgerald you'll like the book. But the binding of this edition is terrible. The whole first half of the book fell out while I was on the first read."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The Beautiful and Damned is a Naturalist novel that recounts the slow dissolution of Anthony Patch, heir to a large fortune, and his charmingly immature, hedonistic, and impulsive wife Gloria.There's something a little &quot;off&quot; in this novel--even saying the title out loud requires an odd caesura. The plot has a feeling of artificial inevitability. Early on, it's easy to sympathize with Patch, even to root for him, but at times his thought processes and actions are so maudlin that one wants him to just *fall* already. Gloria is a fine and interesting character, but by and large the peripheral characters are closer to caricatures.The book's strength is its prose, natural and authoritative, never self-consciously clever to an annoying extent. Fitzgerald's pacing is steady; occasional meandering narrative passages are fished quickly out of the water with dialog and plot events.All in all it's a fairly good book, worth a read if you're NOT looking for the near-great Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Hmmm, just finished The Beautiful and the Damned and was sad to do so. It is the last of His novels for me - until I reread them ofcourse. Yes, F. Scott did it again in this novel - he wowed me - I am utterly amazed at Fitzgeralds use of language!Every other line is brilliant, or near enough. I feel silly &quot;reviewing&quot; this novel - it suffices to say that this is yet another fantastic story wrapped up in a glorious package of ingenious prose and crystalline images - topped off with the big velvet bow that are Anthony Patch and Gloria Gilbert. Glorious!"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I initially downloaded this book thinking that since it was from Fitzgerald's and I had read the Great Gatsby and liked it, I'd like this one as well. Boy was I wrong. I kept reading hoping that it would get better but I found it just awful the more I read. At least I got it free and didn't have to pay for it otherwise I'd be even more upset. If you like main characters who seem not to have a purpose and spend their entire days wondering about their existence and doing absolutely nothing at all then this book is for you. Also, if you're a diehard F.Scott Fitzgerald fan and absolutely love all his writing then this book is for you. If you like your characters to have a purpose even if it's only on the printed page then stay away from this one. I don't care if it's supposedly semi autobiographical, what a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Their is no action, the characters are boring, self absorbed snobs. By the end of the book I wanted the two main characters to kill one another. I would have settled for murder suicide. Fitzgerald did not even deliver that.

Fitzgerald babbles and his characters are lifeless and dull. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"To begin with, I need to say that this is no \\"Great Gatsby.\\" Having said that, I will give my opinion of F. Scott Fitzgerald's, \\"The Beautiful and the Damned.\\" It is a very good example of two lives lived without faith in God. Instead, Anthony Patch places his faith in millions he expects to inherit, while his wife has faith in the money and her beauty. It is clear that Fitzgerald writes from experience as he describes many of the struggles of becoming a writer as well as the struggle with alcoholism. Anthony Patch fully expected to inherit millions from his religiously devout uncle. His uncle disinherited him because of his immoral behavior and Anthony and Gloria end up in a desperate lawsuit throughout the book, hoping to change the courts initial decision. In that process, they are on a downward spiral in their relationship, relationships with friends, and their self esteem. I was reminded of the Biblical story of Job as I read the book. As Job had it all in the beginning, so did Anthony. As Job had it all taken away, so did Anthony. As Job's friends looked down upon him in his condition, so did Anthony's friends. Even Job's wife turned on him. Anthony's wife despised him as well. Then comes the difference. Job never lost faith in his God, but Anthony Patch never had faith. In the end, Job was rewarded with more blessings than he had ever had before. At the end of Anthony Patch's life, he got the blessing he had always longed for, but he was too far gone to enjoy it. I found it sad and depressing at times but it is worth the read. It's a look into the life of Fitzgerald and the age of World War I. It also reminds us that we can have all the world's goods and still have nothing, if we have ignored God in this life."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"+ It's well-written, well-paced and a fairly exciting read.+ The atmosphere of a decadent upper class is captured quite well.- The plot is familiar, and the characters are mostly unmemorable. The girl is probably the best of the lot, but she's over-drawn. The guy (Anthony Patch) is too bloodless to be sympathetic. Everyone else is a stick.So overall it's a good read, but not worth re-reading."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fitzgerald is a favorite of mine, and I think this to be his best work.

But the cover is kinda ugly. It's not the same as the picture."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald is my favorite author, to get my bias out in the open. I have read all four of his novels and many of his short stories, and while this is not his best novel technically, I believe the plot and characters are perhaps more interesting than in some of his other novels. As with his other novels, it draws intensly on Fitzgerald's own life, foreshadowing his problems with Zelda, drinking, and a lack of money. The story of a beautiful young couple ruined by their greed and ambition is very compelling, and the scene where Anthony's grandfather, the Prohibition advocate catches the couple on a &quot;binge&quot; and disinherits them is very dramatic and interesting. By the end of the novel, the couple does retrieve their monetary wealth, but they have already lost their beauty and youth, which is in the end more important than money to Fitzgerald. The story is very moralistic, and perhaps even preachy, but if you are interested in tales of the &quot;leisure class&quot; as I am, you definitely should read this novel."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Store line is good but F. Scott is hard to read due to his run on sentences."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"fitgerald describes things so well and in such a light that after a while is contagous. i read the great gatby a couple years ago and didnt remember being greatly interested but i love this book. i recommend it more for the way the author writes then the mere plot."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The extremley long second novel of Fitzgerald explores many of the same questions that Fitzgerald probed in his first novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise.&quot; This book is very long and could have been abridged and reached the same point. His least exceptional book by far, but a lyrical masterpiece none-the-less. The loss of potential by the novel's protagonist, Anthony Patch is less emotional than the bildingsroman of Amory Blaine or the character deterioation in &quot;Tender is the Night.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"In this novel, F. Scott Fitzgerald is extremely cruel with his characters and society. A young couple of the generation that came of age just before the First World War, were both born in extremely rich families and were educated for the vainest of all lives, high life and no work. They only knew the value of money for what its possession could provide them with : luxury, parties, alcohol, shows, etc. But they did not know at all what working to earn it could mean. Fitzgerald explores in the tiniest details the descent to hell for these two young people and what they considered as their final salvation (the inheritance from the grandfather was finally given back to them by courts). But they have been dragged so low in their vain attempt at surviving without doing anything while waiting for the court decision, that they are plain misfits in society. They have a lot of money and can be wooed and courted by other members of the aristocratic class, but they are despised and they despise all the others. No moral or even social salvation, just a golden version of hell on earth. This novel is a masterpiece in explaining and showing how the education of a young man or a young girl is entirely responsible for the personalities and behaviors these young people will develop later on in life. Hence it is a deep book on education, the education of the children of the rich. They have to conquer their inheritance through their own achievements and efforts or work. This book by Fitzgerald is definitely the best I have read, so far, because it shows these simple truths in the cruellest and most unadorned painting..."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I gave it a fair chance, a hundred pages, before deciding this was not a book for me. The good part, main character Anthony is convincingly and well made. The problems? As a person, I find Anthony so superficial, as intended, that I not only feel no connection to him, but extraordinarily rarely for me, I find him so thoroughly unlikeable that I haven't the smallest desire to find out what happens to him. Which brings me to another complaint. I'm not an action fanatic, but in a hundred pages almost nothing happens beyond finding out Anthony's heritage and lifestyle. The promised female interest has just appeared and at first glance, seems to have no greater depth than Anthony. Final complaint, the writing is so flowery and verbose that it gets in the way. It reads like Fitzgerald must have been paid by the word, with metaphors, similes, and adjectives so pervasive to be annoying to this reader (at random, I picked one of his over-the-top sentences and counted it at 48 words!). If you've read my previous reviews, you'll know that ripping a book is not my style. In fact, I have suspected myself of being too indulgent to written weaknesses. Nonetheless, this is a classic author? A book well reviewed? Hard to fathom. I quit and find no compulsion to return to Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Originally I had intended to compose an essay of sorts, but I no longer wish to devote too much of my time on this endeavor, so I will simply type here extempore.Fitzgerald was, in my subservient opinion, one of the greatest novelists of the last century. I think he holds his own against the mightiest of authors: Joyce, Steinbeck, Faulkner, and even Henry James.The Beautiful and Damned is a tragic and even, dare I say, realistic portrayal of the society so enamored with, and so madly ascetic to, aestheticism and wealth. It's a tale of a young couple: a Harvard graduate who ( spoiler! ) eventually amounts to nothing despite his pedagogical superiority, and a beauteous but fallible woman whose beauty disintegrates like so many mortals before us. It's an account of perfidy and defiance, obstinacy towards time and the havoc that she wrecks upon all lovely and ripe wights, be it organic like Gloria or inanimate like metal.While the story itself is not as captivating as The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald's brilliant pen is ostensibly evident in commanding the text. I would venture to say that the composition is equivalent and even superlative to his most renowned tome - that is, at moments it can be. The problem with this novel is that it's simply too lengthy. Were it one hundred pages shorter, I feel that Fitzgerald could have made a sharper impact on the reader, but too many pages are slathered on repeated episodes of the same events.The Beautiful and Damned is still a fine book and easily considered a &quot;classic&quot; and a definite read for those who enjoyed Gatsby, but it's not the work that catapulted its writer to world notoriety."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"how trite of me to review F.

It was pretty boring until about three quarters of the way through. I will probably never read this book again.

The way that he crafted words together is breathtaking. He was an artist of the type that don't exist anymore. Beautiful and the Damned is no exception.

The windows in the living room of the gray house are wide open patiently exchanging the tainted inner atmosphere of liquor and smoke for the fresh drowsiness of the late hot dusk. There are dying flower scents upon the air, so thin, so fragile, as to hint already of a summer laid away in time.\\"This is the story of a young couple Anthony and Gloria Patch living out their days to the hilt in New York City as they await the death of Anthony's grandfather, Adam Patch from whom they expect to inherit his massive fortune.Gloria is a spoilt child from Kansas City turned into a sophisticated and most beautiful woman. Gloria does not intend to lift a finger to do any domestic work in the home, no matter how slight; while Anthony who considers himself an aesthete, finds it quite hard to get his act together and instead of buckling down to some work, prefers instead to hang with his wife and their friends on nightly binges. They drink and eat in the classiest restaurants and hotels, rent the most expensive apartments, travel out to the West in the spring time driving plush cars, wearing top-of-the-line clothing and just generally living it up high on the hog, as they wait.Meet Maury Noble who is Anthony best friend who spends his time between New York and Philadelphia; Richard Caramel who has just completed writing a book and looking for new ideas for a second one. Joseph Bloeckman from Munich who started out small in America and is now a big shot in Show Biz. Also the quiet Jewess Rachael Barnes and Muriel Kane who is young, flirtatious and sometimes a bit too talkative and Tana the Japanese housekeeper of the Patches.We are shown the Patches at their very best as the novel starts, with the world at their feet and loaded with cash with which they make very expensive choices. But, as we get further in, we see things begin to change gradually and we realize that those very choices will be their very downfall. It was quite a good read but it could be very heartbreaking at times as we put ourselves into the shoes of the main characters. All lovers of F. Scott Fitzgerald should read this book if you haven't done so already, and those of you who like reading about the ultra rich in the Roaring Twenties this one is for you. It is the kind of book that you feel you will want to read again. It is that good and I shall miss it.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 10/04/04)"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"The genius of F.Scott Fitzgerald shines brilliantly in this vastly underappreciated classic novel of moral depravity. The pervasive themes of Fitzgerald include moral corruption, profligate behavior, agnosticism, selfishness, narcissism, egocentrism, and of course, a sick obsession with money and alcohol. These themes permeate all too well throughout the beautifully written The Beautiful and Damned(pardon the pun).Released in 1922, 2 years subsequent to the seminal This Side of Paradise and 3 years prior to the magnum opus The Great Gatsby, incomprehensibly, The Beautiful and Damned was not well received critically nor financially. As a result, history has erroneously filed it under the dubious sophomore jinx category. Strange it may seem, I vehemently disagree. As you read this book, you witness first-hand the maturation of an amazing writer. No American writer of the 20th Century can compare to the profound power and unwavering genius that is F.Scott Fitzgerald. If you enjoyed The Great Gatsby, you will no doubt enjoy this work - an equally beautifully writen and tragic tale of aspiring morally depraved young Americans in pursuit of The American Dream.\\"Remarkable that a person can comprehend so little and yet live in such a complex civilization.\\""},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fittingly, this was the last of Fitzgerald's novels that I read. And I apparently saved the best for last. In this enrapturing portrayl of young lovers who are attracted by their differences in the beggining yet destroyed by their similarities in the end (the need of wealth). I find this perhaps one of Fitzgerald's finest literary achievements. He has it all working for him in this novel, his character development is excellent, I feel as though I could recognize Anthony or Gloria on the street if they were to saunter my way. Fitzgerald truly breaks his own mold on this terrific literary achievement. He not only tells a wonderful story of two young lovers but he also parallels it with a very strong supporting cast of characters to Anthony and Gloria. Much can be understood of the lead characters by reading into the supporting characters, focus on Anthhony's grandfather for example. The rosy picture which is so commonly printed by the media of the rich has never been so wonderfully redone with vibrant color as Fitzgerald waves his &quot;paint brush&quot; through all the old misconceptions of the rich and into something truly brilliant: Real life. Fitzgerald was indeed touched with brilliance, and never has it ever been more evident than in his wonderful novel :The Beautiful and Damned.&quot; An absolute must read."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"My thoughts of: The Beautiful and the DamnedThe Beautiful and the Damned, by F.Scott Fitzgerald, is an exciting novel that brings friendship. Love, and confusion of young life all together. \\"here eyes were gleaming ripples in the white lake of her face; the shadows of her hair bordered the brow with a persuasive unintimate dusk.\\" The author clearly tries to describe the joy and sorrow of finding a new love throughout this novel. Fitzgerald shows the ups, downs, confusions, and oddness of how love begins, lingers, and in some cases, ends.Anthony Patch begins as a young, well educated, and wealthy man. He acts like a regular young man, engaging in drinking, associating with peers, and finding love. He stumbles upon love through a friend, Richard Caramel, an interesting author. Richard's cousin, Gloria, is an attractive young lady who sparks a flame in Anthony's eyes almost instantly. They create what may be love but gradually realize that alcohol and greed soon replaces it all.The setting of this novel seems perfectly fit for the story. It switches from one impressive city to the next, Boston and New York City. A big city naturally puts these characters into play. The activities they persue, and every young person dreams of, fall snuggly into Boston Massachusetts and New York City. Dancing, dining out, and drinking, done so often they become almost as natural as breathing, all activate their fancy high life.The characters in this novel bring back the old fashioned yet, somehow, modern ways of the young. The protagonist, Anthony Patch, signifies a highly opinionated person which shows throughout the story as he places himself in deep discussions with Gloria, the antagonist. The deep discussions also occur with Maury and Richard, some of their closest companions. Maury and Richard both get along great, but they characterize very different people. For instance, Richard loves writing. Writing almost addictively, searching for a new character to create always stays on his mind. Maury, a lot like Anthony, stands as an opinionated person who gives the two much to talk about, which only adds more interest to the story. Gloria conversates as well, but mostly about things only appealing to her. Gloria presents what Anthony and Maury call a \\"childish\\" kind of glow. Though she seems childish, this feature actually attracts people to her the most. All the characters play an interesting and important role in this book.The Beautiful and the Damned, definitely worth reading, shows the realism of everyday life in the 1920's. F.Scott Fitzgerald portrays the life of the young and how easily it might self destruct through greed, material wants, and alcoholism. Fitzgerald proves that the fairytale of married life among the wealthy rarely happens. Money, though abundant, possibly means a lack of love and other ingredients that fuel a healthy life. Money turns into the only reason Gloria stays with Anthony. Though this book may seem fantasy-like at first, it breaks through the candy coated appearance of wealthy life in the early 1920's"},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Nearly ninety years after its first publication, _The Beautiful and Damned_ is still a shockingly relevant account of the entitlement class, the children of the rich or privileged who don't know how to navigate through life without big money. And, it's a New York City novel--written as only a mid-westerner can. It seems to me that because New Yorkers are too much in the middle of it to see themselves clearly, an intelligent \\"outsider\\" like F. Scott Fitzgerald must come along. To write as well as he did, Fitzgerald let the city inhabit him. New York got into his blood, and he recorded it in narrative right down to the dirt under the carpet. Fitzgerald's details lead the reader into the depths of the beautiful and doomed couple, the Gloria-Anthony entanglement, as they are part and parcel of the extremes of poverty and wealth (in the World War I era or the roaring 20s).I don't know how Fitzgerald knew what he knew about the human psyche, or specifically about how a young man might react when he is good-looking and swimming in money and New York, but Fitz's life at Princeton University among this set of people gave him the environment in which to observe; Fitzgerald supplied the story around which the narrative coheres. Of course, there are autobiographical elements to this novel--a lot of himself and Zelda--but what the literary art requires is critical distance. To put his main characters through some shameful scenes, Fitzgerald had to know what tough love is in the New York City context. He had to put his couple to the test, people who from birth had relied on the \\"religion\\" of charm and money. And the author had more than just critical distance: F. Scott had them down right! Every expression, every word. Gloria: \\"This is life! Who cares for the morrow.\\" And you can see Anthony deciding to have one more drink, his speech becoming slurred, his manners maudlin. While Anthony and Gloria wait for his inheritance, we find out what they're made of.Most pleasurable about Fitzgerald's craft is his carefully-controlled technique of letting Anthony and Gloria visit hell (the \\"damned\\" in the title) while softening the harsh surgery-like light with well-timed, well-handled, lyrical sentences. In a single beautiful line, the passage of the winter sun describes both Fitzgerald's craft and his beautiful couple's descent: Gloria \\"lay still for a moment in the great bed watching the February sun suffer one last attenuated refinement in its passage through the leaded panes into the room\\" (p.173). Fitzgerald knew how to show the attenuated and refined way downhill.One more thing about the craft of writing: Only the omniscient narrator technique--which Fitzgerald employs--can show characters in shameful acts and show what they're thinking, and the circumstances in which they got there, and how they \\"need\\" money in order to \\"survive.\\" I wonder if now, in nearly 2010, this novel is not more important than in 1922. More than ever, _The Beautiful and Damned_ is a national portrait. (I can see how \\"spending\\" money could be the \\"sex\\" in the novel.)Advice: Read this novel while in New York, if possible. The first time I read _The Beautiful and Damned_, I was living near 123rd (me, a Westerner!). I looked up every address in the novel (except for the gray house near Cos Cob, Conn.) and got to know New York through this novel. In fact, I could almost pick out their final apartment in Harlem near 127th."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"By no means his best novel (as others here suggest) but highly underrated. Often one hears of Great Gatsby as his best, Tender is the Night as his labored over lost classic, This Side of Paradise as his promising and famous debut, and The Love of the Last Tycoon as the classic that never was, but Beautiful and Damned is never mentioned. In my opinion this is the book that best describes the hedonistic society I have read of called the Roaring Twenties. As the reader watches all the characters lose their dreams and fall into a depraved, hollow existent based on alcohol I am reminded too fondly of my college years.If you are a Fitzgerald fan read this one after This Side of Paradise. If you are someone with a passing interest in the Twenties read this. If you are someone with just a passing interest in Fitzgerald then read this one last, after any of the other Fitzgerald novels."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Highly recommended. Extremely compelling. Still relevant today although first published 80 years ago. A truly remarkable and memorable book.For me reading great fiction is a bit like holding a mirror up to life. In some characters I see parts of myself and in other characters I see parts of other people in my life. With good fiction the characters are so vividly drawn that they seem real. You get to know them and sometimes you like them and sometimes you don't, but they're always believable and you can identify with their emotions and choices in life. For me that's the sort of book this is - and much much more.The Beautiful and Damned is a tragic portrayal of a 1920s society enamored with beauty and wealth (I told you it was still relevant today). The novel traces the gradual downfall of Anthony Patch and his wife Gloria. When we first meet Anthony he is young, well educated and wealthy. Thanks to the generous allowance he receives from his wealthy Grandfather he doesn't have to work and instead spends his days lunching, philosophizing and drinking with his friends while he plans his entry into working life - perhaps as a statesman; perhaps as a writer. Life is a series of Broadway plays and extravagant meals. Nice for some.When Anthony meets the beautiful, flirty and narcissistic Gloria he falls hopelessly in love. After a wonderful courtship they marry and the party really begins. While they wait for Anthony's Grandfather to die and pass his millions on to them, the young couple enjoy an endless string of parties, traveling and extravagance.It is at about this point in the book that you begin to see a change. Up until now Fitzgerald portrays Anthony as pretentious and lazy, but generally a nice enough guy. Gloria is undoubtedly vain and selfish, but is also bubbly, fun and honest. Initially their life together is filled with optimism and breezy cheerfulness and they are undoubtedly a fun couple to be around. However, as they drink more (in particular Anthony) life begins to lose its rosy glow and we begin to see different, less pleasant parts of their personalities. Gradually at first and then faster and faster their downfall accelerates until they each face personal humiliation and suffer pathetic debacle. Believe it or not, it is actually quiet a heartbreaking story.What makes this book so good for me is that it seems real. Anthony and Gloria (or parts of them) are people that you probably know. It all seems very believable. They make bad choices and they pay the consequences - just like real life. The supporting cast of characters that live on the edge of Anthony and Gloria's world also add a huge amount to the story. While flawed in their own ways they generally make a success of their lives.Essentially a chronicle of alcoholic ruin, wasted opportunities and squandered talent, The Beautiful and Damned is a very compelling story. To my mind it's a first-class example of what a novel should be. A book to be savoured and enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"I found Fitzgerald's second novel (published shortly after This Side of Paradise) to be rather uneven. Both protagonists (Anthony and Gloria Patch) are tediously self-absorbed throughout most of the story, and this makes it difficult for me, as a reader, to care about what happens to them. It also seems to me that none of the secondary characters comes to life in a believable way. Some of the dialogue, particularly that between Anthony and his college friends, is longwinded and pretentious. However, there are occasional flashes of brilliance that make reading this American classic a worthwhile effort.The Kindle edition was clear and readable, with only a few small editing issues overlooked."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, The Beautiful and Damned is a tour-de-force of despair....but don't let that stop you from reading it.What begins as a sweet and involving love story quickly spirals downward into the depths of alcoholic misery....If ever there were two people in need of a good AA meeting, it's Anthony Patch and Gloria Gilbert. Meeting as teens by a mutual friend/cousin, Anthony is immediately taken, as are most boys who cross her path, with the beautiful Gloria. Fervently pursuing her, he becomes despondent when she eventually rebuffs his overtures, as she does with all her suitors. But Anthony perseveres, and discovers the truth, that Gloria is indeed in love with him. They marry, with all the best wishes of their friends and family.Too tidy, of course, as this is where life takes some very unfortunate turns for the happy couple...Anthony comes from a background of early 20th century privilege...having been raised by his wealthy Grandfather. Subsisting on a more than generous allotment while in school, Anthony receives one of the best educations that can be afforded to a person. Gloria, groomed and poised, is the perfect debutante....flirty, but never overly so...dignified, but not above an occasional drinking binge, and the object of many a boys' affections.The ongoing party that envelopes the Patch's and their friends becomes a way of life for Anthony and Gloria, and their all-encompassing love becomes a nightmare of co-dependency and over-indulgence. Relying on Anthony's cache of bonds as income, when they continually overspend on their endless nightlife...neither ever engages in a worthwhile profession. Their love of one another turns bitter, resentful, passive-aggressive, and abusive, as they lavish affection on the bottle more and more.Three quarters of this book reads like an AA sponsor testimonial for 'how not to live'....and is very engrossing. A hoped-for inheritance that meets with delay after delay; a stint in the service, as America enters World War 1; an affair to forget; and an aborted attempt at a movie career highlight the downhill run of Anthony and Gloria Patch.An excellent read. Frequently humorous, though covering many dark topics, well-realized in regards to characterization and continuity....The Beautiful and Damned is an excellent portrait in black of what a 'privileged life' can also be like."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Fitzgerald's \\"The Beautiful and the Damned\\" is one of the great American novels and well worth reading. And if your personal copy's in the same shape as mine, you probably need a new one. But it's now out in the public domain and a plethora of reprints are available, mostly from Print on Demand Publishers. So, as a previous reviewer asked, how do you decide which one to buy?Because, believe me, there's some truely awful reprints available. To start with, when looking to pick up a copy of this book, CHECK THE PUBLISHER CAREFULLY and make sure you order a version that's what you think it is. The reason for this is....Amazon associates reviews of a book with many different versions of the same book from different publishers. Unfortunately for us customers, Amazon is seeing a growing plague of new Print-On-Demand Publishers (one of whom, CreateSpace, is owned by Amazon) who are specialising in reprinting copyright-expired books.

What you do need to do is check the publisher carefully for all these older \\"copyright expired\\" books.An outstanding example of \\"not good quality\\" is the imprint of \\"The Beautiful and the Damned\\" published by General Books LLC. The version published by General Books LLC is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.To quote some specifics from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check.

For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality.

He has a terrific grasp of his characters and finds ways to make them realistic. The problem with his characters is that none of them are really likable. I am sure not even Fitzgerald himself thought the characters to be particularly sympathetic. Maybe this was his aim, but it prevents the reader from getting overly involved in the work. I found myself rooting against the main characters, and really all the characters, because they were so egocentric and pompous. It is brillaint writing, no doubt about that, but it is hard to really love a book when the characters are ALL so hatable.It is also a rather depressing and bleak look at society. So too is the Great Gatsby, but this one does not seem to have that certain charm that makes you love it. Despite Gatsby's and Nick's flaws they were mostly sympathetic characters.Don't get me wrong, this was a really enjoyable and interesting book, but just could not quite grasp its own epic aims."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"This is my second reading of Fitzgerald, and I was just as captured by this story as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Anthony and Gloria Patch portray a story of unexpected love, excess, lust, and the many facets of marriage. Fitzgerald's description is immaculate, something many authors have sought to recreate but rarely match. The supporting cast of characters in this novel possess as much livelihood as do the Patches. An honest story, and well worth your time, especially Fitzgerald fans."},{"Title":"The Beautiful and Damned","review":"Love. Fitzgerald is truly one of America's greatest writers.

His characters are very alive."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"The book was a huge disappointment. I'd suggest that it was ghost written by Karl Rove, but Rove would surely be craftier about his unadulterated Bush-envy. Rather than insight and introspection, the book's main purpose seems to be to dismiss criticism of Bush and then explain it away with syrupy words of praise for the author's former boss.The chapter about the day of September 11th, should have been the most insightful and telling about what happened at the epicenter of power...instead it was spiced with explanations of why President Bush sat reading My Pet Goat, while America was under attack...\\"Under inconceivable pressure, Bush maintained his composure and sent an image of calm to the nation.\\" (page 140). - I'm not making this stuff up. That was a direct quote from the book explaining Bush's deer-in-the-headlights look that we've all seen as he was reading to the kids in Florida.I was looking forward to reading this book and again, it was just a disappointment. Maybe Fleischer is hoping to run for office or needs to ingratiate himself even more in certain circles. Or maybe he really believes what he wrote, but to me the book is just nonsense. Sorry. Two thumbs (or maybe 'goat paws') way down."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Notice the trend in how people who gave this book 1 star use a whole mess of generalities in their reviews or bash Fleischer's writing skills. He only claims to be a man with a story to tell here, people, never does he claim to be any more of an author than you or me. You can take comfort in the fact that those reviewers are wrong about that also, as Fleischer stays clear and cogent throughout.1. If you actually read the book, you find that he does explain many of the controversial issues of GWB's term in great detail. He shows where there were misunderstandings, and usually lays out step by step how that came to be from the White House's perspective.2. To the person who posted the Helen Thomas review of the book: You might have remembered that Helen Thomas was a senior member of the press corps who showed her steadfast bias in the briefing room with evermore persistant and leading questions. That is, again, had you actually read the book.And if you want to see her ignorance in action:MR. FLEISCHER: Actually, the President has made it very clear that he has not dispute with the people of Iraq. That's why the American policy remains a policy of regime change. There is no question the people of Iraq --MS. THOMAS: That's a decision for them to make, isn't it? It's their country.MR. FLEISCHER: Helen, if you think that the people of Iraq are in a position to dictate who their dictator is, I don't think that has been what history has shown.MS. THOMAS: I think many countries don't have -- people don't have the decision -- INCLUDING US.Bias, in favor of conflict. That is what plagues our media. Fleischer saw it and confronted it on a daily basis. That is what this book is about."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Ari writes about trying to put the genie back in the bottle after personally creating a media feeding frenzy. This time the media is taking the heat with Ari's respect for the work they do in tow. If you've ever watched a live press briefing on cable or c-span and later yelled at the TV reporter reporting on same \\"that's not what he/she said\\" you will enjoy enjoy enjoy this book. After September 11, 2001 this (me) dyed in the wool liberal Democrat became a press briefing / conference junkie. I watched them all, even getting up at 4AM just for the briefing from Qatar. Thus, I know first hand how many times the press takes liberties reporting. Most all the \\"people that have a right to know\\" knows and acknowledges the liberal left wing bias of the press except maybe for the press themselves. Boy I hope I got right from left correct. Ari's inside scoop on the Whitehouse Press Corp, Whitehouse, Bush, Powell, Rice, Card, Rove and all others is engaging, refreshing and downright entertaining.It is not the best written book I have ever read but is a great great read anyway."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"The job of being Press Secretary for the President of the United States is complex and it essential for both the Presidency and the Public that the person holding that position perform the duties of that office well. Ari Fleischer did a great job during very difficult times. He was there in the 2000 campaign and recount, when the new Bush administration took office, during the intense national sorrow and anger surrounding 9/11, the launch of the War on Terror in Afghanistan, and its continuance in Iraq. No wonder he felt burned out and wanted to leave before the 2004 campaign began in earnest. After all, he had a new wife and they wanted to begin a family. I think he did a great job and made a good choice to leave when he did.What is particularly interesting about this book is that the events it describes are still fresh in our memory. Nearly all of us experience these events through the media of television, newspapers, weekly magazines, opinion journals, and so on. Here, Mr. Fleischer provides his perspective on these events from the inside versus how the media reported the events. The contrast is illuminating. He does debunk some of the popular myths about these events and makes clear what was really said by President Bush and the administration. He is also very clear that the Administration's certainty over the Weapons of Mass Destruction was held by everyone around the world, but was wrong.He also has several amusing anecdotes about interactions with this or that reporter over various events. Sometimes he gets off the witty line and other times he is the butt of the joke. He was serious about doing his job well, but under such serious circumstances humor was required to keep things approximately sane.While some who hate the Bush administration have taken after this book, largely without reading it, I can tell you that I have read it. This book is written engagingly and provides a fresh perspective on recent events that are now becoming a part of history. It is important to get a deeper understanding of our time than the varying and often contradictory news reports. Historians, especially those covering politics and media, will consult various sources for these events to write their books, and I am sure one of them will be \\"Taking Heat\\" by Ari Fleischer.Good job."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Fleischer's writing is surprisingly clunky; the text of TAKING HEAT would benefit greatly from the ministrations of a capable editor. And shouldn't communicating effectively be the strong suit of a famous professional liar?"},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Ari Fleischer was the White House Press Secretary for 2 1/2 years (January 2001 to July 2003) and now writes to tell about his experiences. Ari does a great job giving us a sense what the daily pressures were like, facing the media day after day. The point Ari makes time and again is that the media try to trick him into saying things he doesn't mean or aren't accurate, trying to stir up conflict, because \\"without conflict, there is no news\\".One of the other points Ari focuses on is how slanted the 'mainstream' media are towards the Democratic viewpoint, and I couldn't agree more. I mean, how believable is CBS, NBC, ABC, the Washington Post and the New York Times (just to name those as an example) when you realize that 90 percent or so (as found when surveyed) of those journalists vote Democratic...Ari tells great inside stories such as what it really was to be with the President when 9/11 happened. Missing, though, is more insight into Ari's background growing up (he describes his Democratic upbringing until he became a Republican shortly after finishing college in a mere couple of pages). Hilarious are his tellings about Helen Thomas, the notorious \\"dean\\" of the White House press and self-admitted anti-Bush all the way. Turns out that Ari actually has a lot of respect for her and a great personal relationship outside of the media spotlight.I had the pleasure of hearing Ari give a presentation last Fall here in Cincinnati, and was really impressed with the man. That was before this book came out, and having read his book, I am even more impressed with him. This is a terrific book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"This is a work of either ignorant or delusional right-wing propaganda. To actually ask people to believe that a completely neutered and house trained press was actually giving the Bush whitehouse a harder time than previous governments is a hard sell, but to, for example, completely skip over the unprecedented events of Bush's inauguration as if they didn't happen is revisionist history at its worst. Don't waste your money like I did."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"You probably know before reading that this will not be an unbiased view. Reading that he sometimes felt like a \\"pinata\\" reinforces that opinion. Well, everyone's entitled to have their say and so this is Ari Fleischer's take and now it's his turn.Whether one agrees with his views or now, Ari Fleischer served as the White House press secretary during some of our country's most momentous days, from 9/11, the prelude to the war in Iraq, and more.Mr. Fleischer has no love for the press and reiterates what he feels are some of their more frigid exchanges. He has high praise for his former boss, Mr. Bush, extolling his leadership abilities. No surprises here.Condemn him or praise him, his story is sure to be fodder for debate, diatribe, and discussion."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"I tried to be fair and open-minded while reading \\"Taking Heat\\", I really, really tried but ... my, my. You'd think, after reading this book that, according to Ari Fleischer, George W. Bush is the next best thing to God on earth. Mr. Fleischer does nothing to shed any light on the numerous cover-ups, the abundance of misleading information and outrageous lies that have spilt forth from the Bush White House. It would appear that accepting responsibility for his part in the cover-ups, lies and misinformation isn't something Mr. Fleischer is interested in. On another note, the writing was awful - my 13 year-old could have written \\"Taking Heat\\" better. Worse book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"From a while before the 2000 election to the Bush landing on the Abraham Lincoln, this historical account is unblemished by the mainstream press and the left wing in general. It was enjoyable to read a true account of this time period which includes 911, Afganistan, and Iraq.From the inside of the Bush Administration, this book really incorporates the dedication to national purpose, protection of America, generally good things that happened, not colored by the White House press.It's a perfect history of the acrimony, jealousy, and just plain hatred of Bush, his staff, conservatives in general that is seamlessly merged into what really happened during these tumultuous years.A lot can be learned about the beltway and the press's negative attitudes by reading Ari's excellent book."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"When I found this book (on CD) in the sale rack I thought maybe I'd found a rare jewel. Figuring the early Bush years were old news and this book was sent to the sale rack been because of that.First off Ari should have never read his own book. He came off as a real complainer. A man who had written a book to continue to make excuses for his decisions. Notice I didn't say mistakes. He rarely stated a move of his without showing us how he was forced to do so. It was very sad. Even at one point the old Clinton administration pushes him around.The few moments he gives us of true inside action where wonderful. There may have only been three in the whole book. The Colin Powell condom story was one of them. Ari that's what the reader wanted in the book.What scared me was that Ari came off as extremely angry at the press. There is one woman reporter who he mocks endlessly in his vocal impersonation of her. I hope she doesn't hear the CD version or she is going to be super mad. Ari spends a very long chapter expaining how the press is unfair and bias. He uses graduation numbers instead of true stories. We all saw the press eat Bill Clinton alive...so it was hard to believe they were nicer to Bill then they were to George. That chapter should have met the shreader.Ari did show some spots of careless reporting but his use of \\"you should have believed the White House\\" was a weak response. After past White House administrations trying to \\"out sly\\" the press Ari should have known the press would not simply take him at his word. He came off sounding like a naive high school student.Several of the world stituations that happened while Ari was in office where handled with amazing skill in real life but Ari made it sound like he was rolled over. The moment where Bush took the megaphone in NYC was the most powerful moment in his presidency. Luckily I saw it because Ari barely mentioned it.Ari ducked and dodged the press for years. He's mad that he did it. He's still mad at them. The amazing strategies the Bush administration used to keep the American people informed are not mentioned in this book. I wanted to learn something. Instead I see Ari scolding a press member for a inaccurate story that hurt the White House then giving the same guy a hot breaking story in the next breath by accident AND letting the guy run it. What was his reasoning? It sounded weak and also like bad management.Was Ari out of his league? The book makes it appear so. Luckily I watch all this on television as an American citizen. I know the book paints the wrong picture. To the public Ari did a stand up job and he worked well to keep the American people informed. So next time you write a book Ari stick to your guns and be proud of what you did. It would make for a much better read."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"This is a good book.Not a 5-star one, but quite good. It's clearly written by Fleischer himself (it has his voice and some blemishes that a ghost-writer would probably have avoided), and it reads like a very direct autobiography.I just finished it and came back to Amazon to write a review, and was astonished by the Publisher's Weekly review. What idiot wrote that?This book is thoughtful and even-handed. Fleischer has opinions and attitudes, and he states them plainly. He's pro-Bush and pro-press (as the PW reviewer seems not to have noticed), and he still carries a torch for the Bush Admin's policies. Should that surprise anyone?I enjoyed it as biography-- Fleischer doesn't carry you into the bedroom with him, but he carries you through his thoughts and emotions while he performed an obviously challenging job. Liberals will disagree with much of what he says, but open-minded liberals, I think, will appreciate his forthrightness.One gets the sense from this book that Fleischer believed both in the rightness of his actions and in the possibility that he may have been wrong. That's all I want of a public servant.A good read all around."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"In his ongoing effort to prove to the reader how clever he was in dodging the media's questions, Fleischer provides the reader with a never ending transcript of his White House Press Conferences and the non-answers they entailed.I have read every book written by previous White House Press Secretaries (Salinger, Powell, Speakes, Fitzwater, Stephanopoulos, et. al.) and Fleischer's is the only one I would NOT recommend reading."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"I see this book as having two quite different subjects.Most of this book is on how the Presidency works under George W. And the result has to be considered pretty good. President Bush seems to have a very definite set of ideas, and to be marching towards their implementation. You don't really know what's going on in the Government until the books from insiders start coming out, and this is a good one. Mr. Fleischer is an admirer of President Bush, and it shows.The second major subject of this book is the national press. They get, Mr. Fleischer says, a thousand facts right every day. But he says the press's first and most pressing bias is in favor of conflict and fighting. This is what gets the headlines. Having Mr. A contradict what Ms. B said gets the headlines, and we outsiders here the conflict and not necessarily what's really happening.The next thing he comments on is the so called liberal bias of the press. He asks:Clinton allowed family planning broups that advocate abortion to receive Federal funds; the press reported he \\"delivered on his campaign promise.\\" Bush reversed this action; the press reported he \\"did something to quickly please the right flank in his party.\\" Why didn't they say Bush \\"delivered on his campaign promise?\\"Right-wing and conservative are standard ways the press describes Republicans, why aren't the Democrats described as left-wing or liberals?Debates about abortion are called debates about \\"abortion rights.\\" Debates about guns are described as debates about \\"gun control\\", not \\"gun rights.\\"The \\"religious right\\" is a press term, why is there no discussion of the \\"religious left?\\""},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Absolutely rip-roaring hilarious!! It appears that he is actually not trying to be comedic but when one reads \\"I will always admire the President's calm and self control\\" (pg. 140, referring to Bush listening to \\"My Pet Goat\\" after being informed that his contry is under attack), it should be obvious that we are in the presence of a comedic master or an idiot who manages to be very funny. Either way, one of the funniest books I have read! Minus one star for some tedious passages trying to show himself in a good light without being funny.The dialogues of george bush that are presented are totally unrealistic and seemed to be calculated to put him in a good light. For eg., he says Bush was a superb military commander as he left all the major decisions to the generals but then conveniently ignores Shinseki. In fact, most of the Iraq war dialogue is very funny now that we know more about what actually happened."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"I read this book hoping to get some insight as to what happened in the first Bush Administration and the way the White House sold the war in Iraq. Instead Ari Fleischer, a man so close to these events, comes across as a Bush loyalist who supports and justifies Bush's policies. It was a waste of time and a lost opportunity to give us some insight and help give us some historical information and honest reflection.There is no discussion of how they used the press to manipulate the public and sell the war. For example, he claims the President was careful never to link Iraq with 9/11. But he never addresses why 70% of the American people in 2003 believed otherwise. How did that happen?After leaving the White House, he is still spinning the President's position and blaming the liberal media. Too Bad...."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"I'm guessing that at least one-half of this book's nearly 400 pages are transcripts -- either of excerpts from the President's remarks or speeches and of the give-and-take at Ari's press briefings. Since Fleischer maintains that his job was never to make news, the transcripts typically illustrate his ability calmly to provide platitudinous non-answers to nearly every question. There are so many of these illustrations that it becomes as tedious and aggravating to the reader as it must have been for the news-hungry journalists. The many excerpts from GWB's remarks serve to reconfirm that -- whatever his other strengths -- it is undeniable (even by his strong supporters) that Bush's rhetorical skills are weak. On the other hand, Fleisher does ably document the naked pro-liberal, anti-conservative bias by so many reporters from the mainstream media; he also demonstrates very convincingly an overwhelming press agenda to create news by finding or exaggerating conflicts between government officials where none exist, i.e. to sensationalize at all costs rather than to inform readers of the real facts. He does a good job, too, of compiling many examples of blatant factual errors by major media, reminding us that, unlike newspapers, broadcast news never troubles to issue corrections. Although my impression of Fleischer from his TV appearances is that he is an interesting, witty, engaging personality, his book is very dry, revealing very little of his personal side and virtually none of the President in whose company he spent so much time. The book contains very few memorable behind-the-scenes anecdotes, and adds astonishingly little to the below-the-surface portrait of Bush (or Fleischer) as a person. The book could have been shortened by half and we would have learned no less about W or Ari."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Regardless of your political views, and I'm sure many will rate this book depending on their political leanings, Mr. Fleischer has written a very interesting view of a very difficult job. I've watched many presidential press secretaries, and never envied their position. The press is critical to our democracy, but why do they continue to ask the same question over and over with different verbiage when it's apparent that they are not going to hear the answer they want. Mr. Fleischer doesn't have an answer for that either, but for an insider's view of history being made, I highly recommend Taking Heat.Mr. Fleischer is not the first to point out the left-leaning tendencies of the press, and this is from a man who was raised a New York Democrat! The major media and newspapers deny it, but it's so subtle and obvious that it seems to go over their heads. Anyway, I was looking forward to reading Taking Heat and was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"\\"Taking Heat\\" may not be a book that liberals and/or left-wingers will enjoy, for it completely exposes the left-leaning bias in today's media - and for that matter, yesterday's media too. I guess a few, open-minded and less radical liberals (they do exist, don't they?) might be able to find some good in the effort, hopefully.Former press secretary Ari Fleischer does a good job of summing up his service to the president, the daily struggle to perform his job to the best of his capabilities, and the general mood inside the White House during some of the most difficult years in quite some time.I found Ari's writing style to be quite enjoyable, and I was extremely impressed with the fact that every single subject I hoped would be discussed in the book was right there in black and white. Ari did not avoid any topic, and he also did not throw in some lame attempt to \\"juice\\" his book up by trying to make others look bad in the public eye. He told his story just like it happened - the way it should be told.I met Ari Fleischer at a book signing in Indianapolis, Indiana. I found him to be a polite, articulate, and just plain calm and humble person; he's also a lot taller than Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels (most people are). His book reflects his personality and warm sense of humor.\\"Taking Heat\\" takes the reader right to the heart of what it is like for the press secretary to try and balance his loyalty to the president with the need to address the White House press corps with important news of the day. Fleischer does an amazing job of uncovering the media bias against Republicans and conservatives:Fleischer points out that \\"left-wing\\" activists are referred to by the media as \\"protesters\\", while more often than not, \\"conservative protesters\\" (of which I'll add you don't see a lot of) are labeled \\"right-wing protesters\\" or \\"conservative opponents\\". He also makes it clear that the president's tax cuts were tax cuts for all tax paying citizens and that 65.7 percent of all income taxes are paid by people making 92,000 dollars or more. Half the population of America pays virtually NO federal income tax, \\"yet they still receive many federal services and benefits.\\"This book also addresses the media's intense focus on only concentrating on controversy, often even trying to create debate amongst administration officials where none exist. Ari writes at length about how the press looks for the negative behind almost every story, ignoring many of the positive stories because they don't grab viewers and readers attention.\\"Taking Heat\\" gives the reader a clear view of President George W. Bush, a man who believes he is leading this nation for a reason and that it is his job to keep America safe, even if that means taking a hit in the polls. One of my favorite parts of this book is when Fleischer discusses Elie Wiesel, the noted humanist, Nobel Peace Prize winner, and Holocaust survivor. Wiesel said, \\"I'm against silence. I'm against neutrality because it doesn't help the victim. It helps the aggressor.\\" I agree with Bush and Fleischer, it was only a matter of time till Saddam Hussein would have to be taken down. I am glad we did it when he could not use weapons of mass destruction.On page 369 of Fleischer's book, he makes a great statement: \\"...that man who gave $25,000 to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers will never again be in a position to give them, or anyone, aid or comfort.\\"From the 2000 election to Ari Fleisher's decision the leave the White House, this book covers every topic I expected to read about - a five star rating it shall receive.See ya next review."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"I have just read Michiko Kakutani 's review of this book in 'The New York Times.' The review is unremittingly hostile, and makes it out to be dull, self- serving, uninformative. It rejects completely the claim that press in the U.S. leans to left, and might be guilty of the bias Fleischer continually accuses it of.From reading the review I had no idea that the book speaks about the great share of the subjects listed in the promotional material on the Amazon site.i.e. \\"The 2000 election, from the recounts to the transition to power September 11, 2001, its aftermath, and the anthrax scare The pressure-filled buildup to the war in Iraq and the President's thoughts as the war beganLife in the White House, from learning to adjust to the pace of the West Wing and his early briefings to his relationship with the pressThe White House press corps, who they are, and how they report the newsThe factors that led to his decision to leave Washington behind.\\"Now I am not sure it is fair to write a review primarily consisting of the criticism of another review. And this when my own political position and instinct leads me to think that Kakatuni is simply guilty of the same liberal bias which is in fact 'The New York Times' standard approach to the world. It may well be that many find Fleischer's book self- serving and dull.But the point is that it was not given a fair review on the basis of its content.

Lies - lies.Lies."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"The author, Ari Fleischer, of TAKING HEAT / THE PRESIDENT, THE PRESS, AND MY YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, having been close to events that may yet produce an indictment of presidential adviser Karl Rove, has a point of view which is in need of a form of analysis made possible in modern society by a heady mix of Freud's books on Thomas Woodrow Wilson and WIT AND ITS RELATION TO THE UNCONSCIOUS. People who appreciate this book are likely to be applying the synthesis at the center of the latter, on \\"The Pleasure Mechanism and the Psychogenesis of Wit\\" and \\"The Motives of Wit and Wit as a Social Process.\\" A little old lady named Helen Thomas is so good at filling the role which clowns reserve for representatives of virtue that Chapter 13 (pages 246-258) gives her a platform capable of illustrating section 64 of Nietzsche's THE GAY SCIENCE on \\"Sceptics. -- I am afraid that old women in their most secret heart of hearts are more sceptical than all men:\\" only to have her observations about \\"turmoil in the Arab world, obviously, from all the things we've been doing\\" answered at the end of the chapter by:ARI: I think there's a lot of silent rejoicing in the Arab world that Saddam Hussein is gone.The silent majority was also used by Nixon to justify his policies, which took years and a Congressional action ending American bombing in Southeast Asia instead of the timetable that \\"Peace is at hand\\" usually implies. Fortunately for Karl Rove, people tend to allow advisers near the top to expect to get away with a variety of secret circus stunts, justified by ideals worthy of THOMAS WOODROW WILSON, as when George W. Bush stated in March, 2003, \\"The best thing we have going for us is that our values will unleash that freedom.\\" (p. 335).Now is hardly the time to use Carl Schmitt's book, THE CONCEPT OF THE POLITICAL, to illustrate what war signifies in modern society:Hegel has also advanced a definition of the enemy which in general has been evaded by modern philosophers. The enemy is a negated otherness. But this negation is mutual and this mutuality of negations has its own concrete existence, as a relation between enemies; this relation of two nothingnesses on both sides bears the danger of war. ([Schmitt's Note], p. 63).It was in answering a question about the cost of such danger, based on an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office of between $9 and $13 billion, that Ari Fleischer made a famous remark, on October 1, 2002, \\"The cost of one bullet if the Iraqi people take it upon themselves is substantially less than that.\\" (p. 286). The form of apology demonstrates techniques Freud associated with wit: \\"I had only one bullet to give my country, and I used it to shoot myself in the foot.\\" (p. 286). Back on May 1, 2002, Helen Thomas was told that regime change in Iraq had already been approved in a law, \\"passed by the House and Senate, signed into law by President Clinton. Regime change, in whatever form it takes, is the policy of the United States government, under President Clinton, continued under President Bush. . . . Helen, if you were the President, you could have vetoed the law. (Laughter) President Clinton signed it, and the President will keep it enforced.\\" (p. 252).Politics in America has become so Schmittian that it is not surprising to find that Ari's gratitude to his editor, Claire Wachtel, in the Preface, is primarily about their political differences:I had the help of many people writing and editing this book. Thank you to my editor at William Morrow, Claire Wachtel. A self-described \\"knee-jerk liberal,\\" Claire helped me--sometimes forced me--to carefully think through my arguments and back them up. She challenged my assumptions and helped me to move from assertions to reasoned statements supported by evidence. What may seem self-evident to a Republican wasn't good enough for Claire. One of the most helpful and effective \\"prods\\" I ever met, I couldn't have written this without her. Thank you for your wisdom. (p. xiii).To rock and rollers, this might sound too much like the chorus of the song \`got my own thing' on Liz Phair's recent \`somebody's miracle' (2005) CD. \\"They say that we would get along. So let's just get along. Oooh boy, I'd love to help. Give you enough rope to hang yourself. And watch the silly things you do.\\" The court of public opinion is not as narrow in its scope as the laws which are likely to come to the attention of a special prosecutor who investigates how secret information is used by those who saw a bit more intelligence than the President saw before he claimed that Congress saw the same intelligence he saw. \\"And I hope you're swinging this way too. Boy I do.\\" Liz sounds like part of a war between sexes that becomes \\"freed from all particular personality\\" (Schmitt, p. 63), as Hegel put it in \\"This war is not a war of families against families, but between peoples, and hatred becomes thereby undifferentiated and freed from all particular personality.\\" People at the top like to pretend that they have a frame of reference which is above Hegel's complicated formulation, but then we get a book like TAKING HEAT."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Wonderfully insightful to the challenges of those with a heart for excellence. And a picture of loyalty and truth bordered with candor."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"This is a very very very funny book. It joins a growing collection of hilarious fiction by old Bush & Co. hacks. Ari Fleischer's TAKING HEAT is waaaay more bitchy fun than Chrissy Whitman's earnest IT'S MY PARTY TOO (in that one, a nice Girl Scout from New Jersey gets bound & gagged at a neo-con reform school) even if it's not quite as titillating as Lynne Cheney's SISTERS, a comic saga of High Plains lesbianism. Still, TAKING HEAT ranks right up there with Bernard Kerik's drop-dead-funny THE LOST SON. Hey, but speaking of ethically challenged bald guys .... the FUNNIEST of these books is yet to COME: the kiss-and-tell autobiography of Jeff Gannon/James Guckert, the multi-tasking reporter/hot-military-escort rentboy who greased his way into the bowels of Ari Fleischer's White House press office."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Ari provides an interesting book in his autobiography as President Bush's White House Press Secretary. I always hate to review books like this because they are so politically charged and ideologues on either side tend to get in a huff over what you say. I will endeavor to keep this as neutral as possible. This book sets out to accomplish many objectives but only hits half of them. First and foremost it is one of the best looks at the role of the press secretary and the sheer stress the job has on a person. Whether you like or hate President Bush there is no one who can deny that the role of press secretary is a hard job especially under a tight lipped and secretive white House. Andy Card's goal as chief of staff was to keep leaks to a minimum which frustrates the press leaving their only source of information the press secretary. When the press secretary is instructed not to discuss military matters it becomes even more adversarial. One of the interesting things learned from the book is what viewpoint the Press Secretary is supposed to have. I found it fascinating that he is only there to represent the views of the president and that does not necessarily have to be the wishes of the branches of government that report to the president.One of the other objectives was to provide a critical narrative of the press and give insight into the White House Press Crops. I found his look at the White House Press fascinating and he really does put you inside the room of the toughest reporters in the United States. He illustrates well his points about the adversarial nature of the press and the desire of the press to create conflict which leads to stories. Many times the same questions are asked over and over hoping for a slip that the Press Secretary cannot afford to give. One of the angles that I think he does handle poorly is the bias of the press. While there are voluminous studies to show that the press is slanted right Ari seems to not acknowledge that all media is biased in one direction or another. The White House press does not give passes to any president. People today do not trust the news they get from the press and rightly so due to the biases that are present be they Fox News or MSNBC. While he highlights the point of on the liberal media it is done far better by Benard Goldberg in his book Bias.Finally Ari tries to make a defense of President Bush and his policies/leadership style. Some of his book seems to be aimed at knocking down the arguments in the Price of Loyalty. While this is another viewpoint again the truth probably lies in the middle. Some of his defenses of trying to shift blame to the press for starting up the Iraq war are fairly ludicrous. Ari does not sit in on any of the national security briefings and the president preferred himself to comment on those matters leaving Ari in a hard position to comment on them after the fact. One of the things he does refute well that many agree with is the loyalty that Bush shows to those who are loyal to him. There is a clear look that Bush's leadership style does work within his White House and he is respected by the staff. Ari also seems to take it upon himself to set the record straight and show the country that Bush did not think of the war in Iraq in a vacuum that many other people including the press also had the same idea along the way. He is largely successful in this although he glosses over one of the critical mistakes. The landing on the USS Lincoln with the banner Mission Accomplished was one of the great errors in the press of fighting the war and it is skipped over here. I think Ari is right in saying that the press views any war that is long as a quagmire and Vietnam and any war where we win quickly is Desert Storm and must be over in a week. There is a lack of reality by the press which filters to the country.Overall an excellent book and very well done. Ari provides unique insight into the Bush White House and while it is biased it does not make it useless. He raises critical questions that require issues to be reexamined and while he is loathe to critize his former boss for the things he did wrong we still see a good look at Bush the man and the President."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"The whiny left will cry foul and hope that the \\"unenlightened\\" middle America continues to stick their heads in the sand, and the stodgy right will brandish this book like a blade of righteous indignation. As a staunch independent, the insight into the left-biased media is vindicating for someone like myself who always has that nagging feeling that you're not quite getting both sides of the story. The writing itself was difficult to pick out a linear theme, more of a textbook to be studied than an autobiography to be leisurely enjoyed. The subject matter however is fascinating, giving you a fly-on-the-wall perspective into the most powerful office on earth."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"I having nothing but praise for Ari Fleishcher's work as President Bush's press secretary. But unfortunately, his decision to treat his book like just another press conference makes for a very disappointing, unsatisfying read. What struck me the most was his failure to offer anything even remotely critical of the President. His hero worship/adherance to the party line as press secretary makes perfect sense, but as an independent minded author, one is forced to question how in his years with the President, he failed to see a single thing that had been handled incorrectly. Is this the immaculate Presidency? Could anyone be that perfect? As a supporter of President Bush, I was hoping to discern a more complete picture of his leadership skills and character. But all you get here is a campaign ad. He even spins the now infamous \\"Mission Accomplished\\" banner, using it as an opportunity to slam the press for failing to report the full breadth of the President's remarks. I supported the war, but c'mon Ari, this was a screw up of monumental proportions in terms of public perception. An honest statement like \\"we were right on the substance, but we made a big mistake in terms of giving our detractors ammunition\\" would have been welcome and refreshing. Instead, like with most campaign commercials, after a while, you just stop listening and want to change the channel."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Ari Fleischer should take a bow for having to deal with both sides...the White House and the media. It's a thankless job and you are always in hot water. I thought this was a good book. Not a great book. There were no major revelations and he slammed the media for being too liberal but overall, it was a book that is worth reading. It was interesting to read his first hand account of Sept. 11th and the lead up to both wars. Of course, he defends the reasoning behind most events but it was still interesting to hear why he believed that way. He talks about how he may know something but can't tell. However, what I found most fascinating is how much he didn't know because the Bush White House was afraid he would tell the press or they didn't want his views. Overall, it's worth buying the bargain book price book."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Helen Thomas: 'Fleischer forgets he gave spin, not facts'Posted on Wednesday, April 06 @ 09:42:19 EDT Former Press Secretary Has Advice For JournalistsBy Helen Thomas, The Boston ChannelUnlike some former White House aides, Ari Fleischer -- who served as President George W. Bush's press secretary during Bush's first term -- has not written a \\"kiss and tell\\" book.In fact, Fleischer's White House memoir, \\"Taking Heat,\\" is so worshipful of the president, Bush could have written it himself.Fleischer says he left the White House because of burnout, a fatigue brought on mainly by sparring with the press -- that is the \\"biased,\\" conflict-loving, predominantly liberal cadre of White House reporters.Another perennial complaint in his book is that reporters focused only on the bad news and did not cover the good news \\"even in a land as hopeful and optimistic as America.\\"More in sorrow than in anger he ends his opus with an epilogue, expressing the hope that his book will challenge reporters and journalism schools \\"to think a little bit differently about how they report the facts.\\"If only he had provided the facts instead of the daily spin. But that's another story.Fleischer did not completely spare himself and recounted some of his flubs. Reporters remember when he warned them that people \\"in this building\\" -- presumably Mrs. and Mrs. Bush -- were taking note of what they said.His biggest boo-boo was in responding to critical remarks by \\"Politically Correct\\" host Bill Maher. Fleischer reminded Americans \\"that they need to watch what they say, watch what they do.\\"He also admitted a gaffe when he appeared to be advocating the assassination of Saddam Hussein, saying the \\"cost of one bullet is substantially less\\" costly than U.S. military action. He told reporters later he had misspoken.His book does not mention the time he told a radio reporter he had listened to her broadcast and that she should \\"watch her tone.\\"Fleischer was one-dimensional in terms of the role he played, serving only one master. In remarks to reporters at a farewell briefing, he said his job was \\"to faithfully articulate what the president is thinking and why he is thinking it.\\"He said the job of the press is to \\"find out everything you can about everything under the sun.\\"Fleischer seemed to forget that he also was a public servant working for all the American people, who pay him. He reduced his job to that of a presidential advocate.Fleischer made it clear that Bush runs a tight ship and is a boss who demands loyalty. He was impressed by Bush's \\"willingness to call things good and evil, to make powerful moral judgments -- and to act on them,\\" adding, \\"That makes him a strong leader.\\"Fleischer said that one of the reasons the White House staff was so loyal to the president is that he is \\"loyal to us. He demands accountability from his staff, but we all found him to be so likable that we were driven to do our jobs well, not to let him down.\\"Fleischer devoted a whole chapter to me and our back-and-forth discussions at White House briefings during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. He said he believed the outcome was a draw.My goal in those encounters -- some of them testy and contentious -- was to get the administration spokesman's on the record about exactly why we were invading Iraq.But don't look for any remorse from Fleischer for his incessant campaign to link Saddam Hussein to lethal weapons and ties to terrorists, both later discredited as wholly without foundation.\\"There is no question that we have evidence and information that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical particularly,\\" he said. \\"This is the reason that the president felt so strongly that we needed to take military action to disarm since he would not do it himself.\\"However, he winds up his book acknowledging: \\"We never did find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ... Yet President Bush still won reelection.\\"He said the voters who \\"worried about terrorism and keeping America safe voted overwhelmingly to reelect\\" Bush, despite the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Fleischer defends his role in pumping up the war. It was just a matter of time until Iraq \\"probably would have weapons of mass destruction and used them against our military forces,\\" Fleischer wrote.\\"From my perch at the podium, I took a lot of heat,\\" he said. \\"I hope I also shed some light.\\"He did that. He showed us that this administration puts a low premium on credibility when it should mean everything.Helen Thomas can be reached at the e-mail address hthomas@hearstdc.com2005, Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc.Reprinted from The Boston Channel:http://www.thebostonchannel.com/helenthomas/4339482/detail.html"},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Getting a look behind the scenes from one of the top media relations professionals in the country is a real treat. Fleischer's experience in dealing with a high-profile supervisor (President Bush) on one side and some of the most aggressive and sometimes partisan press on the other is a great read."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Did my opinion of the president change after reading this book? Not really. I read the book with a somewhat-open mind, in that the book is written from the personal perspective of someone who was there. Fleischer wrote from his perspective; gave his testimoy; in that respect, the books is very well written. We're also talking about someone who trusts the President implicitly, so he's going to defend him. So I can't consider this a totally \\"objective\\" account of what was going on in the White House during the time the war was being debated.I don't particuarly appreciate President Bush's policies and his way of thinking, but I do appeciate the fact that he doesn't change his mind once he makes a decision. (Most might say he won't admit he's made a mistake - that's a risk that's run with standing your ground.)What I did appreciate about the book was the insight into President Bush's character. It explains to me why he thinks the way he does, and helps me understand why he says what he does. Doesn't mean I appreciate what he says, but understanding a person goes a long way in formulating an opinion.I also appreciated the behind-the-scenes view into what was going on in the White House during the tense fall of '01.I loved the insight into the media. Do I think they're biased? Absolutely! The book explains the media as much as it does the White House. Being interested in journalism, I was wrapped up in that part of the book. Doesn't excuse their recent behaviors....but the atmosphere of pressure to get the news out as it happens makes people take corners. I can understand that too.Bottom line: if you're a Bush supporter, you'll love the book. If you a Bush loather, I don't see this book changing your mind. I wish, however, that you might be able to read it to understand why he is how he is..."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"I am a political junkie that loves to read personal accounts of individual's experiences, regardless of their political persuasion. It is with this attitude that I approached Ari Fleischer's book TAKING HEAT. Though many will always think of him as a polarizing individual, I think this book does much to humanize him in a way that few accounts have done.He went from being a person that respected the political process to being thrust into a world that had to convey the President's message to a press that was not always interested in what exactly that message was. I learned alot about Ari the man, from his relationship with his democratic parents and fondness of President Bush. He went into the White House with the goal of contributing something during his time there, and I think he accomplished that goal, though maybe with more challenges than he could have expected.Whether it was dealing with addressing the press and the world after the controversial and heated election results or the tragedy that befell the nation on September 11, 2001, Fleischer took his role seriously.Anyone looking to enter public life should read this book. Again, you might not agree with the politics, but you will be hard pressed to not appreciate the complexities and heart needed to be effective.Definitely two thumbs up on this one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"Because I have always thought a press secretary has to be the strangest job in the white house, and because Ari Fleischer seemed the most sincere among the recent victims, I decided, out of curiousity, to read about his stint during the Bush presidency.It is almost painful to listen to a press briefing on cable television. How can the press secretary who is not a cabinet member, who is privy only to information the administration wants him/her to hear, possibly convey the exact meaning to the sometimes ridiculous questions as to what the President knows or thinks - really. All they can do is try not to give their own opinions and start a firestorm.I enjoyed this book because Ari Fleischer comes across as sincere. He describes his trips all over the world, meetings with foreign leaders, the aftermath of 9/11, events leading up to the Iraq war, engaging with the press until he simply \\"burned out\\" and had to resign. No wonder, a press secretary is on call 24/7 as news is being made all the time.The author has no axe to grind, no grand desire to diminish George Bush, and states he took a lot of heat and hopes he has shed some light. He feels the press can be too conflict-oriented most of the time, and I agree. Here is one press secretary who did his best during a tumultuous time in American history to interpret the news from the White House to the American people in a calm manner. A thankless task indeed. Forget party labels, just enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Taking Heat","review":"If you find yourself watching or reading the news and you are panicking about all that is wrong with the world, it would be helpful for you to read \\"Taking Heat\\".

I bought it again just a few months ago, for my boyfriend's 6-year old daughter. She got as much out of it as did my son.It is simply written and very clearly illustrated!

I actually have the opposite complaint of at least one other reviewer--based on why I purchased this book, I don't think it goes into *enough* detail about the sexual organs. For the other bodily systems (digestive, respiratory, etc.) it explains what the major organs do (Food travels down the esophagus, the heart pumps the blood through the whole body, etc.) with a picture of the system. But, for the reproductive system, it only mentions the penis and vulva, and says that everyone has breasts (which I think might be due to its translation from another language.) Given how the rest of this book is written, the complete omission of the internal reproductive organs, as well as other major external reproductive organs seems confusing and unfortunate. My son is six, which is an age when children seem especially curious about sex organs and sexuality, and demonstrate this through silliness about the topic. I want a book that will give my son matter-of-fact information about *all* of the bodily systems, to take away some of the mystery and demonstrate how to talk about these subjects in a healthy, mature way. This book didn't deliver that for me."},{"Title":"All about Electricity Science Kit (Brighter Child Science Kits)","review":"I purchased this item for my 5 year old to help us learn something during winter vacation.

Being very skeptical of the checklist format, this book, frankly, seemed like a \\"salesman cookbook\\" scheme. Well, I was wrong. It took a little getting used to, but this book is written in a way that helped me learn to sell my company's products and services.Just so you know, I basically flunked IBM sales school for engineers way back in 1991. Some of the information IBM taught stuck because, frankly, it is very good. However, even with IBM sales school (acknowledged as one of the best on the planet), I just did not grasp selling and never took up a career in selling. For all intents and purposes, I am brand new to this.I took this book, and in one week, created a powerful prospecting script. That script, which I created almost word for word from the book, with the exception of items specific to my business, has helped to land two great new customers in only two weeks. That is not to say that it will happen the same way with everyone, but the writers have a sublime grasp of how to talk to people, remain honest, and influence them; so long as you have a sellable product or service. As the authors point out, selling is not about the product or service, but about the seller of the product or service. The suggestions in this book for how to get pass a receptionist and how to conduct a prospecting call are direct, easy to understand, and greatly helpful.It is not necessary to read this book from cover to cover. Many of the lists have references to other lists. It turns out that, with this book, this was the best way for me to learn to sell.

I think it's not only important, but revolutionary that Tears of Joy touches on that most taboo of subjects: sexual abuse of children. My wife was subjected to the cruelty of molestation as a young girl, and she swears by the fact that if she had had a vehicle by which to relate what she had gone through, she may have escaped the torture far sooner. A child will never tell what they don't know how to explain. How can we expect our children to learn how to explain if we don't give them the proper channel through which to do so. Thank God for this book."},{"Title":"Tears of Joy","review":"Child abuse, especially the kind that is sexual in nature, is never easy to talk about - not for the abused or the adults around the child. Barbara J. Behm's simply told Tears of Joy is a good book to use to open the door on this terrible topic.Carly is a cheerful, outgoing child until one day something changes. The reader, like Carly's family and friends in the book, don't know what's behind Carly's sudden change. The once happy girl is now sad and distant and doesn't want to talk or play. Most of the adults around her do the right thing by asking Carly what is wrong, but true to what happens often in real life, Carly says nothing. She doesn't know what to say or even how to say it until her school counselor talks to her.Then the horrible truth comes out and the counselor is able to get Carly to see that the abuse isn't her fault and that, no matter what, telling is the right thing to do. Also included in the book are helpful hints for adults on what to do if a child confides in them and what to do about it.This is the kind of book that should be kept handy in elementary school counselor offices everywhere. If you are an adult and you suspect child abuse is happening, this book may also be a good tool to get the child to talk with you. Written in straightforward language with bright and colorful illustrations, any child can relate to the book's message. There should be more books that tackle this issue, as horrible as it is."},{"Title":"Tears of Joy","review":"All Child/Family counselors should have a copy of this book. It exquisitely and deftly opens the doors for child sexual abuse to be revealed and the healing process to initiate.The story and illustrations invite a child in and draw the child's needs and heart out. It's a perfect door to help open up a situation that needs to be addressed. This tool is ideal and effective. Check it out."},{"Title":"Abstract Algebra: A Computational Approach","review":"Abstract Algebra, A Computational Approach is an introductory textbook on abstract algebra that emphasises the &quot;hands on&quot; approach of computing and calculating everything imaginable: Sets, groups, rings, fields, and the operations on them.This wonderful book struggles with a major problem in math education: How do you get a class of 40 students to visualise abstract algebra? Ideally, you'd want to give many examples and problems for them to work out. Soviet books have traditionally taken this approach, so with many Soviet math books there was a compendium of &quot;1000 solved problems in... &quot;. There are similar books in English, but only for the most elementary courses. Having a few dosen books with solved problems in Topology, for example, would have been a great thing, but there isn't any economic motivation for such books. Alternately, if it were possible to calculate and compute things, then students could experiment with and explore the subject matter on their own. This is what graphing calculators, for example, did to intro calculus classes -- it made it possible for students to experiment and visualise the subject matter like nothing else.But how do you visualise abstract algebra? You could write computer programs to do such things as compute permutations, intersect sets, solve matrices, etc, but in &quot;mainstream&quot; programming languages this would take a while, be error prone and slow down the class. It wouldn't be practical. The author's solution: Use APL! APL is a programming language designed specifically for concisely manipulating vectors and matrices. APL programs are so concise that in one or two lines of APL code students can accomplish what would otherwise take hundreds of lines of C code. With a few keystrokes, students could be performing complex operations on groups and fields and sets. APL is fun, quick and concise, and students will be focused on what really matters -- abstract algebra, rather than delving into the nuts and bolts o yet-another programming language. APL to abstract algebra is like a graphing calculator to studying functions -- it helps, it's fun, it gives intuition and insight.The book doesn't cover as much material as, say, Herstein's book. On the other hand, it will give the students a quick feel for the subject matter. Perhaps the book would be ideal for computer science majors and other non-math majors that are expected to take two semesters of abstract algebra. Another minor issue is that the dialect of APL used in the book is a bit old -- the code's great, but I think the students would have a better experience with APL2 or J. J has a richer numeric tower and much of the supporting software is made redundant by it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of the Warrior Kumagai","review":"A man, at the end of his long life, looks back at it and reflects on it. Popularly but erroniously seen as a romantic/tragic figure, he tells the truth of his life, and in so doing gives the reader an incomparable view of early medieval Japan (Kamakura period), the evolution of Japan from an aristocratic to martial society and makes one reflect on what we believe to be history. This is the saga of a peasant boy who rises to being almost a general, and the tale of how an incredibly cynical man becomes a Buddhist. Well written, fascinating to read, impeccably researched and very accurate. Not an 'action story', but the book has some excellent battle scenes. The only book I could compare it to is Bernard Cornwall's retelling of the Arthurian legends - the &quot;Winter King&quot; trilogy. Donald Richie is well known for his skill and expertise in writing on Japan and his other books are recommended as well.I found the book hard to put down. In reading my review please bear in mind that I have a tremendous interest in Japanese history (lived there, speak some Japanese) so I'm guessing when I say I think it would appeal to anyone who would like to read such a warrior's tale. Also I suspect the book will primarily appeal to males."},{"Title":"The Greek Coffin Mystery","review":"The Ellery Queen stories will remain among the most remarkable American classic mysteries ever written. And this superbly constructed story, The Greek Coffin Mystery, is among the best of Ellery Queen.Ellery Queen first appeared in June, 1929 in The Roman Hat Mystery, followed by The French Powder Mystery (1931), and The Dutch Shoe Mystery (1932). The plot in the fourth story, The Greek Coffin Mystery (1932), actually pre-dates The Roman Hat Mystery and reveals a younger, less-experienced Ellery Queen. We readers see an overly confident Ellery Queen stumble in his deductions and are led through not one, but a several flawed solutions.Not only is this \\"younger and cockier\\" Ellery Queen misled and chastised, but it will be a rare reader indeed that does not likewise become ensnared in faulty deductions and erroneous conclusions. Ellery Queen regains any lost prestige in his final, remarkable deductions that lead unerringly to the actual solution.The New York City setting is an old, drooping brownstone at 11 East Fifty-Fourth Street. Adjacent to the Georg Khalkis residence is one of the oldest private cemeteries in the city. Georg Khalkis had died, apparently of heart failure. His burial is in an old brick-lined subterranean crypt.I am hesitant to say anything more about the plot itself for fear that I might unwittingly say too much. Just be prepared to be surprised.The reader acquainted with Ellery may notice that his penchant for quoting literature (and thereby exercising his ivy league education) is more marked in The Greek Coffin Mystery than in his later stories. We encounter literary and philosophical observations in English, French, German and Latin. Ellery is even able to roughly translate a note in modern Greek from his knowledge of the classical Greek language. Who but Ellery Queen would quote Byron, Goethe, Terence, La Fontaine, Chaucer, Rousseau, and Schopenhauer while solving a muder?Like Nero Wolfe, another famous master of deduction, Ellery also enjoys an occasional vocabulary excess, treating the reader to expressions like \`eremitic in its furnishings', \`caparisoning his cousin', \`greatest animus', and \`the charming amanuensis'.The Greek Coffin Mystery is classic Ellery Queen. The plot is intriguing, the characters are memorable, and Ellery Queen's exercise in deduction is simply dazzling. The Greek Coffin Mystery is no longer in print, but used copies, especially in paperback, are still available. Make the effort to find a copy. This is definitely a five star Ellery Queen masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Greek Coffin Mystery","review":"This is one of the first Ellery Queen's books that I read. Before I used to read books by 'Agatha Christie'. Being introduced to EQ character and his method of deduction for the first time had me hungry for more. As with the other reviews regarding this book I agree with them totally. The grand finale is mind boggleling."},{"Title":"The Greek Coffin Mystery","review":"Not even Agatha Christie in her prime could construct a detective story plot of this complexity, with so many delicious twists and turns. Ellery Queen investigates the murder of a man who was found mysteriously buried in another man's coffin. There are many suspects, and as the story progresses the plot just gets more and more complex (for most mysteries it's the reverse).What's notable about THE GREEK COFFIN MYSTERY is the number of solutions. There are no less than four solutions to the mystery, but only one of them--the last one--is the true one. The final solution comes as a genuine shock--when I found out who the murderer was, I was momentarily tempted to throw down the book in disbelief. But Ellery Queen's careful deductive processes show that only (blank) could possibly have committed the crimes. This is an absolute tour de force, a must-read for mystery readers like myself who have, until this point, lived under the illusion that only English writers can construct ingenious plots. Ellery Queen has more than proven that the quality can be an American one as well."},{"Title":"The Greek Coffin Mystery","review":"I have read al lot of detective stories, but I have never found one with a more complex plot than this one. This is not like an Elizabeth George detective or something like that. This book focuses on the mystery. Even more special: the reader gets all the clues the detective finds (not like Sherlock Holmes, who keeps everything to himself), so you can find a solution yourself,........ but than you have to be brilliant!!Read it!"},{"Title":"The Greek Coffin Mystery","review":"The two cousins from Brooklyn are no longer with us, but their literary creation is still alive and kicking. One of their earliest mysteries, published in 1932, this book has a difficult puzzle to perturb problem-solving mystery fans and a more human detective than the thinking machine with which they started. Remember this was still the heyday of best selling Philo Vance detective stories which were the model for successful detecting until the tough guy series came to the fore. The story starts simply enough, the wealthy owner of an art gallery has died of natural causes, arousing no perplexing problems but the search for a new will has proven fruitless. In the search for that will another body is found, this one surely the product of murder. The puzzler has mystery, a bit of romance, many interesting characters and a less than infallible amateur detective who tags along with his eminent police inspector father. The co-authors write well, create memorable characters, spin many a web of puzzlement. While denser in style than their later works, this one is still an easy read, captures ones imagination, and involves one with its people. Still a first rate example of its genre."},{"Title":"The Greek Coffin Mystery","review":"It is my habit to read a \\"mystery\\" series from first published to last. Poirot, Lord Peter, Oliver Thorn, Albert Campion, Travis McGee, Doc Ford, Elvis Cole, Kinsey Milhone and, of course Sherlock Holmes -- all read from beginning to end. I am currently in the Ellery Queen series and am finding it a very difficult read. The Greek Coffin Mystery (of those that I have read) is the most difficult."},{"Title":"The Greek Coffin Mystery","review":"Excellent period mystery [early 1930s].

He should replace a new one with no beard."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"As a mystery author with my first novel in its initial release, I am a great admirer of the works of Thomas Perry, especially his Jane Whitefield series. DEATH BENEFITS does not feature Perry's popular Seneca lead, yet it is a true winner nevertheless. DEATH BENEFITS involves an ordinary man who discovers talents and abilities within himself that he was unaware that he possessed when he finds himself placed in a fresh and dangerous role. John Walker is drafted from his routine job by a shadowy Max Stillman to investigate insurance fraud against McClaren Life and Casualty. Together, the men track their prime suspect .... They eventually travel to other locales and uncover a series of crimes with roots planted long ago. John Walker is a fascinating character and perhaps he will return in future Perry books."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"In the first thirty pages the characters leap out of this book, tie you to your chair, and won't release you until Walker and Stillman go east. But it doesn't continue, and that's too bad! With a superb plot, and captivating suspense, Perry really ensnares his readers and keeps them in suspense until he decides to tell another story. Here, the second part of the novel is attenuated to the point that you'll need a map to figure out where the action is at the end.I think the story goes downhill when our insurance operatives leave the state. Certainly, any semblance of credence is left in the main office. Too bad. Perry is a gifted mystery writer, but he doesn't do well with science fiction."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"the ending is not very plausible. however, if you are looking for something fun and attention-holding to, say, read on a plane, this is very entertaining. i enjoyed it despite the slight letdown at the end. the characters, while not exactly three-dimensional , were likeable, the plot well-done."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Perry is a pro, who like many others this year decides to opt for a change of characters. Walker and Stillman, whose names seem to describe their personalities, are pupil and teacher in this interesting thriller. (Echoes of John Sanford's computer thrillers) You will not be able to stop once you get to the last 100 pages. Great descriptive writing- &quot;Seeing her pull clothes over that smooth, white body was like watching the moon being obscured by dark clouds&quot;, is just one of the rewards of this work. Have fun."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"First let's get one thing straight: I'm a Thomas Perry fan. I like just about everything he's written and I've yet to read Butcher's Boy which I understand is his best. But Death Benefits is not up to his usual standard. I had this one figured out way before the characters had even a clue. The ending was that predictable except for my question: Where did the FBI suddenly come from?No one, not even Thomas Perry, can make the insurance industry remotely interesting. Inside job? He only presented us with two possibles. If it was an inside job...had to be one of 'em. But if it was an inside job, why weren't these two main characters followed and taken out before they could follow their plodding way to the end?Why at one point did Serena, the computer hacker, know that the FBI wasn't getting anywhere, and later had no information on the FBI at all, especially that they were right behind them, ready to step in and save their little tushies?By the way, I know such criminal enterprises exist (not exactly in this form though) and it would have been interesting to get inside this one and see how it works. The denouement didn't explain all of the tidbits the author dropped along the way: Why 27 cops? What went on in that New Systems building? What kept the criminal enterprise together? Was McClaren Insurance the only company targeted? If not, didn't anyone else notice the scam?Are we really supposed to believe that no one in the county ever wondered about, and did a news story on, this enterprise? If so, Perry doesn't understand anything about how governments interact (the states with the counties and the counties with the cities), how people gossip, and how reporters get their story ideas.Not good, not good at all."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"I bought this in hardback when it first came out because I have enjoyed this authors work for some time. I was not disappointed. This book builds to a really different and interesting climax and the characters of John Walker and Max and the others were fascinating. Even the murdered woman became real and you grieved with John at her death. The reason for her death enraged you. In all of this, Thomas Perry engaged you from start to finish.I, personally, think John &amp; Co are worthy of a series of their own, but I, unlike some people, do like a beginning, a middle, and an end to a series. I loved Jane whitfield and it was believable that she retired. (I also love Babylon 5-a five year TV series that came to a conclusion) I would like to get to know John Walker better."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"I'm a huge fan of Perry's Whitefield series - I'm always sad when I've reached the end. Not so with this one. Perry's writing isn't terrible, but it's not great either. The first half reminds me of Ayn Rand - it's sparse. She, however, pulled it off much more effectively than Perry. Also in her favor, Rand had a point to make with her plot and her style, which Perry doesn't seem to. The second half reminded me of Robin Cook or Michael Palmer (both of whom I can't stand) in terms of plot. Overall, I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Thomas Perry is the writer Grisham, Deaver, Frey, et al, only wish they could be. He has a crisp and lucid style -- never degenerates into the hardboiled (though I quite like that style on occasion) -- and he not only understands the way people act, but what's better, he knows how they REact. John Walker is bit younger, more naive, more conventional than any of Perry's protagonists I can recall, and he is the perfect foil for the cynical, earthy Stillman. Perry has a classic gift for delivering dialogue guaranteed to make me laughingly snort my cup of tea, an example being Stillman's theory that it's the soothing quality of doughnuts that makes the Red Cross foist them off on disaster victims. It's funny because, like so much that's funny, it's partly true. What more can I say? If you don't read this book it's your loss. And when you suddenly discover it in some used bookstore 10 years hence, you'll wonder why you ever resisted in the first place!"},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"I've been a fan of Thomas Perry's work since his first book, Butcher's Boy. Perry is one of the rare writers who never inflicts himself on his material, but rather allows the characters to evolve and speak for themselves. His writing is spare, never cluttered, and his characters are always fully realized and highly distinctive. Death Benefits is a fine example of a writer at peak form. Aside from a truly intriguing plot line that extrapolates on the possibilities of misusing life insurance that have not (at least to my knowledge) previously been explored, we have a central character who, at the age of twenty-four, grows up within the pages of this book--ably and entertainingly pulled along by the fascinating Stillman and the clever Serena. What I particularly liked about the character of Stillman, aside from his ingenuity, is his humor and wisdom. There's a lot of truth about life, and about the process of personal growth in these pages. Much as I enjoyed it, though, I found the &quot;bad guys&quot; to be rather an implausible creation. That said, this is a thoughtful and entertaining book, and the last hundred pages of Death Benefits make for a breathless ride. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"In Pasadena, California, insurance agent Ellen Snyder approves the payment of the twelve million-dollar death benefit to an impostor. Not long afterward, Ellen vanishes somewhere between the nearby airport and apparently LA. The impostor has also disappeared. A stunned McClaren Life and Casualty hires private investigator Max Stillman to investigate the fraud.After making inquiries in both the Pasadena and the San Fransicso based home office, Max successfully recruits John Walker, an analyst working for his client, to assist him on the case. Max believes John can help him because he amorously knew Ellen when they were trainees. John agrees to help because he believes the woman he still loves is innocent of any wrongdoing. With opposite motives, John and Max begin a trek around the country in an effort to locate the money and the two culprits behind the felony.If anyone had doubts that no one does suspense thrillers better than Thomas Perry does, just read the exciting, action-packed and character driven DEATH BENEFITS. Only a great writer with the talent of Mr. Thomas can turn insurance companies and related fraud seem glamorous and exhilarating, but that is what the author accomplishes in this fabulous tale. Max and John make a powerful team even as their individual traits make them seem like real people. The who-done-it is cleverly designed from the start, when Ellen flees into the night, and never eases up as the audience has another mystery from one of the genre greats.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"I agree with those that liked the characters of John Walker and Max Stillman as well as the premise of this novel. As the characters worked their way through the puzzle of how somebody was defrauding McLaren Life and Casualty out of millions of dollars the intrigue gets more complex, interesting and very dangerous. However, the answer to the puzzle struck me as so implausable that after following what had become a real head scratching story, I could not help but wonder why the author had chosen to go there. I have enjoyed all of the Jane Whitefield books and am still looking for a copy of The Butcher's Boy, but this book is simply not up to what I have come to expect from this author.

The story is suspenseful (if not altogether plausible) and he again creates interesting multidimensional protagonists. Like all his books, this one includes extensive descriptive settings so the reader always has a strong physical point of view to accompany the narrative.Some reviewers have had a problem with the ending, but I found it a unique twist. Yes, one must suspend disbelief when reading; but, what fun thriller doesn't require that?

In their search for Ellen and some leads about the missing 10 million they encounter several bad guys and get roughed up and a computer specialist who can seemingly get into any data base. When a hurricane hits Florida, John is not only caught in the midst of it but uncovers a thread of the scam they are investigating. Several clever deductions lead John Max and Mary Catherine Casey ( John's new girl friend) to a small New Hampshire town that proves to be the base of a much larger scam than they started with.The last 100 pages of the mystery are a real screamer and will keep you reading late into the night as John, Max and Mary struggle to save their lives and return with the story.Once again Thomas Perry has not disappointed me. The only tiny point of criticism is that John's relationship with Max seems much too unlikely. He follows Max with too obligingly. Never-the-less and excellent read."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"This was a great read. Perry has a new character John Walker, not a professional like the Butcher Boy nor anything like his Jane series. I was glad to see Perry branch out and do new material, many of my favorite authors last year seemed to just plug out another sequal setting up another sequal. Though I would like another book about Walker.Walker is pulled from his small cubicle at an insurance company by Stillman a &quot;trouble shooter&quot; and matures as the case proceeds and expands. At first he resists but since the case involves a former girl freind of his (who seems to be either setup or guilty of pulling of a 12 million dollar insurance scam), he feels the need to see the case through and prove her innocent.All the main characters were well developed and the plot was rivoting. The end was a little quick and the FBI involvement a little weak but all in all a great story."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"I'll skip the plot intros shown in other reviews. There are a limited number of authors whose books I'll reread every few years and all of Perry's books heretofore have fit into that category. When I saw him at a booksigning last year and he explained about Jane being left to wedded bliss and new characters in the next book, I had no regrets since so many series characters become stale after a while.Max Stillman is fun but a not-unwelcome repetition of similar characters that figured prominently in &quot;Metzger's Dog&quot; and I believe &quot;Dance for the Dead&quot;. I enjoyed Max's comment about age in which he says &quot;The ones (changes) you can't see are bigger than the ones you can. One day you just discover that you can't watch this movie or read this book or have this conversation any more. Sometimes you've had it too many times already, but at others, it's not even that. It's just that nothing in it is anything that you're interested in anymore.&quot;Perry's books are always about clever people and I enjoy the way he uses his secondary characters so the primary person can explain how they're in fact so clever (it's done totally modestly). Max starts out being clever but too many years or too many of the old fashioned Mai Tais creep up and he loses his edge and becomes very naive towards the end.While the maturation under fire of John Walker is interesting, his statements don't always stay in character. Sometimes he seems the only one who knows what's going on and then he's back to the bumbling way he was. There are numerous implausible circumstances.Those are the cons. While this is the weakest of all Perry's books, he's done so well before, he's entitled. How does this compare to what else is out there, not much of a contest.

But \\"boring\\" is exactly the wrong word to use to describe this wonderfully exciting novel. I was hooked from the first few pages and just could not put it down. This is one of those suspense thrillers where you love the characters and are so swept up in the story you forget to make dinner for yourself.

It's been a very entertaining journey so far, and 'Death Benefits' does not disappoint. Perry's writing skills are still at the top of their form - Here's an example from early on in the story:Stillman sat down and squinted up at the waiter for a few seconds as though the two of them were at a poker game and the waiter had just raised. The waiter held a tiny pad in the palm of his hand with a pen poised over it.

It seemed to Walker that the pad must be for appraising the customers, and Stillman had scored high.The characters are believable and, of course, as with every Perry novel, you learn something new in case you decide to embark on a life of crime. I knew the 'surprise' last quarter of the novel before the characters figured it out, but no big deal. It's a definite page turner. Read it!!"},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Thomas Perry has produced an excellent story, with fresh and intriguing characters, that is impossible to put down. He gives us enough to really care about the characters, and want to know more. I hope this is the first of a number of books about these characters."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"I once accidently got a subscription to \\"GQ\\". I found it very interesting, since apparently what men want most is to be like James Bond. Drop a man off in a strange city and he wants to go to the right restaurant, order the right drink, have woman throw themselves at him, and most of all, win the admiration of other good men. Oh, and fight evil, too.Thomas Perry want to help you with this. He not only wants to tell you the right drink, he wants you to win the respect of the bartender (\\"The Pursuit\\"), to successfully hide from the Mafia (\\"Butcher's Boy\\"), and to become the perfect mass-murderer (\\"Sleeping Dogs\\"). His books are practically how-to manuals for coolness, as long as you don't let sissy things like morality get in your way. In this book, \\"Death Benefits\\", he wants to show you how wrong you are to want a secure job at an insurance company when you could be chasing criminals across the continent with your dashing boss, limitless expense account, and adoring female colleague.The book has an interesting 3-part structure, starting when young innocent John Walker is lured away from his cubicle when a former girlfriend disappears and is accused of fraud; he agrees to help the free-lance investigator Max Stillman because he wants to clear the woman of involvement in the crime. While doing that, he has to help out at the company's Florida branch when a hurricane comes roaring in, and while there, stumbles upon clues that lead him to a small New England town where the solution to all his questions may lie..... Walker is an engaging character, and you can't help but root for him to \\"find himself\\" as he solves these mysteries. The problem is that Perry finally over-reaches with the small New England town, stealing his plot, improbably, from H.P. Lovecraft, with regrettable results.If you aren't a \\"GQ\\" kind of man, you might even get tired of Max Stillman, who fights crime with methods the police aren't allowed to use, and triumphs over evil while making loads of money. He's not even slightly believable, so it may seem a waste of time following his exploits and writing down tips in case *you're* ever a free-lance crime-fighter. I personally prefer the old-fashioned police procedural, where I may learn something real about crime and punishment."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"This was a good read. It wasn't a story in which you could predict what was going to happen. I enjoyed it. I also liked the Jane Whitefield novels by this author."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Thomas Perry is a superb storyteller. His \\"The Butcher's Boy\\" is a masterpiece of suspense. \\"Death Benefits\\" doesn't rise to that level, but it is still suspense, wonderfully woven.Ellen Synder, a fast rising star for the McLaren insurance company, leaves before dawn for a mysterious meeting. At McLaren's headquarters, John Walker, an analyst is taken under the wing by Max Stillman, a security investigator. Walker, who had a brief romance with Snyder, is needed because Snyder may have been somehow involved with a multi-million dollar fraud.Thus begins a cross-country journey with timeouts for a few dead bodies, a Florida hurricane, more insurance scams and more than one life threatening experience.Perry's characters have depth and are interesting. A burly computer hacker and his far more attractive associate get involved.The quest leads them ultimately to an odd New Hampshire town with centuries of thievery behind it - and a town where everyone packs a gun and wants to kill Walker, Stillman and Serena, the lissome computer hacker.The ending is a bit disappointing, but still well done.All said, it's Thomas Perry: a masterful suspense novelist at work. It's an enjoyable, often tense read.Jerry"},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Being a fan of Thomas Perry's Jane Whitfield, I was prepared for disappointment. Oh ye of liitle faith! Perry's new characters, Walker and Stillman are great! I hope this won't be a one shot book with these characters. It is complete in itself, but for lovers of series with the same characters, one can only hope that this was their debut. A combination of murder, suspense and a surprising ending. Couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Okay, so there's no Jane Whitefield. But I only really missed her for the first few pages, and after that I was hooked. This author could (should!) teach classes in pacing and clarity. After a Thomas Perry novel I have to spend a few nights catching up on lost sleep before I start reading something else. This is the first of his non-Jane books I've ever read. I'll be back for more, though Jane Whitefield will always be first on my favorites list."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"McClaren Life and Casualty is the kind of staid, respectable insurance company that inspires trust. That's one of the reasons that John Walker took a job there as an insurance analyst. Spending his days toiling away, staring at a computer screen in his cubicle, he certainly wasn't expecting any action or danger. When tight-lipped investigator Max Stillman enters the picture, though, that changes very quickly.Part of the joy of reading &quot;Death Benefits&quot; is watching the plot unfold as we, along with John Walker, are drawn deeper into the mystery. Perry's skillful plotting slowly peels away the layers of the crime as he gradually tightens the screws of suspense. He really is a master at this kind of book.&quot;Death Benefits&quot; appears to be a stand-alone novel, although these characters would certainly be very welcome in a return. Adding this to the superb Jane Whitefield series, Perry proves that he is one of the absolute best writers in the genre today. If you're not reading him, you should be."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Elmore Leonard has famously described the reason for his success this way: \\"I leave out the stuff other writers put in.\\" Thomas Perry puts in that stuff, and then doubles it. Take this elevator ride of utterly no importance to the story. He takes care of the whole trip with just eight words, saying that the protagonist, Walker, \\"rode down with him in an elevator.\\" But he can't just stop there. He goes on: \\"The elevator stopped every second or third row to pick up middle-aged women who seemed to know one another, some of them pulling suitcases on wheels, so that by the time it had descended ten floors, Walker was occupying himself by estimating the weight of each passenger and her burdens, adding them up and comparing the total to the elevator's capacity printed on the little card beside the door.\\" Sixty-nine words that could have been omitted entirely.Perry saddles the reader with one of these overstuffed moments on nearly every page. \\"There was a young woman at the front desk who wore a thin wire telephone microphone that came from a spot above her right ear across her cheek to a place just to the right of her lips.\\" What incredible powers of observation! Imagine! The gizmo came to a place TO THE RIGHT OF HER LIPS! Not to the right of her chin or to the right of her elbow, but right to the right of her lips! How could we go on with the story without having all this vital information about a young woman never seen again, wearing a thin wire telephone microphone of utterly no importance?But then, a few pages later, instead of putting something in that isn't needed, he leaves out something that IS needed. The protagonist visits a men's store, purchases a suit off the rack, takes it directly to his car and puts it on in preparation for an important meeting -- omitting the fact that no suit bought off the rack in any store comes with trousers ready to wear. They invariably come inches too long so that they can be hemmed to fit each individual customer, no matter how short or tall. Either Perry didn't know how to fix the problem or he thinks readers are too numb in the head to notice such a blatant oversight.Being a great fan of Perry's early Jane Whitefield novels, I thought (after many intervening years) I'd have a look at what he was doing more recently. After a hundred pages I gave up waiting for something to happen in Death Benefits -- something like the beginning of a story. But I'll never forget the way the telephone gizmo came down right to that girl's lips. I'll treasure that image."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"The book was as new.

Unfortunately, a great character, special security consultant Max Stillman, unaccountably becomes stupid in the final third of the book. He's way ahead of the main protagonist, John Walker, and the readers in the first part of the book, then way behind both Walker and the readers in the last part. I knew what was going on in the town Walker and Stillman were investigating 100 pages before they figured it out. Case in point, when Stillman and Walker saw that the local police department -- serving a tiny hamlet of around 400 people -- had something like 18 police cruisers and a professionally staffed police department, they only thought it mildly interesting. (In reality, a town of this size would likely have one cruiser, maybe two cops tops, and they'd likely be of the minimum-wage lifer variety.) The other problem is that somehow Stillman, a professional security consultant, Walker, an insurance analyst helping Stillman, and a gonzo computer hacker accompanying them, somehow went out on an investigation without anyone carrying a cell phone.No, I'm sorry, I love Thomas Perry's work usually, but this one badly fell apart about halfway in."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"I had to take an unexpected trip recently and someone handed me this book to fill the time. I'd never read anything by Perry before, but now I'm going to be seeking out his earlier work and watching for new ones. It's a thriller that's big on character as well as action, and I'm amazed it hasn't already come out as a movie. John Walker is an analyst in the headquarters of a San Francisco insurance company, a small-ish, old fashioned sort of outfit that competes successfully with the conglomerates by concentrating on service. A young woman, a rising sales person in the Pasadena office with whom he had had a brief relationship eighteen months before, seems to have skipped out in the middle of a $12-million-dollar fraud, and Max Stillman, the company's \\"security expert,\\" takes Walker along on his investigation. The case, which now includes a murder, is brought to a not very satisfactory conclusion less than halfway through the book -- obviously, there's more to come. Walker is sent off to the company's Miami office to help out in the immediate aftermath of a hurricane, where he stumbles upon a very similar scam and hollers for help. Stillman quickly arrives in Miami and the chase is on again -- and Perry brings new meaning to the phrase \\"criminal conspiracy.\\" Along the way, Walker gets involved with a young female hacker whose boss supplies Stillman with illegally obtained information for his work, and she gets caught up in the massive fraud case as well. All three principal characters are nicely developed, with Walker becoming less innocent and more active as he learns from Stillman, and the details of the insurance business and how ingenious insurance fraud can be are interesting as well. The puzzle takes awhile to solve, . . . and I think I'll just stay the heck away from little New Hampshire towns."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Another winner from Thomas Perry. The hero comes from an unexpected source and by the end has found his true calling. I would like to see more of John Walker from Mr. Perry. John Walker is a character to rival Jane Whitefield."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"I bought this in hardback when it first came out because I have enjoyed this authors work for some time. I was not disappointed. This book builds to a really different and interesting climax and the characters of John Walker and Max and the others were fascinating. Even the murdered woman became real and you grieved with John at her death. The reason for her death enraged you. In all of this, Thomas Perry engaged you from start to finish.I, personally, think John &amp; Co are worthy of a series of their own, but I, unlike some people, do like a beginning, a middle, and an end to a series. I loved Jane whitfield and it was believable that she retired.

The three main charactors are as strong and charming as any in fiction, and if the plot gets a little wild in places, it's still quite a ride. I read for fun, and this is more fun than any other thriller I can think of."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"John Walker works as a data analyst for McLaren Life and Casualty, a respected insurance company, when a mysterious character named Stillman, to help investigate the disappearance of one of the company's sales people, enlists him. Not only had the salesperson disappeared, but also, so had a significant payout, $12 million to be exact.Once they hit the road, the thrill of the chase really takes hold. Thomas Perry gives us a very interesting insight into what it takes to try to find someone who doesn't wish to be found. This is in stark contrast to his Jane Whitefield series in which we come at the problem from the side of the person trying to evade capture.Apart from a small lull in the action upon arriving in New Hampshire, the book was compelling reading with problem after problem needing to be solved. As it turned out, the small lull in New Hampshire was just an opportunity for me to get my breath back before the real fireworks began."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"The basic premise is interesting. The intricacy of the insurance world is explained quite well and John's life is boring. However the problem comes in the third act when Max, John and the new girl with many names are trapped in a town that is evil. Nice twist, an almost unexpected road leading to this final showdown. But here;s the problem Ellen Snyder (assistant manager at the Pasadena branch office of McLaren Life and Casualty, pays out a 12 million dollar death benefit to an imposter and then disappears, company red flags go up all over)a pivotal character dead before any other characters get to interact with her. John only reflects on his brief affair. I felt a little cheated when her body is found, quite impossibly, in a field. She's instrumental to the case yes but also to the who tableau of the crime and hence the book. The replacement girl is suppose to be this genius interesting thing but she comes in as a pale substitute.Security consultant, Max Stillman, is called in to clean up the mess. Grabbing data analyst, John Walker, from McLaren's San Francisco headquarters to assist him, because he knew Ellen intimately, the two set off across the country, tracking Ellen and the money. Stillman's convinced she's guilty of insurance fraud. Walker is sure she's innocent and sticks with Stillman and the case to protect and defend her. But what these two find, at the end of the road, shocks and surprises even Max Stillman, and he's seen it all. However at a certain point the obvious becomes apparent and the three of them trapped in this town that kills for cash is played well but never pays off.What hurts the book is that we're total outsiders to this town and its residents so they're all violent zombies attacking the heroes. There is no connection to the villains, they're just a mass facelss mob. If Ellen had been one of them then we could see some motivation see some betrayal, some game played. I love Thomas Perry's work but no one is close to getting into the scrapes that Jane Whitefield does and gets out of.Max Stillman is good, not a Jane but good. John just gets to be a newbie and the chickie who loves computers is just there as a sex convenience and DC-esque Oracle.A nice ride but don't expect the bells and whistles and porterhous you get with 4 out of 5 of teh Jane Whitefield books. This is a departure when instead there should have been some kind of combo action. Jane trying to hide Ellen as Max.John and towns[people close in all for different reasons.

As a fan of Thomas Perry's other novels, I can only say that this was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. This is 2/3 of a good book."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"Thomas Perry's newest novel shifts gears slightly from his successful Jane Whitefield series, but still focuses on missing persons, the occasional murder, and big money pay-offs. Death Benefits introduces us to John Walker and Max Stillman, investigators for a large family-owned insurance company, who are looking for Ellen Snyder, a missing young female insurance executive who is thought to have participated in a fraudulent $12 million death benefit claim. Walker is a deskbound claims analyst who is chosen by the mysterious Stillman, a hired private investigator, to find Ms. Snyder, and maybe the money. Walker has a past relationship with the missing Ms. Snyder, and Stillman plans to exploit this fact to track down his prey.The experienced Stillman and the young, almost naive Walker make an interesting pair, flying from one city to another, running into trouble along the way, committing a few break-ins and burglaries, and discovering that a giant conspirancy may be behind fraudulent death benefit claims. Perry throws in humor along the way, and is very good at balancing the knowing Stillman with the neophyte Walker. Throw in Serena, a mysterious computer hacker, who assists the insurance guys in their quest for the truth, and the end result is an enjoyable romp in the intrigue of insurance fraud. The last part of the book moves at a breakneck pace, and although the ending may appear rather abrupt, the reader looks forward to another pairing of Stillman and Walker, with Serena added for some flavoring."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"When Ellen Snyder, assistant manager at the Pasadena branch office of McLaren Life and Casualty, pays out a 12 million dollar death benefit to an imposter and then disappears, company red flags go up all over and security consultant, Max Stillman, is called in to clean up the mess.

After reading many positive reviews for his work, I picked up a copy of Death Benefits at my local library. This tale of insurance fraud and murder was refreshingly original. I must say, however, that the pace of the story seemed awkward and uneven at times.Walker, the young insurance analyst who is pressed into sevice by the grizzled veteran investigator, seems to take getting attacked in alleys by thugs and shot at right in stride. He follows Stillman, the investigator, around like a puppy,taking everything he says as gospel. The ending was reminiscent of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, not in the Sci-Fi sense. You'll understand when you read it.Overall, I wasn't blown away by Mr. Perry but he has sparked my interest and I will check out other titles by him."},{"Title":"Death Benefits: A Novel","review":"This is my first Perry book and hopefully would not be the last impression I get. _Death Benefits_ starts off wildly interesting; we are drawn to the life of an overachiever (Ellen) who has mastered the art of the chameleon in order to succeed within a large insurance company. She mysteriously disappears, after being responsible for an astronomical 12 million dollar payout to a con-man. The insurance company reacts by calling in their reserves. We are dragged to her manhunt by her friend Walker, who is sure that Ellen is an unwilling victim. Part of the interest at this point comes from Max Stillman, a jack-of-all-trade former police officer who has converted his skills into a bounty hunter/sleuth for the private sector. Part of the fun is watching Stillman and his many antics and deductions about human nature. However, by the time we get drawn into the con-men's town, the gig is up and the rest of the story reads like _The Bedford Wives_ or _Children of the Corn_. The bad guys are faceless and difficult to identify or understand.I was moderately disappointed in this first try of an author that gets such high reviews in his genre.

He was smart enough to realize that they had pretty much run their course (many authors aren't). Thomas Perry moved on to a new set of characters. There is some of the same race-around-the-country, find-anyone feeling, but not too much.Mr. Perry has put in a fair amount of intelligence, too. In many of the interactions between the two main characters (Walker, who is inexperienced and Stillman who is an old pro) Walker figures out why Stillman is or is not doing something or why Stillman did or did not ask something. The conclusion always leads to an &quot;aha&quot; moment, but it isn't spoon fed to the reader.I found the female lead a delight.

I only kept reading this book because it's by Thomas Perry and I kept thinking, 'it's got to get better.'Instead, it gets worse. And, it manages to be both paranoid and boring. The book divides roughly into 2 parts: pre-and-post-finding of Ellen Snyder. The pre section is reasonably involving, although it ultimately asks us to believe that the perpetrators can drug someone enough to keep them compliant but not so much that they can't stand upright and move through airports without attracting unwanted attention.After the first section comes to an inglorious halt (the protagonists, Walker and Stillman, have found no usable information on who is perpetrating the insurance fraud), the second never really gets going. For one thing, the second section of the book never really has anything to do with the first section: completely different type of crime and different style of committing the crime.Between the two sections no sense at all emerges of who the perpetrator(s) might be or their motive.We go along with the two odd-couple protagonists (Walker and Stillman who have some appeal) on shopping trips and small time breaking and entering, trying to get leads which mainly don't develop. Real nail biting stuff.Finally, the heroes cross the border into what they think is New Hampshire, but is really the Twilight Zone. Only, without the camp appeal or Rod Serling's compelling baritone. It turns out the bad guys are an entire Stepford town!Or, maybe not. Maybe it's only some of the town and the rest are innocent wives, children (husbands aren't innocent, I guess) and a rather elaborate undercover FBI operation. Come to think of it, if the FBI is on the case that thoroughly, what's the point of Walker & Stillman?The other loose end -- who was aiding and abetting the bad guys from inside the insurance company? -- is tied up sketchily and perfunctorily. How long has this massive conspiracy been going on? Why has Maclaren just now been targeted? Who was this insider and how did he operate?Who knows? Who cares? Certainly not Perry, and not me. I doubt you will either."},{"Title":"Saints and Angels All Around (Winners of the Race)","review":"Synopsis:Saints and Angels All Around is a series of short (2-3 pages)biographies of 36 saints and 4 angels.The book is designed to be a daily devotional so preceding each biography there is a Bible verse and following each there is a short prayer and a suggestions for further prayer.My review:Since I did not read the book the way it was intended (one day at a time for each saint or angel) but instead plowed right through it, I found the book fairly tedious. I found a great number of the biographies to be too short and lacking some historical context (once again, the result of it being a daily devotional rather than a true written history of the saints). The exception was St. Laurence (Lawrence) who stood up to the Roman government with a great sense of humor.Laurence was a deacon in the Church of Rome and was told to bring the Roman prefect the wealth of his church. He promised he would and on the appointed day he brought thousands of people to the prefect's courtyard and said that these people were the treasure of the church. The prefect did not find it amusing and Laurence was burned to death on a gridiron (like a giant barbecue grill). While he was being grilled to death, Lawrence was asked if he wanted to recant his faith. He told the executioner to step closer and told him to turn him over because he was done on that side!As a book to read straight through, I give this book a \\"D\\".As a daily devotional, I give this book a \\"C\\"."},{"Title":"Our Roommate Is Missing (The Girls of Canby Hall #2)","review":"This book was so sad.

Burroughs teaches all about birds and their life. He paints, through stories, what Audubon did with a paintbrush. This is a must read. Not meant to be read all at once; but rather by the fire in winter, down by the pond in summer, sitting on a park bench as the birds sing around you, tucked into your backpack on a hike. Wake-Robin is the takealong guide for bird lovers who want to do more than just identify them by feather or call. This book (I have the old hardback) is one of my treasures. Kindle version is obviously easier to tuck into a pocket and take along."},{"Title":"Wake-robin,","review":"\\"According to biographers at the American Memory project at the Library of Congress, John Burroughs was the most important practitioner after Thoreau of that especially American literary genre, the nature essay. By the turn of the century he had become a virtual cultural institution in his own right: the Grand Old Man of Nature at a time when the American romance with the idea of nature, and the American conservation movement, had come fully into their own.\\" (Wikipedia)Wake Robin is the first of Burroughs' published essays. The title is taken from the common name of the white trillium, which blooms just as migratory birds (including robins) show up in the northern states in the Spring. Burroughs is an ardent reporter of the natural world, and of songbirds in particular. His writing, however, is not that of the well-informed naturalist. Wake Robin reads more like a diary of his wanderings and his casual observations in the woods. Burroughs' reputation as a co-founder of the conservation movement is likely due more to the timing of his publications than on their content. In the modern era we look for more than the musings of an unstudied amateur when we wish to become better informed about the natural world.Clearly adapted from entries in his personal diary, Burroughs' writing is frequently self-conscious, detracting from his message. He labors at his craft, but when it works, it is very good. Speaking of the wood or bush sparrow, he says, \\"It was a perfect piece of wood music, and was, of course, all the more noticeable for being projected upon such a broad unoccupied page of silence.\\" Burroughs wrote just after the Civil War and he frequently references and credits Henry Thoreau, who wrote just before the Civil War. It is difficult not to compare the writings and observations of the two. In fact, Burroughs' writing suffers in the comparison.The early conservation movement needed a few articulate reporters, and Burroughs was ahead of his time in writing of his woodland meanderings. No one will be drawn to Burroughs for his craft at writing, but we should credit him with his inspiration, and appreciate Wake Robin for what it is, \\"an invitation to the study of ornithology.\\""},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"In his most comprehensive (and not coincidentally, his final) masterpiece, Dostoyevsky addresses and discusses a number of the most fundamental and universal issues which face man. His multiple perspectives are embodied in seperate characters -- taken together, these characters form the whole of the Karamazov family, and these perspectives constitute the whole of Dostoyevsky's view.Each of the brothers represents a distinct school of thought or values -- the impulsive Dmitri portrays the instinctive and carnal desires of man; the nihilist, Ivan, displays the cold and unforgiving intellectual, governed by the rules of logic alone; the religious Alyosha, student to the Great Elder Zossima, depicts the humble and devout spiritualist. While the murder of their father, Fyodor Karamazov, is the catalyst to the real action of the book, it is certainly not the central focus -- a fact that might be surmised in light of the fact that the murder is not carried out until more than halfway through the text.Instead, the work is a discussion and analysis of man's values and beliefs, and an affirmation of Dostoyevsky's fundamental conviction: that the presence of the human spirit cannot be denied without disastrous results, and that despite the assertions of the nihilists, God is a necessary element in the world of man."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"&quot;I would die happy if I could finish this final novel, for I would have then expressed myself completely.&quot;This statement from Fyodor Dostoyevsky helps elucidate both the theme and purpose of the The Brothers Karamazov, one of the greatest masterpieces of world literature. Superficially, the novel deals with a patricide and how each of the book's characters contributed directly or indirectly to that murder.Yet, The Brothers Karamazov, at its heart, is so much more. Its underlying theme deals with the drive for self-redemption in the eyes of both God and man and the role suffering plays in facilitating that redemption.Fyodor Karamazov has fathered four sons, Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha, by two wives, and one, Smerdyakov, with a peasant woman known as stinking Lizaveta.Fyodor Karamazov, a vulgar and ill-tempered man represents, for Dostoyevsky, the Russian government of his times. Like the government, Fyodor shuns his children, preferring instead the materialistic, but joyless, life of wealth and possessions. His union with Lizaveta, who comes to represent all the peasants of Dostoyevsky's Russia, produces Smerdyakov, a bastard child who, in his own turn, will be raped and pillaged by the government and will go on to give birth, metaphorically, to bastard children of his own.Karamazov's eldest son, Dmitri, an impulsive sensualist, finds respect as an overbearing soldier but one whose inability to pay his debts eventually turns him into a poor and irrational man.Ivan, Fyodor's second son, is a cold intellectual who finds his fulfillment in his literary and creative abilities. He becomes famous through his writings, especially those concerning the Russian Church.The youngest son, Aloysha, finds temporary fulfillment in the cloistered, monastic life. Outwardly innocent and naive, Aloysha struggles with his desire for spiritual fulfillment in the monastery and the joys and excitement of the secular life.The character who provides the catalyst for change is that of Father Zosima, a character who seems to embody the strong spiritual sense that was Dostoyevsky, himself.Father Zosima, who has lived a pure and spiritually-nourishing life, has the gift to sense both a man's motivations and his needs. Zosima tells the brothers Karamazov that a sheltered, monastic life is not a prerequisite to the achievement of spiritual riches, a fact that seems to be proven true when Zosima's corpse rots after his death in direct contradiction to Russian belief at the times regarding spiritual purity.It is Father Zosima who, throughout the book, expounds Dostoyevsky's theory that it is suffering that will purify and cleanse our soul, thus bringing us peace. Each brother, in his own fashion, undergoes his own trial by fire, and, in the end, is better for it.One brother, tormented by a guilt he does not deserve, must live his life in unwanted exile, or not at all, though he possesses the heart and soul of a true Russian. Another suffers the torments of a complete nervous breakdown that leaves him grappling on the very edge of sanity. Only a third son seems to find the answer he is seeking and the novel's uplifting final scene epitomizes Dostoyevsky's eternal belief in the importance of Russia's children in her future, as children hold their hands high and shout, &quot;Three cheers for Karamazov,&quot; ending this essentially depressing masterpiece on a joyous note.An extraordinarily complex and rich novel, The Brothers Karamozov also deals with man's response to death. All of the characters, each in his own way, attempts to flee from death and only those who can finally accept the finality of death and the suffering of living find justification and fulfillment in life.Dostoyevsky uses many stylistic devices to expound upon his theme of redemption through suffering: imagery, irony and dreams are three of the most prominent, however, it is Dostoyevsky's wonderful ability to manipulate the third person subjective that serves to illuminate each character and bring him to life.The Brothers Karamazov is a book that delves deeply into the heart of man and the soul of Russia. Dostoyevsky, as any true artist, presented facets of himself in all of his characters who each manages to see the world in a different way and finds redemption through his own unique vision.Ironically, one of the brothers Karamazov is portrayed as a young man who begins to instill the seeds of change in Russia through its children, something Dostoyevsky, himself, thought was needed if Russia was ever to make the transition from a backward country to a global power. That it did, although the children Dostoyevsky envisioned as spiritual visionaries became instead, violent revolutionaries. They sought to free the peasants, not through enlightenment but through the establishment of a totalitarian state Peter the Great would have envied. Today, however, Russia tragically lies amidst the same poverty in which it was dwelling one hundred years earlier.Clearly, Dostoyevsky's path to enlightenment, illuminated brilliantly in The Brothers Karamazov, has not yet been fully assimilated by either the people of Russia or the people of the world in general.A sad and ironic twist to the vision of a master writer and a truly prophetic man."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"I recently read a book so amazing, so well-written, and so memorable that I simply must tell you about it. It's The Brothers Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. After reading another of Dostoyevsky's novels, Crime and Punishment, a while ago, and thoroughly loving it, I had to get this one, for I had heard it was his best work. And I can't disagree. To sum up the premise quickly, the novel takes place in Russia circa 1890, and tells the story of four brothers who become involved in the murder of their own father. That is the most basic summary of the plot I can give; but it doesn't even begin to give you an idea of the territory covered in this massive, sprawling novel. (Over 700 pages of great literature.) There are other things going on besides this murder, and eventually the novel is about so much more than this.This novel has possibly some of the best characterization I've ever seen for any book, period. This is not an exaggeration. First, the four brothers are each given their own distinct personality and background (even though they are brothers they come from different pasts) and become some of the most developed, recognizable, and memorable characters I've ever encountered. In addition, the father is one of the most pathetic, funny, and evil characters in literature. But even then, Dostoyevsky does not stop. There are probably ten or fifteen secondary characters that appear a lot, and even more third-tier figures that don't have much time in the book but are still memorable. This is because whenever a new character is introduced, the author devotes at least a couple of full, developed passages telling the reader about the person, and reveals even more through the many conversations and speeches people have. Remarkably, there are never any repetetive characters. Dostoyevsky manages to create a new, unique, living, breathing person out of every character.This is also one of the most thematically inclusive books I've ever read, one with such depth. Thanks to the incredible characters and well thought-out plot, the novel discusses a whole range of themes. Dostoyevsky must have been a philosopher or psychologist just as much as he was a writer. Through his characters he expounds on the idea that people have the uncanny ability to harbor opposite and contrasting values within themselves at the same time. Good and evil exist side by side in the hearts of men. Dostoyevsky also shows us that some people are never happy because they don't want to be, and that this fact makes them happy. As long as they are unhappy in their own way, they remain happy, even if they know it's not to their advantage.Dostoyevsky was so ahead of his time with this novel- his deep knowledge of humanity is so evident. Years before Freud, he develops the idea of punishment as a way to alleviate guilt and love as a way to cure shame, or as he puts it, &quot;self-laceration.&quot; He was probably one of the very first to fully implement into his characters the concept of the split personality. At one point, one of the characters has a conversation with his alter-ego, fully aware that he doesn't exist. It's so impressive, it really puts some modern stuff into perspective.Death, love, forgiveness, immortality, religion, God, the Devil, all of these things are more than briefly touched upon in the course of this narrative. At one point, a character remarks, &quot;I don't know whether God created Man or Man created God, but if the Devil exists, he was created in Man's image.&quot; In one chapter, Christ comes back to earth and is challenged and shunned by the religious community. The Devil himself even appears as a person to discuss philosophy and religion with one of the characters. When he's asked, &quot;How are you able to take on human form?&quot; the Devil replies, &quot;Nothing human is beyond me.&quot; Powerful, chilling moments like these fill the book.There are so many moments of pure, unfiltered humanity in this novel, it's as if the author's whole life is bleeding through in the pages. When he creates an evil character, we believe in him, and when he creates the opposite- a truly pure figure- we believe in him, as well. In fact, this book has one of the most believably good characters of all stories. Dostoyevsky plunges the depths of man's soul, and what he brings up is sometimes scary, sometimes beautiful. If there are any stories out there that can come close to showing us the meaning of life, The Brothers Karamazov is one of them."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Anyone interested in the central question facing mankind will find \`The Brothers Karamazov' an essential guide. That question--on man's capacity for responsibility and the proper role of the state and religion--is posed throughout the story in dialogue and events, and is framed neatly in a 20-page section where Ivan presents a poem titled \`The Grand Inquisitor' to his brother Alyosha. The chapter that bears that title (Book V, Chapter V) is a masterpiece in itself and should be studied for its narrative technique alone. But the ideas it presents are so immense, so mind-blowing and inspirational, that literary criticism is not sufficient.Indeed, \`The Brothers Karamazov' should not be classed merely as a novel--it is a book of philosophy, theology, psychology, and sociology as well that ranks with the greatest documents in those disciplines. There is a fictitious plot, of course, and the characters in the story are some of the most interesting in all of literature, so it is rightly praised as a novel. But the modern reader looking for a plot of twists and romantic intrigues is bound to disappointment. Dostoevsky does not stir up drama through the placement of unexpected developments or improbable character traits. Instead, he relies on the inherent needs and wants of all men to make vivid his story.The amount of dialogue may be shocking (tedious) to one accustomed to the modern show-don't-tell policy in storytelling. Today, novelists and screenwriters let a character's actions speak for them--it is quicker and provides a much more convincing impression. It also limits the kind of ideas that are posed in the story to simple, prosaic ones like \`she likes him' or \`he wants to defeat him.' By contrast, Dostoevsky allows the characters to speak for themselves, which creates a much longer and subtler exposition, but also frees the ideas to be vast and monumental.What is the fundamental nature of socialism? What are the uses of the church in finding purpose? In finding salvation? Why is there suffering? What is the meaning of death? Read the brothers' dialogues and contemplate.Dostoevsky's own philosophy is seen in the protagonist, Alyosha. This is so despite the fact that the author ably covers every perspective on every topic presented in the book, and one can hardly find a positive assertion throughout. If there is one, it rests in the overall effect of the words and actions, a concept Dostoevsky articulated in a personal correspondence--it is that \\"Man is a mystery; if you spend your entire life trying to puzzle it out, then do not say that you have wasted your time.\\"A word about the translations: The title of Book IV has been translated differently in every version I have seen (other chapter titles are also inconsistent, but Book IV is seemingly the most difficult to agree on). The original Russian is \`Nadryvy,' which literally translates to \`Ruptures,' though no translations I have seen use \`Ruptures.' The word is used throughout the book to convey the motif of \`pressures' or \`strained conditions about to break.' The various options I have seen for this title are \`Lacerations' (Garnett), \`Strains' (Pevear & Volkhonsky), \`Torment' (MacAndrew), \`Crises' (Avsey), and \`Crack-Ups' (McDuff). Given this is a central theme, the potential reader might look into which translation he prefers before buying. Apropos, the Princess Alexandra Kropotkin print version bears the Garnett translation, as does the Frederick Davidson audio recording."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"My three criteria for Great Book candidates are that they must be deep intellectually, stunning in character development, and beautifully written. This book is unequaled in all three ways. It states the argument against the existence of God based on evil, and the appeal of worldliness, as well as I've ever seen, then epitomizes those ideas in characters and plot, and then does pretty well developing counterarguments on all those levels. The Magic Mountain and Dr. Faustus by Thomas Mann, lots of Sartre and Camus, and actually quite a few other novels, personify but don't particularly argue ideas [very well, at least]; Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, on the other hand, is powerful and catchy and does argue, but her favored characters are mostly one-dimensional facets of her philosophy, which is so extreme that her envisioned opponents end up being straw men. The accuracy of her images of opposed views cannot be defended seriously.Dostoyevsky's characters are archetypes, but with multiple dimensions and realism, who engage in real conversation and resultant temptations to waver [though not as deeply as Bakhtin claims]. Dostoyevsky gives a rounded description before each main character appears, but then the character, in dialogue, bursts into a colorful reality.The writing is complex and yet gripping--reading it in high school was pretty hard, but then picking it up in college, I could not put it down, except to rest. It sometimes seems to wander but is constantly building, and its digressions turn out to be amazing constructions.I've come back to my Constance Garnett translation again and again. I've only read pieces of one or two others [and I cannot read Russian], but Garnett seems as skillful and consistent as any in expressing [seemingly] Dostoyevsky's views and vision of the Russian soul. That soul does contain, regrettably, anti-semitism, anti-catholicism, nationalism, and anti-modernism, and Dostoyevsky transmitted them all. But, except for the anti-modernism, which he argues forcefully, these views obnoxiously mar the book but aren't essential to its amazing argument or structure. Compared with the fine books on many 10 or 100 best lists, this one is a sun competing with floodlights."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"&quot;Love to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it! Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love. Love all men, love everything! Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears. Don't be ashamed of your ecstasy, prize it.&quot;Thus ended the paragraph that saved my life from Book VI of Constance Garnett's translation of The Brothers Karamazov. Read unintentionally in tandem with the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony it wreaked upon me a transvaluation of all values. This also happened to some of my students at Shimer College where I teach both the Constance Garnett and the Pevear/Volokhonsky translations. I urge my students who love the book to read BOTH translations. Constance Garnett's poetic grasp of Dostoyevsky's language (with occasionally antiquated twists of phrase) assumes the worldview of the nineteenth century, which is the century in which Dostoyevsky wrote. Her first translation appeared in about 1912.She lovingly captures the cadences of Father Zosima's voice. This wise elder's words are at the heart of this book. I have never understood why his chapter, &quot;The Russian Monk&quot; has not been excerpted and widely read as &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; which precedes it. Poverty, injustice, cruelty, and the suffering of innocents can only be transformed by love--and beauty. This book, a murder mystery interwoven with four love-triangles, exploring dysfunctional families, the nature of God, erotic lacerations, forgiveness, the devil, and the Russian soul can give you the equipment you need to cope with life's agonies, to go through suffering and into joy.Hurrah for Karamazov!"},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky believed that the Russian people were specially marked by God to endure great suffering in order to prepare them to show the truths of Christ's religion to humanity. He did not accept the notions of material progress and scientific rationalism that were coming out of the \\"Enlightened\\" West and felt that such ideas would lead only to spiritual bankruptness and immorality. Dostoevsky articulated these viewpoints and sought to project his vision of what the Russian national identity should be in his masterpiece, \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\".As Dostoevsky himself revealed in the story, the three legitimate sons of Fyodor Pavlovich each represented different aspects of the Russian identity:1. Dmitriy Fyodorovich was the uncontrollable and irrational brother who could commit acts of senseless violence and engage in extreme debauchery, but despite all of that, aspired to goodness and felt remorse at all of the bad things he had done.2. Ivan Fyodorovich was the educated brother who espoused the rationalism and cynicism of the West and who claimed to have renounced God. Despite that, he still had not lost his \\"Russian-ness\\" and he himself did not believe in what he preached and still had troubling doubts about the existence of God.3. Alexei Fyodorovich (Alyosha) was the devout brother who aspired to live in a monastery under the guidance of his spiritual father figure, Father Zossima. Alyosha represented all that was beautiful and holy about the Russian Orthodox faith.Each of these three brothers underwent a crisis in faith that was brought about by the death of their father, either directly or indirectly (as in the case of Alyosha). In each situation, each brother finally came to terms with the suffering that had been placed upon them and accepted responsibility for their actions, or indeed, for all men's actions.I thought Dostoevsky's description of this painful process of spiritual transformation brought on by suffering and anguish was mesmerizing, because I was able to relate to it in some small way. Indeed, considering the responses of many of the other customer reviewers here, I would say that my reaction was not unusual.I would suggest that reading \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" could actually lead you to reevaluate your life principles and manner of relating to people (at least it did for me). I wil not go so far to say that this book changed my life (as some reviewers here have claimed), but at least it made me think, and for that reason this book is wonderful. It's funny how such a transcendent book as this, which has something to say to everybody, was originally written as propaganda for Russian nationalism."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Mark Twain once said that a classic is a book that no oneever reads. Unfortunately, the Brothers Karamozov may be aclassic of those proportions. Many are intimidated by thebulk of an 800-1000 page book when they see the oversizedspine on the shelf and neglect to meet some of the mostinteresting characters to ever be captured on paper.The Brothers Karamozov is possibly one of the most over-analyzedRussian novels (with the possible exception of War and Peace)since it was written in the 19th century, and yet, at itsheart it has some of the most interesting plots and charactersin any language. Consider for a moment three brothers--one apious, bright divinity student, one an intellectual, brazencapitalist, and one a dirty illegimate half wit. Now throwin an ogre of a father, and you can imagine what the dinnerconversation might be like. Do yourself a favor and forgetthe symbolism, the types and anti-types, etc. and get to knowthese people. Also, forget that you were supposed tohave read this book in college and just pick it up foryourself. Dostoevsky's mastery of mood and setting makeits popularity among scholars understandable. Yet its serializedplot-line and suspense-filled action will more than satisfyany Stephen King reader or soap opera fanatic."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"There's really no point in arguing that this anything but a really great novel. It is an epic work, with an almost epic length as well; an the exploration of the relations between three (actually four, if the illegitimate house-servant is included) brothers, the sons of a selfish, greedy, conniving, morally and physically repugnant father. In many ways, \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" can probably be viewed as a reflection of Russian intellectual/spiritual culture in the 19th century, and perhaps even beyond. Like his other works, this book also contains Dostoevsky's literary musings on the state of Russian society as he saw it. Even so, this is also weighty book: in a fashion similar to Tolstoy, Dostoevsky was quite obsessed with the concept of personal redemption, the moral catharsis (or \`moral bath' as Tolstoy called it in \\"War &amp; Peace\\"), atonement for sins, etc. and this, together with his religious mysticism (and the accompanying good vs. evil symbolism), can become quite tiresome at times. Dostoevsky was a very conservative Christian tormented by his own vices and a virulent opponent of Western European Enlightenment ideals (he viewed them as a threat to Russian culture and the Russian soul), and this is often reflected in \\"Brothers Karamazov.\\" Personally, I think the best parts of the book are when Dostoevsky explores the mindsets of his various characters, creating a very psychologically tense atmosphere. Also, his portrayals of the interactions and conflicts between his various characters is superb. In this sense, it is similar to \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" which is a better book - simply because it tends to focus more on one major theme. Thus, after reading \\"Crime and Punishment\\" one can easily be left with the impression that the \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" is a slight case of overkill in some aspects. However, on its own it is nonetheless a great book and definitely worth reading - although due consideration should be given to its historical context, meaning the place and time in which it was written (tsarist Russia in the 19th century)."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"This is a long and difficult book, but very interesting. It is an excellent book, but still not my favorite of Dostoyevsky's. This reads like a murder mystery, and there are also lots of philosophical and religious undertones. I would say that this is a good translation and the book includes some helpful tips to get through the story.

That is...You must excuse me, I am just repeating what I heard, it's only a legend...He was sentenced to walk a quadrillion miles in the dark. And when he has finished that quadrillion, the gates of heaven will be opened to him and he'll be forgiven...\\"I was astonished by the impact left upon me by the depth of the characters that Dostoevsky created in this novel. There are so many conflicting elements from all the characters, so much suffering in the face of adversity, and yet faith is not entirely lost. There is a huge struggle between appraisal of God and rejection of Him within the characters of this book, each representing different aspects of this struggle. Dmitri, the passionate and instinctive drunkard, who represents the banal animal nature within us all, becomes a changed man due to his staring adversity in the face. Ivan, the cold and God-rejecting intellectual, struggles internally with his values of morality and mysticism. Smerdyakov, the cunning and cruel epileptic, maintains a mask of pathetic cowardice to those above him, whose neurotic behavior eventually leads him to inner conviction. Alyosha, the good-natured monastic student, faces the trials surrounding the deaths of his loved ones.The suffering of the characters in this book leads to so many ups and downs, bliss and insanity, that it's truly a rollercoaster. An innocent man finds the true spirit of God in the face of being found guilty for murder, a confused man finds the Devil incarnated in all the worst aspects of himself in the face of secretly hoping to find God but never quite attaining it, and who could forget Fyodor Karamazov, the most loathsome character in the entire story (aside from perhaps Smerdyakov)? He lavishes himself with riches and neglects his children who are most in his image.All these characters' personalities and struggles embody the essence of what it means to be human--the duality, as the prosecutor at the trial explained it, of being both honorable and base. There is a never ending conflict between the Karamazov within us all."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Just finished this classic novel- it was well worth the time.

What I found, though, is a well-crafted novel about a highly dysfunctional family and their interactions with each other and the rest of the world. Its an interesting insight into how people can get so messed up, and also how even the worst people have impulses of goodness, kindness and generosity. It is also interesting to see how there can be so many different personality types in one family and how that dynamic creates a strange sort of balance in family life. I also really enjoyed seeing something of the legal process of Russia in that time period.

It needs to be unraveled, and if you spend your whole life unraveling it, don't say that you've wasted time. I am studying that mystery because I want to be a human being.\\" In Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov he unravels the very nature man: his passion, his intellect, and his soul. In his novel, Dostoevsky explores man's most primitive questions: Does God exist? What is hell? Why do we suffer? No other novel is as deeply intertwined with human existence as The Brothers Karamazov. Modern civilization has been crafted by philosophy, psychology, literature, and religion. The Brothers Karamazov can be considered a masterpiece in each.With characters ranging from sensual Dmitri, idealistic Alyosha, and intellectual Ivan, Dostoevsky reveals to the reader the very essence of man. In each brother, a dimensional extremity of man is illustrated. As the novel unravels, the reader becomes engulfed in the psychological struggle between the extremities. Will Ivan's love of life help deviate him from his dependence on his Euclidean mind? Does Dmitri's desire for his father's murder signal guilt, or is it outweighed by his moral innocence?Grand themes are presented throughout the novel ranging from religious hypocrisy to servanthood. Ivan Karamazov's character is fully illustrated in \\"The Grand Inquisitor,\\" the renowned chapter of the novel, often circulated as an independent essay. Because Ivan can't accept the existence of God if suffering exists in the world, the Grand Inquisitor is born. On the other extreme, Alyosha, and his mentor Father Zossima, seem to represent rival philosophies. Unlike Ivan and his Grand Inquisitor, Father Zossima and Alyosha believe that the world is essentially good. They believe that suffering is only the result of man's failure to love. \\"What is hell?\\" Father Zossima asks, \\"I maintain that it is the ability of being unable to love.\\"With the murder of their father, each brother is confronted by his own internal struggle. Alyosha's ideals force him to accept part of the blame for his father's death. Ivan's struggles with existence drive him to insanity, and Dmitri's guilty verdict reaffirms his faith. Ivan had once said, \\"Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself, I shall see it and say that they've met, but still I won't accept it.\\" Now Dmitri exclaims, \\"I see the sun, and if I don't see the sun, I know it's there. And there's a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there.\\"In sum, to call Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov anything but a work of genius would be an injustice. The Brothers Karamazov seems to explore every corner of human existence. However, Dostoevsky's quest for truth does not end with this novel, but begins. The book, which was originally meant to be the first of a trilogy, seems to call the reader to response. Dostoevsky's quest for truth becomes our own. Dostoevsky now calls us to unravel the mystery of man for ourselves.An additional note--the Barnes & Noble edition offers very insightful information as well as great footnotes and references. Constance Garnett is my preferred translator for Dostoevsky."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"When I started reading the Brothers Karamazov, I thought I was prepared.

When you read Koyla's final exclamation, \\"Horrah for Karamazov!\\" it suddenly all comes together in the most beautiful and emotional climax one can imagine. The Karamazov's represent mankind in its various aspects (its indulgence, its skepticism, and in Alyosha, the tiny spark of faith and love that can be found at its heart). \\"Horrah for Karamazov!\\" means \\"Horrah for mankind!\\" Through that small spark of love and hope from the humble Alyoshas of the world, all that's shallow and evil in our nature can be redeemed for and forgotten; mankind can be something to rejoice over. Horrah for Karamazov!"},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"If Charles Dickens's novels are a romanticization of Victorian England, then Dostoevsky's must be a realization of 19th Century Russia. &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; not only sheds light on Czarist Russian life, society, and religion, but also succeeds in completely captivating the reader with its vivid characterization and dynamic plotting. Like Dostoevsky's other novels, it is a study in man's motivations for good and evil, his potential for corruption, and his glory in salvation. Each character, scene, and event in the novel seems to relay a principle that religion provides the structure for society, for better or worse.The novel chronicles the fragmented Karamazov family, who live in a small Russian town. The father, Fyodor, is a hedonistic, boorish landowner, twice a widower, who has his eye on a young lady named Grushenka. He has four sons: The oldest is Dmitri, an ex-military officer, a passionate, desperate, violent young man who is like his father in many ways; for one thing, he also is madly in love with Grushenka. There is Dmitri's half-brother Ivan, intellectual and studious, but morbid and cynical, and whose motto is &quot;everything is lawful.&quot; There is Ivan's gentle, magnanimous brother Alyosha who is an initiate monk and whom Ivan likes to provoke with his iconoclastic discourse. Finally, there is the illegitimate Smerdyakov, a morose and cruel young man who works as Fyodor's cook. None of the brothers has a particularly loving relationship with their father or with each other.Each brother has a personal devil and an angel. Dmitri's devil is Grushenka; his angel is a young lady named Katerina to whom he is engaged, both connubially and financially. Alyosha's devil is a divinity student named Rakitin, who exploits the misfortunes of the Karamazovs; his angel is his mentor, Father Zossima, who represents religious solace. Ivan's angel is his brother Alyosha; his devil is his own conscience, with whom he converses in one unforgettable chapter. Smerdyakov's devil and angel are the same person: his father, the only person who has ever entrusted him. It is interesting to observe how each brother's devil and angel influence his actions and thoughts and provide conflict throughout the novel.One night, Fyodor is murdered, and Dmitri, who has the most urgent motive, is accused of the crime. This could be considered the central event of the novel, but it is not the event on which the novel's profundity rests. What is profound is the series of psychological mind games that the brothers play with each other both before and after the murder; they could be any trashy family on a modern TV talk show, but they have Shakespearean complexity and depth in the way they express their anguish and weave their webs of deceit.The novel ends with a seemingly positive notion about death and the joy in the remnants of life; in the very last scene, the stirring speech that Alyosha delivers after a young friend's funeral could have been Dostoevsky's own requiem. This is a staunchly uncompromising novel, refusing to provide any easy answers and forcing the reader to look inside his own heart for the source of good and evil."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"For all the people who thought this book was too long, I would like to draw your attention to the Product Info section that Amazon so nicely provides. Yes it is a long book, but you knew that going in now didn't you. I also understand that the book is slow at parts but I have found that most Russian novels are. You guys are the kind of people who go see a black and white film and say the movie sucks because there is no color.Those who are willing to read the 700+ pages are in for a real treat. This is far and away the best book I have ever read. The characters are incredible and the conflict between faith and skepticism is gripping through out the entire book. The rest of you can maybe read some short stories and work on reading without mouthing the words.As far as the translation goes, I really can't comment.

As always Dostoyevsky is an absolutely brilliant master. The breadth and depth are at times stupefying and you wonder how it can all tie together. This is just where he shines, however, in that this is more than a novel it's an exposition on the human condition. Many times the narrator insouciantly goes into a storm of pontification and, while it's a conversation the characters are having, it really doesn't move the plot along-- instead these ruminations delve into the psyche and ask pondering questions that at times supersede the main plot and sublimate it into a secondary glory. Much more can't be said without giving away the ending so I will leave it to future readers' enjoyment."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"This is a good book.

Constance Garnett's translation is Victorian. Garnett may well have thought that she was improving on Dostoevsky's cluttered and lumbering prose, but she did not. Garnett was the first person to translate many of the classic Russian novels (by Dostoevsky and Tolstoy) into English, and it is rare that the early translations of classic works are good. When buying a translation, if there is an option, you are overwhelmingly better off buying the most recent possible. Luckily, Dostoevksy does not now lack for translators, and the Brothers K is *at least* five stars when better translated. Nabokov &amp; others have derided Dostoevksy for his deep and tormented characters and soul-bareing conversations. However, it is pointless to criticize Dostoevsky for not having shared in the form-enfatuation of the 20th century and not having joined the race of style that started three decades after his death. Dostoevsky most concerned himself with his characters. And for him, real evaluation occurs in extreme conditions and conflicting values. He helps himself to these circumstances with none of the frugality of many modern novelists. Although many judge The Brothers as Dostoevsky's greatest novel, it is not the most Dostoevskian of his great novels. That would be The Devils, where the strange workings of his characters and the originality of his social insight are most clearly and uncomfortably evident."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Dostoyevksy has the ability to wrap plot around philosphy as few authors can.

A good story, but possibly not the particular version you would want to buy."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"As a Christian, I consider this book essential reading for all Christians. Dostoevsky argues, sometimes covertly, for the essential tie between morality (conscience) and God. The famous quote, &quot;If God does not exist, everything is permitted,&quot; assumes that without an objective moral God, everything is objectively amoral (even if subjective morals exist). To me, the novel shows how some (not necessarily all) professing atheists try to philosophically justify their actions that would otherwise be considered immoral. The way they justify their immorality is to subjectivize (relativize) all morality thereby making everything, including murder, inherently amoral. The problem with this approach is that the protest against evil becomes subjective and objectively collapses. Absolute good (God) defines absolute evil. Without God, absolute evil can't exist and Ivan's examples of human cruelty lose their force by becoming objectively excusable types of behavior. Dostoevsky also brilliantly shows the bankruptcy of human courts of justice. We the readers know that Dmitri is innocent of the death of his father, but the evidence makes him look guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt... If there is no just God and life after death (immortality), then we're stuck with human injustice masquerading as justice and no hope of the wrongs in this life being righted in the next. Aside from these Christian topics, the brilliance of Dostoevsky's work is that many atheists such as Camus, Sartre, Nietzsche and Freud have found this work a masterpiece. Dostoevsky showed that saints can look like sinners and sinners can look like saints and we are left wondering who is actually innocent or guilty of what.

To me the characters were not described very well and the dialogue seemed forced, at times incoherent(why is everyone having convulsions?)It seems Dostoyevsky did not have any strength left to make the dialogue interesting. People would lapse into fits for no reason and hallucinate constantly, it made you just want to get to the more philosophical sections. The personal interactions were mainly confusing and frustrating, many times I wanted to throw the book in the garbage. 75% of this book consisted of the characters going back and forth to each others houses talking about god knows what(you lose interest and lose track of who's who eventually and they all sound the same). This book was a definite chore-read, I did not suspect this having read \\"crime and punishment\\" beforehand, a book I was very impressed with. The only part I did enjoy were Dostoyevsky's questions about morality, which are always satisfying and informative.

It contains some very memorable scenes described in excellent detail by Mr. Dos. Also, despite its long size, it is a rather easy read, because the language is quite straight forward, the philosophy is rather simple, and the plot progresses at a casual rate.

Not so much because Dostoyevsky was not a craftsman. His narrator is everywhere, including places he couldn't possibly be: people's minds, scenes, etc.) I accepted that the book was written before the revolution of literary technique, but I couldn't accept that the book is way too long. Many incidents don't seem necessary; and characters make speech after very tiring speech.Even more disappointing was that I couldn't relate to the characters. They just didn't seem real; and the main character, Alyosha, is too much of a goody-two-shoes to be interesting. In addition, he never initiates any action.

Who killed Dad and why? Read, find out,and ponder the implications."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"While treating the whole gamut of our human existence in the first half of his novel, Dostoevsky seems to put that very existence--our human nature--on trial in the second half of his volume. The three legitimate brothers of Fyodor Dostoevsky--Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha--and the illegitimate brother, Smerdyakov, together serve as a microcosm for our human existence. Their personalities, disorders, personal demons, frailties and kindnesses remind us of our own--and together they form the full spectrum of possibility for us.Dmitri cries out, after having been arrested for parricide, cries out to Alyosha, \\"A New man has risen up in me...I exist!...And there is a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there,\\" (540-541). Wow. This comment by a man who has been involved in bullying, lust, fear and jealousy is now able to realize the best part of himself. And this is perhaps one of Dostoevsky's many great accomplishments with the novel. That Dmitri cannot become just a villain, easy to hate and disgusting to all, reveals also who we are. In many ways, we conduct ourselves in frail fashion--committing acts in the immediate present for which we mourn in the not-too-distant future. And yet, how many of us get to this point--where we can authentically claim that we are new, and that we are satisfied to know that our life is real, that we can see and feel the sun?On the other hand, we have Alyosha, whose battle lies mainly within. Unlike Dmitri and his father, Fyodor, Alyosha has not led a life of debauchery, sleeping with many women, drinking himself to the hilt. Instead, his has been one of action. Alyosha's great temptation is to learn to speak with his own voice, to rise to the moment that calls out to him. He is both uniquely spiritual and uniquely human. We might say of Alyosha that no other character in our literature (and here I mean all literature, not regionalized) has ever reached so close a rendering to Jesus as Alyosha. And Dostoevsky's driving force becomes clear with Alyosha's final speech to the young boys gather around him after Ilusha's tragic and fateful death. He says with power to his young students, \\"Some good, sacred memory preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education\\" (700). When we can recall ourselves at our best--enraptured by kindness, full to the brim with a gratitude evidenced by joy--we then lend ourselves power to act in the present. Everywhere in this novel we see depictions of men who struggle and fail, falling prey to their own secret or open desires towards the unhealthy and the cruel. However, redemption lies most powerfully in this final moment that Alyosha spends with the very boys who once tormented poor Ilusha. He says that he loves them, will always remember them, and he exhorts them to remember who they are--in their deepest cores, in their heart of hearts. The boys listen and weep with his spoken words, and the reader immediately senses that this is it: this is the moment of triumph when all that has passed comes to what it may yield in the future. Russia, it seems Dostoevsky is saying, will thrive and move and lives as long as each singular human can remember himself or herself at her best--a moment of kindness, a moment of unbridled love, connection, belief. Alyosha powerfully reveals this possibility in himself, and then passes it along to the young boys who have gathered around him physically and spiritually.The fate of Ivan and Smeryakov is tragic. Both men succumb to the personal demons that haunt them--and both struggle intensely with the fate of their own brains. Ivan is a thinker, and his mind unravels itself with what is and is not possible. Dostoevsky seems to claim that life cannot be lived this way: there must come a point when we choose not to think but to act, and that act must be one of loving our neighbor. Ivan does perform this final act on behalf of his brother Dmitri, but it may be too late for himself, as his brain has already run the gamut of controlling and dominating his life. Smeryakov's fate is similar, though his own personal demons have pushed him to suicide. Neither character has been able to find a peacefulness, because both have attempted to come upon it violently, combating life with their intellect and finding it to be a riddle they cannot discover. Dostoevsky claims with The Brothers Karamazov that life can only be accessed authentically when we listen to our own souls, act accordingly, and love our neighbors. This is not religion, but rather the very definition of love, and the author's prescription for what might have, and still might, save Russia. And all of us, too."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Other reviews comment on the strength of this book, comparing it to religious texts in its power.

Nearly every page is a marvel, and -whereas in many other novels the climax holds the one packet of wisdom-, through-out this book there are passages that, even in translation, can do little else but boggle the reader, so powerful are the words and the impressions that they form."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"This is a review for the kindle edition specifically and not a reflection on this wonderful novel.

I realise it all sounds so pompous and even flagrant and i'm startled and horrified by the way this criticism started - but this once sworn atheist who is writing the criticism now believes in god after reading it. I am not Objective. The mere existence of so elated an idea as dostoevsky presents us to, is a diety - for it gives way and meaning to all human existence. Dostoevsky's characters are mesmerising - the fight between the titans of existence is in full motion thorugh out the story. I have read the dostoevsky has intended to write a trilogy of Karamazov and that this was the first part - i feel that if he would have continued he would have completely divulged the meaning of human existence in this world.

The author came up with so many great ideas and characters that are so real to life even in their complex emotions and rationales that we relate to the characters as if we are in their heads. In the end, not only do we have a great story, we are also left with a beautifully written work of political, psychological, sociological, ethical and psychological thought that is very true not only to Russia, but to other lands and peoples as well.The greatest soul writer of all times and great contributor to human psychology successfully created a beautiful and amazing dynamism between the Karamazov brothers that has been the core of many stories after involving siblings. There is the unreliable father, the old Fyodor Karamazov whose life dominates his sons and whose death casts a huge shadow on their future.Sensual Alyosha who is the youngest of the Karamazov brothers is the main character of the story, and he is noted for his strong faith in god and humanity, deep kindness and sense of sacrifice.Ivan the atheist has a sharp mind and is the critical analyzer who seeks for meaning in everything. He is skeptical and dwells more on rationale in his dealing with people and issues. In the end, his intellectual mind misleads him and opens the doors to the nightmares in his life.Dmitry is the sensitive brother who has a strong consideration for anything living, Smerdyakov their half-brother, is the cunning illegitimate son of old Fyodor Karamazov and works as Fyodor's servant.The characters of the brothers and the events of their lives made for the complex and fascinating story of exceptional proportions, where faith, meekness, atheism, indifference and slavery to negative instincts and impulses are often in conflict. Faith and atheism or disbelief in God is taken to epic proportions in Ivan's encounter with the devil.Dostoevsky stated that, \\"when there is no God, all is permitted.\\". That assertion is reinforced in books like The Union Moujik, The Idiot, Crime and Punishment. The absence of God or lack of faith in man makes it possible for man to thrive in his worst animal instincts. Even when man starts with good intentions, the absence of faith usually derails him to the point where the good intentions are overshadowed by the negative effects of his actions. My conclusion is that this is a rare masterpiece."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"The Brothers Karamozov ReviewThe crime: someone murdered Fyodor Karamozov, the wanton, irritable, and sadistic patriarch.The punishments: Smerdyakov, the illegitimate son, committed suicide after killing his father. Dmitri, the eldest son, passionate and immoderate like his father, whom the court found guilty of the murder, was condemned to Siberia. Ivan, the second son, who was \\"enlightened\\" and rational, struggled with the guilt of convincing his half-brother Smerdyakov that since God didn't exist, everything, including patricide, was permitted.But as the dying monk Zosima had revealed and Dmitri soon realized, everyone was complicit in and thus implicated for the crime, since, for Dostoevsky, the web of sin entangled young and old to the extend that even children suffered from their peers' sadism.Through his dream of the hungry and suffering children, Dmitri realized his guilt in the desire, that mustard seed in his mind, to kill his father and therefore willingly took upon the punishment for the crime he didn't commit. In doing so, he assumed a Christ-figure, accepting punishment for another's crime.The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor revealed Ivan's enlightened rationalism for a humanistic dystopia, the socialist utopia that Dostoevsky condemned. Only when, in a hallucination, the \\"devil\\"--Ivan's dark side-- revealed the parable of the learned atheist and thus rationalism's arid futility did Ivan realized his guilt in rationalizing patricide and prodding Smerdyakov to commit it.And Smerdyakov, who mirrored Ivan's unconsciousness and who carried the latter's reasoning to the logical conclusion, like Judas, would not have the chance to repent or atone for his crime. In the end, Dmitri assumed his punishment.Through the tormented consciousness of Dmitri, Ivan, Smerdyakov and other characters, Dostoevsky grabbled with morality in an enlightened but Godless world, a world that he could not accept."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Top ten among must read. A classic that by itself represents Russian literature. Very few authors can go as deep into the psyche of characters and make the reader feel as if one is there in front of them. Lengthy as it needs to be."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"If you can get through the first half of this book, you're in luck. Despite its over-dramatic, Victorian prose style (I'm talking Constance Garnett translation here), The Brothers Karamazov is a strongly plotted family/court drama with characters who seem real, maybe not by their conflated speeches (Constance Garnett translation again) but certainly in their actions. Never before have I been so enraptured in listening to overly wordy conversations (again, Constance Garnett. I mean this as praise) about a murder and its trial that, quite frankly, I know the end result of. Still, the plot moves forward naturally, as if knowledge of its ending has no impact on its power (which it doesn't).But then, the first half. almost four hundred pages (not exactly half, ok) of characters telling you their exact opinions on Christian religion without sparing any detail. The worst example of this is probably the Grand Inquisitor chapter, in which Ivan tells of a poem he wrote but didn't exactly write but would like to, then describes its meaning.That said, if you like the first book, you'll like the whole thing. Just stick through it. It's totally worth it."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"I am pretty sure that The Brothers Karamazov is my favorite work of fiction. There are parts in this book that are challenging and deep, and there are other parts that are light and funny. The theological challenges presented in the book are much more real than what you will usually read from a Christian author. Dostoevsky spent most of his life as an atheist, and the atheist's arguments in this book are not the brainless facades that we normally read in Christian literature. I don't know how else to say it... you should read this book!"},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Somewhere around page 200 of reading through this book I began to grow excited about getting to come to Amazon and write a review for it. I couldn't wait to come and praise it, to tell how wonderful it is, how believable the characters are, how enjoyable it is to watch them go through their lives...But now I'm nervous. I've finished the book and for as much as I loved it at page 200, I've loved it that much more by the time I reached page 729. Hurray for the Karamazov's indeed!First, let me tell you briefly what it is about: there are four brothers, each of which can be summed up in two words, though their personalities all cross each others lines, conjoined by their fathers blood; Alyosha is pious and kind, Ivan is intelligent and reserved, Dmitri is passionate and prideful, and Smerdyakov is resentful and sly...these four get caught up the plot to execute their father, Fyodor Karamazov, though not in concert with one another. Each of them strains against the others, trying to exert his own personality on the situation and to \`save' himself, though each has a different idea of what this means. To Dmitri, for example, it means simply to not be a thief (though to be a scoundrel is okay). To Alyosha it means to serve others as best is possible, though this is more of a mandate handed to him than something pricked out by his own conscious.And it is this word that leads me to not be able to praise this book enough: conscious. Each character has one, though they come off in different ways, manifested as different behaviors. As I said, Dmitri is okay with being a scoundrel, just not a thief- his conscious forbids it expressly. Manifestations such as this and the play between the various personalities give the novel it's taut structure; there is no page that is a waste to read, no side-track that is to be skipped over (especially \`The Grand Inquisitor' chapter, which is a 30 page anecdote that will leave you breathless, wondering how the essence of kind-hearted Christianity could be summed up so magnificently- and this comes from an atheist!). As a whole this gives the novel itself a conscious all it's own- it stops being something that is read and begins to take a life that demands that the reader use his own consciousness to decide where he/she stands on the issues raised (salvation, duty, honor...).Let me step back from that for a minute and explain it better: there is a series put out by Britannica called \`the Great Books' and in this series Dostoevsky has a volume. When I first heard of these books I could not help but to wonder who Dostoevsky was and why he was included. I read some of his other books and found that they were not only entertaining but were literary tour-de-forces; Dostoevsky is not to be taken lightly and cannot be praised enough for his contributions to world literature.Now, after reading this book, I wonder why he did not command more volumes than just the one (though that one is this novel). This book was, by far, the best novel I have ever had the pleasure to read in my entire life. It is a complete piece of art from the first page to the last, constructed from (stealing from the afterward, as it quoted the Russian literary critic Nikolay Mikhailovsky) \`a sick, cruel talent' that has an unflinching, unapologetic ability to look deep into mankind's soul and find something that few other novelists/artists can: the truth.Perhaps it took Dostoevsky all this life to find that. Perhaps he had to send a few Raskolnikovs to prison and put a few Mishkins beside their Nastasyas before he could finally hit upon this final truth- the summation of this book, as is given to us in the last two pages by one of the only good-hearted, believable characters in literature: Alyosha Karamazov (and I'll not ruin what that truth is to you). If that is so, then he is to be praised for always seeking after it, for taking his entire life to find it (this was his last novel)...and you, the potential reader of this book, should take time to pause and learn what this man can teach you. It is a long trip...but it is a worthwhile one.Bottom line: There are some books that everyone should be made to read for the distillation of society and truths that the writer has managed to convey to the world; this is one of those books. It is a novel about Russia, by a Russian who loved his country dearly, but that is pertinent to us all.PS- If you want to get the full impact of this novel, you may want to start with Dostoevsky's \`Notes from the Underground'. That novella expounds the philosophy behind this novel, that salvation can be achieved through suffering, doing so a bit more clearly. That introduction should help to ease you into this book.-LP"},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"The Brothers Karamazov is said to be the greatest and last novel written by Fyodor Dostoevsky. In reading the novel, one discovers why so. The novel is set in nineteenth century Russia, and deals with the story of three brothers, Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha, and the events surrounding the murder of their father Fyodor Kamarazov. The father is a drunkard baffoon, who spares no thoughts or money to his sons, and leads a life of sexual exploits, orgies and drunken revelry. Dmitri, born to Fyodor's first wife, returns to his hometown to seek money from his father, but gets enchanted by Grushenka, who his father lusts for and threatens to win over by the poer of his money. The sensual Dmitri, a former captain of the army, was earlier bethrothed to beautiful Katrina, who he wishes to leave in wake of his intense passion for Grushenka. The brother Ivan, an intellectual stars in the three most famous chapters of the book: Rebellion, the Grand Inquisitor and the Devil; where Dostovesky presents arguments against existence of God and discusses the genesis and futility of evil; the three chapters that on their own could have made the name of the Dostovesky as famous as it is. Ivan formulates arguments that both amaze and befuddle the reader and the reader finds himself tormented by the existential, ethical and theological questions that surface everywhere in the novel. Ivan falls for Katrina.Dostovesky calls Alyosha the hero of the novel. Alyosha is an idealist, a believer, a charming young fellow who would was all set on becoming a monk, till his mentor and guide Father Zossima asked him to return to the worldly life. The landscape is full of a range of other characters: Grigory and his wife Marya, devoted servants of Fyodor, who bring up an illegitimate, epileptic son of Fyodor, called Smerdyakov; the wealthy townswoman Madame Hohlakov, whose near cripple daughter Lise is engaged to Alyosha for some period of time; Rakitin, a character who full of big talk and shallow personality and two kids Koyla and Illusha.The novel centers around the events leading to and after the murder of Fyodor, whereby Dostovesky creates a highly engaging and yet pretty verbose analysis of the crime, parricide, providing his deep psychological analysis of characters and endless references from Christian texts. The last few chapters where he weaves courtroom drama provides the right climax to this highly challenging piece of work.The brilliance of Dostovesky is in making his reader undergo the same fever, same fervour that a criminal is faced with. The depth of portrayal is such that one is continuously full of the characters and the questions that surround their existence: for these questions are eternal questions that confound the reader. While the story is a gripping tale of murder and courtroom drama, the meat of the novel in the three chapters mentioned, in the discussions about what is right and wrong, in the presentation of various facades of human nature and human passion, in arguments for and against parricide, in the dealing of Alyosha with Illusha and Koyla. The last chapter, where Illusha loses his life, culminates a series of heartwrenching events, and this particular chapter is perhaps one of the best pieces arousing pathos in literature. The reader is just washed by the torrent of sorrow, and in a certain sense, Dostovesky succeeds in leading the reader through a sort of catharisis, ending in certain tears and an understanding that Christ-like love and purity of soul symbolized by Illusha and Alyosha is bound to prevail, to save our soul and society.The novel is also an excellent read in terms of insights it offers into the ethical, social and philosophical ideas present in Russia towards the end of nineteenth century. In that respect, it presents a case study of the undercurrents in the Russian society, the seeds and spread of socialism and well as the nature and depth of belief in church, miracles and God. The novel is also a part-time love story, where the flaring passions are so intense as to drive characters to the brink of madness, to the edge of chaos, to extremes of happiness and sorrow.Reading Dostovesky is like undergoing catharisis, tortuous and painful, and precisely so he is a must read for everyone who ventures into deeper questions surrounding the humanity."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"It's somehwat misleading to refer to the &quot;Brothers K.&quot; as a novel. In fact, Dostoevsky's magnum opus is by turns a metaphysical revelation, a terse and deeply emotional thriller and, perhaps most of all, a treatise on God and religion. The symbolism, right down to the very number of brothers (3...the most important number in the bible), is pervasive in the work, almost leaving the reader to feel quite often in the dark. Words like powerful, sensual, illuminating casually leap to mind when considering &quot;Brothers K.&quot; on a whole.My skills as a reviewer are sorely lacking so I could never do even the remotest justice to such a book. Still, after reading &quot;Brothers K.&quot; I feel compelled to give voice to the powerful admiration I developed for the work. Such feelings are likely to well up in anyone who gives the book a careful and thoughtful read.Unequivocally, the Constance Garnett translation found in Matlaw's Norton Critical Edition is par exellence.The only disappointment one may encounter in their experience with the &quot;Brothers K.&quot; is when they learn that this was Dostoevsky's last work. Read only good books, such as this one!"},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"I think Dostoyevsky was and will be the best author the world can ever see... and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, his last novel, is one of his master pieces. In fact, if you asked me, I would name all of his novels a master piece! Whatever, &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; is there for you to discover the secrets of life itself. Whether you believe in God or not, whether you are Christian or Moslem or Jewish, there are so many things you can find about you and the realities of life! The story basically answers all of the questions in your mind you have asked yourself but were somewhat suspicious to find any answer... but this book tells you all the answers - and with more than only one point of view! Religion, love, friendship, murder, hatret... whatever you are looking forward to finding out in a story - the life itself, in short - is included in this great novel. It for sure is no time spent for nonsense. Moreover, it teaches you a great deal about finding the real &quot;you in yourself&quot;. An excellent book! I doubt any other author will ever be able to reach the powerful writing of Dostoyevsky. Read it, and see how right i am!"},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Dostoevsky delves into his characters like few writers have the gift of doing. One grows very fond of sweet, compassionate Alyosha, crazed, heartbroken Dmitri, and cynical, intellectual Ivan, despite all of their flaws. This book is not exciting or engaging in the modern sense. No car chases or gun fights, but it is a very revealing novel that will leave you feeling inspired, broken, and everything in between. I wish I could adequitely find the words to describe how important this work is, although it does start rather slowly. By the way, I'm not a 40 year old uptight russian scholar. I'm a twenty year old punk rocker in a small town. Dostoevsky is just that good."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"I have read the Constance Garnett translation of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" three times since I was a sophomore in high school, and it is still far superior to the latest translation that I read recently. I know Constance Garnett has had her detractors (i.e. Vladimir Nabokov & Joseph Brodsky), but the passion and poetry of language seems much more unaffected in Ms. Garnett's translation.Enough though about translations, when I read \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" as a 15 year old, it changed my life. I could hardly hold onto the book with the adrenaline coursing through to nearly bursting my finger tips upon consuming pages of epiphany after epiphany.Perhaps generations since are raised assuming their right to the freedom of questioning and pursuing an independent investigation of truth, but in the late '60s this was not necessarily understood by a good dogmatically religious boy in Chicago. I was so fortunate that this right was inured in me through my steadfast scrutiny of the 800 pages of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\". And still to this day, some 40 years later, I feel it is the greatest novel ever written. Through the years it is the closest that I have ever had of the meaning of life and grace confided to me."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"The Brothers Karamazov is a magnificent piece of literature. Anyone the least bit familiar with Fyodor Dostoevsky will easily spot his hand at work here, which means some familiar ground for readers of other works by the author. This is not at all negative, however; this volume overflows with illuminating, thought-provoking Dostoevsky ideas.The Constance Garnett translation is somewhat awkward; I find Garnett overly monotonous and convoluted. Though Dostoevsky is no quick nor casual read, his text was certainly confused in some of Garnett's meandering passages. I feel other translators do a more concise and entertaining job, while keeping the same ideas intact, though I've only briefly read other translations.To give evidence to my critique, the notes on translation in the back of my text indicate some issues, including the title itself! Instead of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov,&quot; the book should probably be &quot;The Karamazov Brothers.&quot; As editor Ralph E. Matlaw states, &quot;we do not refer to 'the brothers Kennedy',&quot; and I'll mention &quot;the sisters Hilton.&quot; On the bright side, I feel the strange title makes the book feel more &quot;foreign&quot; and exotic.Matlaw also states Garnett doesn't just confuse the reader with some language, but actually simplifies and cleans up other language, turning at least one character into a more polished version than Doestoevsky probably intended. Thankfully, Garnett's peculiarities become familiar and comfortable. Overall, this book is sufficiently readable.Of note to first-time Dostoevsky readers is the extreme number of characters quickly introduced near the beginning of the book, with the traditional cavalcade of Russian names, surnames, and nicknames. This is no deficiency of the translator, but rather a difficulty inherent with the source text.Fans of Dostoevsky may simply be wondering: is this worth the time to read? After taking in all 700+ pages, I can answer a resounding yes. Ideas introduced in earlier works are here fleshed out into living, breathing, bleeding human beings. I feel the characters are some of the most real I've ever encountered in literature. The variety in people eases the reader's process of identifying with a character; I identified with multiple throughout the book.For those being introduced to Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment may be better, simply because Karamazov has a slow, disorienting beginning. However, if you enjoy the Russian master, you will relish in the delight of Karamazov."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"The Brothers Karamzov was published in 1880 by Fyodor Dostoyvesky (1821-1881). It is the the greatest of his novels. The BK is also considered one of the best novels ever written.The lengthy book (nearly 1000 densely written pages!)is many things:a. A mystery story. Who murdered the old lecherous Fyodor Karamazov?b. A theological inquiry into theodicy and the purpose for life. Most notable chapters are \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" and \\"The Devil.\\"c. A classic Christian story of sin, redemption and humankind's hope for eternal life.d. A psychological study of the various types of human personality. Dostoevsky is the best psychological novelist in Russian letters.e. A political discourse on the future of Russia in the late 19th century. We see such topics as nihilism, atheism, the role of the state and Russian social structure discussed.Was old man Karamazov murdered by his sons?a. Dmitri-a military man who is wild as the wild. He is torn between his love for the wealthy Katerina and the village Circe Grushenka. He hates his father. He represents sensuality in human life.b. Ivan-the coldly intellectual son who is an atheist. He believes that in a world without God all things are possible.c. Smerdyakov-the illegitimate epileptic son by old Karamazov's first wife who was the village idiot!He is one of the most repulsive characters in fiction!d. Alyosha-He is the Christ-like son who lives in a monastery with the saintly Father Zossima. Alyosha will leave the monastery to share the gospel of love and understanding in society.The novel has long passages of philisophy and religious thoughts by the characters. The court scenes dealiing with the murder of old Karamazov are exciting. Several chapters dealing with Alyosha's loving care of a dying child are as moving as anything in Dickens.The book is not easy reading. I have read it five times always gaining a new insight into the human soul and condition. It will live forever.Hooray for Karamazov!!!!"},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"This novel is, in my opinion, the finest novel ever written. The themes are universal, to a degree that they not only hold-up over a century later, even for an American reader like myself, but seem to speak directly and prophetically to the chaos and conflict of modern times. Even the great works of Tolstoy - a superb novelist and contemporary of Dostoyevsky's - in spite of their magnificent scope and brilliant historical detail, seem at times dated, dogmatic, and naive in contrast with the brilliant insight of The Brothers Karamazov.As a result of the vast social convulsions in the century since the book's publication, few of the great 19th century writers are able to reach out through time and address both current concerns and the universal questions of human existance with the unflinching honesty and authority of Dostoyevski.The father and four brothers in the novel are indeed archetypes, but so intimately drawn that they walk and breath on the page as living people - and furthermore, for better or worse, they are people of irrepressible passion - people who confront the moral and social calamity of their lives with a remarkable courage and a vital gusto. Even when that passion becomes confused and twisted, or passes beyond into actual depravity, they are never beaten into apathy under the unrelenting bleakness of a collapsing social order and a failing imperial state . . .And here I must say a few words about Dostoyevski's engrossing and devastatingly realistic portrait of his times. He has sometimes been accused of being an insufferable romantic - of creating charactors that are fantastic - of writing a kind of surrealistic distortion of existance that is employed merely for lurrid effect. But if one goes through the book line by line it turns out that the opposite is true. It is his unflinshing refusal to embelish or prettify the world his charactors inhabit that gives his work it's disorienting quality. He forces us to take off our rose-colored glasses and see his world as he see's it, and this fierce vision is not for everyone, but those able to enter it may take away an understanding of life's meaning beyond estimation.Because, in spite of the patricide, the unrelenting grimness and the omnipresent cold and deprivation that permeate this novel (and much of his other work) Dostoyevski is determined to leave us with an appreciation of the incredible power and endurance of the human spirit, a renewed vision of the wonder of human life, and finally a conviction that neither the three surviving brothers nor we ourselves have passed beyond redemption.Footnote: Also, in my opinion, the Constance Garnett edition is still the finest English translation."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"I don't even know how or where to start a review on a work as monumental and transcendental as Fyodor Dostoyevsky's stunning masterpiece \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", so I'm not going to pretend I can encapsulate in a review its all-encompassing magnitude, depth and complexities. To all fellow Amazon users out there: if you haven't read \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", you should consider yourself lucky that you've yet to experience one of the most important literary works and one of the most intellectually, emotionally, philosophically and spiritually profound works of art ever created. Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka...some of the most creative and deepest thinkers of the past couple of centuries all have agreed on the magnificence of this work and there's a reason for it:\\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" will deeply challenge pretty much everything that is at the very core of your soul. It's impossible to come away from reading this novel and not have your understanding of the human condition and your very soul to be expanded and deepened. The most essential concerns of mankind and deepest questions of life are to be found in this book (God and its existence or non-existence, morality, free will, faith, religion and state, reason, madness, lust, responsibility and a myriad of other crucial themes) and Dostoyevsky's visionary and genius exploration of them will take the reader on a true journey of deep introspection. Kurt Vonnegut stated in one of his books that everything one needed to know about life is in \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" and for my own experience I think he's right.I cannot recommend \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" enough.

It is so rare that you can read a novel and see reflections of yourself as well as being so true and exacting as far human nature is concerned. This novel will make you ask questions of yourself. Do reflect those positive values expressed by Dostoyevsky? Am I a good person? Does pride get in the way of person being truly happy or do many of us live as tormented damned souls who &quot;live on their vindictive pride like a starving man in the desert sucking blood out of his own body&quot; as he puts it? The point of the book is that in order to have happiness and peace you must have love and love can only be achieved by accepting the love of Christ, and worldly cynacism and pride are barriers that separate us from divine love.

Dostoyevsky masterfully and beautifully combines the spiritual traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church, the theology of St. Isaac of Syria, his personal life experiences, the teachings of the Fathers of the Optina Monastery, and an amazing storytelling ability to make this book what it is -- a prophecy of the 20th century, one of the greatest books ever written, and my personal favorite book."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"This, like other classic works, is meant to be savored rather than devoured.

But it is not an ironic coincidence since Dostoyevsky literature is pervaded with three perpetual themes: the craving for faith, nature for freedom, and origin of evil. And The Brothers Karamazov, as the pinnacle of Dostoyevsky's career, is an amazing combination of all the elements that contribute to the intrigues of psychology and religion.The plot evolves around the murder of a depraved landowner, Fyodor Karamazov. The trial itself takes place later in the book with the three sons of Karamazov playing seemingly afflicting roles. It is not accurate to assume each brother's position according to the three themes; simply, each brother represents a unique combination of all three themes with incoherent reactions and consequences. Alyosha is identified as the hero of the novel, and he is the Dostoyevsky's final attempt to personify Christ. Ivan, the second son, is a revolutionary intellectual who more or less symbolizes Dostoyevsky's ideal of &quot;craving for faith&quot;. Acting as Raskolnikov's counterpart, Ivan is Dostoyevsky's attempt to refute the rising radical idealism. It is Dmitri's passion for two women that ultimately triggers the catastrophe. Nature of freedom is truly manifested in this unhappy man desperately trying to regenerate. Held in comparison with Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov dares to manifest the two abysses of human nature with somewhat less realistic and more surreal characters. The plot itself evolves around life's many paradox; for example, the elder himself once led a notorious career; and Dostoyevsky paints a not-so-promising picture of church, overwhelmed with dark oppression. Also, instead of one female character that symbolizes love and religion, Dmitri's sin is only justified through the love of two completely different women. Ironic enough, neither women possess Sonya's divine serenity. Katerina, Dmitri's former betrothed, loves him out of gratitude, and when her convinced love is ruthlessly rejected, she seeks revenge and helplessly falls for Ivan. Grushenka, a player figure that continuously tempts Fyodor and Dmitri's passion, sees herself as the cause to the calamity since many believe Dmitri's motive of murder to be jealousy. But nonetheless, Dostoyevsky strives for balance and sense of truth that is usually found in the middle of extremities. And just as the Devil recites from Terence's comedy Heautontimoroumenous (The Self-torturer), &quot;Satan sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto&quot; (I am a man, and nothing human is alien to me), The Brothers Karamazov captures the struggle we are only too familiar with, and frames forever &quot;those moments when the lie becomes the truth&quot;."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. By the time I had graduated high school, I had already read it twice. I wrote a term paper on it in college. When I deployed to Iraq, I made sure this book went with me.

It does have an active table of contents."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"This is a typical Russian novel in which characters walk in the room and have deep and long conversations about life with each other. If you are interested in what they are saying, it is good reading; if not, it can get tedious. Most parts of this long novel are fairly interesting, although it seems to be slow going at times.Doestoevsky presents two brothers with opposing ideas on how the world works and how those ideas influence Russian society. Alexey follows the Orthodox Church and its beliefs and seems to do well by them, whereas Ivan is tortured by his disbelief in God and the absurdity of the world. He may just be angry at God, rather than an atheist; he is a person who does not like how God has arranged things. Dostoyevsky seems to favor Alexey's Christianity over Ivan's secular ideas because he puts Alexey in better light.Alexey's dream is the standard Christian one in which all people become equal, holy, and loving in their submission to the will of Christ. Alexey represents a religious Russian that finds the way to live life is by the Church's teachings.Alexey is accused of being a sensualist because he is a Karamazov; \\"birth and heredity\\" has shaped him. The socialist Rakitin states, \\"You're a sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother.\\" Alexey goes on to prove that his saintliness overcomes whatever sensuality he might have. He refuses to see the sensual Grushenka, even though she says that she will \\"pull his cassock off\\". Alexey represents a Russian who rejects the sensuality that a secular liberal may give into.Unlike his brother Ivan, Alexey shows his sensitive nature and insight into people he helps. When Ivan coldly states that one reptile will devour another if Dmitri kills the father, Alexey exclaims \\"God forbid!\\" Alexey later questions Ivan as to whether he or any man has the right to decide who should live. Ivan states that it is natural to wish for his father's death and he has a right to do so. Alexey also cries over his father being beaten by Dmitri and Dmitri's insensitivity to it. When he gets bitten by Ilusha, Alexey asks the boy why he was bitten, rather than get angry with him. He thinks that he must have wronged him in some way. Alexey is incapable of passive love because if he loves someone, he wants to help them. He realizes that the captain is too proud to take the money offered him and is ashamed of his initial delight. Alexey attempts to help him again rather than lose patience. He does not have contempt for the man, but states that all are like him. Alexey is a religious Russian who finds an outlet for his kindness and sensitivity by following the Christian way of life.Alexey does not say much, but he does record the beliefs of his mentor, Father Zossima, who believes that fulfilling desires is fruitless and one would do better to live according to brotherly solidarity and humanitarian service.Ivan, on the other hand, asserts that all things are lawful if there is no immortality: \\"There is no virtue if there no immortality\\", he states. He is an uneasy atheist claiming that natural law is based on the belief in immortality and if the belief is destroyed then love and life will be destroyed along with it and the laws should be changed to the opposite of what they are now. Like other Russian secular liberals, he is at odds with the moral teachings of the church because he claims not to believe in God.Ivan struggles to justify his life with his belief in absurdity and atheism. Ivan states that he still has a thirst for life that no disillusionment can destroy. Even though he does not believe in the chaotic disorder of the world and is disillusioned with it; he still wants to live and does not consider the thirst for life base. Alexey states that he should love life even if he finds no logic in it and then he will find a meaning in it later. Ivan will not depend on sensuality to get through his life the way his father has done. Ivan changes his mind and says that he does not believe in the world God created, but may believe in God. His mind is an earthly mind and cannot understand unearthly things or the absurdity of suffering in this life. Like a secular liberal, he struggles to find meaning in life after he has rejected religious meanings that explain life.Ivan makes the argument that suffering is absurd and unjustified as it afflicts the innocent; the world does not make sense and must not have been created by God. He mentions the cruel murder of a baby and says that the devil may not exist, but man has created him in his own image. He talks about the Russian proclivity to cruelly beat innocent animals and children without a tinge of guilt. He says that everyone has a demon of lust, cruelty, and lawlessness within them that is waiting to come out and indulge itself.Dostoevsky presents a generally unflattering picture of Russia as a backward land filled with cheats, religious fanatics, and unprincipled secular types. But he does have two compelling characters with Alexey and Father Zossima; the rest seem to be suffering from insanity, character flaws, or proclivities for violence. He indicates through these two characters that following the Christian beliefs are better than following liberal secular ones, even though a person might be considered reactionary because of it."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Dostoevsky's original Russian is meaty. Constance Garnett's translation is Victorian. Garnett may well have thought that she was improving on Dostoevsky's cluttered and lumbering prose, but she did not. Garnett was the first person to translate many of the classic Russian novels (by Dostoevsky and Tolstoy) into English, and it is rare that the early translations of classic works are good. When buying a translation, if there is an option, you are overwhelmingly better off buying the most recent possible. Luckily, Dostoevksy does not now lack for translators, and the \\"Brothers K\\" is *at least* five stars when better translated (Volokhonsky & Pevear).Nabokov & others have derided Dostoevksy for his deep and tormented characters and soul-bareing conversations. However, it is pointless to criticize Dostoevsky for not having shared in the form-enfatuation of the 20th century and not having joined the race of style that started three decades after his death. Dostoevsky most concerned himself with his characters. And for him, real evaluation occurs in extreme value conflicts. He helps himself to these circumstances with none of the super-model frugality of many modern novelists (with all the style in the world, but wary of weighty non-ironic philosophy or morality). Bottom line: Dostoevsky is an extremely readable great novelist.Although many judge \\"The Brothers\\" as Dostoevsky's greatest novel, it is not the most Dostoevskian of his great novels. That's \\"The Devils\\" (also translated \\"The Possessed\\" and \\"The Demons\\"), where the strange workings of his characters and the originality of his social insight are most clearly and uncomfortably evident. Although \\"The Brothers\\" reads more easily, its subtleties are more detectable in the context of \\"The Devils.\\" Read it too. Better yet, read it first."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"I feel duped. The Brothers Karamazov may very well be a great book, but the Barnes and Noble edition is not the version of it I want to read. Being a bargain edition of a work in the public domain, of course it is cheaply printed, and my copy arrived with torn and crumpled dustjacket, which of course did not please me. Then there were several distressing details about the book which I noticed on first inspection, including a long list of quotations from the text and a pages-long \\"introduction\\" before the text of the novel itself. (If a commentator wants to talk to me about a novel, I feel it's only polite that he wait until after I've read it.) The topper, though, came the day after the book arrived, when I happened to get some information about the translator, Constance Garnett, in The Writer's Almanac (a Garrison Keillor project). Their report is that Garnett \\"was born in Brighton, England (1861). She gave us many of the first English translations of famous 19th-century Russian novels.... But Garnett had a habit of skipping phrases that she didn't understand, she often missed the humor of the original Russian, and she altered sexuality in the novels to reflect her Victorian ideals. Critic Kornei Chukovsky compared her writings to 'a safe blandscript: not a volcano... a smooth lawn mowed in the English manner --- which is to say a complete distortion of the original.' Constance Garnett's translations held up as the standard for decades, but now most of them are replaced by more nuanced versions of the Russian works.\\" So unless you are interested in a Victorian distortion of Dostoevsky, I recommend you find a better translation and pay a couple of dollars more for it. I wish I had."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I prize it primarily because of the characters Alyosha and Father Zossima, both of whom are profoundly good. It is very difficult to write about good people. As another famous Russian novelist famously pointed out, it is the bad characters and families that have the interesting lives. This book is made interesting by the introduction of numerous villains who engage and entice the reader, and who confuse and torment the good Alyosha.The most famous passage in the book, and indeed one of the most famous in all literature, is called The Grand Inquisitor. It is important to note, however, that that portrait of evil is a fiction created by one of the characters in the book. Alyosha and Zossima, on the other hand, are \\"real\\" characters -- at least within the framework of the book. We are perhaps not meant to trust the narrative in the Grand Inquisitor, while we are meant to trust Zossima and Alyosha.This book is important because of the wisdom of its author. Dostoevsky perhaps never mastered the art of living a good life, but he did master the art of portraying goodness and evil in fiction. For most of my life Zossima and Alyosha have stood in my mind (either consciously or unconsciously) as beacons of light in a dark world, and the other characters, to varying degrees, have represented the numerous temptations and missteps that plague most of our lives. As such, the book is not so much a novel, as a spiritual guide.Dostoevsky was one of the first authors to deeply understand the modern mind, and I'm not at all sure that anything written since the appearance of this book has fully supplanted it portrayal of the pitfalls of passion, materialism and pride. A good deal of suffering could be avoided if more people could understand how acts of spiritual discipline can help us realize the simple message of love and compassion found in this book."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"It's not uncommon for a novel to attempt to cover the grand scope of everything. Life, faith, the human heart, our relationships with each other and their effects on the people around us. Our uneasy and reluctant acceptance of death and what that can acceptance can mean for us. There's no shortage of people with ambition and walking in any bookstore to gaze at all the gigantic tomes lining the \\"literature\\" section of the aisles is enough to prove that. Many attempt it. Most don't succeed at it.This one does.Recommending a giant Russian novel to anyone is a fairly dicey affair. Length alone will deter most people and those who aren't frightened by the idea of slogging through over seven hundred hard fought pages will want to know, \\"So, hey, what's it about?\\" How do you even encapsulate it? What could you even tell them?Well. You could tell them it is the story of four Russian brothers, all as different from each other as brothers can be different from each other, navigating the tricky tangles of family, loving and hating each other in equal measure. You could tell them it's a novel primarily of ideas, as various people discuss the nature of faith and whether the soul can be advanced through suffering, if indeed suffering is the whole point of the world. A novel where people who aren't even the main characters engage in lengthy dissections of what it all means, sometimes with each other, sometimes with themselves. You could also tell them that it's a murder mystery, with a character dying who nobody really liked anyway and much possible confusion over who really did it, also the source of much great debate.And yet it's not about one of those things. And yet it's about all of those things, somehow, simultaneously, all at once.The primary drive of the novel is the actions of the brothers, all of whom both exist both as people and metaphorical representations. Alyosha is good and pure and honest, Ivan is coldly intellectual, and Dmitri is the sensualist, eager to experience all the aspects of life that he can, whether it's a good idea or not. Each acts within his confines but somehow manages to come across as a real person, Alyosha in particular (it's impossible to believe that a man of such consistent gentle goodness can exist but the novel will have you believing in the very reality of him). But attempting to pin the novel down to one single plot is an exercise in futility that the novel nimbly eludes. To me it seems to exist as an examination of faith in this world, openly questioning how it can exist (Ivan's scenes and speeches involving such a topic are famous for a reason and I love how he can accept the idea of God but not accept the idea that such a being would want to deliberately create a world so steeped in suffering) and also making a case for why it has to exist. It gives us characters who are so good that it seems the world can hardly bear them and people with no redeeming qualities whatsoever (the brothers' dad roars through every scene he's featured in, commanding the page like the drunken train wreck of a guy at a party that you don't want to look your way but you can't take your eyes off of) and manages to make them feel all cut from the same fabric. It feels like sharply observed life, as people wrestle with the same ideas that we privately wrestle with, just in extremely long speeches that never seem to bore.There's no central plot to this. It meanders and rambles, although it never feels like it's getting off track. The author circles around his points and tries to poke at them from every angle just to see what comes out. For every long argument we get in favor of something, in the next chapter someone will turn around and give the opposite argument in a way that seems like truth in that very second. It digresses and sidetracks itself and each time it does it only strengthens what we've already read. Whether it's the story of Father Zosima, or Ivan relating his poem or the young boys who throw stones, it all becomes part of the same piece, part of life in all its ability to come to a single sustained point.And part of death, too, the single sustained messy point of our lives. A novel this big can't fail to have a body count and not a few people drop in the course of it. Some go out with a gentle sigh and some go out with more of a bang. It's the latter kind of death that drives the action toward the last third of the book, as the dad comes to an end that seems inevitable from the very start of it (the way he constantly goads everyone in sight you can't imagine the book will end well for him) and there becomes a sense of tension as it becomes a matter of more when than if. Yet we get no easy explanations for that either, just conflicting stories and contrasted viewpoints, as everyone seeks to find a guilty party that makes sense to their own philosophies. But when that's decided all that's left is for another small death, hardly anything in the scheme of it, that manages to give the novel an ending that seems amazingly hopeful after what has gone before. Indeed, I had no idea how you could wrap up a novel with no easily grasped theme or plot but he nailed it. The ending is perfect, not because it ties things together neatly, with all mysteries explained, but because of the great emotional finality of it and overriding sense of yes, we can stop here. This is a good place to get off.Don't get me wrong, it's not a page turner. The prose does crackle in parts, especially as the ideas start to wing left and right. But you have to spend time with it and let it spend time with you, absorb it and let it seep into the cracks you didn't know you had. These aren't real people, more constructs of real people but in their bursts of living and loving and hating and despairing, their swoops of joy and suffering, they feel more vital in a way that other novels don't. You can't go into it looking for a strict story, it's too big for that. The narrative refuses to hold it and doesn't need to. Instead it takes hold of every thread of life and sets it spinning out into the dark and it, much like us, follows for as long as it can, to glean whatever insights there are to find, before letting those threads continue on their way long past the point where the darkness is absolute. But it's not a source of fear. We often don't see the end of what we start, and that's okay. As long as we've entered the debate, we've made a case for being alive."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Anyone interested in the central question facing mankind will find \`The Brothers Karamazov' an essential guide. That question--on man's capacity for responsibility and the proper role of the state and religion--is posed throughout the story in dialogue and events, and is framed neatly in a 20-page section where Ivan presents a poem titled \`The Grand Inquisitor' to his brother Alyosha. The chapter that bears that title (Book V, Chapter V) is a masterpiece in itself and should be studied for its narrative technique alone. But the ideas it presents are so immense, so mind-blowing and inspirational, that literary criticism is not sufficient.Indeed, \`The Brothers Karamazov' should not be classed merely as a novel--it is a book of philosophy, theology, and sociology as well that ranks with the greatest documents in those disciplines. There is a fictitious plot, of course, and the characters in the story are some of the most interesting in all of literature, so it is rightly praised as a novel. But the modern reader looking for a plot of twists and romantic intrigues is bound to disappointment. Dostoevsky does not stir up drama through the placement of unexpected developments or improbable character traits. Instead, he relies on the inherent needs and wants of all men to make vivid his story.The amount of dialogue may be shocking (tedious) to one accustomed to the modern show-don't-tell policy in storytelling. Today, novelists and screenwriters let a character's actions speak for them--it is quicker and provides a much more convincing impression. It also limits the kind of ideas that are posed in the story to simple, prosaic ones like \`she likes him' or \`he wants to defeat him.' By contrast, Dostoevsky allows the characters to speak for themselves, which creates a much longer and subtler exposition, but also frees the ideas to be vast and monumental.What is the fundamental nature of socialism? What are the uses of the church in finding purpose? In finding salvation? Why is there suffering? What is the meaning of death? Read the brothers' dialogues and contemplate.Dostoevsky's own philosophy is seen in the protagonist, Alyosha. This is so despite the fact that the author ably covers every perspective on every topic presented in the book, and one can hardly find a positive assertion throughout. If there is one, it rests in the overall effect of the words and actions, a concept Dostoevsky articulated in a personal correspondence--it is that \\"Man is a mystery; if you spend your entire life trying to puzzle it out, then do not say that you have wasted your time.\\"A word about the translations: The title of Book IV has been translated differently in every version I have seen (other chapter titles are also inconsistent, but Book IV is seemingly the most difficult to agree on). The original Russian is \`Nadryvy,' which literally translates to \`Ruptures,' though no translations I have seen use \`Ruptures.' The word is used throughout the book to convey the motif of \`pressures' or \`strained conditions about to break.' The various options I have seen for this title are \`Lacerations' (Garnett), \`Strains' (Pevear & Volkhonsky), \`Torment' (MacAndrew), \`Crises' (Avsey), and \`Crack-Ups' (McDuff). Given this is a central theme, the potential reader might look into which translation he prefers before buying. Apropos, the Princess Alexandra Kropotkin print version bears the Garnett translation, as does the Frederick Davidson audio recording."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"I read this novel 20 years ago and was fascinated with Dostoevsky's ability to portray the inner human conflicts of his countless characters. Reading it again, I'm still fascinated by Dostoevsky's outstanding ability to describe human confrontation with mortality, agony, and the burden of choice. However, now I have a new understanding of Dostoevsky's philosophy.Understandably, and due to the political, emotional, religious and social crisis that Dostoevsky witnessed during his life, he arrived at a point where he rejected radical socialists' positions and all the philosophical concepts popular in Russia at the time, and moved to a conservative position of concern for traditional and religious values.During my life's journey of trying to comprehend and understand Dostoevsky, I came to believe that all his work, with the exception of Notes from Underground, was too predictable. He describes an avalanche of human emotional mysteries and takes the reader on a tragic roll coaster ride that will peak and end in either symbolic or an over simplified answer, both of which stand for one concept: humans are doomed, truth is mysterious, turn to God and you'll be saved. In my immaturity, I thought that Dostoevsky did his part to search for truth and the meaning of life, and consistently forces his novels to this conclusion. In particular, the arrogance of his definitive righteousness that he displayed in his last few books was starting to get on my nerves.After reading the Brothers Karamazov the second time, I came to a different understanding of Dostoevsky's passionate literature. The characters in The Brothers Karamazov were actually more mature than Dostoevsky's previous characters, and instead of Dostoevsky's typical tragic and hopeless conclusion, there is actually an objective, optimistic, non righteous view of human kind's nature.Granted, Dostoevsky still portrayed the hero-Alyosha-as a true loving self denying person, but without the over dramatic craziness that his characters previously had. The other semi-corrupt characters like Dmitri, Ivan, Grushka, and Smerdyakov were realistic enough and displayed both dark and bright sides. Particularly, Ivan was a great character that Dostoevsky used to display his thoughts about atheism, morality and the way he sees free will as a curse. Even though Dostoevsky obviously wanted to disagree with Ivan's debates about God and mortality, he was less definitive in this novel about who's righteous and who's bad.Now, I feel that Dostoevsky never found his true inner peace. After all, he was always torn between his desires, addictions, and obsessive love to the woman that tormented him, Suslova. Maybe, the righteous answer that Dostoevsky forcibly wanted for all his characters problems is, in fact, his own dream of a salvation that could never been achieved during his life.I might be wrong in both my assumptions, but The brothers Karamazov is a well written masterpiece regardless of the author's hidden messages."},{"Title":"The brothers Karamazov (Barnes & Noble classics)","review":"Was a tad late arriving, however was worth the wait.

Love's women's monologues and meditations are both lyrical and disturbing in their unceasing honesty, as tough and tender as the lives he's celebrating.\\"- Amy UyematsuNights of Fire, Nights of Rain"},{"Title":"Water at the Women's Edge","review":"B D Love is a technically accomplished poet. Yet his poems are most certainly not mere sterile exercises. For he brings to life the memories and emotions of the many people he speaks for and through. To read his poems is to hear voices that I would either never hear or not listen to if I did. This is a book of poems that will make you want to read more poetry again."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Susanna Clarke won me over with Strange & Norrell, which I confess is my \\"favorite book that I hate\\" (it was painfully verbose at times, and rambling at others, but somehow it was also highly enjoyable). It should be no surprise that her short stories are the best of both worlds: the same highly literate representations of Fairy, the same well-crafted world of magic and wonder... but condensed nicely into more easily consumable portions. More adult than the lovable and whimsicalStardustby Neil Gaiman, but as easy to digest.I give 2 enthusiastic thumbs-up, or five stars, or whatever (I'd give five thumbs-up if I had five thumbs)."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"While Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is not required reading for this short story collection, it provides a fuller and more complete background to the stories you are reading, nevertheless, one can certainly enjoy them and understand what's going on without having read the aforementioned 600+ page book.Clarke spent a decade writing Jonathan Strange, so it is not surprising that in her spare time she wrote some stories set in this magnificent world, which while not directly involved in the actions and events of her opus, do play by its rules and restrictions. Some of the stories may even have been cut from the massive manuscript that was Jonathan Strange and now find themselves in this collection, finally in print.These eight stories run the gamut of what Clarke might want to tell about her world, from what a couple of ladies with magical ability must do (from the title story); to a tale of Mary, Queen of Scots; to a story involving the same Jonathan Strange of her book. What links all these stories together is the reality of magic, whether the characters in the stories choose to accept its existence or not. The result is a delightful, seemingly romantic, and entertaining change to the glut of fantasy filling the book world these days. Magic in Clarke's world cannot be done by everyone; it is subtle, exhausting, and hard to do. Like the Bartimaeus Trilogy, Clarke's magical world presents something new and therefore captivating in its own way.While my complaint of Clarke is that she can often be long winded and due for some heavy editing - both in this collection and in her weighty novel - in the end one is left with the wonderful feeling that one has just read something special and will delight in reading it again some day. Not to mention Ladies of Grace Adieu also features mesmerizing black and white illustrations by Charles Vess (who illustrated Neil Gaiman's Stardust), the book is a worthy addition to anyone's library. The question remains now: how long will it be before Clarke publishes another collection or novel? Does she have a box full of cut stories and material from Jonathan Strange waiting to be viewed by a reader's eyes? Only time will reveal this truth.For more book reviews, and other writings, go to www.alexctelander.com"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I loved \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" so much that I was just thrilled when I found out that Susanna Clarke had a new book coming out. I was less thrilled when I found out that it was a book of short stories, and many of them had been written before \\"Jonathan..\\" was. But still, this was a priority for me to read.And I really liked it! There were maybe two stories in this book that I didn't love, and the rest of them were just great. Most of these stories take place in the world of \\"Jonathan Strange\\" and deal with the same type of magical happenings. A great deal of the stories focus on fairies (which was just fantastic because the way Susanna Clarke has visualized the fairy is not only highly original but hilarious and creepy at the same time.) Some other stories are reworking of classic tales, like Rumpelstiltskin. One borrows from the book \\"Stardust\\" by Neil Gaiman and takes place beyond the wall that separates England from the land of Fairy.I felt the best stories in this book were \\"Mr. Simonelli or the fairy widower\\" and \\"Tom Brightwind or how the fairy bridge was built at Thoresby.\\" I was also very surprised by how well Ms. Clarke writes in first person (every bit as good as in third.) While I would have preferred this book to be a second \\"Jonathan Strange...\\" or something of the like, this was a great book to be in-between large, serious novels, and wet the reader's appetite for more.Five stars, 4 for the really good stories there were, and 1 for the anticipation this generated for her next book."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Having been disappointed with most of what I'd been reading lately, I decided to read this book even though I'm not a short story fan, because Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is an absolutely brilliant book. And I was in the mood for something I knew would be good.And it is good. These eight short stories, set in the same imagined England as Clarke's novel, share much of its atmosphere and wit. As is to be expected, they're also very well-written, in the same sort of nineteenth-century language as the novel. I enjoyed them--particularly the title story, \\"Mrs Mabb,\\" \\"Mr Simonelli\\" and \\"Tom Brightwind,\\" all longer stories dealing with the relationships between people and the magical world.But I can't say this collection has converted me into a fan of short stories--I find I have little to say about it. They're certainly well-done, but it's Clarke's next novel that I'm really waiting for."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Ladies of Grace Adieu can't help but feel a little light compared to Clarke's first book,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell- after all, when you go from an 800+ page novel to a slight collection of very short stories, you can't help but feel some of the loss of scope and that epic feeling. That being said, Clarke's imagination is no less on display here, whether it's the tale of a bitter deposed queen using embroidery to try to get at her foes or a small village in desperate need of a bridge. There's still a sense of this wondrous alternate world where faeries and magic coexist with men, and anything is possible. And yet, in cutting down her massive tapestry to tiny cloths, Clarke doesn't quite succeed as well as she did with her novel. The stories are fun diversions, but ultimately feel a little weightless, especially given that most are presented as folktales with little \\"reality\\" to anchor ourself in. All of that being said, it's still a fun read, and Clarke's writing ability still shines through, even in short pieces; it's just like a collection of DVD extras attached to one of your favorite movies. Fun, but inessential unless you're a big fan of Clarke's. Let's hope the next novel is in the works."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Mr Norrell and Jonathan Strange from Susanna Clarke is an amazing book - actually the best fantasy book I've ever read. After reading that, you might be still hungry for her style of writting and this is a good book to statisfy that. At least one story is amazing: \\"Mr Simonelli and the Fairy Widow\\" and there are some pretty cool stories, like the last story about the Raven King. The others are entertaining and nice to read. So, I strongly recommend it, but if you haven't readMr Norrell...\\" first, go and read that one that you will enjoy much more."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"If you enjoyed the incredibly imaginative folk story-ish footnotes in JONATHAN STRANGE & MR NORRELL, you will surely enjoy this book as they are written in that style. The eight stories in here were just brilliant. Fast-paced entertainment, mysticism, and, best of all, creepy/shocking magic (both Faerie and human) all rolled together. Absolutely loved it."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I wish is was longer. Read it over 2-3 nights. Could read it in a day except I'm pregnant and sleep a lot. Can't wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I enjoyed Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell because it was so unique. It was a slow read at times but made up for it with some fascinating characters placed in an alternate history where magicians work with the military to fight Napoleon. This collection of short stories however, I found odd, boring and very very slow to move through. Just didn't capture my attention. I read another four books while forcing myself to finish this one. I give it two stars which to me means save your money. I didn't like this one for the most part. One story reminded me a bit of Strange and Norrell and that is Tom Brightwind. Amazon recommeded \\"His Majesty's Dragon\\" to me because I enjoyed JS and Mr. Norrell. I enjoyed reading about the English using talking dragons to fight Napoleon. If you are looking for something similar to JS and Mr. Norrell, you might look there."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Since I won't ever shut up about how magnificent Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is and how it ought to be required reading in the civilized world, a friend bought me this book for my birthday. I enjoyed it, but It feels like exactly what it is: stories set in the same world as Jonathan Strange to tide over the fan base and capitalize on JS's success. The stories work to varying degrees of effectiveness, but I thought that only one (\\"Mr Simonelli or the Fairy Widower\\") was truly excellent. If you've read JS, this book may tide you over but in a vaguely unsatisfying way. If you haven't read JS, this book will hopefully whet your appetite for the main course."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"With the tremendous success of 'Harry Potter,' there should be no questions that other publishers would also add magical books to their line. Susanna Clarke's addition to this genre started with 'Johathan Strange and Mr. Norrel.' The publisher suddenly found that he had a hit on his hand. Next those who like Strange/Norrel needed a short term fix while waiting for the next novel. And the quick answer was to get this book together from stories that Ms. Clarke had written before.It's a very good fix. The stories are set in nearly the same magical world. While most of them have a different set of characters and stand alone stories, a couple cover points at least mentioned in Strange/Morrel. Taken together, these stories show the thinking that Ms. Clarke was going through as she developed her ideas of a magical England.Since everything that Ms. Clarke has written, up until now, has been published, these stories will just have to hold you until the next novel is published."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Truthfully told, I have not read the whole book.I am slowly savoring each story, perhaps one a month! But I was glad to see Jonathan Strange make an appearance in the first story; I've missed him so much--here's to hoping there'll be a sequel of Ms Clarke's first novel to learn of the further adventures of Strange and Norrell!This fairly slim book of stories are magical in nature and are perhaps not quite so proper, as found in the title story of those Grace Adieu ladies, as in Clarke's novel revival of English magic. The stories I've read so far are written with Clarke's deft touch of tongue in cheek seriousness, yet with a good portion of minatory darkness.While I appreciate the opportunity of reading something new of Clarke's, I hope another novel is in the works, as it is quite a lot of fun to spend a nice cold wintry day delving deep into the her unique thoughts and imagination, and travel to new places of flights and fancy and dreams. So until then, I will content myself now with slowly savoring these tasty amuse-bouches."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Written in the same intensity as its predecessor, this book occupies the same universe, but only exposes us to short bursts of anecdotes, which to be certain, as i am in this case, can only be fully appreciated and enjoyed once you've gone through the trials and tribulations of Susanna Clarke's earlier novel. Now, i mean 'trials and tribulations' in only the most positive of ways. The earlier behemoth of Victorian nuance was a chore, to be fair, when it started. and to the novice reader it could prove to be damning, and back breaking if they didn't have the nerve to follow through. and once you did, then a new world opened up to you, swallowing you in its dark and fantastical voyage, with front row seats in the minds of the eras two foremost professors of magick.The ladies of Grace adieu, is like an addendum, one would think perhaps it is a collection of tidbits and anecdotes edited out from the previous book, but even then, they have a charm of their own. They dance, they sway, they wilt lyrically till the last page. and then you realize, that it was over far earlier than should've been, i had only just begun to enjoy it.This book is our reward, our dessert, our evening tea. But in some ways it also as if Hercules after fulfilling his mighty tasks was told it was all in preparation for an evening in the garden. He'd be relieved, sure... but over-prepared."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I love Susannah Clarke's style and have ranked her earlier novel \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" as one of the best novels I've ever read. This collection of stories felt to me like meeting a dear old friend with new stories to tell. Clarke captures for me the essence of the folk tale with humor and joy in language. There is a wry quality to her writing, clearly reminiscent of Jane Austen, that relishes understatement and irony."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Simply magnificent! True in style and vocabulary to all that one might except to meet when the lands of that horrifying elvenking and all his darkness and indifference spill out into the victorian code of conduct. heroisme and fairytale in a grimm and great univers, that the brothers Grimm and the elders of the folklore would do backingvocals to for free. Gloom meets enlightenment, husky hills and cool english reasoning clash on these pages, and you might not be the same afterwards."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I loved the narration. Davina Porter has a lovely voice and beautiful expression. However, it seems as though \\"the other stories\\" were just thrown in. The title story was very good, but the others were less than expected."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"It is a pleasant notion: that over the years, I have shed adolescent imprudence. That, in choosing between taking a nap or tapping my thumbs to the beat of a song, my thoughts so methodical would impress Pluto. Ah, but I know that if suddenly, I found myself once more in that body, the fifteen year old's, and in that library, the Las Vegas Rainbow, I would again choose the thick book with the interesting name and impressive cover. Why? For the interesting name and impressive cover, of course! And what a pleasure it would be to once more find myself in that body, the fifteen year old's. Each page would make me covetous for the next hundred and, at the end, I would find the book too short, pick up a blue sharpie pen, and in a school journal begin to form my own fantasy novel--one I would grow to be embarrassed of. But that was then and that was another book, JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL.THE LADIES OF GRACE ADIEU AND OTHER STORIES is not good, not very good at all. I read the first few pages on a cloudy day in Phoenix and said out loud, really said out loud, \\"I love Susanna Clarke.\\" As I read on, however, the sun emerged from between two thick clouds and its dreadful, epiphanous light shone and made me realize that Susanna Clarke is not a short story writer. Though some stories are a delight, particularly the one about the eponymous ladies or \\"Mrs Mabb,\\" none come close to the charm, the great fun that was Clarke's debut novel. Why? Reading the short story collection made me realize how great Susanna Clarke is at forming characters. Not because she does it in THE LADIES OF GRACE ADIEU--no, not at all does she do it in THE LADIES OF GRACE ADIEU--but because she did it so excellently before. Give the author hundreds of pages and I guarantee she will make you feel as if one of her characters was real, somebody you are familiar and friendly with. Give the author a confined form of writing, and she won't come close.The best short stories are more like poems than novels. Susanna Clarke's style of writing is perfect for a novel, but too ambling for a short story. The reason for this is because she includes too many characters that cannot be satisfactorily formed by the end. In many instances, it feels as if she should have combined several characters into one, giving her more space for development. It is unfair to compare THE LADIES OF GRACE ADIEU to her previous work, so I will not. Simply, it is a book that I would not recommend. The stories are not fun and some, like \\"The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse,\\" are surprisingly bad.If you have not read Susanna Clarke before, definitely do not read this book. Invest time and read the infinitely superior JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL. If you are a fan, well, you might as well read it. Perhaps, I realize at the end of this long review, I am heartbroken that I was not able to experience once again that lovely feeling I had when I was first introduced to Clarke. Despite it all, if Mr. Garcia Marquez were not alive--and may he please live forever--she would be my favorite living author."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Love her sly sense of humor. These remind me a lot of Sylvia Townsend Warner."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I stopped listening to the audiobook after the first three stories or so, I couldn't detect much unusualness nor magic. However, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Susanna Clarke has a formidable imagination, as anyone who has read her novel, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell,\\" can attest. In \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu\\" she turns out eight delightful entertainments that show the multi-faceted nature of magic and its users, as well as some brief (fictional) footnotes providing historical details of English magic (a device also used to splendid effect in her \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\"). The stories have an impressive range, showing how magic can be used for good, bad, and indifferent effects, and the different reactions people have to the art. Some characters fear magic, others courageously challenge it, some find ways to use it for their own gain, and still others are driven mad by the pursuit of it. Ms. Clarke's narratives eloquently take on the form of old English writings -- and her academic asides seamlessly compliment the fictional universe she has created. I admit to thinking that her novel was overly long, but my respect for her ability compelled me to experience her next work -- and short stories prove to be a great form for her to show off her unique vision and explore it in a more rounded way (fans of \\"Strange and Norrell\\" will be glad to know that Strange himself puts in an appearance, as does the elusive Raven King, John Uskglass). Truly, she is a writer of enormous talent and limitless creativity. I am utterly in awe of Ms. Clarke, and eagerly await whatever flight of fancy she comes up with next."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories is another masterpiece by Susanna Clarke. It is a collection of eight short stories set mostly in England in the early 19th century. The stories are absolutely magical. Characters include Mary Queen of Scots, the Duke of Wellington, Jonathan Strange, and John Uskglass (the raven king) among others. Each story has that wonderful, magical charm that she put into every page of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. Fairies appear in many of her stories. I love her fairies because they are not your traditional fairies. One of my favorite stories in this collection is \\"Tom Brightwind or How the Fairy Bridge was Built at Thoresby\\". In this story, her fairy, Tom Brightwind, is six feet tall, has somewhat of a malicious side and has no wings at all. Another favorite is \\"On Lickerish Hill\\", which is Susanna Clarke's version of Rumplestiltskin.What makes this book even more magical is Charles Vess' illustrations. The whole package of the book makes you feel like you hold a treasure in your hand. The cover is designed beautifully, the stories are magical, the pages of the book are antiqued, and the illustrations are just gorgeous. I feel special for owning a copy of the book. Charles Vess' illustrations are very Victorian looking and go wonderfully with the stories. I felt as if I were reading an old book of fairy tales from the 19th century complete with illustrations of the time and all. It's very easy to forget that this book was published in 2006.Clarke truly is a master of her genre. She spins tales that become classics as soon as they're written and her use of the english language is simply beautiful. I can't wait to see what we can expect from her in the coming years. She has announced that she has somewhat of a sequel to Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell in mind, though it will probably take place after Strange and Norrell are long gone. I'm sure that whatever her brilliant mind produces next, it will be just as much of a pleasure to read as her first two books have been."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Wish I could get my money back. While the stoies are great, though a bit less absorbing than her previous book, the kindle edition is horrible. Mispellings abound and the illustrations don\`t come out right, but most disappointing is the lack of section divisions that make it extremely confusing! Very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The content of this book is wonderful, however the Kindle version is rife with typos and errors. There are I's instead of K's, 7's randomly following the letter Y, and various instances of two keys being pressed instead of the intended one. A few typos can be expected in a long work, but the frequency with which they happen in the Kindle version of this book are honestly jarring.I do not know if the printed version has been edited with more scrutiny, but I imagine that it must have been."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories, published in 2006, is a collection of short stories by Susanna Clarke meant to follow-up her amazing novel Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell (see my review of Strange in my Amazon review archives), and is mostly set in that universe. The tales are enjoyable, though the collection will only whet the appetite of those looking for more of what they liked about Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell.Eight short stories make up Ladies, and my favorites were \\"Tom Brightwind, or How the Fairy Bridge was Built at Thoresby\\" and \\"John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner.\\" Besides just finding them the most enjoyable, they also seemed to me to have the strongest feel of Strange, with the amusing fey antics of Tom Brightwind and the folklore of the Raven King.The main shortcoming of Ladies is simply that it is what it is - a collection of short stories. One of Clarke's greatest successes in the 800 page Strange was the long build up of the various plots and the layering and interplay between the characters. That just can't be replicated in a short story. What Ladies might best be viewed as is a collection of expanded footnotes from Strange, as these sorts of side stories and legends frequently appeared in the footnotes of that tale (though they often came back to be important in the grand scheme of things later in Strange ).I listened to Ladies on audio book, as read by Davina Porter and Simon Prebble. Prebble read the entirety of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell wonderfully, and his sections of Ladies are once again very well done and enjoyable. Porter, on the other hand, just didn't work for me. Her reading seemed uneven and with little variation outside of \\"saccharin heroine\\" and \\"crotchety adversary.\\"I would definitely recommend The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories to fans of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, with the warning that Ladies is more of a quick dip back into the world of Strange, and not a full immersion. Wikipedia reports that Clarke is working on a sequel to Strange centering on the characters of Childermass and Vinculus, and I suppose I'll have to wait for that for my next big adventure into the magic of 19th century England."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I'm in agreement with all of the 5-star reviewers here. I'd just like to make a few points about why I love Susanna Clarke's writing, and I'll mention the audiobook:* \\"The Duke of Wellington Misplaces his Horse\\" was a particularly delightful piece not only because it was so whimsical, but mainly because the main character is a real historical figure. One of the aspects of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell that I particularly enjoyed was Susanna Clarke's use of several historical events and people. She gives them personalities that are completely believable. Imagining The Duke of Wellington in this particular magical situation was highly entertaining.* In addition to mentioning true history and geography, Ms Clarke's use of footnotes, introductions by the \\"editor,\\" and fictional references to other works and theories about faerie give her world detail, background, and richness similar to Tolkien's Middle Earth. I read a lot of scholarly research, so I'm not easy to fool, but I certainly felt like I was reading someone's dissertation. An entertaining dissertation.* I particularly appreciate Susanna Clarke's use of dry humor (the English do that so well, don't they?). If you're into Xanth, Ronan, Discworld, or The Belgariad, it may not be your thing, but to me, it's hilarious.I listened to The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories on audiobook. I guess Susanna Clarke ranks high with her publisher because this book is read by two of the best readers in all of audiobook-dom: Simon Prebble and Davina Porter. Simon Prebble is up there with Simon Vance (who read Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander series) and comedian Lenny Henry (who read Neil Gaiman's Anansi Boys). Davina Porter reads Marion Zimmer Bradley and Diana Gabaldon (and a lot of historical fiction) and I can't think of any female reader who's better than Davina Porter -- I could listen to her read accounting textbooks and be entertained for hours as long as she read each chapter in a different voice (and I bet she could). She's particularly good at Cockney.We have only two major works by Susanna Clarke so far, but in my opinion, there is no better writer in all of fantasy fiction. For that matter, her prose is on level with those authors who we recognize as the greatest in all of literature. I hope there is much more coming from Susanna Clarke! --FanLit.net"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Susanna Clarke made a dazzling debut with \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\\" which was the sort of fantasy story that Jane Austen would have written. Still fresh from her first bestseller, she presents a new array of captivating stories in \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu.\\" But expect it to be more whimsical.The title story takes place in the magical Regency period of her debut: dull Mr. Field remarries after his wife died, and his pretty second wife, his niece, and a friend soon become good friends. When Mr. Strange passes by on a family errand, he discovers that there is more -- these ladies are all magicians, and have quietly escaped the boundaries placed by society.From there on, Clarke trips through a series of strange, fantastical stories: when a young newlywed finds that her rich hubby expects her to spin flax, she asks for help from a nasty little fairy, who will kidnap her if she doesn't guess his name. Think a Regency \\"Rumplestiltskin.\\"Then a young lady tries to regain her boyfriend from the mysterious \\"Mrs. Mabb\\"; a Duke changes his destiny with a pair of scissors and a needle; a Jewish doctor and a fairy nobleman travel through England; the Queen of Scots becomes fascinated by an embroidered figure; and a young pastor finds himself enmeshed with a cruel fairy lord. One of the stories is even set in the world of Neil Gaiman's \\"Stardust.\\"\\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories\\" is more fantasy and less history than the full-length novel, although it leans more heavily on history. But then, most of these short stories may not be in the same universe, and they range from whimsical little fluff pieces to almost-horror.Clarke still writes with the solid nineteenth-century style, flavoured with shimmering descriptions of \\"Pharisees\\" and odd creatures, although Clarke occasionally skimps on just what \\"goblin babies\\" look like.The second story is also amusingly written in much-mispelled English (\\"...lookes at me with his bewtiful Eyes...\\"), and Clarke peppers the other stories with older words like \\"shewed.\\"There are also some deeper moments, where Clarke approaches the lack of freedom given to women (magical or not) where they only have marriage to a well-off dullard to look forward to. And though the shorter stories are not much more than fables, the longer ones have intriguing characters who are likable in an understated way.\\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories\\" is a solid little collection, more whimsical than Clarke's first book. Very pleasant Regency \\"Pharisee\\" tales."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"This is a very nice book in which Clarke brings back the fantasy world she created for Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell (JS&N;). On the upside, it's a good complement to the aforementioned work, and allows readers to be mesmerized again by Clarke's delicious prose. On the downside, the stories are a little bit repetitive and never go to explore the depths that were covered in JS&N.; I deeply enjoyed JS&N; and have to confess that it took me a while to finish this book, because it didn\`t \\"call me\\" as much as I wanted.I would only suggest this book to those that read and enjoyed JS&N.; If you haven\`t read JS&N;, I suggest you try it before. I am not sure how much you will enjoy this work if you did not read the first one.Good read!"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"My first introduction to Susanna Clark and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed her book. Some clever wit likened the prose to 'Jane Austen meets the Grimm brothers' and I have to agree.This is a collection of eight good old-fashioned English fairy tales, written in a style and language that many Austen fans would recognise. Lovers of faerie and fantasy would appreciate the almost historical manner of their telling. Clark gives a new twist to the Rumpelstiltskin tale and Shakespeare's Queen Mab. She even sets one in a Neil Gaiman universe.Not everything is sunshine and rainbows; like Grimm's tales, there's a darker undercurrent afoot. Fairies are not the 'little people', or 'fair folk' we remember from childhood tales. They are lustful, mean-spirited and cunning. Their interactions with humans nearly always spell disaster for ordinary folk. But this book is far from that. It's a quick easy read, done in one long afternoon."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu is a collection of short stories that Susanna Clarke released as a follow-up to her first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. Clarke delivers a variety of tales in this collection, some based on previous tales (such as Rumpelstiltskin) and some of her own creation, all based on the land of Faerie. In this collection, she revisits Johnathan Strange, the Duke of Wellington, and even has a story that takes place in the world of Neil Gaiman's Wall.I recommend reading each story separately, as opposed to reading the book in one sitting. I give the book 5 stars, but only based on reading my copy in this same fashion, through a recommendation from someone else. I feel that the stories may loose something of their value if all read at the same time, as each of the stories basically deals with the same subject: the creatures of Faerie versus the people of the \\"real\\" world. While each story is unique of itself, since each story does in fact deal with something of the same subject each time, reading them altogether may be somewhat tedious.I enjoyed Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell and felt that this was a suitable follow-up. After reading The Ladies of Grace Adieu, I anxiously await Clarke to whisk me away again to land of Faerie with her next novel."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Being merely mortal, I will not attempt to accurately encompass the sublimity of this work with words; I have not the art.

A caveat: the Kindle version is execrable and should be avoided. There are bizarre spelling and format errors that ruin it entirely. Read the paper and ink version!"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"If you loved Harry Potter like I did, &#34;Jonathon Strange and Mr. Norrell&#34; is a must-read, a witty, compelling tale of dueling magicians for adults.

The strongest stories are, IMO, The Ladies of Grace Adieu, On Lickerish Hill, and Mr. Simonelli, or the Fairy Widower. In general I love Ms. Clarke's work & wish she would write more!"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I love Susanna Clarke and bought her book of short stories after reading Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell. The stories bring in some of the much-loved characters from that book as well as introducing new stories of wizards and the land of fairie. It both expands the lexicon from her initial book, giving it more depth, and provides new enjoyment for those who have not read it. It also gives us a glance into the lives of some women wizards, which is a fun change of pace."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Susanna Clarke's much-acclaimed 2004 novel Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell explored a world in which real English history and fairy folklore are deeply entwined, where magicians aided in the war against Napoleon and fairy lords intervened in mortal affairs to no good end. Since Clarke took ten years to write the novel, a sequel or follow-up was probably not going to appear soon, so author and publishers chose to release a collection of short stories as a stop-gap in 2006.The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories collects together eight short stories, all of them previously available (apart from the last one) and most of them set in the same alternate reality as Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (though one, 'The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse', actually takes place in the setting of Neil Gaiman's novel Stardust). For the most part the writing style is similar to that of the more celebrated novel, a mixture of whimsy and more serious themes played out with a writing style reminiscent of Victorian literature at its most elaborate although, thankfully, not its most verbose.The opening and titular story is about three women in a Gloucestershire village who meet Jonathan Strange. It was Clarke's first published story (appearing eight years before the novel) and is impressive in its confidence. In the novel, female characters were on the sidelines, but here take centre stage, to Strange's amusing befuddlement. There's some subtle characterisation and some interesting inversions of both 19th Century novels and fantasy books in general (particularly their treatment of women) and it's all extremely readable. 'On Lickerish Hill' entertains but is less successful, being a rather straightforward rewrite of a classic children's character for no real gain. 'Mrs. Mabb' returns to the theme of the role of women in Victorian literature, playing around with the stereotypical depiction of abused or suffering women as hysterical wretches, and is one of the more successful stories in the collection.'The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse' is fairly predictable, and its use of the Wall setting from Stardust feels unnecessary. 'Mr. Simonelli' is probably the highlight of the collection, featuring the titular character falling afoul of a fairy relative and having to save the five Gathercole sisters from the fairy's dubious carnal interests. The way the protagonists spar over high stakes whilst maintaining a polite and pleasant level of discourse recalls Jack Vance at his most creative. 'Tom Brightwind' is also amusing, featuring as it does a fairy/human double-act about whom more adventures could be told. 'Antickes and Frets' features Mary, Queen of Scots attempting to utilise magic to bring down her rival Elizabeth I from inside prison, to mixed results, and is one of the slighter stories in the book. Things conclude with 'John Uskglass', in which the titular, ultra-powerful character is brought low by a peasant (albeit one backed up by the firepower of some annoyed saints), which again amuses but little more.As a collection, The Ladies of Grace Adieu manages the tricky feat of retaining a common prose style (which it also shares with the novel) whilst injecting a variety of tone. Some of the stories are darker and more grim than others, whilst some are comedic or satirical. Clarke proves adept at using these different tones and creating interesting characters (none moreso than the Brightwind/Montefiore duo) and situations. A particular success here is pacing. Whilst Jonathan Strange was a five-star, 600-page masterpiece undone by being 950 pages long and featuring a long, agonisingly drawn-out ending that sapped the book of much of its narrative vigour, this collection is understated and concise, knowing when to end the story and move on. Whilst the stories cannot hope to match the epic scope and depth of the novel, they also reject some of its more obvious flaws, and show that Clarke is a skilled and interesting author (and, hopefully, one who is not too many more years away from unveiling her next full novel).The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories (****) is a fine companion-piece to Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, though it does not drift too far away from its setting or tone. It is available now in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I love folklore and fairytales, and I love strong female characters. So it's no surprise that I love love love The Ladies of Grade Adieu & Other Stories. This collection of eight short stories by Susanna Clarke puts a fresh, dark spin on the world of Faerie. Aside from the stellar writing, the beautifully executed illustrations by Charles Vess make this book a treasure.The characters in this book range from vengeful queens, to impish sprites, to the great Raven King himself. Even Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (from Susanna Clarke's previous novel) make an appearance in one tale. Each story is very different, yet so familiar because of the timeless folkloric style. If you've ever read one of Andrew Lang's fairy books (e.g. The Red Fairy Book), you would not be surprised to find any of these stories among them although are often written as memoirs and dialect.Although it is very difficult to choose a favorite, I really loved \\"On Lickerish Hill\\" and \\"Mrs. Mabb.\\" \\"On Lickerish Hill\\" tells the story of a young girl who marries abover her station and accomplishes magical tasks with the aid of a fairy. This particular one is actually based on a Suffolk tale called Tom Tim Tot, which is a variant along the lines of Rumplestiltskin. \\"Mrs. Mabb\\" tells the story of a young girl who seeks to wrest her intended from a faerie spell. Both have that fascinating mix of strangeness and familiarity that we find in the best fairytales-- the magic is so peculiar but the story feels like something the reader has known forever.I sincerely hope that more books like this become available. This blend of old-- dare I say, \\"olde\\"-- and new seems to be a trend in literature as we seek to refresh our favorite works. At this, Susanna Clarke is masterful, and The Ladies of Grace Adieu & Other Stories is a gem."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Susanna Clarke's epic fantasy novel \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" made a huge splash in the literary community, with her captivating brand of Jane Austen meets Neil Gaiman writing, with a nod to historical fiction. She focuses on the other equally magic folk, especially the female magicians who are not highly regarded in the chauvinistic arena, in this collection .I was entertained by the title story and also the last in the collection,\\"John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner\\" for the way much-loved characters from the previously mentioned novel are outwitted by the powers of the more lowly in station, especially by unassuming women, and at times, not even those with any magic.\\"Mrs Mabb\\", a story about how an ordinary young woman overcomes a mysterious and elusive love rival despite the odds not being in her favour, is one of the more intriguing stories in this collection. Elsewhere, there is the retelling of the Rumpelstiltskin tale in \\"On Lickerish Hill\\" and also Queen Mary of Scots's wicked embroidery for Queen Elizabeth in \\"Antickes and Frets\\", where the interesting mesh of fact and lore makes the stories come alive.Clarke handles the genre well, which can be a tall order, considering how she makes the magical seem ordinary and believeable, and showing that the magical world can exist alongside and in the real world, which makes these tales even more fantastical, and puts her above other run-of-the-mill fairy tales."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories by Susanna ClarkeBloomsbury, 2006235 pagesShort stories; fairy tale4.5/5 starsSource: LibrarySummary: A collection of short stories with magical elements and fairy tale aspects.Thoughts: I put this on my list after reading a great review of it and after remembering how much I enjoyed reading Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell (pre-blog with delightful footnotes!) I found the writing lovely, at some points reminiscent of Jane Austen (high praise from me!) I enjoyed the variety of style, tone, theme, and length in the stories. Now for a closer but brief look at each.The Ladies of Grace Adieu: Set in the universe of Jonathan Strange and apparently referenced in the book itself; this is about ladies using magic which was frowned on by Mr Norrell. I liked the ladies but not fantastic. 4/5On Lickerish Hill: Retelling of Rumpelstiltskin with archaic spelling that made it difficult to read thus only 3.5/5Mrs Mabb: A lady returns from nursing her friend to find that her beloved has fallen under the sway of Mrs. Mabb. She attempts to fight for him, despite the magical confusion around. I really felt for Venetia as she bravely fought for Captain Fox who she was certain had not abandoned her. 4.5/5The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse: Very short, set in the same world as Stardust. The Duke of Wellington plays with the thread of time and fate. 4/5Mr Simonelli or The Fairy Widower: Mr Simonelli is the new rector who ends up matching wits with a fairy lord and ensnaring himself in romantic entanglements; told through his journal entries, a format I really love. 5/5Tom Brightwind or How the Fairy Bridge Was Built at Thoresby: A Jew and a fairy king travel to Lincoln and end up constructing a bridge. 4.5/5Antickes and Frets: This is about Mary, Queen of Scots and her imprisonment by Elizabeth I. While she attempted to leave, she couldn't and used embroidery as a coping mechanism. 4/5John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner: Possibly my favorite. A charcoal burner lives in isolation and gets revenge on Fairy King John Uskglass multiple times; quite funny and very quick. 5/5Overall: Very enjoyable even without having read Jonathan Strange (I can barely remember anything about it) and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu is a collection of seven short stories, written by Susanna Clarke. Clarke is the author of one of my favorite books, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. She is a very clever writer, writing in the style of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen, and her words are always a delight to read. This anthology features fairy tales, but not in the traditional setting.\\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu\\" is the title story from this collection. Its characters are, on the surface, three simple ladies of the times, that is to say that they're quiet, subservient, obedient, perfect in their manners, ignorant, and occasionally witty, but never clever. No, it is unseemly for a lady to do magic. Why, heaven forbid a woman should learn!This story was short and featured a cameo by Jonathan Strange and his lovely wife, Arabella. They take a trip to Grace Adieu, where a few odd things happen. This piece was filled with humorous jabs at the old culture, and it indeed was fun to see Strange again.\\"On Lickerish Hill\\" is told in an amusing, but sometimes confusing, Suffolk dialect. I had to read it a bit slower to fully understand what was going on, but in the end the tale was very much like a classic folk tale of fairy mischief. This was my least favorite story in the collection, probably because the dialect was rather difficult to read and get into.\\"Mrs Mabb\\" is the story about love. Venetia, a lonely girl who's one true love, Captain Fox, is heartbroken and angry. Fox was bewitched by that wretched but beautiful Mrs Mabb. Venetia tries to locate Mabb's residence and win her betrothed back, but she always receives different directions to the house. Whenever she does attempt to find the house, peculiar things always befall her.This story kept me reading until the end. I was quite captivated to discover the truth behind Mrs Mabb and see what would become of Venetia's and Captain Fox's love.\\"The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse\\" is a short tale, but still entertaining. The magic is simple and pleasant.\\"Mr Simonelli or the Fairy Widower\\" was the second longest story in the book, but very intriguing. The tale is about the scholarly Mr Simonelli, who has just become the Rector of Allhope house. There he finds five beautiful young women, a strange but likeable neighbor, a small salary, and some dangerous mystery. This tale is told through journal entries, and I really liked it very much. Quite whimsical, I daresay. Quite.\\"Tom Brightwind, or How the Fairy Bridge was Built at Thoresby\\" is the longest tale in this collection, coming in at 43 pages. This story was delightful. It had me laughing; it had me speculating; it had me in its grip. This tale relates a peculiar incident between the Jewish physician, David Montefiore, and his fairy friend, Tom Brightwind. It read exactly like a footnote from JS&MN;, and I loved it.\\"Antickes and Frets\\" is a story about Mary, Queen of Scots. The story is about Mary being held captive by her cousin, Queen Elizabeth. She attempts to find ways to enact revenge, but things rarely go as planned. This tale was entertaining and had me laughing a few times at some of the Queen of Scots actions.The last story, \\"John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner\\" is another short one, but definitely my favorite from the whole lot. Absolutely hysterical, plus a good bit of English magic involved, too. The Cumbrian charcoal burner lives alone in the woods with his pet pig, Blakeman. One day he's interrupted by a hunting party, who tears up his wood and runs away. One hunter stays behind, and vengeance plus hilarity ensues. This story also is great for anyone that wants to read a little more about the mysterious John Uskglass (you'll know him from JS&MN;).Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It fit right in line with the writing style and plot devices of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, and I loved it. If you've got a hankering to read some old Faerie mischief tales, then I easily recommend you pick up The Ladies of Grace Adieu. It is no sequel at all to Clarke's debut novel, and in fact only one or two stories feature any familiar characters. Actually, if you're just looking for a very quick and entertaining read, check out the book, especially \\"John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner.\\" Once again, if you've not read JS&MN;, you should add the book to your TBR list immediately."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"In this first collection of short stories, Susanna Clarke returns to the world she created in her first novel, the excellent \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\", with more stories about the world of Faerie and England. Jonathan Strange visits his wife's brother in the town of Grace Adieu and discovers there three women who secretly practice magic and deal with any menaces that come to their town with strict severity. A re-telling of the folk tale \\"Tom Tit Tot\\" is the basis for \\"On Lickerish Hill\\" where Clarke employs rural dialect in the telling of a young woman who, in return for a favour from a faerie, must guess his name within one month or else she will become his.My favourite was probably \\"Mr Simonelli, or The Faerie Widower\\" which is about a priest called Mr Simonelli who goes to the town of Allhope to be the new rector there and finds that the town is ruled by a mysterious fellow who lives outside the town in a ramshackle house, whose name is John Hollyshoes. The setting and the air of desolation within an isolated countryside town brought to mind the work of the Bronte sisters, especially Emily, and adds to the atmosphere of blasted heaths and doomed country folk. Who will help them? Mr Simonelli to the rescue! I thought this story was most effective as even though it's set within Clarke's world of faeries and magic and England in the regency period, it stands apart from her novel and could be read by somone unfamiliar with her work and still enjoy it.\\"Tom Brightwind, or How the Fairy Bridge was Built at Thoresbury\\" is another cracking read as is \\"Mrs Mabb\\" both of which feel like they had been cut from Clarke's novel and resurrected here but are still pleasures to read nonetheless. The shorter stories, \\"The Duke of Wellington Misplaces his Horse\\" and \\"Antickes and Frets\\", are both about embroidery and are the less energised of the tales but fit in well between the longer tales as breathers. Both stories are about real people as well, the Duke of Wellington and Mary, Queen of Scots.There are eight stories in this collection (more! more!) and the first seven have been published before, though I'm glad they were reprinted in this volume as I had no idea that she had had published short stories. The eighth is an unpublished story called \\"John Uskglass and the Charcoal Burner\\" which is about a charcoal burner and his pig Blakemore who thwart John Uskglass, The King of the North, and shows Clarke's comedic side in putting down probably the coolest character in her world.As for the illustrations, they are a wonder, I am going to see about getting some books by Charles Vess, so wonderfully does he draw. And the cover of this book! So eye catching, so classy, so understated yet outstanding! In design and spirit they recall Aubrey Beardley's iconic work. One of the best designed covers I've seen this year.Clarke writes about magic but she needs none to enchant the reader, using only her skill as a writer and her unique imagination to burn the story into your mind and float into your dreams. A highly recommended read and I'm not the only one who hopes that the sequel to \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" won't take her nearly as long as her first book (which I think was around ten years).

These fascinating stories are set in the same England as Susanna Clarke's bestselling novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and the talented author skillfully portrays once again a nineteenth century England where faeries live among humans and where magic is present everywhere. In these spellbinding stories, Susanna Clarke explores the relationship between humans and faeries, showing the reader how the presence of faeries influences humans in different ways.Here's more about the eight stories:The Ladies of Grace Adieu tells the story of three ladies who live in Grace Adieu and who deal with Jonathan Strange and his brother-in-law in their own way, using their magical powers to achieve what they want.On Lickerish Hill is narrated in Suffolk dialect and is a wonderful retelling of the Rumpelstiltskin story where a young wife seeks the help of a faerie creature so she can fulfill her husband's demands.Mrs Mabb deals with a young woman whose financ&eacute; has been enchanted by the Faerie Queen. The young woman is determined to find her finac&eacute; who is being held prisoner in Mrs Mabb's house, but there are many obstacles standing in her way.The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse was inspired by Neil Gaiman's Stardust and it's one of my favorite stories. It is set in a village called Wall, which happens to be situated near the wall that separates the human world from Faerie. This funny story shows the reader how the Duke of Wellington accidentally enters the world of Faerie, nearly not surviving his visit.Mr Simonelli or the Fairy Widower is a story about a clergyman who finds out that he is related to a powerful fairy lord. In order to rescue the community from his fairy cousin, the clergyman has to match his fairy wits against his relation.Tom Brightwind or How the Fairy Bridge Was Built at Thoresby gives an account of the adventures of Tom (the fairy prince) and David (the Jewish doctor). This story particularly explores the relationship between humans and faeries.Antickes and Frets is one of my favorite stories as it deals with the vengeful Mary, Queen of Scots, who tries to harm Queen Elizabeth by using magical embroidery.John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner tells the story of John Uskglass (also known as the Raven King) who is harassed by a charcoal burner. This simple man seeks revenge against the Raven King by calling upon various saints.The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories has all the right ingredients of great fairy tales - vengeful owls, dark woods, houses that never appear the same way twice and ladies who embroider terrible destinies. Our heroes and heroines have to overcome many obstacles and they have to be careful, as Faerie is a dangerous and wild place!This wonderful collection is packed with vivid character portraits, wit and intelligence. In addition to that, the author's original and beautiful writing style will enchant readers and will make them long for more. The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories is certainly a remarkable collection of stories that will sweep you away and astound you. Be prepared to be taken on an unforgettable journey into the magical world of faeries where nothing is quite as it seems.What I really liked about these stories was the fact that Susanna Clarke has managed to capture so many different relationships - the relationship between sisters, parents, friends, but also the relationship between humans and faeries. The characters are very charming and you can't help but feel sympathetic to them. But what is probably the most attractive thing when it comes to this collection of stories is the author's writing style. It's so unique and masterful and it will remind you of Jane Austen's prose as both are highly formal and witty. Furthermore, Susanna Clarke offers the reader a number of different viewpoints, thus, achieving a various number of effects that will most certainly appeal to readers who appreciate an eminent storytelling.Nonetheless, The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories will not appeal to everyone, as not everyone will delight in this sort of genre. However, this collection of magical stories will certainly make Neil Gaiman fans and fantasy lovers happy, as they will adore Susanna Clarke's distinctive and bewitching voice! As for my part, I must say that I just loved The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories and I can't wait to read Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in the near future. Susanna Clarke is now one of my favorite authors and I am looking forward to reading more works by this marvelous author! I have never read anything like this before and I think that's why I found The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories so special and captivating!"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The ladies of Grace Adieu and other Stories introduces readers to a world where charm is always tempered by eeriness and picaresque comedy is always darkened by the disturbing shadow of magic.

I did not think I would like this book, because I usually don't care for short srories. However, I became so hungry for a little more magic that I broke down and bought this book. I am so glad I did! Many of the characters that we came to love in Strange & Norrell reappear in this book and we learn some more detail on many of the people to whom we were previously introduced through footnotes.

I LOVED Jonathon Strange and Mr. Norrell, and was grieving when I completed the book--what could I possibly read following such a fanstastic fantasy? Well, continue your jouney through Clarke's England and Faerie with these stories. I can't wait to see what Clarke publishes next."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Susanna Clarke made a dazzling debut with \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\\" which was the sort of fantasy story that Jane Austen would have written, had she lived around magic and fey.Still fresh from her first bestseller, she presents a new array of captivating stories in \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu.\\" But expect it to be more whimsical and varied, rather than a sprawling fantasy-historical epic -- these are more like nuggets.The title story takes place in the magical Regency period of her debut: dull Mr. Field remarries after his wife died, and his pretty second wife, his niece, and a friend soon become good friends. When Mr. Strange passes by on a family errand, he discovers that there is more -- these ladies are all magicians, and have quietly escaped the boundaries placed by society.From there on, Clarke trips through a series of strange, fantastical stories: when a young newlywed finds that her rich hubby expects her to spin flax, she asks for help from a nasty little fairy, who will kidnap her if she doesn't guess his name. Think a Regency \\"Rumplestiltskin.\\"Then a young lady tries to regain her boyfriend from the mysterious \\"Mrs. Mabb\\"; a Duke changes his destiny with a pair of scissors and a needle; a Jewish doctor and a fairy nobleman travel through England; the Queen of Scots becomes fascinated by an embroidered figure; and a young pastor finds himself enmeshed with a cruel fairy lord. One of the stories is even set in the world of Neil Gaiman's \\"Stardust.\\"\\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories\\" is more fantasy and less history than the full-length novel, although it leans more heavily on history. But then, most of these short stories may not be in the same universe, and they range from whimsical little fluff pieces to almost-horror.Clarke still writes with the solid nineteenth-century style, flavoured with shimmering descriptions of \\"Pharisees\\" and odd creatures, although Clarke occasionally skimps on the more exotic descriptions -- just what do \\"goblin babies\\" look like? The second story is also amusingly written in much-mispelled English (\\"...lookes at me with his bewtiful Eyes...\\"), and Clarke peppers the other stories with older words like \\"shewed.\\"There are also some deeper moments, where Clarke approaches the lack of freedom given to women (magical or not) where they only have marriage to a well-off dullard to look forward to. And though the shorter stories are not much more than fables, the longer ones have intriguing characters who are likable in an understated way -- including some very familiar, quirky ones.\\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories\\" is a solid little collection, more whimsical than Clarke's first book. Very pleasant Regency \\"Pharisee\\" tales, from a modern master."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Good things come not only in small packages but sometimes in unique ones as well. The first thing a reader of Susanna Clarke's latest work, THE LADIES OF GRACE ADIEU, will notice is that the publisher flaunted contemporary convention by offering this hardcover without the obligatory dust jacket. The cover image is pressed directly onto the book: viney pink flowers on a dark gray background. The design immediately sets the book apart. And once the cover is opened and the spine cracked, the contents will surely continue to surprise and please readers.THE LADIES OF GRACE ADIEU is written in the same genre-challenging prose of Clarke's previous bestselling book, JONATHAN STRANGE & MR NORRELL. It is not historical drama, though it's mostly set in 18th and 19th century England. It is not quite fantasy, though it's mostly concerned with magical and mystical creatures. And it's not a collection of fairy tales, though it's concerned with fairies. Or, more properly, Sidhe, as we are told in the introduction by Professor James Sutherland (another character of Clarke's). The Sidhe, Sutherland explains, \\"impinge upon our quotidian world\\" and Clarke's tales \\"create a sort of primer to Faerie and fairies.\\"All the stories are whimsical yet have a dark and deadly serious undercurrent; they are about the romance and appeal of magic but also its danger. Some tales in the collection are, of course, more successful than others. The title story is one of the best; in it, readers meet three women in the small village of Grace Adieu in Gloucestershire.These ladies are more powerful than they first appear and wise in traditional magic and the ways of the Raven King. When the famed and charming magician Jonathan Strange shows up in the village, they challenge him in unexpected ways. More importantly, they are able to thwart the evil plans of Captain Winbright, the legal guardian of young Ursula and Flora, with whom Miss Tobias, one of the three titular ladies, is charged with raising. This first tale sets the stage for the rest: a world of spells and magic, enchanted woods and houses, figures both charming and diabolical. Even Mary, Queen of Scots makes an appearance.Clarke's writing is beautiful and engaging, and her stories blend wit and darkness. However, while all the tales and characters are interesting, they are not always very original (Clarke's version of Rumpelstiltskin, for example). Furthermore, they are often just too short. It would be lovely to be able to lose yourself in these fantastic and colorful tales, but the book offers eight stories in fewer than 250 pages. Once you begin to get swept up in the plot and setting, it is off to the next.Still, THE LADIES OF GRACE ADIEU is very readable and quite enchanting overall. Charles Vess's Victorian line drawing illustrations lend to the specialness of the volume. If nothing else, this book will keep Clarke's readers happy until her next full-length novel and create some new fans along the way. Her voice is unique and hard to define, and it might stray a bit too far off the beaten path to make this book recommendable to all readers. But those seeking literary adventure and huge imagination, coupled with a precise and unforgettable writing style, will find much to enjoy here.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"from the very first paragraph we were enchanted...dear lovers of faery lore and magic,... by these stories written by the author ofJonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell: A Novel. If you loved that book, which these elves did, you will surely enjoy these charming stories, written in the same period and of the same cloth, so to speak. The first and title story involves Jonathan Strange and the Ladies of Grace Adieu and the last the Raven King, and between them the book is filled with magic, the sidhe (faery folk) and beautiful writing, which is a great magic in itself. We hope she writes more, much, much more.kyela,the silver elves"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"For those who have read _Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_: This book is essentially a collection of short stories of the same kind as the various snippets included as footnotes in _Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_, but of greater length -- not so much a sequel as a collection of spin-off tales. It even includes at least one story referred to in that book but never detailed therein (the tale of John Uskglass and the Cumbrian charcoal burner). Only one of the stories features either Strange or Norell as characters, but all of them (with the possible exception of \\"The Duke of Wellington Misplaces his Horse,\\" which is set in or perhaps overlaps with, the setting of Neil Gaiman's _Stardust_) are set in and flesh out the same world. All share the same dryly witty, intelligent, intellectually charming writing style that made the prior novel so worthwhile. In some ways, this collection shows more technical expertise than _Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_, because the stories include a number of different viewpoints, use different stylistic devices, and achieve a different range of effects than found in the novel. The author has a wider range to play with here, outside the limits of a single novel's plotline, and she takes excellent advantage of that.For those who have not:If you like Jane Austen, have a strong taste for 18th or 19th century fiction or fantasy stories, like Neil Gaiman's _Stardust_ or Lord Dunsany's works, or find the thought of an mix of those two sources appealing, this book will probably appeal to you very strongly and I recommend it highly. It may be the first original short-story collection in a very long time to draw upon the same tradition as the old classics like Howard Pyle's _Wonder Clock_ or the old Andrew Lang _[color] Fairy Books_, with the exception and improvement that this story collection has its own sensibility, style, and manner -- this is not a random medley of folk tales, but a deliberate product of a skilled writer working to create a specific fantasy milieu. It would be relatively accurate to describe the book as a collection, not of \\"fairy tales,\\" but of recorded, historical stories about fairies from a world whose history ran (mostly) parallel to our own, but with slightly more magic.Most of the stories are written with a dry, highly mannered wit, very reminiscent of Jane Austen's writing style -- a deliberate conciet, I'm sure, and very well executed (One of the stories in the collection is an exception, a version of a classic fairy tale written in period Suffolk dialect; it may be the best-executed of the lot).This is \\"historical fiction\\" of a very specific kind. Only two stories feature historical characters (\\"The Duke of Wellington Misplaces his Horse\\" and \\"Antickes and Frets,\\" which concerns Mary Queen of Scots), but the setting, tone, and style are all set in the 18th or 19th centuries and executed as if the stories were written by period authors. This is not the sort of \\"historical fiction\\" where someone writes a modern thriller and throws a bunch of historical names into the pot as minor characters -- it is historical fiction written (mostly) as if written during the time period wherein the stories were set -- one of them even is even an epistolary story, taking the form of a series of period journal entries and letters.I don't mean to imply that these stories are derivative, or exact replicas of old fairy tales, or that the style merely mimics Austen's, etc. All of those sources are drawn upon, but a remarkably modern synthesis is achieved -- this is very clearly a modern work, and there are definitely places where sex, violence, and all the other things modern audiences desire show through the mannered veneer of style and tone. But the mannered, wit-charged tone, the period conceits, etc., all are expertly utilized; the reader is left with a definite impression that all of these stories are part of an extant, coherent, and compelling world. Everything in each story fits together, and all of the stories fit together into a whole - even if none of the plotlines intersect, they all hang together in the same general web.I would not recommend this book to everyone. Some people just aren't going to go for this sort of thing. But if you like any of the stylistic sources on which the author draws, or if you appreciate an author with a clever, unique style, or if you just like masterful writing, then you will almost certainly regret not purchasing a copy of this book. It is hard to imagine this sort of fantasy/historical fiction hybrid being executed more masterfully by anyone. If you read this book and like it, you'll almost certainly find yourself purchasing the novel as well.A final word on the illustrations: Charles Vess's line-drawing illustrations provide an excellent accompaniment to the text, both in tone and in richness of detail. They achieve much the same sort of balance that the text does,such that the viewer simultaneously realizes they are not period illustrations but is, at the same time, given the impression that could have been."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The eight short stories in this collection are set in the same England as Clarke's popular novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell (which I have not read), an England in which magic is at least nominally present and faeries are human-like creatures with very considerable powers. All but one of the stories, which range in length from a few pages to 45 pages, have been previously published over the last ten years in various anthologies such as Starlight 1, 2, and 3, and Black Swan, White Raven and Black Heart, Ivory Bones.Although the leadoff story, which gives the book it's title, concerns Dr. Strange and a trio of witches, the bulk of the stories (and certainly the more memorable ones), revolve around the capricious doings of various powerful fairies. A somewhat less powerful fairy is at the heart of he second story, \\"On Likerish Hill\\", which riffs on the Rumplestilsken story. The third story, \\"Mrs. Mabb\\", is an excellent old-fashioned tale about a poor young woman whose fiancee has been ensorcelled by a fairy queen. \\"The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse,\\" is a comic interlude featuring the famous hero of the Peninsular and Napoleonic Wars, and how he survives an accidental visit the the Fairy Kingdom.Another longer, and somewhat more engaging story is \\"Mr. Simonelli or the Fairy Widower\\", in which a Cambridge scholar turned local rector matches wits with the local fairy lord. Another long and fairly decent story is \\"Tom Brightwind or How the Fairy Bridge...,\\" in which a Jewish doctor and fairy lord making their way cross-country stumble upon a village severely in need of a bridge. What happens is somewhat obvious, but it's a story well told. The seventh story, \\"Antickes and Frets\\" is a somewhat perfunctory one about Mary Queen of Scots and some magical embroidery. The final story, which appears here for the first time, is the brief \\"John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner\\". It's another classic story, this time of a lowly woodsman taking on a fairy lord, matching prayers to the saints again fairy magic.On the whole, the collection should be of great interest to fans of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and of intermittent interest to those unfamiliar with Clarke's work. The prose is generally highly formal and stylized, which matches the tone of the stories but becomes somewhat tiresome over the course of a book. Similarly, the plots of the various stories often cover the same ground (humans matching wits with fairies), so that reading the book straight through becomes a touch tedious. Taken individually, each story has something to recommend it, and I suspect that they would feel much more distinctive in their original appearances, alongside the works of many different kinds of writers. in that vein, perhaps the best way to approach this book is to read a story of month or so, mixing it up with other kinds of reading so that Clarke's voice retains its distinctive nature."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The moment I finished Susanna Clarke's wonderful first novel \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\", I wished that there was more of it. It was a long wait, but finally the fans of Clarke's magically-soaked nineteenth-century Britain have a sequel - of sorts. Clarke presents eight short stories concerned with the presence of Faerie in England, and its influence on human inhabitants, all set in the same universe (with the same magical structure) as her previous work. However, it's more of a companion piece than a sequel, considering it does not continue the story told in her novel, but expands on several of its ideas and subplots.This is particularly the case in the title story, \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu\\", in which we find out why Jonathan Strange was so eager to remove his brother-in-law from the province of Gloucestershire (as mentioned in footnote 2, chapter 43 of \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\"). The ladies in question are Mrs Field and her step-niece Miss Cassandra Parbringer, who are close friends with Miss Tobias, a young governess who is the warden of two young heiresses in a wealthy estate. When the women are confronted by both a gold-digging young captain and a suspicious Jonathan Strange, they take matters into their own hands - calling up their own magical arts.It is a mysterious, charming and beautifully written story, capturing what her fans love best about Clarke's work: her delicate prose, her sense of humour, her grasp of the darker side of Faerie, and her refusal to tell the reader everything. Instead, we are given precisely what we need to make sense of the story, whilst many of the details are left mysteriously obscure. It is also the story that is most dependent on a reader's prior familiarity with \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\", and though it is not essential that the masterwork be read first, it's certainly recommended.\\"On Lickerish Hill\\" is an intriguing retelling of the Rumplestiltskin story, told in first-person narrative by a young wife who secures the help of a faerie-creature in completing the demands set to her by her husband. But can she pay the price demanded of her? Its most memorable feature is its use of Suffolk dialect to tell the tale. Here's an example of the prose used in the opening sentence:\\"When I waz a child I lived at Dr Quince's on the other side of Lickerish Hill. Sometimes in a winters-twilight I have look't out of Dr Quince's windowe and seen Lickerish Hill (where the Pharisees live) like a long brown shippe upon a grey sea and I have seen far-awaie lights like silver stares among the dark trees.\\"The third story again pits a young woman against the tricky and selfish nature of Faerie, in the bittersweet and sometimes disturbing \\"Mrs Mabb\\". This time, a young woman called Venetia Moore is on the hunt for her lost love after the elusive Mrs Mabb steals him away. Hearing different accounts of her rival wherever she goes, Venetia goes on the hunt for the house in which she believes her sweetheart is being held prisoner, whilst her family worries for her personal sanity. With some creepy examples of memory-loss and the world bending into Faerie before one's eyes, Clarke certainly presents a feisty and brave young heroine, one prepared to brave the perils of a powerful faerie to win her beloved back.\\"The Duke of Wellington Misplace his Horse\\" is a story of particular interest to anyone who has read Neil Gaiman's \\"Stardust\\", a story set in a village called Wall that was situated (aptly enough) near the wall that separates our world from Faerie. In this mostly-humourous tale, the Duke of Wellington chases his horse Copenhagen into Faerie where he happens upon a cottage. Inside is a young woman, embroidering a rather remarkable tapestry...The next two stories are the longest ones to be found in the collection, and consequently my favourites, since Clarke has plenty of time and space to develop certain aspects of the story. \\"Mr Simonelli or The Fairy Widower\\" is told in journal-form by Mr Simonelli himself, who has been tricked by a rival-colleague of Corpus Christi College to accept an unsuitable position as clergyman in the country. He has not long arrived when he finds himself introduced to the enigmatic John Hollyshoes, a hitherto unknown relation to Simonelli. Finally understanding where his foreign appearance comes from, Simonelli sets himself against his fairy cousin, matching his fairy wits against his cousin's in order to secure the safety of his newfound community.\\"Tom Brightwind: How the Fairy Bridge was Built at Thoresby\\" chronicles one of the adventures of the fairy-prince Tom and his unlikely friend David Montefiore, a Jewish physician. When David is called away to a patient, Tom tags along and the two are sidetracked at the village of Thoresby, which is in desperate need of a bridge. Tom takes up the challenge, promising to build the bridge in one night (whilst paying a visit to the magistrate's barren wife). It is a wonderful story about the personality of faeries and their relationship with both other faeries and human beings. Furthermore, it once more makes use of Clarke's famous footnotes, which are tidbits of knowledge scattered throughout \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" and always fun to divulge in.\\"Antickes and Frets\\" explores the life of Mary Queen of Scots after her imprisonment and her dangerous game of cat and mouse with both Queen Elizabeth and the new mistress of her jail-house, Countess Shrewsbury. Although it's an interesting magical spin on the monarch's life, it has little to do with Faerie itself, save in the character of the Countess. Presumably she's a witch or sorceress of some kind, but in this case Clarke's decision to leave certain aspects of the tale untold is more frustrating than aptly enigmatic.Finally, Clarke uses the core concept from her previous novel as the centre of the last story: John Uskglass, also known as the Raven King. \\"John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner\\" pits the king of all magicians, the mortal child who was raised by fairies, the most powerful medium between earth and Faerie against a simple charcoal burner who calls upon various saints to seek revenge against the perceived slights done upon him by John Uskglass. It's not the strongest story in the collection, and sadly the enigmatic and powerful Raven King is (being the butt of the joke in this particular story) is sold a little short, and not at all the character as he appeared in \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\".What makes Clarke's stories (and novel) so appealing is her attention to scholarly detail. For example, all of the short stories are preceded by an introduction by (the fictional) Professor James Sutherland, Director of Sidhe Studies at the University of Aberdeen, who has organised this collection for our benefit, in the hopes that it will shed further light on the relationship between Faerie and humanity in this period. He mentions the work of other scholars in his field, the disagreements that arise in interpreting certain fairy lore, and the possible discrepancy between reality and the stories told (according to him, Mr Simonelli's journals should be read with a pinch of salt, considering that Simonelli abridged them several times). All of the work is given context in either history or folklore, and is often footnoted, which of course gives it a realistic depth that makes you feel as though the world of faerie really is being studied! Clarke doesn't just present Faerie, but the imaginary research that goes on by scholars *into* Faerie, and it makes her stories even more enjoyable to read.Clarke doesn't just write fantasy, as her character portraits are vivid and sympathetic (though obviously not quite as in-depth in short stories), as are the human relations found throughout the stories. Friends, parents, sisters, rivals, family members - all these relationship are wonderfully captured throughout, between both human and faerie individuals. She's also quite a humourous author, and is obviously a fan of Jane Austen's precise, delicate prose. Clarke perfectly captures the form and feel of an Austen novel, and the manners and decorum of a Jane Austen novel is perfectly balanced against the wildness and danger of Faerie.This collection is a wonderful companion piece to \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\", and once again whets my appetite for even more stories from this talented author. Definitely recommended, even to those who don't usually read fantasy.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell: A Novel"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Do not buy this book for Kindle, the editing is so poor that it becomes effectively unreadable. I have found this to be a slight problem with other ebooks but never so bad as this. I will try to obtain a refund."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu was a pleasant read. The fairy tale stories were literally fairy tales, and a completely revolutionary idea that I think deserves praise. Although the book was not as good as Jonathan Strange as Mr. Norrel (ironically, although JS and Mr.N was around 800 pages and this is a quarter of that, I felt like these stories dragged on more than the novel's). But, in all respect, Susanna Clarke has the potential to be on the best writers of our time. Her sceneries are beautifully crafted, her ideas unimaginably good, and the depth of her vocabulary is tremendous. She is truly a great writer, and I think is one of only two authors who have effectively been able to convey magical life to the public. The only other author is also a female and English (and a billionaire if it has any relevance). Clarke has complete control of her writing style, it is unimaginably well developed and her own, and has made the epic novel something enjoyable. Read her, I really hope you agree."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I first read The Ladies of Grace Adieu in hardcover many years ago and enjoyed it greatly. Unfortunately, I've found that the Kindle edition is simply sloppily edited. While readable, typos do abound. This becomes a particular problem for a book that frequently employs unorthodox or antiquated spellings. I love my Kindle, but I would have appreciated more care from the editors responsible for this version."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"With \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories,\\" Susanna Clarke weaves history, legend and myth to give us one of the best collections of supernatural tales since the days of Arthur Conan Doyle and Joseph Sheridan LeFanu. Each of her stories contains a hearty dose of magic, mystery, melancholic atmosphere and witty dialogue, all of which combine to cast their own spell over the reader.Clearly Ms. Clarke has done her research, as evinced by the numerous details and nuances given the Otherworld and its inhabitants. Many of the tales show the firm influence of her predecessors in the genre as well. Her story \\"Mr. Simonelli or the Fairie Widower\\" gives a strong nod to Mr. LeFanu's \\"Laura Silver Bell\\". There are also homages to Mr. Gaiman and John Aubrey. However, it must be said that each of these improves on the original in terms of scope, detail and entertainment value. Lady Wilde and Lady Gregory would be proud!All in all, this collection is a delight which kept me reading up until the wee hours of the morning. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"This rather slight collection of short stories by the author of _Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell_ is certainly not slight in terms of quality. The writing is consistently good, her subjects are in harmony with that of _Jonathan Strange_, and the styles are delightful.I say \`styles' because there is just a touch of variety in this little volume. The title story, \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu\\" is very much in the mock-history voice of _Jonathan Strange_, tempered by what seems a touch of Jane Austen and a healthy dash of a Victorian or Edwardian worldview. It seems that Strange and Norrell may not have been the only magicians in England.\\"On Lickerish Hill,\\" a dialect piece, demonstrates Ms. Clarke's background in folklore and ability to write good dialect, but really isn't quite as much fun as the other stories. Ms. Clarke's voice is too delightful to suffer its loss under a veneer of unkempt grammar and pronunciation.\\"Mrs. Mabb\\" and \\"Mr. Simonelli or the Fairy Widower\\" strongly parallel the style of late 19th to early 20th. century stories of the supernatural, a variety of story offered by such practitioners as Amelia Edwards and E.F. Benson, with \\"Mrs. Mabb\\" also echoing a bit of Austen.\\"Tom Brightwind: How the Fairy Bridge was Built at Thoresby\\" mirrors the world of Jonathan Strange perfectly. It features another totally capricious fairy creature, one whose acts happen to prove rather more benevolent than those of _Jonathan Strange's_ \`man with the thistledown hair.'The briefer stories, \\"The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse,\\" \\"Antickes and Frets,\\" and \\"John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner\\" all hold the qualities of the footnotes and derived tales found in _Jonathan Strange_.The title story and the \`Fairy Bridge' story strike me as the best in the collection, though all were quite worth reading. Clarke's writing demonstrates a wonderful sense of pace, as I find myself lingering over Clarke's stories and stopping at curious moments just so I will have the pleasure of picking the book up again. There is little rush to see what will happen; the journey is the reward. I claimed Clarke's mock historical style the high point of _Jonathan Strange_. Now I am not so certain - it may be the leisurely, almost Victorian (yet never ponderous) pacing is the strongest element, the one most responsible for the half-smiles and gentle chuckles that appear as I read her words"},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"I greatly enjoyed \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel\\", and this book is certainly more of the same good stuff. I am rather disappointed, however, at the number of apparent typos in the Kindle Edition. It seems to have been scanned using some poor OCR software, and not subsequently reviewed.For instance, \\"Before the Raven King was a Icing at all\\". Clearly, \\"Ic\\" ought to be a \\"K\\". This is just one example. Other random letters and numbers appear in the middle of words, and I'm not sure that all the paragraph and page breaks are where they're supposed to be.How does this happen? A single read-through should have caught most of these errors. They're really distracting."},{"Title":"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories","review":"Susanna Clarke made a dazzling debut with \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\\" which was the sort of fantasy story that Jane Austen would have written, had she lived around magic and fey.Still fresh from her first bestseller, she presents a new array of captivating stories in \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu.\\" But expect it to be more whimsical and varied, rather than a sprawling fantasy-historical epic -- these are more like nuggets.The title story takes place in the magical Regency period of her debut: dull Mr. Field remarries after his wife died, and his pretty second wife, his niece, and a friend soon become good friends. When Mr. Strange passes by on a family errand, he discovers that there is more -- these ladies are all magicians, and have quietly escaped the boundaries placed by society.From there on, Clarke trips through a series of strange, fantastical stories: when a young newlywed finds that her rich hubby expects her to spin flax, she asks for help from a nasty little fairy, who will kidnap her if she doesn't guess his name. Think a Regency \\"Rumplestiltskin.\\"Then a young lady tries to regain her boyfriend from the mysterious \\"Mrs. Mabb\\"; a Duke changes his destiny with a pair of scissors and a needle; a Jewish doctor and a fairy nobleman travel through England; the Queen of Scots becomes fascinated by an embroidered figure; and a young pastor finds himself enmeshed with a cruel fairy lord. One of the stories is even set in the world of Neil Gaiman's \\"Stardust.\\"\\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories\\" is more fantasy and less history than the full-length novel, although it leans more heavily on history. But then, most of these short stories may not be in the same universe, and they range from whimsical little fluff pieces to almost-horror.Clarke still writes with the solid nineteenth-century style, flavoured with shimmering descriptions of \\"Pharisees\\" and odd creatures, although Clarke occasionally skimps on the more exotic descriptions -- just what do \\"goblin babies\\" look like? The second story is also amusingly written in much-mispelled English (\\"...lookes at me with his bewtiful Eyes...\\"), and Clarke peppers the other stories with older words like \\"shewed.\\"There are also some deeper moments, where Clarke approaches the lack of freedom given to women (magical or not) where they only have marriage to a well-off dullard to look forward to. And though the shorter stories are not much more than fables, the longer ones have intriguing characters who are likable in an understated way -- including some very familiar, quirky ones.\\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories\\" is a solid little collection, more whimsical than Clarke's first book. Very pleasant Regency \\"Pharisee\\" tales, from a modern master."},{"Title":"McClane's New Standard Fishing Encyclopedia and International Angling Guide","review":"I have been an avid reader of A.J.

It is written with grace and eloquence and yes with a bit of passion for the subject as well! It probably cannot be used as a stand alone textbook since it lacks the rigour and depth of standard textbooks. However, it is a perfect adjunct to any QM class. The book uses the Dirac notation from the beginning, much like the books by Townsend, Shankar and Sakurai (a couple of these are graduate level books). As such it will not follow the typical undergraduate's class experience if books such as Griffins are used. As with most books the problems are an integral part of the book and of your education. For the most part these are not untractable and hints and solutions are given for some.If you are planning on taking QM in the fall then you have enough mathematics to tackle this on your own (perhaps the summer prior to the first QM class). And if one puts the effort much can be gained from this little book. Also, since Dover is the publisher the price is not unreasonable."},{"Title":"Primer of Quantum Mechanics","review":"A good and relatively easy introduction to Dirac notation for quantum mechanics. Very suitable for self study--I have worked through all of it, including all the problems. Most of the problems are an integral part of the text, but there are solutions to many and hints for many of the others. Should be suitable also for an undergraduate text in quantum mechanics. As an example of his method, Chester treats EPR in a general and apparently original manner, i.e. he uses neither the formulation in the EPR paper nor Bohm's--in most treatments the latter is most common (and certainly easiest to apply to experimental tests). I found the chapter on indistinguishable particles particularly helpful. Using simple examples, the author provides a clear introduction to the topic. Somewhat weak in the area of matrix mechanics; using Dirac notation in that section seems forced. There is a number of typographical errors, which are not serious however."},{"Title":"Primer of Quantum Mechanics","review":"The author has an original way with words that makes for interesting reading. Many paragraph headings make memorable slogans, such as \\"WHAT YOU MEASURE IS WHAT YOU KNOW\\".But in order to understand this book you must come to terms with the author's own terminology; for instance he regularly uses the word \\"language\\" to mean a mathematical \\"basis\\".Dirac notation is used liberally, and the Dirac bracket is explained in words in several different ways; but nowhere is it defined in mathematical terms, as the inner product (scalar product) of two vectors. This seems surprising in view of the author's statment that \\"The entire business of practical quantum mechanics is devoted to obtaining transformation matrices!\\". The elements of transformation matrices are Dirac brackets, but this book shows how in many cases they can be evaluated without knowing their mathematical definition.This book has a strongly practical approach, with emphasis on the physical apparatus used to make physical measurements."},{"Title":"Primer of Quantum Mechanics","review":"I asked the physicist Sean Carroll (CalTech) to recommend a book that was an intermediate between the popular science books and a full-out text book, and he told me to get this one, and it was most certainly worth the money.

This is a book I would have liked very much if it was available some 14 years ago when I was an undergraduate student. We should be in a time when old presentations of the subject were abandoned. The book,in an intelligent spirit of a primer, introduces Dirac's notation which, in my opinion, is the only chance that a non-genius has to really understand some Quantum Physics.

It tends to be somewhat dated but as a basic guide it does not suffer."},{"Title":"Primer of Quantum Mechanics","review":"No doubt you can learn a lot of basic QM from this book, and its answers and hints to problems are good for self-study. But the author (MC) is overly insistent on his particular philosophical interpretation of the subject. Ubiquitous bold-face headers in capitals give the book the feeling of an indoctrination manual for a New Age cult: e.g., \\"WHAT YOU MEASURE IS WHAT YOU KNOW\\" (@13), \\"THERE'S ALWAYS A LANGUAGE OF CERTAINTY\\" (@195) and \\"THE WHOLE UNIVERSE PARTAKES IN EVERY EVENT\\" (@240). (I share another reviewer's irritation at the use of \\"language\\" for \\"basis\\", BTW.) It recalls the 1970s and early '80s, when John Archibald Wheeler was pushing his observers-create-the-universe POV and Wu-Li Masters were Dancing. The main text has more than its share of moralizing, or at least odd, judgments, such as that uncertainty is caused by \\"[p]igheaded insistence on measuring other observables\\" (@195) -- so the same wouldn't be true of inadvertent, or simply unenthusiastic, measurement of another observable?MC adopts the Schr&ouml;dinger picture (\\"A STATE EVOLVES IN TIME\\", @ 177) without alerting the reader, presumably a QM novice, that he's doing so; a corollary is that he also fails to mention the Heisenberg picture (all time dependence in dynamical variables, none in the states). Moreover, a cornerstone of MC's view is interpreting the wave function as describing an individual particle. Unfortunately, this is neither the only interpretation of QM (though you won't learn that from this book), nor the best one. If you're willing to dive into its Dirac-ish, math-intensive approach, Leslie Ballentine's terrific text gives you a much more through and balanced analysis of the philosophical underpinnings of QM, including a careful and convincing argument for a statistical interpretation of the uncertainty relations (an aspect of QM that Einstein got right). As Ballentine's book also shows, if you're going to be opinionated it's more helpful to the reader if you at least describe other views before you trash them. Ironically for a book with a strong experimentalist orientation, this \\"Primer\\"'s math might be more reliable than its physics. If you read it, work the problems and be skeptical about most of the rest."},{"Title":"Primer of Quantum Mechanics","review":"This book takes you step by step into quantum mechanics concepts.

Encyclopedia of Survival","review":"The SAS Encyclopedia of Survival is one of the best in its' class! I fully recommend it to anyone seriously interested in valid survival techniques. I spent several years living in the Andes and remote jungle areas of South America and I believe that I can recognize a decent survival manual when I see one. Many survival books being sold are worthless in the field, as their content depends on items that need to be packed in. Barry Davies's book is not one of those. The book covers the topics most often discussed in other books such as shelter, fire and food, but the outstanding thing about the book is that it also has specific chapters on survival in Arctic, desert, and jungle areas. The pictures found throughout the book are great although some like the ones showing snares could be supported with illustrations as the photos are too vague to show any details. An interesting chapter in evading capture is the frosting on the cake for the book. This book is easy to read, not being dry like so many military manuals. The advice is sound and practical, and can be applied easily using common sense. I would reccomend it for anyone traveling to the wild areas of South America because it teaches you what to do to save yourself when working or traveling in an area where there are no ranger stations or local search and rescue teams. The chapter on survival medicine is also superior to that found in most other books.

But the information is very little, could do with a lot more background info.The price is way to hight, probably because it is full of full-color photographs, unfortunally not contibuting at all to the understanding of what is being said in the text.For example the section about medical plants contains only a handfull plants, of which you just have to hope to find them, no information where to find them, and only two photographs, not very clear, which pretty much throws away your chance to realy use them when you need it.For a good survival manual, buy Wiseman's &quot;SAS survival manual&quot;, which contail all the information in this one, and A LOT MORE, including USEFULL drawings.

This book's aim is to stress the importance of not ignoring the reality and empirical evidence when producing the theories in social science. Shapiro dared to say what majority of students think and this book can serve as a starting point for everyone who is starting PhD research and it is confused whether to choose quantitative or qualitative approach. In summary, Shapiro advocates more liberal and creative approach to studying contemporary world."},{"Title":"The Flight from Reality in the Human Sciences","review":"Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective Action (1965) was the start of a revolution in political thought, known as the rational choice school. Olson applied a simple economic logic to the question: when will a rational individual join in collective action, at personal cost? His answer is that, unless the group is very small so that the individual's contribution to the success of the action is great, or some external sanction is applied to the individual for failing to participate, the rational individual will not join. In 1994, some three decades later, Ian Shapiro coauthored Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory, asserting that this school had produced nothing of importance, and its commitment to a universalist model of human behavior precludes it ever from doing so. This book, The Flight from Reality, includes several follow-up essays, including a reply to the rational choice critics of his earlier book, and a long critique of Judge Richard Posner, the most prominent rational choice theorists among legal scholars.It is hard not to sympathize with Shapiro's \\"show me the beef\\" approach to political theory. Rational choice theory has not revolutionized political science in the same way it has revolutionized economics. By and large, rational choice theorists have taken hold of the \\"high theory\\" segment of political science departments, but their methods are honored mostly in the breach when students go on to study real political problems. However, it is also hard (at least for this writer) not to sympathize with the intention of political theorists to ground their subject analytically, as has been done in economics and biology. The rational choice theorists in political science may not yet have succeeded, but they cannot be faulted for attempting to build an analytical political theory. Shapiro comes off as the alchemist who doesn't mind dirtying his hands in chemical soups, but who criticizes the chemists because they haven't yet solve the problem of the transmutation of the elements.Why has rational choice theory failed? Shapiro's answer is that all \\"reductivist\\" theory must fail. However, all science is reductivist, and tolerates emergent properties of complex systems only after sustained failure to model them analytically. Thus, Shapiro is really an anti-science realist. The correct answer, I believe is that rational choice theorists learned the wrong lesson from Mancur Olson. Clearly large-scale collective action exists in the world, and without such action, human society as we know it could not exist. Voting itself is an example that violates Mancur Olson's theory, as are the collective actions that gave rise to representative institutions, political democracy, striking down of racially discriminatory institutions, and some measure of gender equality. What we must give up in Mancur Olson's argument is not his postulate of rationality, but rather his postulate that rationality implies self-interest. This, the rational choice school in political science has not done.Economists and biologists use rational decision theory to model choice. This accounts for the analytical success of behavioral theories in biology and economics. We can describe the rational choice model more accurately as the Beliefs, Preferences, and Constraints model. The theory holds that individuals maximize a preference function, subject their knowledge/beliefs, and subject to whatever constraints they face. However, the content of preferences, and the nature of beliefs, cannot be derived from the concept of rationality itself. In particular, the notion that it is irrational to prefer something because it promotes the welfare of others (e.g., giving to charity), or because it is the moral thing to do (e.g., being honest, or voting) cannot be sustained by any known plausible argument.There is a deep irony in the political science rational choice school that they felt that adopting the analytical rigor of the beliefs, preferences, and constraints model necessarily obliged them to accept the economist's model of Homo economicus, that supremely sociopathic personality who is rarely found outside of impersonal market interactions. Shapiro, were he a real scientist, would have known the two decades of behavioral game theory that rejects the equation of rationality with self-interest (see, for instance, Colin Camerer, Behavioral Game Theory, Princeton University Press, 2003), and instead of assuming the role of harping critic, could have set rational choice theory on a better road. But, those with alchemistic predilections just prefer to muck around in reality with no need for theorizing at all.I demote this book two stars because it is wrong, and one star because it is a collection of previously published essays. I add one star because it is beautifully produced with a dynamite dust jacket."},{"Title":"The Flight from Reality in the Human Sciences","review":"Shapiro's argument that logical empiricism (LE) is the cause of flight is at the time LE scholars were promoting LE the logical component of LE was assumed. E.g. of course a scientific theory must be logical . . . duh! But then, with advancements in computational efficiency, beginning in the '60s, the pendulum swung too far in the other direction. Boldfaced and reckless empiricism becam incorrect, or at least misleading. From the perspective that most social scientists are not actually adhering to LE, it is unfair to blame LE. By and far, most of social science practitioners are just empiricists; believing that data speaks for itself and empirical analysis is not open to alternative interpretations. On the (so-called) formal/logical side, practitioners build \\"models,\\" not theories. Like data, mathematics and mathematical models say noting about content. What a term represents is intuited, not formally explicated. E.g. game theory is constructed upon mathematical axioms, thus making solutions feasible, but make no intelligent or sensible assumptions about how humans actually behave.Rationalists are completely dismissive of such criticisms, asserting the nonsensical claim that assumptions need not be realistic, but only useful. (Right, useful to project their paradigm and publishing enterprise.) Yes, assumptions must be realistic. Unrealistic assumptions should not be confused with abstract assumptions. Rational choice assumptions are abstract (as they are mathematical axioms), but they are in no way realistic- not individually, nor collectively.e the mainstay of social science research (and still is more than ever). And, it had the advantage of bolstering the pet theories of leading scholars by training graduate students to be technicians and not philosophers and theorists. Just look at the curriculum at leading graduate programs. There are no requirements in analytic philosophy, logic, concept formation and analysis, or theory Construction (not building or extending). But there is a healthy dosage of requirements in statistics, game theory, etc. and severely dumb-down research design and methods courses. And, because they are so severely dumb-down, they are usually convoluted, disconnected, and wrong. The biggest problem know is that two generations of scholars were trained this way such that they cannot even understand the language, process, and rigor of LE as genuinely the best we have to offer in terms of science. Oh well."},{"Title":"The Flight from Reality in the Human Sciences","review":"As a political theorist and global studies scholar, I deeply sympathize with Shapiro's call for a return to problem-driven social inquiry that can illuminate the central questions of our global era.

Along the way, he and his fellow excursionists visit the Azores, Gibraltar, Paris, Venice, Istanbul, Damascus, Cairo and a host of places in between. Twain's acerbic wit is on full display as he offers up what are occasionally laugh-out-loud critiques of the places and people he encounters. Even his fellow passengers receive a ribbing, for which they often deserve, as they \\"chip\\" their way through the mideast removing souvenir pieces of religiously historic architecture. Innocents Abroad is not for the easily offended. This is a pre-PC view of the world which, properly judged for it's age, is highly entertaining.The second book of this volume is Roughing It. Here, Twain takes us on a sojourn to the American west in the company of his older brother. Roughing It is possibly the best contemporaneous account of life in America's 19th century western expanse and beyond. From stagecoach travel to silver mining, exploration and discovery to regional ecomonics, lifestyle, and lawlessness, Twain provides the reader a humorous look at the many facets of Manifest Destiny.As always, Library of America is a splendid publisher with an quality product priced attractively. I recommend this volume wholeheartedly.NOTE: This review is for the Library of America volume containing both Innocents Abroad and Roughing It by Mark Twain."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This is a fascinating, extraordinary account, written by Mark Twain in relation to his travels throughout the Mediterranean, the Holy Land & other points of interest around 1867.Many readers will be familiar with Mark Twain from their school-days , perhaps having read the author's stories of \`Tom Sawyer' & \`Huckleberry Finn'. Although factual, this book is itself just as enjoyable a read as the author's other classics.I obtained my rather ancient copy of this book primarily to investigate the author's account of his travels through the Holy Land during the 19th Century, and his observations of the Holy Land, it's terrain, population, culture and character at that time.Noting that the author had also spent some time in Gibraltar at any early stage in his journey, I thought that I might also be able to gather some perception of the accuracy of his accounts, having personally lived in Gibraltar for a period of time & being familiar with Gibraltar's history. I was not to be disappointed and was quite impressed with the writer's description of Gibraltar and his interpretation of it's turbulent history.I was also impressed with the writer's account of so many locations within the Holy Land and the considerable amount of time that he devoted to it in his book. So many of the Judaeo-Christian sites that I am very familiar with are admirably described by the author and are instantly recognisable even after so many years.However, unlike today, where many of these areas are quite heavily populated and where the land has flourished in recent times, the author's account paints an utterly different picture during the 19th Century. A picture which flies heavily in the face of the \`new historians' and the \`revisionists', many of whom allege that the Land even then was quite heavily populated by \`Palestinian Arabs' and was as verdant as the present day.Instead Mark Twain describes the Holy Land as being barely populated and just a collection of small villages in a dry, barren land, an outpost of the Ottoman Empire.[...]I highly recommend this book to everyone. Please note that some copies under the title 'Innocents Abroad' do not include the coverage of the Holy Land trip. Please ensure that you obtain the correct copy. Thank you."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This book describes a group tour of &quot;Europe and the Holy Land&quot; Samuel Clemens experienced and reported about 100 years ago. He describes, in a way that only Mark Twain can, the people he meets and the places they go from the point of view from the American West. One memorable example of his American perspective is a comparison of Italian mountains, lakes and rivers with his beloved Rockies, Tahoe, and Mississippi. He also paints humorous portraits of the tour guides and his fellow travelers. The first time I read this book I was on an organized bus tour in Europe and quickly realized how many of Twain's human observations on how tourists are treated still apply, which makes the humor very accessible."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"I think Clemen's funniest extended work.

Although Twain was a man of his era, with a lot of racial and cultural prejudices, he was seldom mean-spirited about it. When he made fun of others, he also laughed at himself. His descriptions of the physical landscapes are a beautiful record of the way the various cities and countrysides must have looked and felt in the 19th century. His descriptions of the people and their peculiarities are still fresh and funny today.

Mark Twain's ability to tweak character flaws and situations are, at the same time, hilarious and thought provoking."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"In what must have been the first organized tour by Americans of the Old World, Mark Twain tells of his experiences as a member of a party of 150 taking a cruise steamer to tour the European mainland, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.The \\"innocents\\" of the title applies to Twain and his comrades. It shows partly in their naivete such as being flattered by a French shopkeeper into buying a tawdry piece of apparel, and in their assumption that every native guide must be telling the truth. It shows partly in their attempting behavior that seasoned travelers would not attempt, such as riding a donkey all day, or making an evening foray to the shore of Athens--in violation of the quarantine--to observe the Parthenon under the moonlight. It shows mainly in Twain's sense of wonder at the monuments of civilization which tower over him in what seems the first confrontation of American culture with Europe and the East.There are some memorable moments: Twain's audience with the Czar in the Caucasus; his arduous trek through the Syrian desert to the Holy Land; his measuring the blocks of the Baalbek temples and deciding they were as big as railroad cars; his being harassed by beggars in every town in the Middle East; his being made a virtual prisoner by his guide as he labors up the great pyramid in Egypt. And we realize that throughout this tour of the antiquities, some things remain as they were in 1867. Tour groups are still largely made up of the gray-haired, the Louvre with its miles of art galleries is still overwhelming, the sphinx remains inscrutable, and Arabs still hate Christians.INNOCENTS ABROAD is typical Mark Twain, full of his humor, irony, and exaggeration. Brevity is not its virtue, however.I found this non-fiction work useful for its travel information, but even more readable for its digressions: those anecdotes, legends, spoofs, and mini-essays that liberally infuse the book. Twain's reproduction of a fancied playbill for the Coliseum of 2,000 years ago is hilarious. His well-evidenced argument that Egypt is the wellspring of western culture is a startling one. His portrayal of his experience in the Tomb of the Holy Sepulcher shows a devoutness that we do not associate with this American iconoclast. In fact, he marshals a fund of knowledge of the Bible and Christian history in demonstrating that Ephesus, now largely in ruins, is really the most important city in Christendom.I purchased INNOCENTS ABROAD after I read it. It is the only book of Twain's that I own, because I will want to read its passages again and again, to myself and to others."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"When I read Chapter 13 of this book where he describes the scene in Paris where 'Ferguson' is eating his breakfast and generally ripping them off as he pretends to guide them to the Louvre I had to put the book down because I was giggling and laughing so hard. Even now when I reread it for the 100th time it never gets old. Anyone who feels Twain was racist doesn't get how universally he applies his satire."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Well, Mark Twain certainly had a good sense of humor. You can count on laughing out loud many times as you read this book, which, because times have changed since he wrote it in 1867, is really amazing. It's interesting to read his adventures in the Azores, Gibraltar, Morocco, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Russian Crimea, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and the Holy Land and compare the experiences with what tourists might expect to meet today. The world looks far more uniform now than it did then. A few shenanigans, a few jokes among passengers on the chartered ship that took the whole bunch of them on an extended tour overseas flesh out the volume. The famous author hoped to gain knowledge and insight, but a lot of what he saw repelled him. He could not escape the prejudices and bigotries of his time. The grandeur of ruins and the great sense of history to be found in the Old World inspired him; the order and cleanliness of France attracted him as well. But he often took the ways and tricks of those involved in the tourist trade as typical behavior of the countries involved. Like modern tourists, he did not meet cultured or disinterested people in such places---only touts, guides, servants, salesmen, and beggars.As Twain travelled he got increasingly bogged down in minute descriptions of antiquities. By the time he got to Jerusalem, I was exhausted. While he revived my interest every now and then with another set of droll remarks or humorous observations, I admit that my will flagged somewhat towards the end of the 476 pages. Nowadays Americans are not so concerned to pinpoint the differences between the Old World and the New. Anyway, both have changed immeasurably in the last 142 years. But Twain, like many writers since--for example, Henry James, Hemingway, and Sinclair Lewis---found the comparison fascinating. Contemporary Americans more easily accept themselves for what they are, at least, they have become less defensive. They have also lost the pretense that somehow America is more innocent, a common 19th century trope.The best way to read this book is to dip into it over a period of time. I loved the sections where he took the mickey out of travel writers who waxed eloquent about the beauties of places that were anything but; recklessly trigger happy writers who claimed they'd showed the \\"natives\\" what was what (but probably did nothing of the kind). It's still a great travel book and if you ever liked Mark Twain, you should read it."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Twain enters a steamship bound for the Mediterranean in 1869. Mingling with foreigners and Europeans specifically, his caustic wit centers on contrast and comparison between the Old and New World, the feature of all of Twain's books. While it is sometimes difficult to divide Twain the traveler from Twain the critic, his remarks are frequently informative as his new eyes are brought to old scenes, and his criticisms (as usual) are incisive and clever. Tangiers, Naples, Constantinople, Alexandria, Cairo -- these are but a few of the places he visits. As a traveler myself, I have often cited Twain's views in comparison or contrast with my own findings, such as his detestation for Turkish coffee (he hated it, but it was almost tasteless to me). In any event, Twain returns home safely after a long voyage to many places, where his tongue had given frequent lashings to the Old World, the Middle East and even his fellow travelers."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"It had been years since I last read Twain, and thought that perhaps I should read the prototype of the cruise review.

His satire on American travelers, other rhapsodic travel guides, and the \\"holy\\" land on his travels to the Holy Land, were hilarious. There were a few times that I thought \\"Ok he's just rehashing a donkey ride to see ruins...AGAIN\\" when it happened for the umpteenth time, but by the time I finished the chapter I was once again chuckling out loud.I now have to go back and reread A Connecticut Yankee.

Twain is observant, droll and amusing, but he also bogs the narrative down with numerous tedious tangents and obscure literary and bibilical references.It is interesting to see the world of 1867 through Twain's eyes and to find that many of the annoyances of travel then are familiar today -- pushy vendors, long-winded guides, aggressive beggars. But it's also fascinating to see what's different -- the difficulty of finding soap in Europe, for example, or the need to travel partly by carriage, horse and donkey.A couple of scenes were especially enjoyable. In Greece, the Americans were forbidden to land. Desperate to see the Parthenon and the Acropolis, Twain and others snuck off the ship in the middle of night, crept through city streets and then bribed guards to see the landmarks. Later, at Yalta on the Black Sea, the travelers remarkably got to meet the emperor of Russia simply because they were Americans, and were treated as grand representatives of their country.While Twain makes it clear that he is a Bible-reading man, he despises those who are excessively pious or who use religion arrogantly. Italy, he says, has built magnificent churches while \\"starving half her citizens to accomplish it. She is today one vast museum of magnificance and misery.\\" In the Middle East, he mocks those who operate questionably \\"holy\\" sites to lure in tourists.It is hard to imagine any travel writer as blunt as Twain. He describes the Azores as \\"eminently Portuguese -- that is to say, it is slow, poor, shiftless, sleepy, and lazy.\\" He says Moorish women have \\"atrocious ugliness.\\"The most disturbing element of the book is Twain's bigotry toward Muslims. He calls the Muslim Turks \\"by nature and training filthy, brutish, ignorant, unprogressive, superstitious.\\" He calls the residents of Damascus the \\"ugliest, wickedest-looking villains we have seen.\\" He unapologetically says Muslims will never be the equal of Christians until they learn to repent.This is a long book (my edition was 495 pages of rather dense type), but I found you don't have to read it straight through. Since there are few continuing characters, you can put it down and pick up later with little loss. To avoid getting bogged down, I suggest you skip over Twain's numerous digressions and instead skip ahead to the parts where he is actually traveling or personally engaged in an activitiy."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Mark Twain's tale of rich 19 century Americans let loose in Europe and the Holy Land provides an insight into Victorian travel habits I suppose, but it is not very noteworthy as a travelogue. Its real value is that it is testament to Twain's undeniable skills as a writer and as a linguist.I came across an original review of Innocents Abroad at The Atlantic Monthly's website. Unfortunately I am not permitted to type in the whole web address so that you could more easily find the T.A.M. review, but if you are interested, go to The Atlantic Monthly's website and under the section entitled &quot;Books and Critics&quot; type in &quot;innocentsabroad.htm&quot; at the search engine. The review itself was written in December 1869."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This book, along with Twain's \`Roughing It,' is often considered to be some of the best travel narrative ever put to paper. Certainly it deserves its acclaim. Twain, the irreverent All-American writer, took a trip halfway around the world in a steamer and visited many of the great sites of Europe and the Middle East. This is his account of his experiences, and the experiences of the group of \`Pilgrims' which accompanied him on this \`pleasure excursion.'One of the best things about Twain is his refusal to romanticize, even in the cases of the greatest places in the world. He does not hesitate to verbally abuse Paris, Florence, Damascus, even Jerusalem. He tells it how it is, refusing to admire the work of the great painters (Raphael, Michael Angelo, and co.) and asserting that everyone who ever wrote of the beauty of the Sea of Galilee was a downright liar. He has some good things to say, too (he seems to have approved of Athens), but mostly he spends his time dispelling the romantic images of the great places of the world. The result is hilarious, and certainly makes one realize that, despite the perfect images that Paris, Pisa, and Rome sometimes have in our minds, they are a far cry from paradise.Twain's wit, as always, is very sharp, and this book is an excellent example of it. His antics (and descriptions of them) are very funny, and his way of putting things a joy to read. Along the way, he pokes fun of the American \\"Pilgrims,\\" who deface the sacred relics they visit and call every guide they have \`Ferguson.' This is certainly a classic in American Literature. Anyone interested in travel writing will profit greatly from this book, as will anyone who enjoys Twain's humor or just a good laugh."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"It took me all summer to read this novel, not only because of the dense descriptive writing and banal Biblical references during Twain's travels in the Middle East, but also because of the repeated claims of racial and ethnic superiority by the author. Twain refers to everyone, from the Portuguese to Arabs and even some Italians as savages. The modern reader should be 'understanding', recognizing that this is written in a time when political correctness and the reasons behind it were unheard of, but I couldn't help twinging over Twain's predjudices. Nevertheless, I rarely start a book without finishing, so I kept on, motivated by laugh-out-loud scenarios Twain vividly describes, bold cynicism, and what turns out to be, quite simply, a really good story. It's easy to see why this is not included on most school reading lists, but it has some entertainment value nonetheless. Plus, Twain's writing is superb, like nothing you'll find on today's bestseller lists."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This is classic Twain. He is an endless amusement. When I first discovered how much pleasure I derived from his works, I promised myself that I would ration them out over my lifetime and not read them all at once, so that I could always have some fresh Twain. I thought THE INNOCENTS ABROAD was exhausting, in the way that most travel is exhausting--on the memory. There are a number of scenes I won't soon forget. The times I fell asleep reading it, Twain's images slipped into my nightmares. Not that he inspired them--I have nightmares more often than not--but now they featured minarets, beggars, and Bedouins.A hungry Twain tours Europe and the Holy Land, by boat and mule respectively. He pokes fun at everyone and everything along the way as an innocent child might--with unabashed honesty and playful cruelty. Twain had already traveled the breadth of America and absorbed its natural wonders, so his Great American Ego is rarely awed by the geography of the Old World. European lakes like Lake Como are puddles compared to Lake Tahoe, its rivers mere trickles, considering the Mississippi. He nicknames all the indigenous travel guides \\"Ferguson,\\" instead of their real names or in spite of them. Similarly, when he visits Palestinian villages with names he can't pronounce, he dubs them 'Jacksonville' or after random American towns. He does not shy away from judging the women of any land as hideous. His fellow voyagers, mostly old professionals and ex-military, are also freely ridiculed by him, many becoming caricatures--some of them, parasites. On several occasions, Twain calls them out on their annoying habit of chipping away at even the most sacred monuments with their little picks and hammers, for souvenirs. There's plenty of mischief besides. Twain and friends conspire to play dumb with several foreigners, asking the silliest questions of every Ferguson. The troop would point to a petrified mummy and ask if it is really dead. The tourists sneak into the Parthenon by night, without permission to dock, steal a bunch of grapes, and get chased by a mob of villagers all the way back to the boat. Soap is a scarce amenity at every stop, even in civilized Europe. Beggars, however, are plentiful, and the relentless demand of charity (bucksheesh) is a running gag, from Algeria to Egypt. You get the filth, the stench, the poverty, the heat, the hypocrisy, nothing is spared, that's why it's exhausting in all of its bounty. He makes the most pitiful scenes oddly amusing so you don't know whether to laugh or feel pity. Outside of Damascus, he has this to say about local health care:\\"The little children were in a pitiable condition -- they all had sore eyes, and were otherwise afflicted in various ways. They say that hardly a native child in all the East is free from sore eyes, and that thousands of them go blind of one eye or both every year. I think this must be so, for I see plenty of blind people every day, and I do not remember seeing any children that hadn't sore eyes. And, would you suppose that an American mother could sit for an hour, with her child in her arms, and let a hundred flies roost upon its eyes all that time undisturbed? I see that every day. It makes my flesh creep. Yesterday we met a woman riding on a little jackass, and she had a little child in her arms -- honestly, I thought the child had goggles on as we approached, and I wondered how its mother could afford so much style. But when we drew near, we saw that the goggles were nothing but a camp meeting of flies assembled around each of the child's eyes, and at the same time there was a detachment prospecting its nose. The flies were happy, the child was contented, and so the mother did not interfere.\\" (Chapter 45)Twain deliberates on bizarre topics such as the reputation of the starving dogs of Constantinople and the city's remarkable class of cripples:\\"A beggar in Naples who can show a foot which has all run into one horrible toe, with one shapeless nail on it, has a fortune--but such an exhibition as that would not provoke any notice in Constantinople. The man would starve. Who would pay any attention to attractions like his among the rare monsters that throng the bridges of the Golden Horn and display their deformities in the gutters of Stamboul? O, wretched impostor! How could he stand against the three-legged woman, and the man with his eye in his cheek? How would he blush in presence of the man with fingers on his elbow? Where would he hide himself when the dwarf with seven fingers on each hand, no upper lip, and his under-jaw gone, came down in his majesty? Bismillah! The cripples of Europe are a delusion and a fraud. The truly gifted flourish only in the by-ways of Pera and Stamboul.\\" (Chapter 33)Twain's historic and religious reflections are priceless for their mix of gravity/levity; he never misses an opportunity to put the Catholic Church on blast and he shows surprising compassion for Muslims. His own American folk stories are interspersed with impromptu imaginings of European life, and apocryphal versions of Biblical tales abound. There are far too many funny incidents to mention. The biggest and most sustained laugh I had was when he was describing the famine in Samaria brought about by a Syrian siege. It closes Chapter 51, for anyone that cares to look."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This is a travel book written by one of America's greatest writers and thinkers.

Above all other other authors, it was probably Twain that directed me towards my degree (minor though it is) in English. I also love to travel and see new cultures and places. Because of this I couldn't have imagined a better author than Twain to accompany on a romp through Europe and the Middle East. The first couple of pages alone were entertaining, so I plunged into it with excitement. What I found is that not even Mark Twain can avoid the eventual tediousness that comes with travel memoirs, someone rattling on and on about this place or that place, the art they saw or the cities which are apparently unique but all seem the same. However, if there is anyone you would rather be with throughout all that monotony, it is the master of satire himself. Every time I thought I was descending into the point of no return boredom, Twain threw out some anectdote or image or some completely irrelevent story that made me laugh out loud. Several times I laughed pretty hard, other times I simply smiled, but no matter what, Twain rescued me from not wanting to finish the tour. Some of my favorite moments were the constant naming of all guides as \\"Ferguson,\\" no matter what their actual name or nationality, the never-ending quest for a good shave from foreign barbers, or reflections on the random, non-sensical thoughts of the passenger nicknamed \\"the Oracle.\\" By the end, I was interested not only to see parts of Europe, but from the point of view of a very fresh, post-Civil War American. Twain's encounter with the Russian Czar is almost too good to be true, and his insights in the Holy Land are both funny and thoughtful. Something that I had never noticed in his previous writings, either because of my own negligence or his careful writing, was the power of Twain's description. It is with the most passing ease that he masterfully paints a picture of what he is seeing. My brother tells me that Mr. Twain also wrote a travel narrative on a trip around the equator. Europe was fun enough that I don't see a reason to not join him all the way around the world. I'll keep you posted."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Twain is not only timeless but his observations may seem all the more timely. This excellent read follows him on a journey to Europe and then the Middle East in the 1860s. We learn much about the time period and his observations are helpful in learning about the past, we see the brutality od the slave market in Istanbul where European slaves are sold, we see the arrogance of the europeans and we see the true view of the 'Holy Land' as Twain puts to shame former romantic accounts of the land of the Bible and brings it to life in its brutal squalor. Twain is ever cynical and whitty and in this the read sheds light on a nascent quinitsential Americanism. The American culture of Twain is not taken in with old europe, he is not impressed by luxory and he is not easily taken in with romance, there is no Lawrence of Arabia in Twain, there is skepticism about religion, about the Catholic church. People are not inherently good or evil, but jaded, Twain has a sense of justice but he dares to challenge his contemporaries and ironically the way his contemporaries viewed say the European or the Arab beoduin, has not changed in 140 years. Twain dared to challenge popular thought and in that he was one of the first Americans.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Reading early Mark Twain is like watching a young David Letterman. The brilliance is there, but its owner is still learning how to use it. In 1867, Twain was dispatched by a San Francisco newspaper to be a passenger on the first organized tour group of Americans making their way through Europe and the Near East. In 1869, he reworked his newspaper dispatches into something resembling a book, although that book is more like Gulliver's Travels than Moby-Dick. Twain's modern detractors don't approve of how he wrote so dismissively about \\"the natives.\\" What they overlook is that he is even more cutting when he is writing about the pious, provincial Americans he is traveling with. The Innocents Abroad is one of the first books that grapples with what it means to be an American. And it's a lot more fun to read than Henry James."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This is Twain when he doesn't have to worry about a bloomin' story line or consistant dialogue.

In the book Twain travels through France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt, among others. This is Mark Twain, early in life, at his very best.Contrasting this with his autobiography, &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot; is equally witty and comedic, but with Twain's patented cynicism being far less jaded than it would become at the end of his life. Twain's Biblical knowledge is impressive and surprisingly respectful as he recounts his travels to European cathedrals and later, multiple Middle Eastern holy sites. At the same time, his mistrust for many of the people in power and living in these lands, particularly the Middle East, is truthful and direct in a way that our hypersensitive modern world does not allow people to be. Twain's account of the Arab world was just as accurate then as it would be today, over 130 years later. His assessment of the mess their culture had created, especially in regard to the utter wasteland that was pre-Israeli state Jerusalem, is cuttingly accurate but brilliantly comical in typical Mark Twain fashion.This book is one of the best non-fiction books I've read in a long time. Mark Twain was truly a great American, and every patriot will enjoy following him on this trip around the world and may come away with a greater appreciation of all that Americans have."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Interesting to read the esteemed Twain's observations back when Europe was a very different continent. While Americans may be similar now, many had not traveled \\"back to the old country\\" and beyond before, so it's eye-opening to review Twain's remarks.Like many \\"classics,\\" the book meanders and is probably too long. (And I say this as someone who regularly reads 1000-1500 page presidential bios.) The \\"witty\\" Twain, who offers something for people of diverse socio-political views then and now, is observant and amusing; but he also lends himself to multiple tangents and personal conjecture which detract from the ethos, in my view.It is interesting to see the world of 1876 through Twain's eyes, and to find that, while Europe has moved from a proud, nationalistic place to its current multi-culti secular socialistic disaster (though improving a bit under more conservative leaders unlike here in America under disastrous Obama), it still had similar annoyances back then: theft, lack of public facilities for the common man, racism, etc. We are lucky to live in America. A person wins the lottery the day s/he is born in the USA. Period.Also worth nothing how desolate the Holy Land was before World War 1 and especially before Israel was created/populated by European & American Jews, as Twain observes. The few Jews there 136 years ago, and the Arab squatters, lived like it was still the 12th century. We have Jews/Israelis/Zionists to thank for making the desert bloom, developing incredible technology and science that we in the west use, among much else. And we thank them for their strong, freedom-loving defense force being a liberal democratic partner in the war against radical Islam. Sorry for the tangent, but it's vital. If only the Israelis could live in peace, but the Muslim Jihadists and anti-semites won't allow it.And if Twain could only see Israel and the Holy Land now, he'd be amazed."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our literature. Sam Clemens (1835-1910) wrote Huckleberry Finn in 1885 which has been acclaimed as our greatest American novel. Lesser known are his wonderful travelogues: \\"Roughing It' \\"Following the Equator\\"; \\"Life on the Mississippi and \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" published in 1869. This book is worth reading even 140 years after its publication. Twain style is a joy to read for he was a born storyteller and communicates his thoughts well on the page.Twain was a reporter who joined the six month expedition to Europe and the Middle East on board the steamer \\"Quaker City.\\" The pleasure tour hadbeen organized by the famous pastor Henry Ward Beecher (sibling of Harriet Ward Beecher) and Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman. Neither of these notable made the trip citing other obligations.Twain roomed with a young man from Elmira New York. He would later visit Elmira and meet his friend's sister Olivia. She would become his wife and the mother of the couple's three daughters.The Innocents Abroad is a long book of 400,000 words covering over 500 densely written pages. Twain takes a sardonic, humorous view of European art as he guides us through the Louvre, Florence Italy and Rome. We visit London, Paris and meet with Czar Alexander II in the Crimea. Twain had a keen reporter's eye and a humorist's ability to paint word pictures of his fellow passengers,tour guides and natives of the fascinating cities and countries he visited on a busy itinerary.As a Presbyterian pastor I found the most interesting part of the book dealt with Twain's tour of Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece and Israel. He was upset by the filth, disease and cruelty he saw in the land of Moses and Jesus Christ. Despite all his asides and digressions the observant reader can gain a good picture of what these places were like in 1869. Twain was an agnostic but knew his Bible.Mark Twain was our greatest author. In this fine book you will get to know this fascinating man better as he shares his globe trotting journey with his readers."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Ok, maybe that is a minor overstatement, but this is one hilarous book, to be read by people who have travelled, who plan to travel, and generally, people who want to laugh. A lot.The book is also surprising for its timeless points about the journeying of certain upper white, middle class people going on a grand tour of Europe. I frequently had to remind myself that it was written in 1869 because his observations and the behavior of his shipmates is so close to the way people I studied abroad with acted-only a few years ago.Twain also puts those &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; people who claim to have traveled, but don't know anything about any place they have been but and just like to lord it over everyone else that they have &quot;travelled&quot; and you have not.Reading this book is like listening to a very wise, old man tell you about his adventures. Its not like a book, more like one long conversation. Twain takes nothing seriously-not himself, his fellow travelers or the places they visit. The words are another adventure-sometimes, you know he is setting you up for something, other times he is serious for a while, then you end up in the middle of a joke.I know this is against the rules, but the other posters who don't like this book-don't be so serious and p.c. all the time. Twain is making humorous observations, at a time when a different standard was acceptable. Not to mention, he does manage to get a few zingers in there about what people are willing to accept and what they do not.You will laugh yourself silly and want to book a trip-not to Europe, just to anywhere, after reading this book."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Cliches aside, retrieving the outlook of mid-19th Century isn't easy. Having successfully concluded the upheaval of the War Between the States, the people of the USA, while bruised, felt confident. Their sense of righteousness was enhanced - they'd quelled a rebellion and freed slaves. Some took that attitude to other lands. The 1867 SS Quaker City excursion to Europe and the \\"Holy Land\\" was but one of those forays. It was special in that it carried one of the more discerning observers the United States had produced - Sam Clemens of Hannibal, Missouri and points West. He was to post letters to the San Francisco newspaper \\"Daily Alta California\\" describing the journey. The trip and the account opened Clemens' eyes and those of his readers over numerous legends.In Clemens' baggage was a strong religious sense imparted by his mother, Jane. This cargo was balanced by Twain's more worldly experience on the Mississippi and his life in the mining communities in the West. When he crossed the gangplank to board the steamer, his gaze was sceptical and his pen ascerbic. His portrayal of the Quaker City's passengers began as they traversed the Atlantic, but it is his depiction of \\"foreigners\\" in their homelands that both shocks and enlightens. Starting with the Azores stopover, Clemens' observations of the islands are a tribute to their charms. Of the people, however, he has little positive to impart. They are dirty, noisy, conniving and devious. In general, they're \\"not American\\".The use of the \\"innocents\\" is exemplified by Twain's description of contact with the Europeans. Educated in the minimal language training of the day, the travellers struggled to impart their wishes in French shops and restaurants. Twain seems to lay responsibility for this on the French \\"failure to understand their own language\\", but his description of the exchanges makes it clear where the problem lay. There was another side to this coin, however. Europeans were caught up in their own affairs. The United States was a remote and unknown element to them - \\"they'd had a war with somebody recently\\". Twain notes his shipmates were even then tinged with the arrogance that would fully blossom later. Respect for \\"tradition\\" had a variety of expressions in the \\"Quaker City\\" passengers. Twain depicts them all with delightful detachment.As the ship made landfall in Mediterranean ports, Clemens and his comrades visit the \\"standard\\" tourist haunts. Paris is a must, Genoa is a treat, Rome is a maze of cathedrals and art galleries. Quickly disenchanted with \\"guides\\" he renames them all \\"Ferguson\\" and rebukes them at every opportunity. Michaelangelo seems so pervasive in Rome that the Pilgrims ask if Greek or Egyptian artefacts are his work - to the consternation of the \\"Ferguson\\" of the day. Twain's flexibility and ability to adapt to events leads some of the \\"innocents\\" to take the train from Rome to Naples - a city under quarantine. While the \\"Quaker City\\" lies still in the harbour, Twain and his companions tour the city and visit Vesuvius. A similar ploy works in Greece.It is in the \\"Holy Land\\" that Clemens' descriptive powers and distrust of \\"authorities\\" flowers most brilliantly. Like many of his fellow passengers, he's been subjected to many tales from \\"Scripture\\" and a spate of earlier travel writers in Palestine. Unable to criticise the Bible outright, he lets the words speak for themselves, allowing logic and common sense to question dogma. The effusive travel writers, who had insisted Palestine was a \\"paradise\\" are brought out in contrast with Twain's observations of the barren desolation that was the Levant. He is scathing in his criticism of people who fabricate conditions there in order to sell their books. His veracity, of course, nearly had the opposite effect. \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" manuscript was originally rejected by Twain's publisher.Sam Clemens' reputation was \\"made\\" with this book. It touched on many aspects of how people in the United States viewed themselves and the world. The subtle, but incisive, comments on tradition and legend were seeds finding fertile ground in a dynamic nation setting the practical foremost. \\"Innocents\\" was a challenge to dogmas and a paean to the sense of \\"realism\\" that permeated the post-Civil War era. The \\"Romantic\\" Era, still evident in mid-19th Century in the earlier accounts of Palestine, would be whisked aside. \\"Innocents\\" would be instrumental in that sweeping it away.

Sometimes, this is funny/cruel, as in his attempt to pay the Egyptian kid to climb pyramids until it kills him. Pretty much every nationality in Europe is attacked. Maybe this jumps out at you when he gets to the Holy Land, but it's there all along.I found Twain's discussion of Lake Como to be the most troubling. Here, in comparing it to Lake Tahoe, he gets diverted into what can only be called a racist tirade against the Washoe Indians of Nevada.Melville (in The Confidence Man) has a long chapter on Indian-hating, but he writes as an observer, not a practitioner. Twain is more partisan. There is an anti-Catholic tinge as well; but then, anti-Catholic political parties (such as the 'Know Nothings') were also a feature of pre-civil war America.I do believe that this is one of the finest books on tourism one can read. Twain is a keen observer of Old World culture, which he opposes to our American adaptation. Admiration can lead to whitewashing if some of Twain's social pathologies are left unexamined.The book is as anti-Indian as anti-Arab, as anti-Mormon as anti-Catholic. It remains a very funny book; but I wouldn't give it to a teenager to read without a precautionary warning."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"The Innocents Abroad covers the travels of the steamer Quaker City and its cargo of American tourists headed on a pilgrimage to the holy land. One thing that you notice right off the bat is that Americans haven't really changed since Twain's time. We still make the same remarks and complain about the same things and are prone to the same bad habits as then.The funniest parts of this book is when Twain is talking about the paintings of the old masters or about the relics of Europe's churches. Twain likes to give his honest opinion in saying that he enjoys newer painting more than the old faded and cracked paintings of the old masters, and he is sure to torture any tour guide that gets within his grip with the fact. As for the relics, Twain notes that there are enough pieces of the true cross to make several copies over. The skeptic in Twain comes out and he points out everything that he thinks is false or a sham.The reason that I say this isn't Twain's best is that this was written by a young Twain as a newspaper writer, so in a sense he he writing to appeal to a larger crowd. He takes every opportunity to criticize the people and races that he encounters on his travels. To the modern reader, some of this criticism will read like racial stereotyping, so at times it may be uncomfortable for the modern reader to read. The more tolerant Twain that we often hear quoted doesn't develop until later in his career."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This book is amazing! Join the Quaker City Cruise voyagers and their meandering through Europe and the Holy Land. Mark Twain shows the haughty characteristics of American travellers that still thrive today.Enticing imagery takes you to the turbulent Europe of 1867. Mark Twain satirizes everything under the sun from travel guides and long dead lovers to Michelangelo and the Old Masters to the Rennaissance and Venice to Israel and the Catholic Church. His bitter sarcasm and witticisms left me laughing out loud. Next to Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, this is the funniest book I have ever read. I can't think of any downsides to this amazing work by the greatest humorist that ever blessed the English language. Exceptional!READ IT!"},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Between June and November 1867, Mark Twain was a participant in an excursion tour of the Mediterranean area of Europe, Asia, and Africa. This book is basically an account of that trip, based on letters he had written for (mainly) the \\"San Francisco Alta California\\" during the trip (the paper thus paid for the trip). It's an interesting blend of fact and fiction.Sailing aboard the \\"Quaker City\\" steamship, the journey begins in New York. First stop is the Azores and then Gibraltar, where Twain hears the legend of the Queen's Chair. A short side trip to Tangier gives him his first exotic tastes - right out of the Arabian Nights. The Fourth of July finds him at Marseilles, from which he travels by train to Paris (where he gets a painful shave in addition to visiting the Louvre, Notre Dame, and a theatre that has cancan dancers). He spends a day at Versailles before returning to Marseilles.The ship is now off to Italy, where Twain spends the next month visiting Genoa, Milan (he tours the cathedral and its sculptures and La Scala), Lake Como, Venice (a big disappointment), Florence, Rome (where he spends a lot of time viewing the Vatican), and finally Naples (which he thought filthy). Greece was their next stop, then Constantinople, where he comments on the slave market there. They sail to Odessa, which really offers no sightseeing opportunities, a welcome respite after Italy.Traveling then to Asia he visits Smyrna and Ephesus, and then moves on to the Holy Land. In Damascus Twain becomes ill for a day, but continues on to Palestine and the Sea of Galilee (another disappointment). At Nazareth he imagines it hasn't changed since the time of Jesus. Jerusalem seems a very small city to him; it is here that Twain weeps at the grave of Adam, a \\"blood relation.\\" A week or so later he continues to Jaffa overland where he meets the \\"Quaker City\\" and sails to Egypt. He goes to the pyramids and the sphynx, which impresses him greatly. The ship sails from Alexandria for home in early October, making a few stops along the way (one lengthy one in Spain, which Twain found delightful). They stop at Bermuda (most enjoyable to Twain) and land in New York in mid-November.Twain has a keen traveler's eye, though his humor would sharpen with time. Only his second book after the Jumping Frog sketches, he hadn't yet mastered the sharp satirical observations that graced later books (ROUGHING IT, for example, which is quite a bit funnier). But certain \\"themes\\" were already forming - his poking fun at religion, for instance: he observes that the relic of Jesus' Crown of Thorns at the cathedral in Milan is not as handsome as the one at Notre Dame. When he compares things seen on his trip with things back in America (something he doesn't do enough) he can be humorous: he compares the canals of Venice with a flooded river town along the Mississippi - neither which is very appealing in his view. He is always interesting, however, and the book is a joy to read."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This book, written over 130 years ago, still captures the essense of a European or Middle East trip. The same tour guide rip-offs, ancient hatreds, true pieces of the cross etc. Twain describes the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as a place where armed guards have to separate the various sects so that the followers of the Prince of Peace don't murder each other. He compares the Sea of Galilee unfavorabby to Lake Tahoe, and he is right. His at time narrow minded American boorishness comes off as charming because he doesn't take himself or anything else seriously. Throw out Lonely Planet and Michelin. This is a must read before your next trip."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"As the United States was recovering from the devastating effects of the Civil War, a group of \\"pilgrims\\" (as Twain calls them) boarded a steamer for an extended five month picnic to Europe and the Holy Land. His passage was paid, about $1250, by a newspaper in California in return for a series of what turned out to be 50 letters documenting this tourist experience. In the process, he got a lot of mileage out of caricaturizing his inner circle amongst the some 65 pilgrims, making them famous...and the book made from the letters made him famous.Although his humor and irony is not as concentrated as that in \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and later books, the suggestion of great literature is present. \\"Innocents\\" is rampant with characteristic understatement. In a day before political correctness, he notes, \\"The people of those foreign countries are very, very ignorant...in Paris they just simply opened their eyes and stared when we spoke to them in French! We never did succeed in making those idiots understand their own language.\\"In Tiberius, he noted that the women wore their coins of dowry on their headdresses: \\"Most of these maidens were not wealthy, but some have been kindly dealt with by fortune. I saw heiresses there, worth, in their own right, - worth, well, I suppose I might venture to say as much as nine dollars and a half. But such cases are rare. When you come across one of these, she naturally puts on airs.\\"He does not sugar-coat his view of the middle east and holy land - a thinly populated barren wasteland whose religion handicapped them then as now. During a trip to Jordan over roads supposedly subject to raids by roving Bedouins, he wrote, \\"I think we must all have determined upon the same line of tactics, for it did seem as if we never would get to Jerico. I had a notoriously slow horse; but somehow I could not keep him in the rear to save my neck. He was forever turning up in the lead. In such cases I trembled a little, and got down to fix my saddle. But it was not of any use. The others all got down to fix their saddles, too. I never saw such a time with saddles. It was the first time any of them had got out of order in three weeks, and now they had all broken down at once. I tried walking for exercise - I had not had enough in Jerusalem, searching for holy places. But it was a failure. The whole mob were suffering for exercise, and it was not fifteen minutes till they were all on foot, and I had the lead again...We were moping along down through this dreadful place, every man in the rear. Our guards, two gorgeous young Arab sheiks, with cargoes of swords, guns, pistols, and daggers on board, were loafing ahead. 'Bedouins!' Every man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a mud-turtle. My first impulse was to dash forward and destroy the Bedouins. My second was to dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in that direction. I acted on the latter impulse. So did all the others. If any Bedouins had approached us then from that point of the compass, they would have paid dearly for their rashness.\\"Delightful in every respect, this is still a chronicle of travel, and readers who have experienced any of the myriad of locations will be more consistently entertained. Astute readers may observe evidence of the history and experiences gained on this trip used frequently in Twain's subsequent writings.His more acclaimed \\"Roughing It\\" is a duplication of his travelogue efforts, but in the more familiar United States. Interesting (in \\"Innocents\\") is his positive view of stage coach travel in the US in comparison to train travel by steam engine in Europe. Can you imagine in today's world enjoying a thousand-mile trip over rut-filled excuses for roads behind a team of horses?Anyway, this is a great intro to the early Mark Twain - Five well-deserved stars!"},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"I regard Innocents Abroad as one of the best books I, an avid reader, have read in eighty years of being able to read.

Mark Twain, even at this early stage in his career, had a keen eye for truth, and was unflinchingly honest and forward with his opinions and observations. Written before the anally-politically correct current era, Twain was free here to set forth what he truly thought about the given situations - even if it burned some ears. His irrevent descriptions of some of the most famous (not to mention holy) landmarks in Europe and the Middle East are by turns caustically biting and cynically hilarous; on the other hand, and far less ackwnoledged, are his enthusiastic waxings over the true beauty of certain artifacts and scenes. Twain here, unlike so many other travel writers both past and present, truly gave his own honest impressions of the things he saw - even if he disdained some of the most revered things on earth. Twain, characteristically, was also humble in his way, freely admitting his ignorance of such subjects as art - while, at the same time, showing off his immense knowledge of history, The Bible, languages, and many other subjects. Twain was a true American original, and he is sorely missed. One might call the book a bit overlong: some passages go on longer than they should, and some of the attempted humor falls flat. Furthermore, some of the drier sections are less interesting and more tiresome to wade through; still, Twain's ever-present sense of humor and continually sharp wit are always there, and serve to make this book perpetually more interesting than the stadard dry, boring travelogue. A must-read for fans of travel writing, and of course for fans of Twain."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"I am generally a fan of Mark Twain but was disappointed in this book for a few reasons. He traveled on this famour voyage to Europe and the Middle East when he was still a young man, and the humor is sometimes on the juvenile side. He is often making fun of people's eating habits and clothing, and his comfort or lack of comfort at many points along the road form the subject of much of his material. He makes a lot of comments about the nature of the beast that he is riding at the time be it horse, camel or donkey; but while he anthropomorisizes the animals, he seems to not have been able to communicate with the humans he meets. Few conversations with native people or guides are evident and he does not seem to have been able to understand the cultures he visits in any depth. The strength of this book is his impressionistic visual descriptions of places before they were transformed by technology after the late 19th century."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"The great humor and satirical power of Mark Twain are evident often in this work.

Mark Twain (and his Samuel Clemens pseudonym) is a revered author, no matter how atrocious is the last quarter of &quot;Huckleberry Finn,&quot; and it is with great sadness that I realise that Twain / Clemens was simply a boor. This book reveals a chauvinistic ignorance that at times angers but more often simply disgusts the reader. Twain stands revealed as a person incapable of seeing past his own considerable prejudices. His minor saving grace is that he does so accurately see past the pretense of the snobbery of Europe and the hucksterism of Palestine. This small grace is more than offset by his reverse snobbery. Twain's generation worshipped progress, such that he can only see merit in a thing if it has a practical side. When Twain comes to tired and full Europe and even more tired (if not quite so full) Palestine he can see only legacies of a grand past for which he feels only contempt because he cannot see them in application to the present world. The problem is that Twain's values are so completely at odds with those of whom he writes. This in itself is forgiveable, but it is Twain's unwillingness to accept any values other than his own as valid that reduces &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot; to boorish drivel. Twain had little or no interest in discovering new peoples and cultures; he had already made up his mind on all of them. He was instead solely interested in justifying his own lamentable glorification of Americana. His comparison of Nevada's Lake Tahoe to Italy's Lake Como would be enraging were it not for the fact that Twain has already revealed himself by this point as a person whose opinions are so illiterate as to be inconsequential. Ultimately, Twain's cultural and social insensitivity is such that one wonders if it is not hear that the phrase &quot;Ugly American&quot; has its origins. Twain's treatment of the Sphinx and his disgust at his fellow travellers' frantic destruction of centuries-old structures for their own personal collection do give small signs that Twain is not utterly unregenerate, but by this time 400+ pages have elapsed and Twain has given too much evidence of the contrary for this trifling bit of sensitivity and respect to look like anything but an aberration. Perhaps I should give Twain some allowance. He was a humourist and he was trying to be funny. I shouldn't condemn him so utterly just because he failed in his attempt, even if it is the sheer nature of his failure that causes me such discomfort. It might be argued that in many cases I simply don't get the joke. If so, fine; I suspect that in those cases I am just as glad to have not understood his humour because I doubt that I would have shared it.A brief aside: Despite Twain's admiration for Louis Napoleon III and contempt for Sultan Abdul-Aziz as evidenced in Chapter 13, it was France and Napoleon that fell four years later in the Franco-Prussian War, while the Ottoman Empire lasted a full fifty years more before collapsing as a result of the upheavals of the Great War.

It's read with lyrical cunning and comprehension and easy to be present in reaction of all seen and done almost as if a friend is understatedly describing a recent trip but with Twain's marvelous prose and an impressive vocal cast of what seems like hundreds!Like his previous real life adventure book Roughing It there is quite a volume of information, perhaps too much, but I quite enjoyed hearing how accessible traveling through Europe over a hundred years ago could and does seem."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"The Innocents Abroad is travel writing; that's my story and I'm sticking to it. I found it in the fiction section of our public library, and more than one credentialed person has called it a novel. That's because Twain changed names of actual personages, conflated some personalities and episodes, indulged in satire, and passed off hyperbole and fanciful jokes as truth. That does not make it a novel, just novelistic. Today we call that creative nonfiction. It also happens to be one of those books I was content to just live in (it is over 400 pages) and not worry how long it was. It never bogs down.In 1867, the steamboat Quaker City sailed from New York, having been advertised as a grand, 3-month cruise that would take in the rim of the Mediterranean, with optional inland journeys and a trek across the Holy Land, ending in Egypt. The book, published in 1869, was developed from the dispatches Twain sent to the American media and his notebooks. The book follows (or invents) classic lines of travelogue exposition. Twain begins with a recitation of the cruise brochure, not all of which will bear out as promised; for example, William Tecumseh Sherman and Henry Ward Beecher were supposed to be celebrity passengers with whom one could presumably socialize, but neither made it. He describes his fellow passengers, most of them grey-haired, and many of them religious fundamentalists who are on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He also has a gang of younger friends with whom he will get in and out of scrapes along the way. The early part of the narrative is that of a traveler groping for the meaning of what he is doing, and impatient for the adventure to get going. But once he hits land (the Azores, and then Gibraltar), he deploys considerable descriptive powers to describe the countries he finds. He also describes the natives, which it must be said he often treats with unenlightened satire (he had not yet blossomed into the man who would write Huckleberry Finn).But there is a transition to more engaged traveler as time and experience kick in. From Gibraltar, to Morocco, to France, Italy, Greece, Turkey and throughout the Levant, he offers vivid descriptions and critiques. He offers a very close and opinionated reading of European cultural legends, like Abelard and Heloise, and of Biblical stories as he and his friends transverse a countryside that hadn't changed in two millennia. I only wish that he were here today, to revisit his ports of call and see what has happened nearly a century and a half later. I'm sure he'd have a lot to say."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"Treat this book like a special dessert! Make it last! This book is full of surprises. If you know anything about Mark Twain, you will appreciate his dry wit. This classic is completely politically INCORRECT and entirely DELICIOUS! I would advise the reader to keep a notepad and pen handy because you will witness the old world through the author's eyes and learn points of history that are no longer taught. There will be things revealed which will cause you to do further research. There will be times when you will have to put the book down to LAUGH OUT LOUD!

At the time, I picked up \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" and started it, but life intervened. Usually that's a sign to me that the book won't be too whoopty... but this one WAS.In about 60 chapters, Twain takes you through Mediterranean Europe and Paris, then Turkey, the Levant, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt, with stops in Gibraltar and assorted islands.He finds the ridiculous side of most situations, and gently pokes fun of himself while he skewers his traveling companions. I've been many of the places he writes about, and some things don't change. It's an interesting book for travelers.It's also interesting that, 140 years ago, EVERY literate person in America knew the Bilblical Old and New Testaments well enough to read this book. The book is packed with references to scripture and apostles and miraculous events -- he uses psalms and proverbs ironically.Twain is not a reverent writer, although he has moments of being touched by the history of a place.This edition has a great introduction and notes section by Jane Jacobs -- it's a high quality paperback book.Worth a read."},{"Title":"The innocents abroad;: Or, The new pilgrim's progress ; being some account of the steamship Quaker City's pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land,","review":"This review relates to the Heritage Press edition in green cloth with red and gold on the spine (circa 1962 and probably later.)A classic and simple Heritage design, meant to evoke the 19th century.

Now I know he was much more than that; he is a legend.Coach Wooden discusses his life, from his early days playing basketball on an uneven dirt court with fruit baskets to shoot into, to the passing of his beloved wife. He talks about the great influence of his father and coaches who lovingly taught him to always do his best. He openly shares the mistakes he made, both as a player and a coach, and the lessons he learned from them. He also talks about some of the players he coached, the 12 NCAA championships at UCLA, and what made him most proud. Included are numerous photos from his life. And while basketball is a big focus of the book, it's not the only focus in the book or his life.An inspirational book I can highly recommend to anyone. Coach Wooden is a great role model - something that is unfortunately uncommon among sports figures."},{"Title":"My Personal Best : Life Lessons from an All-American Journey","review":"This book is thin, short, full of pictures, a simple days read, and yet, it is packed with content. This is a journey to the core of Wooden's life. It is simple but complex.In this book you will read about the central concepts that goverened Wooden's life from childhood to his success(s) at UCLA. He skips the details and goes right for the meat in this book. He tells the reader what exactly he learned, at each point along the way, and then we move to the next item of business. There are some fun pictures, a few interesting stories, but tons of little life \\"philosophies\\" that make the read worth it.If you are interested in cutting away the sometimes bulky biography-type text that can follow a wonderful coach and man, and get right to the core of his life's experience, this is the book for you.

When I was growing up, his teams were dominant, but more importantly, they made the game beautiful to watch. After he retired at the peak of his game, he quietly stepped off the stage. With the rush of books on leadership in the 1990's through the present, it was inevitable, and overdue, that folks take time to examine Coach Wooden's approach to leadership. This has led to a cottage industry in Wooden books.This book is short, personal and focuses on life lessons learned from the narrative of Coach's life. It doesn't attempt to be weighty, just a good read, that imparts wisdom without hitting you over the head with it.

He had depth, insight, was spiritual, a reader, a thinker, etc. This was not required, but he knew all these attributes were necessary to grow \\"student athletes\\" into successful players and adults. Even a hippie like Bill Walton, the antithesis to a noble, mature person like Wooden---respects and admires \\"Coach.\\" Wooden knew how to reach all.

His researches range from Siberia to India to Sri Lanka and beyond. In this book he has provided a clear, non-technical introduction to a badly misunderstood field. Included: bibliographic information (including citations of his own studies) and a glossary. The book begins with a discussion of shamanism and its worldview, moves on to regional traditions, talks about shamanism from the shaman's viewpoint, and ends with a brief discussion of the new shamanic \\"movements\\" (fads).As with \\"Far Eastern wisdom\\" reinterpreted and sold by people educated in the West, shamanism has been the target of intense cultural appropriation. A worldwide esoteric spiritual tradition has been diluted into self-help, with guided imagery exercises sold as \\"shamanic journeying.\\" As Vitebsky notes, \\"Many forms of neo-shamanism use elements from North American native religions which I have characterizedin this book as not strictly shamanic. In addition...native organizations have started to criticize some of these systems for cultural imperialism or intellectual piracy.\\" It would seem to be a characteristic of the empire psychology so many of us share but do not see that we feel entitled to uproot practices and traditions that grew up in very different societies instead of exploring our own.A strength of this book is its presentation of shamanism as actually studied in its indigenous contexts. This frees it of the choking layer of common mischaracterizations (e.g., shamanism as dark night of the soul, self-improvement method, or spiritual path for people taking drumming lessons). I often recommend this book in my graduate holistic studies classes because here in California everyone and their mother think of themselves as shamans after attending some workshops and watching a few videos. The real shaman does not decide to become one but is selected from a long shamanic lineage by imaginal guides (\\"spirits\\") whose manifestations vary across cultures. The selectee then works as a shaman if he or she survives the initiatory illness (some do not). Nobody who has lived through the illness would choose to walk it as a spiritual path. It has nothing to do with self-improvement, and genuine shamans sometimes report feeling wounded by it for decades after enduring it.Bonuses of this book include the glossy text stock and beautiful photography. Most of the pictures are small, but evocative, especially the agonized expressions of the shamans who appear throughout the book (e.g., pages 10, 58, 65, 98, and 156). The book also discusses the arduous training the shaman will need for a lifetime of dissociating and painful ecstatic trances that (in the shamanic view) hold the energies of the world community in balance beyond the healing work done with an occasional human client."},{"Title":"Shamanism","review":"This volume provides a good quick reference on the varying aspects and traditions of shamanism. Whilst it doesn't boast the detail of Eliade's Shamanism for example or contain any how to information, it is an excellent introduction for those approaching the subject for the first time. It is beautifully illustrated and does provide enough pointers to guide you in the right direction. It is supplemented by a good bibliography and a list of contacts (although how current the latter are I don't know). Taken for what it is, an introductory text, the book achieves its goal admirably. In my opinion it is also a useful supplement to Eliade by countering the dryness of Eliades text. In summary a readable introduction to the topic."},{"Title":"Shamanism","review":"Vitebsky may have not put together a masterpiece with this book, however there is a multitude of excellent information within its pages. The book covers shamanism cross culturally, so you get a taste of shamanism in Siberia (where it first originated) Africa, South American, North America, and many others. Some of the information in the text may be a little dated or flawed, but if you are someone who is just getting interested in the area of shamanism I highly recommend it. The text is easy to read, has vivid pictures, isn't too dry or boring, and doesn't spend an exorbitant amount of time on any one thing in particular.

Winterset was Anderson's second attempt at dramatizing the Sacco and Vanzetti case, the first being his prose drama, Gods of the Lightning (1928) which he wrote with Harold Hickerson and which dealt with almost the same story in a realistic and propagandistic mode. Winterset was written eight years after the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. By this time Anderson did not wish to write merely a protest drama, as he did in Gods of the Lightning, but one that would transcend the prevalent realistic mode in drama and achieve a certain grandeur unheard of in modern American dramatic scene. At this time Anderson wished that American theater would go beyond the point of \\"journalistic social comment\\" and, occasionally, attain the \\"upper air of poetic tragedy\\". He finally decided to write most of Winterset in blank verse because, to him, prose signified \\"the language of information and poetry the language of emotion\\". In one of his essays, Anderson writes that he believes \\"with the early Bernard Shaw that the theatre is essentially a cathedral of the spirit, devoted to the exaltation of men\\".As the story unfolds in Winterset, one learns that after the execution of Bartolomeo Romagna, who is modelled after Bartolomeo Vanzetti, a professor writes an article about a possible witness for the defence who was never called to testify at the trial. As a result of this, three men come to New York looking for the key witness, Garth. They all come to New York on a quest: either to expose the truth or to suppress it. The whole plot of the play centers on a detective-like quest and the process of discovering the truth of a murder in which the investigators are drawn to the solving of a mysterious crime and the discovery of the true murderer."},{"Title":"Charging Back Up the Hill: Workplace Recovery After Mergers, Acquisitions and Downsizings","review":"Our company, like many others, has gone through merges, acquisitions, downsizings, and other transition. Marks, who is an independent consultant based in San Francisco with experience in over 100 organizational transitions, has written an outstanding book that tells how to revive employee morale, workteam performance, and organizational effectiveness following difficult transitions. Marks knows his stuff--his approach is well grounded in organizational behavior theory, but he presents it in a straight forward way. And, he offers numerous case studies from companies like Pfizer, Seagrams, Qualcomm, and Kyocera.Marks presents a model for helping employees let go of the baggage they gathered from mismanaged mergers and difficult downsizings, so they can look forward to &quot;charge up the hill&quot; and achieve desired business results. This book is a must for any senior executives who has led a company through a difficult period--or for one who has taken over a firm after a merger or other tough period. It also is very helpful for middle managers and other employees. Marks shows them how to focus on what they can control over their work situation rather than fret about what they cannot control.The book is enlightening, helpful, and not jargony. Am I gushing too much? Let me just say that after I read it, I bought ten copies of the book for my team!"},{"Title":"Rabid Growth","review":"At first, I was really disappointed with this book because it turns out that it is the sequel to _Possessions_. No where on the book's cover, or inside flaps is this pivotal fact mentioned. I had to look it up online to figure out why something felt missing... And since the ending of _Possessions_ is definitively given away in this sequel, I am not really in any rush to go back and read it. Maybe someday...That aside, I did enjoy this book quite a bit. The narration was refreshing and the characters were likable. The end also seems pretty open-ended, so I will keep an eye out for a third book in this series. There were a lot of gaps in the plot, but it didn't bother me too much, since this book was mostly all about excitement."},{"Title":"Rabid Growth","review":"After battling and defeating no less than an evil god in Moore's previous Leisure novel POSSESSIONS, Chris Corin wants nothing more than to kick back and try to put his chaotic life in order. His hopes are dashed, however, when he learns that his friend Jerry is suffering from an affliction which is consuming his entire body, transforming him into something \\"other\\". It appears that Jerry and many others who were exposed to the now dead evil entity are carrying the seeds of a new, potentially greater evil in their decaying bodies. Unfortunately for Chris, destiny has decreed that he is the only one who can defeat this new threat.A direct sequel to POSSESSIONS, RABID GROWTH offers an answer to the question, \\"Just what does happen to a \\"big bad\\" once it is ostensibly vanquished?\\" Most books would have you believe that the protagonists live happily ever after. RABID GROWTH offers no such solace, which stands to reason, since the evil faced in POSSESSION was on a cosmic level. Surely then, some vestiges of that evil must still survive, and may even come to thrive again in other forms.Satisfying on that level, RABID GROWTH also offers a captivating and realistic cast of characters, all people you'll feel you've come to know well by the time you finish. Moore is obviously very comfortable with these players, although that familiarity sometimes works against him in regard to readers who come to RABID GROWTH without first reading POSSESSIONS. In light of the overall quality of the novel, however, that's only a minor criticism. Moore's sheer storytelling skills continue to appeal -- if you liked his previous works, you're apt to enjoy this one too."},{"Title":"Rabid Growth","review":"Not knowing this was a continuation of Possessions, certainly clouds my perceptions of this book. Most authors who write series books refer to characters or events in previous books and if they are any good - they can pull off a stand-alone book, where it doesn't really matter if you've read those coming before (I speak of John Sanford's 'Prey' series as an example). Moore, obviously cannot do this. Very disjointed and dependent on Possessions. You may get more out of this book if you read that one first - but that may be a stretch in my opinion."},{"Title":"Rabid Growth","review":"let me start by saying i am a huge fan of Mr.Moore. i have spoken with him before and i truly think he is a good guy and a great writer however i was not satisfied with the rabid growth. for those who don't know this is a sequel to his previous novel possessions.this book deals with the consequnces of what happened in the first novel and if you haven't read it you should. this story take's place around chris corin and his sister and friends and how they are recovering from what happened at the end of possessions. apparently not very well because chris still hasn't gotten his lottery money and his sister is a nympho at the age of 14.apparently there are still thing's out there that don't like chris very much and he spends the novel being stalked and fighting them off. what these things are and where they come from is not really explained which is a big complaint of mine. i like to know why thing's are happening maybe that is just being too picky.my main complaint is just that...i dont know what the thing's chasing chris are and what there motivations were in the first book i thought things would be explained in this book but they weren't.the ending of possessions promised so much but i ont think it came through with many answers. this book is action packed and exciting but ultimately a let down in the end. i can only hope for another sequel to explain things.i suggest people who want to read good horror read james moores under the overtree and it's sequel serenity falls which are great and have one of the best hero's ever to grace the pages of a novel."},{"Title":"Rabid Growth","review":"I would suggest this book for new horror readers under the age of 25. Lots of loose ends even for a series book. It had some slightly scary parts but not much to leave to the imagination. You can go from Moore to Koontz but not the other way around. Being an avid Koontz fan, this was rather flat."},{"Title":"Rabid Growth","review":"I haven't even read POSSESSIONS to get the full gist of this fantastic story. Moore's very realistic characters and great writing style make this book fly, along with tremendous horror sequences. Creepy and weird with some head-spinning scenes.

After his mother's death, he became the legal guardian for his fifteen year old sister Brittany who is going through puberty and challenging his authority every chance she can. His maternal grandmother, who he has never met and who his mother never talked about, challenges him for custody of Brittany. He is the winner of millions of dollars in the lottery but with al the paperwork that has to be taken care of, he barely has enough money to buy food.There has been an enormous increase in the homeless population and the men are violent. One of the men who became extremely violent is taken to jail where he dies. The police lose the body and later Chris sees him walking the streets. Chris' friend Jerry, as well as other people in town, who were affected by the events that took place last year (see POSSESSIONS) are changing, becoming something other than human. Chris tries to help his friend while trying to prevent being killed or worse by the others that have changed into something alien.James A. Moore is one of the best new horror writers of the twenty first century as he can hold his own wilt the greats including Clive Barker, Bentley Little, Stephen King and Robert Mccammon. Be advised that this book should be read with all the lights on and they should not be turned off even when the reader goes to sleep. The story starts off in a mundane fashion but changes so subtly readers will feel they are in the Twilight Zone without an idea of how they got there.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Slow Dance Heart Break Blues","review":"Arnold Adoff captures the essence of being a fumbling, embarassed teenager through his poems.

This takes you through the events following a collision between a car and a motorcycle. It records the event as seen from the point of view of eight different witnesses, all who may or may not have seen what they think they saw. This may not sound like it would make for fascinating reading, but trust me on this, it really does! The writing is superb, the plot speeds along (no pun intended), and the characterizations are often hilarious. Suffice to say that this is not your ordinary mystery. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up!"},{"Title":"Independent Witness (Colonel Brain)","review":"You can get the whole book by reading the first chapter and the last, but if you do that then you'll miss the oddity of the book. The humor is excellent. I caught myself laughing on the metro a few times. Every person should read Henry's books because they help you learn the legal procedures not only of UK but also of the US. What does it mean to be a witness to an accident? How do you know if what you saw was really what happened? Through the legal proceedings you will learn to ignore some faults you may have in the way you may present your very case as well (if you should end up in the court room for any reason). The ending will surprise you."},{"Title":"Independent Witness (Colonel Brain)","review":"I read this book because of a great review in the NY Times. I agree with the 2 other reviews, so won't repeat their comments. I have to say that the book is laugh-out-loud funny. I consider it to be a farce, which is normally not the kind of book I'd seek out. But Henry Cecil was so clever & witty in defining his characters & situations, that it was irresistible. It didn't matter where I was when I read it: restaurant, hair dresser, etc. No matter how hard I might have tried, I couldn't keep from laughing aloud. I wouldn't try, even if I could; why keep all that delight to myself?"},{"Title":"Independent Witness (Colonel Brain)","review":"This is a humorous legal British mystery first published in 1963. A car and a motorcycle collide and after a brief pause, the car driver leaves the scene of the accident. Many folks at a nearby pub are on hand to help the injured motorcyclist and to speak to the police about what they saw. None of them has any connection to the men involved in the accident (i.e., they are independent witnesses) and all claim the car driver ran the halt sign. An M.P. confesses to being the driver but insists he stopped at the sign, albeit briefly. He claims he left the scene because he had just had a panic-inducing call from his sick wife.Much of the book consists of the courtroom examination and cross-examination of the independent witnesses. Some of them are quite eccentric, and their testimony is a hoot. The only sour note is struck when the author briefly goes off a tangent that minimizes the plight of domestic violence victims. I grimaced but kept reading. As Cecil was a judge, I especially wish his views were more enlightened. Yet the passage could very well be somewhat *less* offensive than a typical judge's view of domestic violence four decades ago. That bit aside, this was a quick, fun, and amusing read."},{"Title":"Playboy (JULY 1991 TALL GIRLS /SPIKE LEE INTERVIEW)","review":"I like this issue because of the black-and-white photograph of elegantly-naked Dawn Wildsmith laying on her abdomen on a bed on page 175.

With memories of the film firmly etched in my mind, I decided to read Schaefer's novel, to go to the source itself and see whether the book is better than the movie. I have to say Shane as a novel is a must read, even more important than watching the film version.The plot should be familiar to many people. The Starrett family is working some land in Wyoming, trying to cut a living out of the rugged landscape. Several other families are staking claims in the area even though Fletcher, the big rancher in the region, hates their presence and is working behind the scenes to drive them out. The homesteaders look to Joe Starrett to protect their interests in the face of this intimidation, a battle Joe is slowly losing until the arrival of Shane.When Shane arrives, he quickly takes up residence with the Starrett family, working as a hand around the place. Within a short period of time Shane finds himself sucked into the feud between Fletcher and the homesteaders. Ranch hands goad Shane into several violent fistfights, although Shane goes out of his way to avoid trouble. As the level of conflict escalates and the dangerous qualities of Shane emerge, Fletcher brings in a hired gun from the outside to deal with the troublesome homesteaders for the last time. The final scenes of the novel balance gripping action with the heartrending departure of Shane back into the wilderness from which he came.Schaefer pulls off a triumph of epic proportions with this short novel. Not only is the story told in a sparse, no nonsense style, Schaefer makes Joe Starrett's son Bob the narrator of the story. Through this touchingly innocent narration, Bob manages to convey the mysterious qualities of Shane while still revealing adult themes. For example, a rather platonic love emerges between Shane and Marion, Bob's mother. Joe knows about the love springing up between the two but chooses to keep it in perspective. The beauty of this incident is how Bob relates it; he discusses it just as a child would, without really understanding the implications of the situation while the reader understands perfectly what is happening. Brilliant, just brilliant!Shane is the main character of the novel even though we do not learn much about him. Shane is an enigma clad in dark clothing, riding in off the land like some mysterious omen of doom. Schaefer tells us nothing about Shane's past, although it is obvious he is a master with a pistol and that he has a checkered past involving trouble of some sort. Whatever trouble Shane is in, he is what we would call \\"good people.\\" Shane wants to avoid conflict, but he will never back down from a fight or fail to help people who treat him as a friend. His past haunts his actions, making him reluctant to rely on his seemingly vast reservoirs of strength. When pushed to the wall, Shane lashes out with a terrible violence usually kept in check because he knows what he is capable of doing to a man.There are several themes arcing their way through this book. One deals with fate and how it is impossible to escape your past. Another involves violence; not reckless violence of the type employed by Fletcher and his goons, but a measured violence used to solve a seemingly insolvable situation. Schaefer shows us that no matter what our intentions in this life, there are going to be times when violence in the name of a cause is the only answer to those who are incapable of relying on any method other than intimidation to get what they want out of life.This is an excellent read for any type of reader both young and old, although that does not make it a necessarily easy book. The bare bones writing style makes it very easy to gloss over important themes and symbolisms. In other words, \\"Shane\\" is a book to think about both when reading it and after finishing the story. Reading the story more than once may not be a bad idea, as more themes are sure to emerge from this fascinating character study. Schaefer dedicated \\"Shane,\\" his first book, to his first son. What a beautiful and wondrous tribute."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I'm a 7th grader who just finished writing this review for my class and my teacher accused me of cheating. She said it was too good for a 7th grader to write. My mother suggested that I send my review in and consider it a vote of confidence. This action-filled western fiction, set in the late 1880's has an unpredictable ending. When a restless gunman rides into a hard working, god-fearing family, they provide him with honest work and stability. The untouchable gunman changes his negative actions into positive actions by fighting for justice of the commom man in a Wyoming valley of corrupted cattlemen. The setting provided a historic look into the past of the taming of the west and its enduring bloodshed of the ending of open ranges and the beginning of grazing wars between the farming homesteaders and the established ranchers. The main character's defenses of isolation and destitute unravel into a caring, justice-seeking, loyal man whose attributes contribrute to the small homesteading community. Finding his acceptance among man, the main character, unpredictably returns to his engraved dynamics of aloneness and shatters the lives of the people who grew so close to him. This novel impressed upon my mind the cliche'&quot;The road to heaven is paved with good intentions&quot;, showing me that he couldn't distance his past and feel comfortable in his own skin where ever he roamed. SHANE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE A NEGATIVE TO A POSITIVE-BUT I SURE CAN! JESSE MILLER"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Unlike the reviewer &quot;Barb from Oregon,&quot; I believe everything she found detestable in Shane is what makes it a great western. Her firts complaint was to the shallow development of the Shane character. I believe the author intentionally left his past dim, his motivations unkown, as part of the &quot;hero&quot; motif. As to violence--it's a western story depicting a range war, not a court proceeding. The author shows Joe's muscles ripping his shirt in the bar fight for a reason. From the perspective of his son, it was vitally important that he see his father as strong, otherwise his admiration of Shane may have overshadowed his father.Wild Bill recommends this book for any reader interested in a portrayal of the wild west in its legendary form."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"He was clean-shaven and his face was lean and hard and burned from high forehead to firm,tapering chin. His eyes seemed hooded in the shadow of the hat's brim. He came closer, and Icould see that this was because the brows were drawn in a frown of fixed and habitual alertness.Beneath them the eyes were endlessly searching from side to side and forward, checking off everyitem in view, missing nothing. As I noticed this, a sudden chill, I could not have told why, struckthrough me there in the warm and open sun.Well, we all know why that chill ran through little Bob as Shane rode up to the Starrett homestead in the Wyoming Territory in the summer of 1889, because Shane was a lethal, albeit reluctant, gunslinger. This slender American classic tells the story, familiar to every cultured American from the great George Stevens' movie (1953), of how Shane, fleeing a mysterious but obviously violent past, was befriended by the Starretts and stayed on to help them fight off the predatory intentions of the valley's big rancher and his evil henchmen. It is a story that is central to the American mythos.The great Westerns penetrate deep within the American psyche; they strike a chord that lies somewhere within our national character, just waiting to be plucked. I believe that their unique power derives from a truly elemental facet of democracy--that in order for men to enjoy the freedom that a democracy allows, they must be able to depend on the fundamental goodness of their fellow men. An unyielding, self enforcing morality is a prerequisite for a political system based on liberty; men are unwilling to limit the coercive power of government when they live in fear of one another.Certainly the Western and the code of the West represent a sanitized and romanticized view of the Frontier and the men who tamed it, but it is a romance that serves the democratic purpose. These morality tales are instructive and aspirational. Of course men like Shane are archetypes in a kind of a national myth making:There were sharp hidden hardnesses in him. But these were not for us. He was dangerous asmother had said. But not to us as father too had said. And he was no longer a stranger. He was aman like a father in whom a boy could believe in the simple knowing that what was beyondcomprehension was still clean and solid and right.This is a little boy's impossible view of a hero, but here we see that the character of Joe Starrett is equally important. Joe Starrett is a simple sod farmer, but he is kind and decent and honest and courageous, the equal of Shane in every respect except for speed on the draw. Joe is the true yeoman hero of this tale and one of the duties that Shane performs is to demonstrate this fact to young Bob (and to us).Stories like Shane are a product of a time when Americans genuinely believed in democratic ideals and in the American Dream. They express our native confidence that we can produce men who will measure up these standards. It is no coincidence that the Western died in the mid-60's along with the sense of confidence in our national purpose. It is also unsurprising that it was Ronald Reagan, that hero of myriad Westerns, who stanched the bleeding and made people believe again, however briefly.Here is just one other example of the instructive nature of these stories. This is Shane, teaching Bob to shoot:&quot;Listen, Bob. A gun is just a tool. No better and no worse than any other tool, a shovel--or an axeor a saddle or a stove or anything. Think of it always that way. A gun is as good--and as bad--asthe man who carries it. Remember that.&quot;Think of the level of personal responsibility that this attitude assumes. Contrast it with the near fascist drive to abolish gun rights today. The underlying argument of the forces of gun control is that guns are evil in and of themselves, regardless of the men who wield them. This is part and parcel of the Democrat myth of the '90s. Which do you think is more likely to foster good citizenship, holding guns responsible for violence or holding men responsible?As for me, I choose the classic Westerns and the democratic ideals that they convey, over the moral relativism that permeates our current culture.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Three reasons this Critical Edition is superior to the usual trade paperback edition. First, there are dozen of good essays written by book and film critics included within the pages. Second, this edition is true to the original, in the sense that it wasn't edited, and was printed in the original layout format.

If you think the book was &quot;about a stump&quot; you are too young to be reading beyond grade school level. Jack Schaefer had a hugely powerful grasp of the West and of Western characters, and he left us a legacy with this book that can never be topped. That's coming from a man who reads Kirby Jonas's novels on audio tape. I enjoy Kirby Jonas's books to no end, and I know of no better author, but Jack Schaefer's &quot;SHANE&quot; is a book for anyone to strive to match. It is an all-time classic that I would put hand in hand with Kirby Jonas's DEATH OF AN EAGLE.

I saw the movie when it first came out. I was a New York City area kid then, and I fell in love with the Tetons where it was filmed. I then bought the book and loved it. I was captured very early by the scene involving Shane and Joe Starrett and Ledyard, the phony salesman. When Ledyard asks Starrett how he can take the word of a stranger, Shane, Starrett responds: &quot;I can figure men for myself. I'll take his word on anything he wants to say any day of God's whole year.&quot; I still get chills re-reading those words; I still strive to live so others might say that of me. Can there be any higher praise? So... read it, and give it to your kids. If you have brought them up right, Shane will become one of their heroes and perhaps they will &quot;grow strong and straight&quot; as Shane wishes for young Joey Starrett in the book."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Jack Schaefer has set his story at the time of Wyoming's Johnson County \\"wars\\" between cattlemen and anyone, like rustlers and homesteaders, who cut into their profits. First published in 1949, the novel also reflects something of the war that had just ended for Americans who fought in Europe and the Pacific. We have a young family struggling to put down roots on the frontier, wanting little more than an ordered life and the opportunity to make a living among a gathering of neighbors who want the same for their own families.But they are prevented by men who want the open range for themselves and their own economic interests, and they'll stop at nothing to get their way. While the father of the family attempts bravely to hold his own, his neighbors are intimidated, feeling threatened and outnumbered. Shane, a man with a shadowy past, arrives in the middle of this conflict, and while he assumes for a time the life of a hired hand, his gunslinger services are eventually needed to defend the lives and property of the family that has given him a home. We see what we have suspected, that he is a killer, and there's no place for him in their sunny, settled world. He must go back on the trail and disappear.Given the time in which it was written, \\"Shane\\" is a commentary on the role of violence in a world where law and order, on an international level, had been in short supply. Americans - and especially returning soldiers - had seen this for themselves. The novel carries this disturbing awareness right into the daily life of home and hometown. The mystery of Shane's identity suggests that what he represents in the story is a darker side of ourselves that does not integrate well with the more honorable aspects of self we prefer to acknowledge.The simplicity of Schaefer's tale, and his choice of a boy as narrator, allow readers to fill in a lot of details and emotions that tap into their own deeper fears and desires. The two men joining forces to uproot the tree stump is like a scene from a dream that wants to be understood - it's not just about a tree stump. But what? While the film for all its widescreen glory is not without merit, it's dated in a way the book may never be. In its 250+ pages, it speaks of elemental forces and how we go about living in a world where we are threatened by circumstances beyond our control.Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for assembling this critical edition which includes several fine essays providing historical background, analysis of the text, commentary and reviews on the film adaptation."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This tale of the mysterious stranger who rides in from the distant hills and rides off again, in the end, is mythic archetype of the first order. Shane, unknown and brooding, finds a place for himself at a little farmstead where he is befriended by the farmer's young son, trying desperately to shed his past and make a new and simpler life for himself among the good homesteaders who surround him. But the scheming cattle barons in the area, who control the town and seek to drive the homesteaders out make this impossible. The farmer and his wife who have befriended Shane are already being sucked into a confrontation, not of their own making, in which they must give up everything they have and flee their valley, along with their kind, or stand and fight and be destroyed by the cattlemen who want to keep the range free, at whatever the cost. Shane, the mystery man, tries to help the farmers stand up to the cowboy bullies sent by the ranchers but matters get out of hand when the head rancher, frustrated by Shane's presence and backbone, calls in a ruthless gunman from nearby Cheyenne to bring matters to a head. But Shane is more than what he seems as our little boy narrator and the cattle barons and the farmer and his wife soon find out and the tale culminates in a final confrontation which is emotionally powerful as strong men face one another in a battle for justice and right. A great, if rather short, tale, the epitome of the Old West. I loved this book and the movie that came after it. By the way, Clint Eastwood's film, Pale Rider, is another re-make, albeit with some variations, of this very wonderful novel.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"great book I have read it three times. The author did such a good job that I felt as if I knew Shane myself and was just as upset as family when he had to go."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"SHANE is my all-time favorite movie and I got the Audio Book to see how well the movie version followed the original novel. I was thrilled in listening to learn that the book is even better than the movie version. The character that SHANE portrays has always moved me-the stranger riding into the valley,befriending the homesteading family and in the end triumphing over evil,then moving on. Although SHANE is a fictional character,he is still a hero to me and this Audio Book along with the DVD of the movie make great companions."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This classic western provides a nicely readable tale about good, evil, plus longing for serenity and running from one's past. Shane is a drifter reluctant to discuss and eager to escape from his gunfighting past. He rides into a Wyoming settlement one day in 1889, where he meets the family of Joe and Marion Starrett, plus their young son Bob. The Starretts take him on as a valuable hired hand, and Shane soon learns of the struggled of Starrett and the other farmers against cattle baron Luke Fletcher. The disagreement involves rights to land and water. Such matters are generally decided by the courts, but the law is three days ride away. Thus matters may end up being decided by pluck, shrewdness, and the six-shooter. Complicating matters, Fletcher has brought in a hired gun named Wilson, who soon guns down one of the other farmers. All builds to the obvious climax certain to involve the two gunman and possibly several other characters.The book makes an excellent story, although most readers probably have already seen the 1952 movie starring Alan Ladd in the title role. Clearly worth a look - the book and the film."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is a western about a family in Wyoming and about a drifter who rides into their lives. It is told in the first-person by a boy - the son of Mr. and Mrs. Starrett.I think this story is amazing. It grabs me and holds me on the edge of my seat.The author does a great job of deepening each of the main characters - except for Shane . . . Shane's past remains mysterious.I have read this more times than I can count.This is a story about a man who cannot avoid his past. About a boy who learns how to be a man. And a husband/wife who show the kind of guts it takes to put down roots in some far-away land. I am deeply inspired every time I read this."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I have taught \\"Shane\\" for many years to my Junior classes.

Lawrence) and can only hope to elicit a small portion of the emotion from readers that either Shane or Old Yeller yanked out of my heart.To be sure, there are a lot of good, heart-wrenching stories available.

There is almost no action throughout the book until the last few chapter because the whole book is centered around how a cowboy stays on a farm and a kid's perspective of the story. A few of the chapters were just dialogue about absolutely nothing. And how much do we really to know about the cowboy anyways! If you want a book with good symbolism and connotation with still some action you should read The Giver. Overall, one a scale of 1 to 10, this book is a -1!

I'm one of those &quot;pre-high-school kids&quot; who read Shane in class. And, though I don't like to be cliche, I hated it.Somebody said before that this novel had little character development. I have to agree. Jack Schaefer is excellent at fight and appearance description, but our characters are left as empty clothes waiting to be filled. We know Shane is a tall, dark, and handsome gunslinger trying to escape his past, but we don't know what he's escaping from or anything else about him. And his character seems to change dramatically throughout the text. When he first arrives in the valley, Shane is hesitant to involve himself with anything, wanting only to stay at the Starrett's for a night. Joe persuades him to stay and work on his farm, and as time passes Shane gradually becomes more involved in the valley's affairs. I can see this happening. But Shane seems always quiet and, yes, still hesitant. I can't see Shane losing his cool in everyday life. This is supported by his actions throughout the book, especially by his tenderly wiping the blood from Chris's face after breaking his arm. But after Johnson's bringing the news of Wilson's arrival, Shane pushes past him saying roughly, &quot;You'll only ever be a farmer.&quot; I can't see Shane doing this.Another point my friends and I poke fun at is all the violence. Schaefer describes, in detail, each punch landed and each bone splintered. I can see how this adds to Shane's prowess in fights, but I find it overly descriptive. There is no point in, for example, telling us how Joe's shirt rips off his back and reveals bulging, rippling muscles. I find this unbelievable, unnecessary, and revolting.So to anyone out there, be you English teacher, avid book reader, or a Western fanatic, I advise you to stay away from Shane.Second thought--you Western fanatics might like it. *shrug*"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I thought it was an interesting book.

Read it and you'll believe it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The Starretts are examples of the pioneering sprit. This is shown to us in the story Shane, in many different ways. When the Starretts establish themselves somewhere new and start a family, by taking in and helping out someone they didn't know, and Joe Starrett not giving up on the stump. In the year of 1889 the move that was happening across Northern America had relatively come to a holt and the Starretts were one of the last to settle down and start a family on the new plains. They stopped at a small place in Wyoming and set up their family. To do this would be a strong effort as the pain and pressure that people went though in the cross of Northern America was quite large. There is a poem about the great movement across Northern America that applies to what the Starretts would have gone through. &quot; The cowards never started and the week died on the road and all across the continent the endless camp fires glowed.&quot; This captures the essence of the movement across Northern America and the feelings that the Starretts would have had. In the story the Starrett family take on a new member to their family, a man titled Shane. When the Starretts did this it showed that they had compassion for others that had traveled the same journey as them and that they were willing to help someone that they didn't know. When the Starretts were moving across Northern America, they would have been tired and happy to see a warm and friendly face, so they gave water and food to Shane to show that they would help him. When Joe and Shane started working on the stump in the property of the Starretts, the pioneering sprit was shown again by both Shane and Joe. They were both very determined to remove the stump out of the ground and get it out of their lives. Joe and Shane never gave up on the stump, they kept at it till it gave way and did what the Starretts wanted it to. Thanks Adam Tierney"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The story of a boy's transition from boyhood to manhood in this classic Western is a story of passion, excitement, adventure, and that magical sense that is associated with the Old West."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane by Jack Schaefer is a well-written classic that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This story takes place in the West during the 1800's.Shane, a man of a mysterious unknown past, rides into the Starrett's farm while farmers turn to examine him intently. He is a man of medium build, dark skin, and a thin, tight face with a body as hard as steel. But the thing that catches the eye the most is his clothes. He has a nice shirt, jeans, a handkerchief around his neck, and a big, black hat. Definitely, his nice clothes are uncommon in such a plain farm community as this. He is a gunslinger, but something in his past keeps him from wearing a gun.The whole town wonders about him, and even more so when he ends up working as a farmhand for the Starretts. However, they do not know how deeply involved he would become when Fletcher, a cattle rancher who lived across the river from the farmers, tries to take the farmer's land for his cattle to graze. When Fletcher hires an expert gunslinger to \\"convince\\" the farmers to back down, only Shane can stop him, but will he?Shane is a wonderfully written story that depicts the conflict that farmers and ranchers faced in fighting for land in the West. This Western novel will not disappoint you with its interesting characters and nail-biting plot. I recommend this book to any one 10 or older that likes Westerns and classic novels."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The book 'Shane' is very exciting. Good interpretation of symbols and an open mind is required to thoroughly enjoy this masterpiece. It is not simply about a boy and his family and a stump. Several themes are found in this novel: Attitudes to Power and Authority being the most prominent. Authority is seen in Joe Starrett. He is not chosen as leader nor were the homesteaders forced to comply with his decision to be leader but it was just accepted that he was their representative. On the contrary, Fletcher acquires his power because he already owns most of the land in that area and could be considered the wealthiest man. He abuses this power by forcing his ranch hands to bully the homesteaders into moving off the land. Fletcher becomes a despised character because of this abuse of power and it is noticed that when Fletcher was away the ranch hands were actually friendly with the homesteaders. Another theme is Love and Family Relationships: All through the book, the strong bond of the Starrett family is displayed. One instance is when the narrator (Bob- the son)remarks that he and his father would paint the house in rainbow colours just to please Marian (the mother). Another example is when Shane decided to face Wilson (a gun fighter hired by Fletcher) and Fletcher alone. Starrett was the one requested to face Wilson but Shane, knowing that Joe could easily be injured, knocked him out and went to the saloon. Other themes like: Heroism, Attitudes to the Past, Women In Society, among others are found in this novel. This is truly a work of art!!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This book is about a guy named Shane who rides into Wyoming who is very mysterious.

It's too detailed and far too complex for my taste. About 2 chapters of the book talks about a man and Shane chopping at some big old stump, and the characters are all astonished and proud of them. It really makes no sense to me. I do not recommend this book to ANY high-school student if you need to read a book for school."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Given the status of this book as an icon of Westerns, I was a little disappointed with the execution of this simple story.The book starts with a situation that has become a staple, if not a stereotype, of Western drama. Big rancher Fletcher is expanding his herd, and that means that he needs to drive out a handful of homesteaders who are encroaching on his water source. The homesteaders are led in their resistance by Joe Starrett, the young narrator's strong-bodied and strong-willed father.The disagreement has been stewing for a long time, but things come to a head after two important events occur: first, Fletcher gains a government contract that will allow him to move far more beef, making his situation a desperate one. Second, Starrett hires on Shane, a well-dressed man with a mysterious past who carries a sense of danger and sadness around him like a cloak.Any Western fan will be able to see what's coming next. From the moment Bob (the young narrator) see him riding in from the horizon, Shane is obviously an ass-kicker and a sharpshooter. We therefore know that he will kick some ass and shoot sharply by the end of the book, and we are not disappointed.I actually like the plot, which is a classic confrontation between the honest and strong citizen, and the greedy and well-resourced bigwig. My problem lays more in the writing itself, which telegraphs every move long before it comes. What's worse, there is a lot of \\"telling, not showing,\\" and also a lot of time is spent dwelling on the obvious, and treating the special relationship between Starrett and Shane as though it needed constant explaining. The action was also unrealistic in parts, including a fight scene in which Starrett literally picks a struggling, hefty grown man up above his head and hurls him across the room.The main attraction in this slim novel is the character of Shane, who can do everything twice as well as the next man. He is a man trying his best to escape his violent past by tilling the earth and spending time with good country people. But his plans are laid to waste when violence erupts around him, and we get the feeling that this has happened to him before.This is a quick, easy read, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from picking it up and passing an afternoon with these characters. But I would keep my expectations in check, and be prepared to move on to some Louis LaMour, which is a step up."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I think that the book Shane was a good book, but I only like the ending aand a few other parts about the story.

This is the &quot;classic western novel&quot; that everyone has been raving about? &quot;Shane&quot; lacks the elements of a good story almost completely. There is frighteningly little character development, and I find it a little strange that the reader knows next to nothing about the title character. Since other reviwers have already mentioned that pretty much nothing happens in this book, I will focus on the lack of information about Shane. The only concrete fact about Shane is that he has a mysterious past. Anything else that might be said about him is inferred,(as are most traits attributed to members of the Starrett family). Also, I believe that Schaefer pushed the whole &quot;Shane's past haunts him&quot; thing a little too far. The reader is constantly reminded of how &quot;poor Shane had something bad happen to him&quot;. This started to get old about 30 pgs in, and to add insult to injury, we are never told exactly what this &quot;bad thing&quot; was. Within literature it is sometimes for the best to leave things ambiguous, but usually, the piece of information that is never going to be told to the reader is not hinted at and/or alluded to every other page. It seemed to me that Shane's past was a vital part... scratch that, one of the only parts of his overall character. Ultimately, reading this book felt like watching the sequal to a movie I'd never seen, mostly because of the huge gaps in information about the characters. Without interesting characters, even a story with excellent prose and plot can fall flat. Shane, which had neither of these to begin with, was utterly dissapointing."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Don't get me wrong, the guy has talent. To fit a 1 paragraph story into a 119 page book takes skill. If Schaefer had any plot to the storey, it might actulally have been a good book. But it wasn't.

There is absolutely no one that could play the part but Alan Ladd. If you know Alan Ladd, and as you read the book, you will realize that Shane was written for this great actor. This book just has everything meant for a good western. However, as much as I like westerns and realize how proud these Western men are, I did not like the ending. I wanted Joe Starrett to go after Shane and make sure his wound was tended to. But, in the great scheme of things I realize that it really doesn't matter. Shane did what he was intended to do and then he sailed off into the sunset. God Bless Shane and Jack Schaefer. You can find out what type of a man wrote this book and it is too bad we never got to know him any better. We all missed out on this great man's life, but, he left us Shane and this was important."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"i read this in 1949 at the age of 7. i have never gotten over the simple moving hard reality of this book. \\"it's not you i want shane, it's starrett\\" ... \\"what you want and what you'll get are two different things, wilson.\\"and earlier, when chris went up against shane with a partner who backed out, \\"what's wrong, do you know him?\\", \\"no one can say that, I'm leaving, that's all.\\"so a man can grow up straight inside as a man should. ... this language has made an indelible impression on me my whole life. and i am, as my friend says, \\" a bed wetting liberal democrat\\"!i just recommend you read the book first rather than watch the movie. but afterwards the movie is pretty special too, particularly the role of the child.the thing i noticed as a kid was that in the book the lead character shane was a martial arts specialist who just dismantled the cowboys he fought, while the movie character was just a slug it out hollywood amateur of the standard species, i knew even then a man alone could not win a fight against odds without training. i confirmed that in my high school basketball days against teenaged thugs.this is a simplistic, pre- clint eastwood type movie and book (compare it to pale rider to see where clint borrowed from this one), but it is hard to resist. and of course it features one of the most memorable performances of jack palance's career. In pale rider it takes stockburn and a half dozen deputies to approach the menace of palance alone.(The disappointed reviews from some teen agers here who found the book too complex, detailed, boring, or otherwise difficult are really sobering. Apparently even the comic books we read in the 1940's [count of monte cristo, les miserables, ...] would have been over these kids' heads. But to be fair, the only required reading i ever enjoyed was by dostoevsky and dickens. And four stars is not criticism here, I mean Don Quixote only gets 5 stars, and maybe alan mendelsohn the boy from mars.)"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Not sure how, but I read the book before I saw the movie, a long time ago. The book was profoundly moving to me, but I never read it again until the other day, when I saw it in a used book store for 25 cents, many years later. Well, its just as meaningful as ever now, and maybe even more so. Told by the son Bob, an adult now but looking back on his experience, it mixes a youngster's awe and naivete with a grown-up's perspective and understanding of subtlety.Very short (119 pages) and concise, it gives us a symbolic, archetypal, mythic hero in a realistic setting. Shane is too good to be true, but that's how a young boy would see him. He's a combination of a Christ-figure and a great warrior as well as a hardworking, able ranch-hand. Extremely competent and sure of himself in any setting, he seems superhuman to the wide-eyed Bob. His mother Marian likes Shane no less, and in fact falls in love with him, a fact that Bob's father Joe accepts because he too admires and respects Shane and loves Marian so much that he wants her to be happy whatever she chooses. But Shane is far too noble to take advantage of the situation because he loves the Starretts no less than they love him.Shane himself is deliberately kept as mysterious as possible, but we get hints here and there about his past. One good example is his treatment of Chris, Fletcher's cowhand. Shane is clearly seeing a reminder from his own past when he looks at Chris and is as kind to him as possible under the circumstances. He had no doubt started out as a good man but probably became very much like Stark Wilson, the hired gun, and been repulsed by his own actions, finally ending up at the Starretts' ranch very much in need of redemption. The family's acceptance and love deeply impresses him and finally leaves him with no choice but to sacrifice himself for them. All this despite the situation being the ideal set-up for him - all he has to do is let Joe go to town and get killed by Wilson and he will have everything he covets. Joe actually makes it clear that he wants Marian and Shane to be happy together and consummate their feelings for each other after he's dead, and Bob would certainly accept Shane as a father in that case.But Shane is a very complex, albeit shadowy figure and so he steps in for Joe and faces Wilson - and he's the only man who can. This book is also deceptively complicated and is about lots of things, not just homesteaders standing up to a cruel cattle baron. Its about honor and courage and integrity and different kinds of love and is seen through the hero-worshipping eyes of a young boy. The movie was great, too, but in a different way. Alan Ladd was too Roy Rogers-ish for me in his physical appearance (nothing against Roy, that's for sure); he just lacked some of the darkness and moral ambiguity that I pictured in Shane when he first arrives in the book. Ladd looked more like a trick-shot artist from a traveling Wild West show than a sinister gunfighter. Don't forget, on the very first page of the book he rides up to a fork in the road - the left branch leads to Fletcher's ranch and the right to the homesteaders, and he thinks it over before making his choice. But there's no question that Ladd did a fantastic job in his own style and its a classic western film - maybe the best ever. I just imagined Shane as being very much like the Jack Palance character, only heartsick and ashamed of what he had become and anxious for another chance, which the Starrett family gave to him so freely and unconditionally.Anyway, this book is a small gem that packs a lot of different themes into a short, seemingly simple tale. I can't recommend it highly enough. I'm a grown man and it still makes me cry."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I just recently finished 149 page book that you could say has taken me 30 years to finish and is considered by many to be the best Western novel of all time, Shane by Jack Schaefer.Shane was actually the first book I'd ever read that had no illustrations. I can't remember why, but one time in 5th grade, a few us had to stay in upper-grade classroom, and with nothing better for us to do, the teacher had us grab a book off the shelf to read. So basically I read the first few chapters and those first few chapters have always stuck with me and I always meant to go back and finish. It's weird how these things work -out sometimes, but I finally did. All I can say is; what the heck took me so long! For its size, Shane is one of the most well written and emotionally impacting books I've ever read.Mr. Schaefer's skill at projecting emotion and his ability to just \\"imply\\" what's going-on with out actually telling the reader is nothing short of amazing. Many mysteries are teasingly never solved in the story but the conclusion still has no less of an impact.Shane should be considered a modern classic. It's a must read for fans of Western fiction, a great first Western for any new-comers, and should definitely be on the list for literary scholars."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Unlike most students, when I read this novella in 8th grade I actually liked it.

The description of this novella sounds like the archetypal Western. You have a lone gunman, a battle that can't be avoided and the inevitable showdown. Yet Shane refuses to fit the Western mold.The action sequences are few and most of the written word is devoted to description of the relatively few characters involved. Even when action occurs, it isn't described in scintillating, pulpy detail.Partly this is a result of the author's chosen protagonist. This novella is less of a Western and more a coming-of-age story. We see the events unfold through the fuzzy and at times myopic lens of a young boy. Shane is a vehicle used to challenge Bob's understanding of right/wrong, and the makings of a \\"good\\" man.Readers have complained that Shane's past is never fully explained. There are many reasons for this. It isn't necessary in the development of the plot concerning Fletcher. It also isn't necessary for the plot concerning Bob's psychological journey into young adulthood. Most importantly though, is the fact that anything Schaefer might have written would pale in comparison to our own imaginations. Most of Shane's impact comes from his mysterious past. Illuminating it would decrease his affect on the reader.Shane remains one of my favorite books today. I encourage young people to give it a try with the above caveats in mind. This isn't a mindless adventure. Shane requires a lot of effort on the part of the reader. In particular the infamous \\"stump\\" scene comes to mind. I've read a number of different analyses of that scene and my own is slightly different still. That is part of the wonder, the joy, and yes the frustration of reading Shane."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Since this book was written, all westerns since have tried to capture its power.

In a similar westernThe Magnificent Seven (Special Edition)is a western made with the plot of a famous Japanese Samurai filmAkira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (Shichinin No Samurai) ~ Original Theatrical Version [Import, All-region] (Dvd).That no edition except a foreign language one has been put out of this book since 1966 is a real shame: the book is an American classic recognized the world over.

Told through the eyes of a young boy many years later, it's just about perfect.Just go read it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is the classic tale of the Old West fading away through the eyes of Bobby, a young boy, whose family is trying to homestead range land in (presumably) Wyoming. Based loosely on the Johnson County Wars of the early 1890s, the tale centers on the heroic gunfighter Shane, a man who is trying to escape his past by settling down with the homesteaders, and working alongside Bobby's parents.Unfortunately, the Ranch barons, seeing their ranges fenced in and their way of life coming to a close, refuse to compromise and seek violence against the families. One of them is coldly shot down by the notorious gunfighter Jack Wilson, and Shane is forced, very much against his will, to return to a way of life that he sought so desperately to leave.In the end, Shane, wounded, and knowing he could never settle down, rides off - the metaphor being the Old West is dying, and so is Shane, though no one ever knows for sure, as his figure portrayed in the classic book and through the eyes of the late Alan Ladd remains immortal - to the Starrets and to us readers. The last scenes of the movie remain very sad -and very timeless. This was a movie - unlike the pablum and nonsense churned out by Hollyweird these days.I echo the comments of James Drury, this is a book that young readers should want to read, as it is solid literature. And finally a personal note: Even though he was the \\"bad\\" guy Wilson in the movie, I want to pay my respects to a nice man and fellow Pennsylvanian who I had the honor of meeting before his passing, Jack Palance. RIP, Mr. Palance, and God Bless."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"While I am sure that many people will point to Shane as the classic young adult novel of the American west, there is no reason it should be limited to young adults. This is a simple story, beautifully told, with characters of depth and subtlety and classic themes of good vs. evil, might vs. right, and living with the consequences of your actions. The narrative has an amazing, quiet grace, with scenes that will stand out in your mind well after you have finished the book. And the point of view gives the events that transpire a depth and clarity that could easily have been lost from a different perspective. Highly recommended to all. Donald J.

Schaefer catches the conflict that is going on in Shane's world and in his mind. The bright text helps you visualize the world through the young Bob's point of view. While reading this book, I felt like I was young Bob. Schaefer creates the action scenes as if the pages where his film.Shane is great for those who like to see the world through a child's point of view.

I've recently read, Charles Portis', True Grit. With respect to the Western context you can see where Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars and High Plains Drifter came out of, though that has been as much attributed to Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest. And although I wanted to like this book as much as my vague memory of it suggested, I found it to be slow going, with it's unengaging prose style, exacerbated by the first person retrospection of the main character, which was too detailed to be convincing for a boy so young. A characteristic not unique to Jack Schaefer for this kind of book. Sure the story was good, heavily viewpointed, and moralistic, but that kind of thing is done better now, as in the Star Trek tie in books by the likes of L.A, Graf, and K.W. Jeter. It seems to me that Shane is a book of its time, which is unfortunately not this one, with respect to the younger audience it was originally intended for.For me it's the style of Shane more than anything else, that leaves me unenthusiastic. But it should please others."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I read this book few months ago this a book about a guy who is atough guy he is hard worker and strong he never tells any body about himself he just say &quot;call me shane&quot;. once he went to valley and he settle thier with Joe starret as a coworker than see what's next....."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane, by Jack SchaeferJack Schaefer writes a classic western tale of a gunfighter in the late 1800's moving through town and who gets attached to a rural ranch family, the Starretts. Mr. Schaffer really reaches the levels of Louis L'Amour and other outstanding writers of their time in the western genre. Shane helps out on his new friends land and at the same time deals with an increased emotional tension with the ranch owner's wife like the true professional that he is. This is similar to Clint Eastwood's character of Preacher in the always outstanding film, Pale Rider.The book goes into great detail of the tools of Shane's trade, his custom tuned Colt 1873 Single Action revolver chambered in .45 Colt. You can easily visualize the revolver from the well written description. His draw is fast as lightening and his instinctive honed aim is thoroughly true. A gunslinger that handles himself coolly when facing danger and blowing off taunts and attempts of those that have an interest in sparking violence... unless violence is the only cure for the towns ailment.Shane is read in many middle schools and even had a pretty good film based on it starring Alan Ladd. I read the book first prior to seeing the film back in middle school and so sadly the major issue I always had with the film is that it wrecks the image of Shane (only in that in the book he dressed more like a southern gambler and less like a frontiersman in buckskin), but at the same time casts a good actor to play the part. It is no surprise that this book was chosen for a film adaptation. A great story not overly drawn out and fast paced. A nice short read at 160 pages.For another great look at this book read the #1 2003 review by Jeffrey Leach here on Amazon. He really breaks it down well.If you like this book you are in luck because Jack Schaefer wrote other great westerns; like the one called First Blood... yes, the same title as the David Morrell book. What are the odds of two books with the same title written by good authors and both end up being great... truly awesome!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I'm having a really tough time writing a review for Shane. I liked the book quite a bit, but just don't have a lot to say about it. A compact little book with some depth to it. It's a tough book to summarize. The book was so influential on other westerns that any summary will now sound like a pile of clich&eacute;s: A mysterious drifter arrives in a settlement in 1890's Montana and becomes enmeshed in a fight between settles and the big rancher who craves their land. It would be an easy book to dismiss based on such a summary, but it would be a mistake.The book was very well written. This isn't so much a novel about a heroic drifter who arrives in town and saves the day. That is the spine of the story, but the focus on the book is on the effect Shane has on the Starrett family and the effects he would like them to have on him. Shane isn't just a cipher of a character. Though we never learn much about Shane's past, it is clear that he enjoys his time with the Starrett family and would like to be able to settle down to their way of living. I was reminded a bit of Unforgiven, as Shane is clearly a gunfighter who would like to escape that lifestyle but knows he will most likely be unable to.The Starretts felt real and it was nice to read about a truly functional family. Young Bob idolizes his father, Joe, a good man who is trying to make a go of his farm. Marion, the mother was believably portrayed. Through the course of the novel you can see that she is developing feelings for Shane, though nothing overt is ever stated in the novel. The only time it felt overly clunky would be when the mother and father would have discussions about how Shane affected their lives. I just couldn't see two people having conversations like that.Otherwise Jack Schafer does a very good job. The book is written from the point of view of Bob Starrett, a man reflecting back on this time in his childhood. The author does a very good job with Bob's narration. The way it is presented allows for Bob to discuss situations both as he saw them at the time and with the maturity he's gained since then.Overall, Shane was a very satisfying read. Quite a bit better than I bargained for."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I first read this book a couple of years ago, and remembering how beautiful it is, I wanted to read it again. I just finished reading it for the second time, and I am re-doing my review. (But I don't think I will ever read it again - it is too hard emotionally, even though I fully understand why what happened to Shane had to happen.)This is the most beautiful, delicate, sensual Western you will ever read. The book is about Shane. He is a mystique who rides into a Wyoming valley in the 1800's. He has an eery air about him that everybody seems to unspokenly respect. He is straight-to-the-point, sure, steady, confident; not cocky or unnecessarily arrogant or insecure. He is strong and practical, swift and quick.But this book isn't only about Shane. It is also about the people he impacts. He stops in at Joe Starrett's ranch and works for him. Joe and his wife, Marion, and son, Bob all love and respect Shane. Shane becomes a part of them; the little family feels Shane is indeed one of them. Sometimes it is the silence, the unspoken words, the body language, the air, the way things are carried, that speaks the most volumns. Shane and the little family understand each other, sometimes just by the silence. There is so much love in this book, it can literally be sliced with a steak knife.And the book isn't just about Shane and the people he impacts. To me, it goes beyond that into something personal. I love the West; I have been there as a child/teen. I've been to the mountains. This book reminded me of the summers I was there in the Wyoming and Colorado mountains (but this book is only Wyoming). I always felt a \\"belonging\\" to the West. It always felt like \\"home\\" to me. That fact made the book extra special to me.Joe Starrett loves and respects his wife and son. It is felt; the love drips off the pages. The mother loves her husband and Shane and little boy. I love it when the mother holds her little boy tight in her arms, plays games with him, and treats him with tender love and respect.This book is told through Bob's eye's. Bob \\"narrates\\" the story after he becomes a man, looking back at it as it happened when he was a small boy. The words and writing are so beautiful, breathtaking, and delicate. This author is amazingly talented.This book is set in Wyoming; settlers from out East coming West and homesteading. Bob's family is a homesteader. There is a greedy man, Fletcher, who wants all the land, and wants the homesteaders out. Will Joe Starrett, out of fear of being killed by Fletcher or his men, give in and give Fletcher his land? Will Shane allow it? Joe is worried about losing the place, but Marion is determined not to lose it. It is home to her. She doesn't want to go back out East, or anywhere else. She wants to stay in Wyoming. This is her home. Her home, her husband, and her little boy. She is a strong-willed woman, a good cook, a hard worker, an awesome mother and wife. I admire and love her.Shane is determined to allow Joe and Marion to keep their land, their home. Is he strong, swift, sharp, and courageous enough to protect them and their land from Fletcher?Shane gave Bob a piece of advice that needs to be given to all children/people: \\"It's up to you now. Go home to your mother and father. Grow strong and straight and take care of them. Both of them.\\" No matter what a person's situation is, whether you are stuck out in the WIld West, or the innter East city, if a person would take that advice, things would be a lot better for everybody. If kids would grow straight. If they would take care of the parents. That advice really touched me. Of course, it was coming from Shane, and look at his caliber.I think it is hard to read this book with totally dry eyes. And the ending is so sad, it was really hard for me (even though I had read the book before, and I knew how it was going to end). It was really tough for me. I can't say much about the ending, as to not spoil it, but I will say it was personal for me in another way too. I will not tell you what happened to Shane, but I will tell you that he reminded me of my best friend who died in Colorado. She is gone, but I can feel her presence, as if she is still here, still alive. It is usually like she has never died. I feel her and sense her in everything.Oh, this book is so beautiful and awesome and magnificent, and I'd better quit writing - I can't take it any longer. It is as beautiful and breathtaking as those Rocky mountains that look like a slice of heaven. 11-14-2011."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"the unforgettable novel of a boy's love and a gunman's struggle to escape his past."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"It is the summer of 1889, and young Robert McPherson Starrett (Bob) lives with his father Joe and mother Marian in a little valley near a small town in the Wyoming Territory. Up to the Starrett's farm rides a mysterious stranger all dressed in black. When asked his name, he simply says, \\"Call me Shane.\\" There's trouble in the valley. A rancher named Fletcher used to use the whole valley to raise cows, but then settlers moved in and established legal claims to various portions of the valley. Now Fletcher has a new contract to provide beef for the government and wants to be able to use the whole valley again. The farmers stand in his way.Shane decides to stay and work for Bob's dad, especially since Fletcher had run off another young man named Morley who was helping the Starretts. Shane helps to remove a huge tree stump that's been particularly stubborn and then builds an addition on the corral. And he works with Mr. Starrett in the fields. However, as autumn comes, the situation in the valley begins to heat up as Fletcher returns from signing his contract and brings a hired gun named Wilson to help intimidate the farmers. They goad one somewhat hot-headed farmer named Ernie Wright into some rash actions by which he gets shot to death. The other farmers are somewhat scared and don't know what to do, but Joe wants to stand up to Fletcher and Wilson. A couple of fights have already occurred between Shane and some of Fletcher's men. Is there anything that Shane can do to assist the Starretts and their friends?The 1953 film starring Alan Ladd that is based upon this book has become a classic Western movie, but I have never seen it. From what I had heard, I would never have imagined that the book would be considered to be for children, but according to the publishing history a \\"Juvenile edition\\" and an \\"Educational edition\\" have both been published. My conclusion is that while the tale is narrated by a young boy it is most likely not a book intended for youth. There is a fair amount of cursing, with the \\"h\\" and \\"d\\" words used somewhat frequently (once the \\"d\\" word is preceded by the name of God), and there is some profanity with the name of God used as an exclamation. Also some of the fighting and shooting scenes are detailed enough that they might be bothersome to sensitive youngsters. Otherwise, it is an interesting story that is probably quite typical of the modern \\"Western\\" genre."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"When my teacher first told us that we were going to be reading the book Shane i had never heard of it.

For not being from the West Jack Schaefer seems to have a commendable grasp on it (Tibbets 200). I believe Schaefer seems to have a deep understanding about the West and what went on in it. The selection of Wyoming for a setting also made the story relate to the West (Platt 1). Although Shane may not follow the traditional western fiction style, it has a different message, which is the fight between good and evil (Simmons 2). PS-Mr White is my favorite teacher in the world! And he really wants to give me the last day off!!!(PLEASE). MR.White...you are the coolest!! In this book Shane handles an ax, his fist, and gun with accuracy and thought, just as Schaefer handles his words (Platt 1). Because of this thoughtful writing, I think a variety of things in the book have a symbolic meaning, including the characters. Shane is a character that is hard to understand at first, but makes the story more interesting (Simmons 2). He represents what is done to prevent the bad things from happening (Platt 2). He keeps Starrett away from the having confrontation with the homesteaders by handling the conflicts himself. He may seem simple but he is actually a complex character (Simmons 3). Starrett represents what is good and right about America (Platt 2). He is loving and willing to fight for his family safety. The story is more entertaining to me knowing that there is a larger meaning. I believe Shane should not be read as a simple western story. It insists a deep response from the people who read it (Simmons 1). Although there is a lot of symbolism throughout the book, there is one main underlying theme (Simmons 2). I think that it is the theme that out of all of the corrupt things in the world eventually something good will come along. Shane has a universal meaning behind it and can be related to the entire world (Simmons 1). The struggle for peace is the fight for the farmers to grow and the homesteaders to decrease (Platt 1). Just as in the world we strive for good to prevail and evil to lessen. Shane is the type of book that will be read from generation to generation (Simmons 3) because of it's universality and grasp on the West. His writing was so well and honored in 1985 by the Western Writers of America because of his great understanding to the myth of the west (Tibbets 200). I liked reading a western that did not follow the traditional method but understood the concept of a western. PS-Mr. White is my favorite teacher and he wants to give me the last day off for this awesome paper!(PLEASE)"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is the quintessential morality play. Good triumphs; mindless evil is defeated by a supreme act of selfless heroism; love is affirmed. One needs not to mix up the book with Gorge Stevens superb movie.The two share many virtues: spare dialog, toughness and tenderness, a clear and simple (but never simplistic) vision. George Stevens should have won an Academy Award for the movie (do you remember what movie won the Best Picture award in 1952?). The movie is one of those rare, wonderful adaptations of a book that is both true to the original and brilliant in its own right.Schaeffer's book is deceptively simple. It records events through the eyes of Bobby (not Joey) Starrett. It is a pre-adolescent coming of age story from a more innocent time. Young Bobby sees his parents and his home threatened. A jaded and blas&eacute; stranger rides into the valley, and finds the family he never had. By (presumably) dying for them he lives on.None of this does it justice; you should read it for yourself (and then watch the movie)."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Set against the backdrop of the westward expansion movement in US history, this novel is almost allegorical in nature. The characters play out their roles in a story as old as time; one of choice, the power of good and evil, and making one's own way in the world. Young Bob must learn that with every conscious decision, comes an element of responsibility. This responsibility is not only to oneself, but also to those who depend on and surround the decision maker. Shane is a man who has learned to live with the results of his decisions; Joe is a good, solid man, a good father and great role model. And Bob's mother, Marian, makes a serious decision as well, regarding her own life, and how she chooses to live it. On the surface, this is a story of ranchers v. cattlemen, but symbolically, it is more a story of choices, of love, and of self-reliance. Good book. I teach it often to my students, and they have always enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Most of us know \\"Shane\\" from the excellent movie that remains a high-water mark of realistic depiction of the Old West. Better than the novel could, the movie conveys the dust and grime, the slower pace of events, the backbreaking work of a kind no one in America knows anymore -- and the ways confrontations were handled before the arrival of law and order.Commonly a book excels its movie, and this one is no exception. The story proceeds as a brewing range war between a Wyoming rancher and small farmers toward the end of the 19th Century. Ironically, in the never-ending struggle between \\"the old ways\\" and modernization, the small farmer here represents modernization - and small farmers themselves no longer exist.The principal characters embody themes as old as literature. Before farmers ever got there, the rancher Fletcher cleared the range of marauding Indians by whatever means worked. In a might-makes-right situation, it probably needed such men to lead the westward migration. Fletcher certainly considers himself wronged as farmers begin taking over the land for which he put his life on the line. That the law favors them doesn't matter; Fletcher respects force and little else.Joe Starrett emblemizes the civilizing virtues: energy, intelligence, sense of community and honor, moral and physical courage, self-discipline, belief in family and self. In a later Schaefer novel Starrett reappears as Chet Rollins. His very physique - large, awkward, physically powerful - stands as a bulwark to which his fellow farmers repair for advice and leadership. Especially in lawless circumstances, such men represent the institutions of civilization to the less sturdy.Shane is many things, all of them complex. The book cover caricatures him as a gunfighter who can't escape his past. Shane is more than that; he's a white knight, his life echoing the Greeks who said that character is destiny. A man of substance who disdains the company of most, Shane honors substance in the Starretts. They take to each other immediately.But Shane has another side that he keeps on a leash: the inner leopard, the big cat that lives and hunts alone, striking fear in those around him. \\"Bad ones like him are poison,\\" Starrett observes. Shane unhesitatingly takes on hugely uneven odds against Morgan and his gang in the saloon, and it isn't just, or even particularly, courage or heroism. He instinctively relishes combat, violent action, dominance, perhaps even cruelty. The leopard blood passion -- and control of it - occupy Shane's core. He cannot be imagined without both.Shane brings to mind another hero who entered American consciousness 13 years before this book appeared: Rhett Butler. Rhett has more rebellion in him, but shares with Shane an unerring sense of himself and the milieu in which he moves. Both manifest extraordinary physical ability and competence. As Rhett truly respects only Melanie Wilkes, so Shane only truly respects Joe and Marian Starrett. Neither man feels threatened at knowing \\"women's stuff\\" such as ladies' hat styles. Both understand the crucial importance of role models to kids. We know more of Rhett than of Shane, but we do know that Shane somehow let himself down in the past, as Rhett before joining the fight against the North.At a deep level, this story concerns free will and its consequences. It deals with the choices men make and how the con-sequences of these condition further choosing. Men are tested constantly, and must constantly choose the moral tenor of their response. A man who yields to cowardice, in the many ways that can be done, does irremediable violence to his soul. Once done, it can't be undone and he can't be who he was. Good men have always known this; it's why honor matters, projecting their sense of themselves as moral agents. What others think also matters, but secondarily to their self-opinion.This theme bears directly on another, that of heroes: what a hero looks like in real life and how he affects others. Schaefer doesn't want us to miss this, so he provides a stark contrast with Shane in the person of Stark Wilson, a man with whom Shane has a great deal in common. Wilson, too, is a leopard. But while Shane puts his leopard passion in the service of principle, Wilson indulges his passion. With jungle mentality, he lives for the kill. These men made different choices along the way, and those choices conditioned all that followed. One can imagine Shane degenerating morally into a Wilson, but cannot imagine Wilson, all moral decay and depravity, evolving into a Shane.Hence Schaefer, perhaps without realizing it, posits morality as evolutionarily selected. Yet neither Shane nor Wilson marry, and indeed one can't imagine either of them domesticated. They are curiously sexless. But Shane will have progeny in the persons of those who idolize and model on him. Wilson's blatant evil drives others away. He lives solely for himself, so much so that he has nothing to give anyone. His role in the world is to serve as a bad example.Six years before this book appeared, Ayn Rand brought out one of the great novels on the theme of heroes. The Fountainhead explicates the philosophical issues, but lacks the balance and realism of Shane. In Rand's pantheon, Shane would fit right in while Joe Starrett would barely merit mention. Her heroes never have children, the reason FOR civilization. Yet in everyday living we seldom encounter a Shane while running into Joe Starretts often. Starrett is the enduring hero who has much more to lose (hence to win) than Shane does. Shane is Michael Jordan, magnificent in action, stirring and memorable, the apotheosis of excellence, showing what's possible. But that level of excellence is physically beyond most of us. It's for admiring rather than emulating.The day-to-day heroes matter more. Joe Starrett needs Shane, but everyone else needs Joe Starrett. Shane knows this. His role is to step in as needed and then, work done, to move on. As he does in this interesting and most excellent short novel."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Today's thriller writers could take a lesson from Jack Schaeffer. Just like the title character, this novel is lean and quick and frightening.I mostly bought the critical edition for its cover. Having read the extra material, Shane's historical, literary and cinematic context and a nifty talk with the author, I'm glad I did!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Howdy everyone, this is James Drury. I used to play The Virginian on NBC television, for those of you who can't remember that far back. It's that time again, time to read Shane. I'm only into it up to chapter six, and already those old memories have flooded back, and I recall why I love this book so much. It is timeless, to use a perhaps overused word. It is nearly a flawless book, although for the first time I've noticed that a few of his time elements are incredible, such as, for example, the time it takes Marion to bake a pie in the book. But this is such a good book that things like this don't matter. The only Western author I can truly say I enjoy as much as Jack Shaefer is Kirby Jonas, a young author whose books I read on audio for Books In Motion, who can be located at Booksinmotion.com . But in my opinion Shane can never be topped nor matched by anyone. If you are a young person and feel forced into reading this book, I wish I could tell your teachers, &quot;Don't force Shane on anyone!&quot; This book should be read in your leisure time, when YOU want to, to be truly enjoyed. I hope you will give it an honest chance."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"OK, I am only in 8th grade, and I just finished it. Is it me, or is America getting more stupid by the second? This book requires a lot of your brain power. It implies a lot of things. But seriously people, how easy can understanding this be? To any intellegent people out there, this book will suit you fine. If you especially like historical fiction, and westerns also, you'll love this. I don't even like historical fiction, and I liked it! I hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"If you pressed me I could probably go on and on about Shane; in fact I'm sure that my remarks would end up longer than the book itself. But going along with Schaefer's advice that short is much better... I'll just say that Shane immediately became my favorite book when I read it in 6th grade. The copy that I read was my teacher's and I have been searching for one of my own for years... now a freshman in college, I finally have my personal edition of Shane as of a week ago. When I opened the cover, the story completely absorbed me just like in 6th grade and I couldn't put it down until I had finished reading the entire book. It was every bit as good as it was over six years ago. Thankyou Jack Schaefer for writting such an extraordinary book and for those of you who havn't read Shane, I strongly urge you to get out there and search for it. I am certain that it will not be in vain"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"&quot;I had to read it for school. and I hated it!&quot; seems to be the common theme, here. As a middle school teacher, I can vouch for the observable fact that many many children 1. hate to read (sad) and 2. hate to read - even more - what they are told to read. Shane, while now somewhat dated, was a classic in it's time, and often imitated. One direct imitation is the Clint Eastwood movie, &quot;Pale Rider&quot;, which serves as a wonderful comparison piece. As far as the young reviewers not being able to &quot;understand&quot; the novel &quot;Shane&quot;, one can only ask if TV has destroyed their brain cells, or if they can't understand how Shane and Marion resisted their temptation to be with each other at the expense of friend and husband Joe Starret. In today's age, such restraint must surely seem confusing. A fine, easy- to- read book."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I first read this book as a 6th grade reading assignment and found it spellbinding from start to finish. From the dynamic that first develops between Shane and the younger Starret to the final showdown, the insightful reader experiences an emotional euphoria that boxes the compass from joy to sadness. Unlike others that have read the book and seen the movie, however, I must admit that the movie, for me, captures the essence of the eternal struggle between good and evil as well, if not better, than the book. The majestic cinematography and musical score, combined with George Stevens skill at directing the film's superb cast make Shane the standard by which all westerns, past and present, should be measured."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I just finished reading Shane right now. I picked it up at school and I didn't stop reading until I finished, if that tells you anything about it. It's an extremely powerful book. I feel a bit miffed reading other reviews by kids saying it's a boring, stupid book about a stump. Maybe they just skimmed it because they had to and didn't let themselves get involved with it or something because if you let yourself, there's no way you couldn't get involved in it.Shane is a very powerfully written person. You grow to love him and it almost made me cry at his inner torment as he made himself face life head on, no matter how much it hurts, and while he does it teaching a little boy, too.I wish that there hadn't been any killing. Yet, somehow if everything had worked out &quot;happily ever after&quot; the message of the book would not have hit me so hard.This book teaches you so much about life and I can easily give it 5 shining stars.Don't skim the book like a fashion magazine. It's a deep book. Let yourself get lost in it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I was turned onto this book in an online forum and decided to check it out. I was glad that I did. This book should rank as one of the great American classics. Set in 1889, it tells the story, from a coming-of-age boy's point of view, of how a stranger comes to town and changes everything. The story focuses on a rising conflict between homesteading farmers and ranchers, who see the farmers as encroaching on their lands. On the surface, this sounds like just another run-of-the mill Western. But this is not your typical Western at all. There are no gun fights (except at the very end) or chasing of Indians.I was captivated with the story from the very first few pages and I found it difficult to put the book down. This book - actually a long short story - is tightly written. Not a word is wasted. Though the book was short, I found myself slowing down and absorbing each word, as if I was savoring a fine slab of prime rib. This is not the sort of book you want to rush through.The story conveys some very powerful moral themes but you must read the book carefully to grasp them all. These moral themes are just as important today as they were on the American frontier 100 years ago. One is that it is far better to face danger and risk death than to run from it and not be able to live with yourself afterwards. Another is that pacifism only ensures your own destruction. You must be prepared to defend yourself against your adversaries. You cannot expect to get along with them or allow them to \\"buy you off.\\" For once they do, you have sold your soul to them.The underlying theme of the entire story however is the coming of age of the boy (who narrates this story) and the powerful life lessons that the stranger (Shane) provides to him.I know this book was made into a movie but I have never seen it. Having read the book, I have little desire to see the movie. No movie can possibly surpass the vivid images this book has left in my imagination of what life might have been like on the American frontier in the late 1800s.Lastly, despite the cover art and the poor placement of this book in bookstores (usually the teen section), this is not a \\"children's book.\\" It is very much an adult book. Of course, it can be read by teenagers, but it is much more challenging then Harry Potter and other fare associated with teens today."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"My father named me after the book's main character and perhaps that's what led me to write my own Western novel (&quot;Bounties&quot;). Of course, &quot;Shane&quot; can't be topped and is a unique Western in its own category. While I rely on humor to tell my stories, Jack Schaefer paints a picture of a man trying to escape his violent past and eventually has to accept who he is and that his destiny is something he can't escape. This book is not just a Western but a beautiful tale about growing up, boyhood dreams, and heroes that emerge from wide and unforgiving landscapes. Thanks to Schaefer for giving us a book that continues to inspire so many people."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"When this was made into a movie I was seeing lots of movies, but I never saw Alan Ladd in this. I must have thought it was just a Western and I ordinarily skipped them. Surely a mistake, I now know since after reading the book I surely want to see the movie (rated five stars and &quot;one of the best westerns ever made&quot; in my Video and Movie Guide). I was really caught up in this story, and my attention was held as surely as when I read &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;--also a book told from a young boy's view. I found Shane a poignant, thrilling, suspenseful and satisfying book, and it can be read in a very short time, since it is truly unlaydownable and only 214 pages."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is a great book I would recomend this to anybody who likes adventure and suspens or the old west. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"There is good and there is evil in this world. The good must be vigilant or else the barbarians will rule. As America is becoming more barbarian every day, the Shanes of the country must awaken and fight the forces of darkness just as Shane and Starrett fought the Riker Brothers gang."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The story centers much upon the failure of a man to control himself when fate and violence close in around him. It can be seen as an allegory of our times"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is a brilliant psychological western about the true meaning of strength, integrity, and manhood. It's not just a shoot-'em-up; far from it, it is remarkably subtle for its genre. A great book for intelligent young adult males."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Of the hundreds of books I've read, this is the one that I've re-read the most. To say that this is a classic would not do it proper justice. In a short, compact narrative, Mr. Schaefer manages to convey an unforgettable sense of a time, a place, a man and his destiny in a most accurate, convincing fashion. The movie version, as good as it was, does not come anywhere close to the book, and this is due in part to Alan Ladd's portrayal. Again, Alan Ladd was a great actor, but he carried none of the implied menace that the book's character had. This is a great book for first-time readers, in its depiction of right, wrong and the price each carries. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I just read Shane for a book report. I think it is a great book. It isn't very long so there can't be any boring parts. The fights were very realistic. Shane was a realistic person. Next to Louis L'Amour's Chick Bowdrie, Shane would be my favorite western character. The setting is like a real community trying to get to be a town in the early 1800's.-J.J. Hendrix"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"It would seem that Shane is too complex, too 'talky' or too deep for many Jr. High Schoolers assigned to read it. I sympathize, I too was forced to read horrid, dull books by teachers. Most notably Hemingway's 'The Old Man and the Sea' and 'Catcher In the Rye'. But then there's something about being *required* to read a book that almost invariably ruins it. Shane may indeed be to 'old' for the majority of the twelve to thirteen crowd. Wait five or ten years and try it again, you may like it - or you may still hate it like I still hate 'Old Man and the Sea' and 'Catcher In The Rye'. I personally read 'Shane' in college thanks to Arthur C. Clark. In his science fiction novel 'A Fall of Moondust' the passengers of a lunar tour bus are trapped in a sea of dust and entertain themselves while waiting for rescue by reading, among other things, 'Shane'. So I tried it and loved it, dispite being no big fan of the Western Genre. It is, quite simply, a wonderful character study."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I don't know how say it but soon as I read the first paragraph I was hooked. I don't like to read that much but this was different. I have seen movies of old westerns that were corny and stupid but this book has taken the old westerns to a different level of thought. I think that Jack Schaefer should of had more credit for the later books that he wrote."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The critical edition of Shane contains the novel, which is good, and severl reveiws, which is so-so. The novel is fascinating to read, and it varies significantly from the movie screenplay. The interview statements by the author, Shaefer, and the reviews are of modest value.There are four or five interesting ideas, such as: westerns like Shane may reflect American foreign policy in the 50's and 60's, the western heroes like Shane are Christ (with six-gun) figures, sort of old testament-new testament hybrids, the author could not write such an innocent story again, because of his cynicism about what the \\"homesteaders\\" eventually did to America (his politics are unclear and he seems to blame Babbitt and not the oil barons), the novel first person is an older son looking back at his childhood with Shane instead of the movie's first person protagonist being the young boy, and, the other really good western is The Gunfighter. The obvious oedipal projection, which no reviewer but me has noted, is vivid in the film and only hinted at in the novel.It is too bad for those of us who have seen the movie first; we can only compare, and can't see the novel's images free of Alan Ladd and Jack Palance. The movie could have been better (maybe with Randloph Scott after intenstive acting lessons, or Palance instead of Ladd) since Shane was written as a super-humanly lethal and fearsome man. But, Ladd gives the right voice to the character, and with the special effects the movie works.Shane is \\"pure\\" western myth. (It was always a myth, there never were any such characters in the west except in 19th century newspapers and tabloids.) There are only white Nothern European Christian men and few wives and kids; no Mexicans, no African-Americans, no Native Americans, no dance hall girls, not even any cripples. But the novel and the movie try to answer the essential question raised in every good western: what price will you will pay for the most expensive of American luxuries: fairness, justice and honor.If you are fascinated by the film Shane, as I am, the critical edition of the novel is worth taking a look at."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I am new to the Western genre but I love it. I heard Shane is considered to be the best western novel ever. I just read it and although I understand that there is so much more to western stories than is displayed in this short book, but in the AMAZING way that this one was written, I can see why it is so beloved.I enjoy Louis Lamour and am looking forward to trying other authors who have received good reviews such as Elmer Kelton, Kirby Jonas,Glendon Swarthout and Mike Blakely among others. Shane is soo ENGAGING. Honestly, the best way to describe it is UNIQUE. Get it !!!!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I first heard of &quot;Shane&quot; in the 50's when Alan Ladd made a movie of the book. While I in general liked the movie (who doesn't like westerns), I didn't care for the casting of the supporting stars, in particular Brandon DeWilde, Jean Arthur, and Van Halen (?). I didn't read the book until the 70's and was totally blown away by way it was written. In my opinion, Schaefer dwarfs both L'Amour and Grey. The lead character shows that he is subject to all the strengths and weaknesses of all men, but unlike weaker men, he is able to overcome his weaknesses to ultimately achieve his ideals in the end. The final shootout was an excellant climax for the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone whether they like westerns or not."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I understand completely why kids assigned this reading for school did not enjoy it. Though told through a young boy's eyes, the writing style is mature and uses many descriptive paragraphs. Though sometimes impatient with description, I loved the story all the more for the details; but some pre-high-school kids will become bored.It's true that Bob's introspection is unusually discerning for his age. However, some remarks indicate that he could be writing this at a later time in his life, looking back on what happened with a wiser perspective. Either way, the author's depth of observation from an unlikely character can be forgiven as he elicits reader sympathy and understanding. Bob's view of his world may not always be reliable (especially when referring to his hero as \\"invincible\\"), but he is always endearing. Reading about Bob's nave, honest idolization of the mysterious gunman, I wanted Shane to stay, too. And looking beyond Bob's innocent perspective, the mature reader sees things that Bob does not, understanding his parents as well as Shane even better than he does himself.This work of art manages to stay short (120 pp.) without losing the substance and quality of much longer novels. Any shorter, and something would be missing. Any longer, and the added words or events would be unnecessary, lessening the \\"punch\\" that perfect length gives this tale. If all Westerns are as captivating as this jewel, maybe I'll try another one sometime!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"This is my all-time favorite western, as there is so much in this book if you just look deeper. Shane is not only a tough guy, but he is able to discuss fashions with the wife, and so he shows that being tough doesn't mean you can't be sensitive and observant. He wasn't afraid to show what being a man is all about."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"As some of the reader reviews indicate, _Shane_ will not satisfy you if all you want is wild, gun-slinging action, or if all you want is to find out Shane's mysterious past. These are superficial aspects of the story. If you want to enjoy it, you need to turn your focus elsewhere. You need to look deeper. Schaefer writes with such great economy and integration, there is meaning in every word. The book is not pointless, as some here (apparently high school students) have called it. It is simply wonderful (an evaluation other reviews here have already elaborated upon)."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is an inspiration to me. To those of you who are inspired by the heroic, I highly recommend this book. In Shane, Jack Schaefer portrays man as a clean, uplifted being who is capable of achieving great things."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"In skimming the reviews below, it appears most of the negative ones are from adolescents and/or semi-literate readers. &quot;Shane&quot; is a classic story, a nearly pure good-vs.-evil myth.It's interesting to compare the Shane of the novel with the portrayal by Alan Ladd. There are some marked differences, but both the book and movie versions seem appropriate to the overall mood of the story."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"The movie was outstanding, , ,the book is ???What is greater than outstanding???Uuhhmm?? SUPER-TERRIFIC will work.There is a lot going on in this book, , ,notyour typical western shoot-em-up-bang-bangthat's for sure!! Great, great book."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is the quintessential Western novel. The loner with a dark past settles in with a righteous family and redeems himself. When the livelihood, and even the lives, of his friend and employer is endangered by an unscrupulous rancher, Shane sets out to right the wrongs, and he becomes a tragic hero. It's a suspenseful, emotional read, with all the cheesy melodrama one expects from a Western. If you ever only read one in your life, Shane should probably be it."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Did you like the movie &quot;The Man From Snowy River?&quot; If so, you owe it to yourself to buy and read SHANE, Jack Schaefer's first novel. As is so often the case, Hollywood's version of this beautifully written classic does not begin to capture the integrity of the characters in this book, nor the relationships which develop, nor the love and respect an &quot;ex-gunman-on-the-run&quot; engenders in a Wyoming sodbuster's family, and in any reader with a soul. This book is short, because it contains not one extra or unnecessary word. Every description -- from Shane's posture and dusty clothes as he rides up to a log farmhouse, in the shadow of the Grand Tetons, to the looks of unstated understanding which pass between a boy's father and a stranger who stays for supper, and then stays even longer to help a valley of farmers in trouble -- is poignantly clear and crisp, yet almost understated. Few Westerns have ever gained the degree of admiration that's been s! ! howered on SHANE, and justifiably so. After reading the paperback edition you may even be moved to buy, as I did more than 10 years ago, the &quot;collector's edition,&quot; also available through Amazon.com. And once you've read it, you may also find it makes a great gift ... for children of all ages!"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is a good book. Shane stands up against the bad guys and helps a family on their homestead in the west. I wish I had a friend like Shane. He was willing to give everything up for good reasons. You will like Shane, too."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I would recommend this book to someone else because it is very exciting and interesting. The characters were well constructed throughout the book and it had a lot of unusual twists to it. This book was very easy to read and it's a good book to read especially if you like western stories."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Jack Shaefer's western novel is a well-written and interesting tale of a gunman who learns something of himself when confronted with the problems of a pioneer family. The story is told by the son of that couple, so much is seen through his young eyes. There are minor differences from the famous 1953 film starring Alan Ladd as the title character, e.g., in the book he is dressed entirely in black, which would've labeled him as a bad guy in the Hollywood of the 50s. At 150 pages, it's a quick read, but none the less enjoyable."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"As soon as I finished reading the first page, I had to put the book down and reflect on how Jack Schaefer could convey so much with so little. Simply put, not a single word was wasted.Shane reads quickly which is it's only downfall (I wanted it to go on and on and on) but when you finish, you feel as though you have just returned from a very long trip back in time.A slow simmering tension (both violent and oddly sexual) builds between Shane (the gunslinger with a shady past) and the Starret family. An unexplored and unspoken relationship between Shane and Marian (Joe Starret's wife) offered me the most insight into my own expectations and desires.Though the story is told through the eyes of Bob a 10 year old boy, you get the feeling that there is so much there, so much that Bob simply does not understand. This tool utilized perfectly by Schaefer created a story that had many layers.All in all I will recommend Shane to anyone with an ear to listen."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"this story is of course a classic, one of the finest western novels ever written and is interesting as it is written from a young boys point of view of the adult world around him"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Spare, evocative writing by first-time author Schaefer accompanied by a selection of analytic articles give this edition depth. A satisfying read."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I use this novel with my high school freshmen. It is a whiz bang story. Students enjoy the basic farmer/rancher conflict, and they come to see difficult adult situations handled with good will, honesty, and integrity."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I picked this book up only because it was required for my son's reading class. I try to read what he reads so we can discuss it & I can see what he is getting out of his assignments. I got hooked on this book & ended up reading it straight through. It's a cute little story, but I think the best part is that it leaves so much unsaid that the reader gets to add his own impressions to the story. We know nothing about Shane but we appreciate his loyalty to the family and his kind and gentle way with Bob. It is implied that Shane has a \\"history\\" but what it is, is for us to decide. Even the ending is a bit unclear. I suppose it ends however we choose to believe. It may not go down as one of the classics but in my opinion the author was genius. It is probably one of the most well written books I have ever read. Even if it's not exactly my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Great, well written squeaky clean book for my 7th grade daughter. They boys in her class read it to. Plenty of cowboy action, plenty of hard work and good character winning the day. Presents several men of different integrity/character. Only one female lead, but she is a spectacular role model. Book also tackles difficult issues with grace. Like what to do when you are married and attracted to someone else. My daughter and I had an amazing conversation about that one day.

It was really hard to get into and when i did get into it finaly i saw that the book had too much in the lack of themes! Some readers might have liked it but for some reason it lingers on me! Sorry"},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Apparently I was tainted by the classic 1952 film before I read this book. In the movie Alan Ladd plays the eponymous hero, and although the audience can see he represses whatever mysterious past he has, the film shows a reluctant gunfighter trying to fit into Homesteader life. The end of the film shows Shane facing down a &quot;stacked deck,&quot; finally revealing how deadly his nature is, as he kills the villains in the story. I love the tension between two personas, as well as the conflict between the Starrett band of homesteaders versus the Rikker cowboys.I saw the movie so many times, I felt it was time to take on the book. The easy reading kept me occupied just over an hour, and was so disappointing. I was expecting more psychological tension between the lifestyles, more insinuated romance between Shane and Starrett's wife; perhaps more build up to the end of the greatest Western ever filmed. Instead I read this ego-trip version of Shane who knows how good he is and doesn't bother with modesty. His stint as a farmer seems more like killing time between gunslinging. The subtle romance of the movie, seems to spawn from the book's adulterous &quot;could-have-been's&quot;. There is this cheezy scene our narrator catches between Shane and Starrett's wife about upholding honor over lust, and respect Joe Starrett as the proper husband. By the end of the book we already know how great Shane is, and expect him to win all the gunfights (though again, I did see the movie first).This book seems to have flat, one-dimensional characters. The plot of a drifting gunfighter landing into the hands of a family struggling against hired guns is still entertaining, but not enough to recommend the book. I recommend the movie, it's much more entertaining and date-compatible."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane is the story of a kid named Bob Starret and his family, and Shane, and how that connection there helped changed everyone in their town's lives.The Starretts and the other local farmers had claimed their stakes of land, as the government deemed proper, but free-ranger Fletcher is losing his because of their 'squatting' and has been trying to get it back. Then, Shane enters, a mysterious old-gunman who has ended his shooting days, only to become stuck in the middle of this ensuing property battle that could bring him back to the steel.In my opinion, the book as a whole is not that bad, and thus I understand why some English teachers have their students read it. However, this is also not a fine piece of literature, as some make it out to be. Too much emphasis is put on Shane being almost a deity, with everything happening because of course, he is Shane. And the whole time I was reading this book, I felt that the over-use of description was merely compensating for the true, and often apparent lack of story.In the end, I believe the message gets across, but if you're looking for some good westerns, maybe not as heartfelt, then I'd recommend any of Louis Lamours books. Because when it comes to a story, Shane has the potential for emotion and excellent plot, only to fall short."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"I'm reading this book right now, and I find it confusing. Maybe it's because it's not the type of book that I would like to read normally. I'm sure if I were into these kinds of novels, then I would enjoy it more than I am."},{"Title":"Shane","review":"Shane: Dangerous and ConfusingIn the summer of 1889, a mysterious man named Shane rode into the Starrett's town in Wyoming. He was strange and dangerous however Joe and Marian Starrett took him in and gave him shelter. He began to work for them and was soon a farmhand, but he was not welcomed as warmly by some of the other townsfolk. They knew he had secrets, secrets of his past, and in a small town like that secrets weren't welcome. However Joe and his son Bob grow very close to Shane, and he and Joe develop an unbreakable relationship so close they seem like brothers. Things couldn't always be perfect and when someone from Shane's past rides into town, there wasn't enough room for both of them in town. Bob loves Shane like his dad, but he must grow up and make a decision for better or for worse.I'd say that in this book I was very similar to Joe Starret. He and Shane connected effortlessly, and that is how I am with other people. I make friends very easily and I have a couple of friends that I'm very close to. However I'm not a huge fan of secrets, and I'm very keen to know the answer to people's secrets. That is very similar to how Joe acts when Shane rides in, he is a puzzling man with an unknown past, and Joe wants to what his story is. I also love mystery, and this book was a western, but there was a dash mystery in the plot.If you read the book The Rangers Apprentice: The Ruins of Gorlan on its surface level, you would most likely see no comparison to Shane. However since I have thought about their plots and what the characters in each book meant, they are actually very similar. In both books there is a stranger in town, and there are two little boys that at first are curious of the strangers and develop a liking to that person. They quickly grow closer together and they work together through the thick and the thin over the story. Anybody that reads Shane and actually likes it will love The Rangers Apprentice: The Ruins of Gorlan. I just kept reading Shane and The Ruins of Gorlan kept popping into my head because of the parallelism between the two.Shane was a good book, but it wasn't one that I would read again. At some points the book was hard to follow; they would talk in old west terms and reference things that I didn't know about. There was very little action towards the very end, but until then there was almost no action. The narrator, Bob Starrett, shares his emotions a lot and I felt it was kind of a soap opera/western theme. Also in some parts he's best friends with Bob the Joe and so forth.

Then Cindy tells him that she has become a Christian. Storming out of his house in a turmoil of emotions, Marc returns to the border where he keeps guard while struggling with what he must do about Cindy's decision. In a skirmish he is severely wounded and mistakenly stumbles far across the border into Jordan before succumbing to unconsciousness. Abdullah, a Beduian, stumbles upon him and, being filled with compassion, takes the enemy soldier back to his cave in Petra where he nurses Marc back to health, telling the Jew it is Christ who gives him this love. But a few days before the two intend to try to get Marc across the border, he is caught by an Arab and finds himself running for his life all over Jordan, ever getting help from Christians just when he needs it.One of my favorite books since I first read it at twelve years old, Beyond the Night still moves me and encourages my faith. The story is captivating, Abdullah and the others' faith is inspiring, and the message is convicting. I particularly appreciated Abdullah's respect for the Jewish faith, and the emphasis in the book that Christ is the only One who can change men or nations."},{"Title":"Hamiota: Grains of the century, 1884-1984","review":"This community history book is a very comprehensive documentation of the Rural Municipality of Hamiota.

Nothing's really changed -- her parents and three-year-old brother Sam are just as they used to be -- but somehow, Anastasia's filled with embarrassment just thinking about them.Determined to get to the bottom of things, Anastasia insists on getting a therapist ASAP. When her parents refuse, Anastasia takes matters into her own hands -- quite literally, when she's at a garage sale and a plaster bust of Sigmund Freud falls on her. Anastasia takes him home, thrilled to have not only a therapist, but the world's most famous.To top things off, Anastasia' friend has given her two gerbils, which she decides to use for her science project. Before long, Anastasia's got ELEVEN gerbils -- which she's got to hide from her mother, who was squeamish enough about the idea of two...While this book is funny and smart, like all the Anastasia books, it's not the best in the series. Lowry always writes the character and her family well, but the plots in the book seem largely recycled from countless other books for readers in the same age bracket."},{"Title":"Anastasia, Ask your Analyst","review":"Anastasia is sure she is going insane so she buys a big statue of Freuds head and talks to it every day.This is a fantastic series,highly recommende buy moi!!(Now,what they decided to do with the gerbils at the end...was that really revenge on Nicky,or was it cruel to the gerbils!!)"},{"Title":"Anastasia, Ask your Analyst","review":"Okay. This book is a part of a serie of books about a teenager, Anastasia Krupnik. In this book, Anastasia has a problem. She thinks her mother's abnormal, her brother's too smart and that her father never takes her seriously. Anastasia just can't understand it. Why does her family suddenly make her angry all the time? So, she decides she is &quot;unstable&quot; and needs to see a shrink. Unfortunately, her parents think the idea is just stupid and refuse to even discuss about it. NOW Anastasia really has a problem...Personally I thought this book was great. I higly recommend the serie to everybody (especially girls)from 11 to 15 years.

Anastasia, though she seems really mature at times, in this book, seemed really immature. I mean, talking to her pretend analyst--come on! There were other parts that were immature, which I won't get into. She doesn't seem like a 13-year-old but more like a 10 or 11-year-old in parts. I am also tired of the racist views in these books, including this one. Anastasia doesn't believe a Chinese person can be named Stanley. She is so naive. Doesn't she know that Chinese Americans usually have American names?Also, some parts were just plain gross! But you will have to read it to find out. If you are a fan of Anastasia books, this should still be added to your collection.

Weston was such a commanding presence in so many photographic fields, and this overview of his work is great.

The latter book was designed to help professional photographers with the business aspects of their careers (but I found it omitted reference to many important business questions). I was wrong.This book purports to be aimed at people who are interested in becoming professional freelance photographers and it starts out simply in the first part with a broad overview, including comparisons of the advantages of attending a photography school and apprenticing to a professional photographer and selecting equipment. It was simple stuff to be sure but I'm told many people entering the career need this type of information.But when Part II came, there was more meat. It was a first for me to encounter a photography business book that actually talked about where the new professional was going to get his startup cash: family, friends, a working wife, or even (highly unlikely) a bank loan. The short chapter on location and leases even referred to things like zoning and subletting. There was even a section that talked about the collection of sales taxes and resale certificates for tax exemption. The chapter on insurance covered a topic you never hear even experienced photographers talk about although you know they all need it.Part IV on negotiating contracts and prices even had a pricing model that looked at the costs of creating photographs and suggested that if the photographer could not set his prices high enough to cover his costs (including his own draw) he should not enter the business.Part V called \\"Photography and the Law\\" discussed copyright, privacy and hiring an attorney. It even had a section on income taxes with suggestions on how to keep the books, which combined with an earlier reference to the software Quicken, talked about an issue that the new photographer usually doesn't even think about facing.You may have noted that I haven't discussed Part III on marketing, which I found the weakest part of the book. It was disjointed and not comprehensive, although most photographers would probably benefit from reading the short but well written chapter called \\"The Web Site as Marketing Tool.\\" If you want to understand what's involved in marketing I would suggest Scott Bourne's little book \\"88 Secrets to Selling & Publishing Your Photography.\\"This is not to suggest that this is the only business text a freelance photographer will ever need. Far from it. With the exception of the chapters on copyright and privacy and releases (which I think covered the fields very well) every one of the issues raised by the book will require more extensive study. But the book will highlight areas of the business of photography of which the beginning freelancer would never think until a major problem exploded in his face. Presumably, that's a good enough reason for him or her to read the book."},{"Title":"Starting Your Career as a Freelance Photographer","review":"This book is very informative, well written and very interesting, I have not read the whole thing yet, but from what I read so far, I am pleased.

We believed we were providing a balance of discipline and love and lots of attention to our child and therefore could not figure out why she was so out of control. As an infant she had been assessed as a &quot;spirited child&quot;, which she still is. We took the advice of an infant behaviour therapist, along with the advice in the book &quot;Raising your Spirited child&quot; and just accepted that our daughter was special (that has not changed), and that we could not expose her to standard discipline. By the time she was 4 1/2 we needed help handling her. Our pediatrician recommended we start giving our daughter some consquences to bad behaviour and to stop treating her as a mini adult and most importantly , read this book. I did. I could not believe my eyes. Dr. Millar was describing my child. My husband and I immediately carried out the advice in the book and literally within days our lives changed.

Does it seem like there is not much love left between you? Look no further.This book is easy to read, amusing, very practicle info on setting up routines to restore peace in your house. Simple steps to get your child moving: in the morning, at dinner, bedtime, chores, homework too. No drugs (interesting chapter on ADD, ADHC), no nagging, easy as pie...I had my 5 yr old running around trying to avoid punishment cards (mostly taking away privileges like candy, am/pm TV, etc.) All in a flash, no nagging, no yelling, some supervision.There is a temper tantrum program, a jar program(drop in tokens, 3 tokens=a punishment), a punishment card program. Implemented some steps right after reading this, and it worked like magic. Never seen my child be so motivated. WOW, wish I read this years ago. This book should given to every parent when their kids reach 2-3...read it before looking for help elsewhere. Don't take my word for it. Discipline with firmness and kindness. Develop your child's inner policeman, help your child learn to cope with anxiety, disappointment, anger. Get him/her ready for the real world.Why is this not on the best seller list--it should be.

It is very easy to put your child on a pedestal above all others. My husband and I did so with our little one for 5 years. We ended up with a very poorly behaved little girl. This book was recommended to us and our lives have been incredible ever since. We learned how damaging it is to give your child a sense of complete omnipotence. We thought we were building great self-esteem in our child. What we were really doing was creating a child who had little tolerance for others and particularly anything unpleasant. this book gave us the common sense approach to parenting that we needed. Thankyou Dr. Millar for the great book."},{"Title":"Omnipotent Child","review":"I was getting exceedingly frustrated with my 9 year old son. I chalked up his behaviour to being a boy; being emotional and full of energy, but my efforts were getting me nowhere. In fact, his behaviour was deteriorating. While reading this book, I felt like the author had been spying in my home. After the introduction of the Chip System that the author recommends my son went through all the predicted stages of fighting the system. But it was amazing how quickly he, and in fact his younger sister, were able to turn their behaviour around. We now have more peace, loving, energy and cooperation in our household then I would have thought possible."},{"Title":"Omnipotent Child","review":"This book was used as a text book in a child behavior class at East Tennessee State so this review is written from the point of using the book in that context.Although this book was worth reading because of the solid points that Dr. Millar makes about the influence that parental conduct has on child behavior, it is outdated in his behavior modification techniques. By today's standards, some of the techniques Dr. Millar used seem a bit silly and others simply make some psychologists today cringe due to the potentially adverse effects they may have.I have no doubt that Dr. Millar was very well versed in his field and was extremely knowledgeable in his time. This book however was written in the 1980's and was \\"updated\\" in 1994 with a new preface and introduction. Looking at the book using today's standards, we can see how far we have come in our understanding and techniques of behavior modification.It is also the general consensus of my class that the book was a bit bland and lacked any finesse in conveying the lessons there in."},{"Title":"Omnipotent Child","review":"Having a child who was quite difficult to parent I have read MANY parenting books. I can honestly say this book is the best I have ever read on the subject. It tells parents why the 90's style parenting we tend to lean toward is not effective. What I mean by that is that the adult is the parent and the child is the child. This book basically gives parents the permission we need to take the role back into our hands and be our child's parents. we are teachers to our kids , not their friends( alhtough that is not to say that we can't thoroughly enjoy each other). We must teach our children that there are consequences to negative behaviour. After all, discipline is teaching. The best thing we can do for our kids is to set them on the right path for their future. If we teach them to be tolerant, responsible and to understand that they are not the only ones in the home who has needs, they are much more likely to succeed in life. Since I read this book our life with our daughter has done a complete about-face. she has man more friends, she is co-operative, loving and loveable. Our whole family has benefited from Dr. Millar's sound advice and practical approach to parenting."},{"Title":"Omnipotent Child","review":"Living with a 12 year old son who has been diagnosed with ADD has been a challenged. We tried it all... counseling, bio-feedback therapy, family therapy and finally medication. I wished I'd read Millar's book 3-4 years ago when some of the techniques would have been more age appropriate.I also have a 13 month old and have read his other book, Raising the Preschool Child -- which is a precursor book based on the same theory. I've used some of his \\"no\\" techniques with success already. Short 2 minute timeouts have already shown my daughter that Mom really does mean \\"no\\" when she says it. It doesn't stop her EVERY time, but she now at least pauses (which for 13 months is a great start). I haven't tried the technique for temper tantrums... YET. But that is only because I want to start slow and work one area at a time.I agree that some of the book is outdated by today's standards. However, parenting, to some degree, is timeless. The parent's job is to train our children that they aren't the center of the world, that parts of life are not fun and rules and authority exist for a reason. The consequences of NOT teaching our children these life lessons are tragic. Possibly AS tragic as not nurturing.Methods on balancing training and nurturing may vary, but both components need to be there. I like how this book gives concrete examples, techniques and the theory behind them.I have a bachelor's degree Psychology and have read a TON of parenting books and articles -- and yet parenting is still a challenge! If you've read other parenting books, subsribe to all the parenting magazines... yet nothing has worked... this is definitely worth a try for the spirited child."},{"Title":"Omnipotent Child","review":"This book was recommended to me when I went to mypediatrician desperate for help with my very difficult to parent child.

I was feeling like a \\"guilty\\" mom, but I want my daughter to grow up to be respectful, and to know the difference between what is a privilege and a what are her rights. This book gave me assurance that I wasn't crazy, and that some of the \\"old fashion\\" parenting styles are still the best. It's good common sense, but I think parents need to hear it more often.

This book explores everything that is central to true enlightenment: the ridiculous, the blasphemous, the paradoxal, the rebellious, the foolish. This book embraces all that society rejects, and in doing so, unearths the very missing link to our spiritual evolution. There's no reason to fear. Journey with Wes and his troop of clowns, poets, mystics, thinkers and fools as they explore the philosopies of East and West with a grain of salt the size of a boulder. Along the way he points out that the world's greatest and most revered thinkers, prophets, poets, scientists, artists and activists were all considered &quot;crazy&quot; in their day and viewed as outlaws and criminals by their contemperaries.

It is one of the better Hong Kong produced art books I've seen.The book was issued to accompany an exhibition at the Lowe Museum of Art at the University of Florida, Coral Gables. As such, considering the relative obscurity and small size of the issuing museum, one is surprised both at the quality of the workmanship and materials that went into the book and also its contents. Part of the reason for the former is doubtless because the publication was underwritten by the couple dozen advertisements included in the back of the book; mostly from galleries/art dealers.The book's pages are glossy and packed with high quality, full color plates of numerous truly excellent, often beautiful, Netsuke. Each item is accompanied by a short 'story' that gives it meaning/context. For instance explaining who Kanzan and Jittoku are; what a Kirin or Tengu is; the significance of certain animals and how they are portrayed, etc. These short, single paragraph background blurbs are entertaining and informative and, one hopes, accurate (although one truly amazing Netsuke described as 'Ama and Squid' is more accurately 'Ama and Cuttlefish'). Approximate date and creator's name where known are also inlcuded.Many of the items in this exhibition are genuinely world class and would enhance any collection.Especially nice is that the Netsuke, categorized as Early, Middle and Late Period, are joined by a very nice collection of Inro (cases) and Ojime (bead cinch) which get their own sections. Still, one wishes that the Ojime had been displayed six to the page rather than nine so that the viewer could see a larger picture of the tiny items and thereby better discern the details. Also, no dates are given for the included Inro.The section I found most fascinating was the one displaying Kiseruzutsu, or pipe cases, with which I was totally unfamiliar. The included examples are pretty amazing.This is an overlooked book in the realm of Netsuke publications but it shouldn't be and even though the color reproductions aren't top notch they and the production values of the book are still of high enough caliber that this book is certainly a desirable acquisition"},{"Title":"The Saint in New York","review":"I recently found an original copy of this book (costs 2'6(old British money)published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton) and have found it thoroughly enjoyable.

Because the enemy was so big, so strong and so merciless; even the Saint was severely cornered several times. But I was glad because he still held his characteristics that made him so charming; impudence, recklessness, sense of humor and sense of justice. I also enjoyed the story very much; well-plotted, fast-paced and thrilling. And the climax was so dramatic! It will be one of the best Saint novels. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Saint in New York","review":"This is the book that put Leslie Charteris on the map and made best-sellers of all the previous Saint books in retrospect.Set shortly after the repeal of Prohibition, this tale of revenge is one of the grimmest, and the certainly the most violent, of all the Saint stories, so that when it was filmed, it was considerably toned down (and all hint of corruption in the New York judiciary removed, of course).Nevertheless, most Saint fans, including myself, seem to regard it as one of the best (as witness the other reviews). To take just one example: as a synopsis of all the previous Saint books &mdash; vital, if new readers are to understand the story &mdash; the prologue (which takes the form of a letter to the NYPD from Simon's old adversary Chief Inspector Teal of Scotland Yard) is one of the most original ideas I've seen.Charteris knew New York well, along with its denizens and their culture and language. The characters are drawn with great verve, especially Inspector John Fernack, the various members of the gangland hierarchy, and the mysterious Fay Edwards, who falls in love with Simon at the same time as she is helping him to kill just about everyone she knows.Above all, Charteris shows himself once again a first-rate story-teller. Gripping from start to finish.P.S. For a list of &mdash; and discussion of &mdash; all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To...

It starts out of nowhere and attempts to cover subjects, but instead dribbles tidbits of information with the shallowest possible coverage.To make matters worse, the examples given in the book are long, tedious and confusing - especially for people who try to tackle programming for the first time - the intended audience of the book.The only salvation for this book is that the technology it describes is so simple to begin with.The most disappointing part though, is the book's index. Most people look there to find quick references and answers. This book's index will drive you straight to the web. The index is disorganized and for even a simple issue like file uploads, I had to research the web before finding information in the book about it.Although reasonably price, it is not a great choice. It is another example of a lazy publisher who scrambles to get a book out as fast as possible without any serious proofing. Stay away."},{"Title":"Macromedia ColdFusion MX Development","review":"Having no prior programming experience (sans some Basic on my C64 when I was about 8 years old); diving right into Coldfusion seemed like quite the daunting task. However, after working thru the first 3 chapters in a matter of an hour, the tone of the book and inferred concepts just starting clicking, and within the span of 2 days, I was able to walk away with pretty much all the knowledge I needed to start immediatly on my intended projects. I was simply blown away.Eric Ladd does a fine job of working you thru the various functions and tags; and although actually &quot;trying&quot; all the examples given may teeter on excess, they do a great job in the capacity that as you follow along, your able to pop the lightbulb above your head continuously, and get that reassuring sense of &quot;Yeah...I get this.&quot;That's not to say that you don't have to do your fair share of actual, eh, &quot;learning&quot;. There were several occasions where I found myself needing to get up and take a break from it all, only to return with a fresh outlook and a bit more caffeine in the bloodstream. It's a very well written book, but it's also quite concise. It doesn't waste time with redundant examples, and re-iteration. It's a book that NEEDS to be re-read, and something you'll find yourself returning to as you develop.That said, it is a very quick read, and most should be able to get thru within the span of 2-3 days. I opted not to complete the tutorials at the end, but giving them a read thru will confirm if you &quot;know your stuff&quot;.This is a beginners book, but creates a great foundation to build upon, and enough knowledge to start utilizing all of the CF resources out there. It's a great place to start, and a very rewarding read."},{"Title":"Macromedia ColdFusion MX Development","review":"My students and I have found this to be an excellent, well-paced book for ColdFusion classroom instruction. Definitely superior to Macromedia training products in which the examples are somewhat canned.I had very favorable email interactions with the author, who also teaches ColdFusion at the university level. I don't know what the last reviewers problem was, but if you can't find the databases on the Que Web site, you should contact Que as they ultimately own the book and its contents and are responsible for its support. The author provided me with a number of Zip files with code and databases. The databases for chapters 4 and 5 are so simplistic, anyone should be able to recreate them with the most basic MS Access skills.Again, great book for classroom use, though that is admittedly a niche market. Even so, the inviting style and tutorial exposition still make this a good starter book for the newbie."},{"Title":"Macromedia ColdFusion MX Development","review":"... This book is a \\"mess\\".

Lewis has devised a humorous, satircal novel; yet also one that sadly and painfully hits close to home. He has cleverly and novelly set up his book as a series of letters that the \\"Devil\\" writes to his nephew who is learning the trade. Many of the tactics used by the Devil become painfully clear to the reader and provokes deep thinking and questioning. Overall many letters contained strong, learning themes yet the overall presentation of ideas, although creative and unique, may have contributed to the overall lack of unity in the novel. I felt it read more like an essay than a novel. Overall though, the ideas were strong and poignant and stimulated thinking yet the setup perhaps hindered the developemnt of lasting impressions from the novel. As you read it, you gained insight, yet because the points were stated and then immdietely abandonded, it is hard to imagine this novel as leaving deep impressions in the mind."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"After a month and a half it hasn't shown up yet.

However, I was disappointed with the concept. Why does Christianity continue to point fingers at the Devil and/or demons?Lewis uses an interesting format (letters written from a ficitious demon named Screwtape to his aspiring nephew Wormwood) to convey an important message, namely temptation. Christians must be very aware of temptations that confront them in everyday life, and Lewis does his usual, masterful job of inserting wit and humor into a very serious subject. He provides many useful insights into temptation and often helps the Christian see why things are not always what they seem at first glance.That being said, I'm frustrated with Christianity's repeatedly blaming Satan and his demons for our own sins. The Bible teaches us that &quot;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.&quot; Man is wicked enough on his own to fall head first into a horrendous life of sin. We need no assistence from the evil one. Maybe I'm reading too much into Lewis' work, but in today's church, when angels and demons seem all the rage, I think many may miss this message's true intent."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"It seems here like everybody absolutely loves this book. Whilte it does have some witty moments of insight, I found the book to be enormously overrated.The allegorical form of writing, as letters from a demon to another demon, gets old pretty quickly and it gets extremely repetetive and frankly quite boring. Way too much time is spent on how to tempt humans away from Christianity, and to a non-Christian, those long portions of texts are completely uninteresting.Lewis does make some good points about human behaviour in general that are both witty and insightful, but those are exceptions and for the most part \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is quite boring. The novella would have been good if it was about one third as long and not be so centered on Christianity. Christians will probably enjoy it more than I did, though."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C. S.

That kind of person almost always turns out to be the staunchest and most annoying type of True Believer. I have the same basic problem with this book that I had with Richard Dawkin's \\"The God Delusion\\". Both books were written in a way that was likely to titillate readers who share the authors beliefs and annoy people who disagree. I found it interesting that they were both products of Oxford. I wonder if that means anything. My biggest problem with this book comes from a Christian point of view, not an atheist or agnostic one. In Lewis's cosmology not only do you have to believe in Christ the Redeemer but you have to live an uncompromisingly saintly life or your going to end up as dinner for some demon, which Lewis obviously believes in literally. Lewis is just the Pharisees he condemns to Hell. He can see the speck in everybody else's eye but he can't see the log in his own. He swallows a camel and chokes on a gnat. If there is a Hell I wouldn't say he deserves to go there, but if there is a Hell there is a Purgatory and he deserves to spend at least a few decades there."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I started my search looking for The Screwtape Letters on CD as narrated by John Cleese.

This was, and remains, such a great way to address the problem of human sin because other-worldly treatments lose their believability so quickly.Certainly, this volume deserves to be called a classic because it continues to be quoted by theologians, clergy and ethicists alike, in this age.

Every aspect discussed is 100% applicable today."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Lewis wrote this book with the serious intention of bringing souls to Christ. As an atheist myself, I find most of Lewis' serious works, such as \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"The Abolition of Man\\" to be frankly absurd and illogical. \\"Screwtape Letters,\\" however, is so funny that I recommend it even to non-Christians. Screwtape's single-minded wickedness is like all the greedy, cruel, and arrogant persons you have ever met, rolled up in a single Machiavellian package. Lewis does a fiendishly clever job bringing his devils to life and making sure their every word brings hellfire to mind.Many of the ethical points Lewis makes are applicable to anyone, Christian or not. I really like Lewis' back-handed reminder that when trying to do good in the world, it's just as important to be kind to the people you meet every day, as it is to save humanity. Lewis also emphasizes the role of simple pleasures in creating happiness, as well as the natural ebb and flow of pleasure in human life. This is great advice, and I wish more attention were paid to it in our economic and political arrangements.As I said before, \\"Screwtape Letters\\" is highly amusing and contains some good advice. Before taking the Christianity Lewis puts forward as overcoming these devils too seriously, though, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. Christianity has a sad tendency to ignore the major problems of our times, such as overpopulation and exhaustion of resources, because they aren't mentioned in the Bible. I would suggest Kunstler's book \\"The Long Emergency\\" for more on this. For a defense of the naturalistic worldview, I would suggest Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" or Taner Edis' \\"The Ghost in the Universe.\\" As a scientist, I think it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Lewis' demon, Screwtape, uses this book to advise his nephew in the fine art of corrupting a man's soul. The advice is clear and detailed: turning healthy pleasures into vices, prohibiting clear and rational thought, encouraging divisiveness over any issue or none at all, and lots more. It's a proven plan which, unfortunately, sometimes fails. Despite every distraction, excess, and false trail, some people still reach a higher plane.This wonderful book is written from a strongly Christian point of view. No, Lewis does not propose any literal reality for these allegorical demons, but he clearly points out the human weaknesses that so often expand and crowd out the valid and valuable parts of life. In fact, this book need not be taken from a Christian standpoint at all. Whatever morality and ideals you hold to, they are under the same kind of attack as Lewis' Christian virtues.This book is quite enjoyable in itself. It's even better as an introduction to Lewis' other work, especially his space trilogy (Perelandra, Out of the Silent Planet, That Hideous Strength). Those books play out the human strengths and weaknesses that Lewis isolates here.This really will help thinking readers take stock of themselves. I know it points out my room for improvement. I recommend this very highly.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Screwtape Letters stands besides &quot;Mere Christianity,&quot; &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;, &quot;Confessions,&quot; &quot;City of God,&quot; and &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; as one of the most crucial pieces of reading material outside of scripture itself.Without getting too mystical; if you have an open mind, reading The Screwtape Letters is an experience, rather than an education.Do not hesitate.

The book is fairly short and could be a quick read, but you will want to stop and digest each letter for a while before moving on to the next. Excellent for a study group.Amanda Hamm, author ofDear Jane Letters"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C. S. Lewis was, without a doubt, one of the best writers of the century, and this book is C. S. Lewis at the height of his powers. It is clever, entertaining and insightful, at points even profound. At points you're almost tempted to take notes. People tend to think of \\"informative\\" and \\"entertaining\\" as opposites, or at least mutually exclusive. Lewis proves that that isn't true by writing a book that is both at the exact same time.Some people seem think that this book is depressing or too heavy, but I don't think that's true. It's definitely not a dime novel or pulp fiction, and I suppose it does require a lot more thought than a lot of novels, but don't let that stop you.

Lewis' wit is ever present in this volume too, and it's always a pleasure to read this excellent author. I truly believe he is a massive monument in intellectual history because of his theological writings.The Screwtape Letters are basically letters written by a demon named Screwtape - he is an old senior demon - writing to his nephew Wormwood, a young demon sent to earth to tempt a human (the \\"patient\\"). He gives him advice on how to tempt humans. That may sound simple, but you have no idea of how intricate the tempting is. Along the way, Screwtape makes some very fine points about our modern world and its current ideology.Much more than merely theological or Christian, this book possesses some really excellent psychological insights in human behaviour in groups and inner behaviour.It's a relatively short read and is a really good one; it happens to be quite some fun as well. Lewis uses irony in seriously gifted ways and I never got tired of it, not to say that he over-uses it, not at all.Definitely another Lewis classic."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is a masterpiece.

While anyone could read this book, it will be best understood and appreciated teenagers and older. It is both entertaining and philosophical.

It is an easy read and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"All art is propaganda. So said George Orwell. And if that is true, then C. S. Lewis' THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is surely one of the most brilliant and effective pieces of religio-literary propaganda which ever crawled out of a typewriter. In this thoughtful, wickedly comic, e'er so slightly horrifying story, Lewis makes the greatest negative case for becoming a Christian I've ever heard. I say \\"negative case\\" because this novel is far less an argument that you should love God as it is that you should fear the Devil - but I'm getting ahead of myself already. To the story...THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is an epistolary novel - like DRACULA, it is written as a series of letters. What makes it different from most epistolary novels is that the guy writing the letters is in this case an arch-devil named Screwtape. Screwtape is a high mucky-muck in the bureacracy of Hell, and is counseling his neophyte nephew Wormwood on how best to corrupt a particular Englishman into the devil's dominion. Using this very clever format as his guise, Lewis makes a systematic and extremely effective attack on materialism, idolatry, moral apathy, atheism, shallow Christianity, and much of the popular political thought of the day be it Left or Right (the novel was written during World War II). Screwtape, an experienced fiend, explains to his bumbling relation the many ways a man can be turned away from God, and once turned, kept that way.The novel is written in a very highbrow style that betrays Lewis' very high level of scholarship (he was an Oxford don) as well as his theological training, but while it occasionally begins to sound too much like a lecture given to seminarians, it is riddled with brilliant little aphorisms and remarks that stick with the reader long after the book is finished, such as: \\"To get a man's soul and give him nothing in return - that is the devil's greatest pleasure.\\" Or, in explaining the philosophy of Hell (and of Nazism): \\"\`To be' means \`to be in competition.'\\" In addition, it is laced with a kind of wicked humor, such as when Screwtape becomes so agitated at his nephew's treachery that he turns into a gigantic centipede and has to have the rest of his letter written by a secretary. But what it mainly gets you to do is admire the way in which Lewis, a very devout and sincere Christian, managed to play a literal devil's advocate with such skill and daring. Taken literally, the book is actually a furious and well-reasoned attack on religious faith, and Lewis, like most theologians (or political idealogues) clearly knew every page of the \\"other side's\\" playbook. Indeed, Lewis admits in the afterward that it was so easy to write from the Satanic point of view that he became depressed. But he also manages to inflict depression on those who don't agree with him - his brief sketch about the dismay, surprise and horror that souls feel when they realize they have been duped by ideology, lust, greed, or just plain laziness into turning away from God, and are now doomed to end up as cows in the devil's slaughterhouse, is enough to make even the hardest-core atheist a bit uncomfortable.The book has its issues, not the least which is Lewis' deft but nevertheless noticable tap-dancing around some of more problematic aspects of his religion - for example, the idea that a loving God sees no difference between, say, a good-hearted and kindly unbeliever and a man like Stalin or Hitler. Indeed, Lewis seems as determined to frighten the reader with the wily power of \\"Our Father Down Below\\" (as Screwtape calls Satan) as he does to come up with reasons why people should love a God whose mantra seems to be, \\"Love me and obey me or I'll torture you forever.\\"I should close here by stating the obvious, i.e. that I am not a Christian. Nor was Orwell, who noted that THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS was \\"a flanking movement in the great counter-attack by religion against atheism.\\" As a rule I dislike religious tracts, but I also feel that it does a brain, body and soul good to hear things which run against one's own dearly-held beliefs. One of the most pernicious failings of our own era is the refusal to accept that someone who disagrees with you might nevertheless have something worthwhile to hear, and so I would especially recommend this novel to those of little (Christian) faith."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Very well read and I am enjoying it over and over. So glad I bought this version.Couldn't imagine it being better. Great audio book!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"\\"The Bible\\" is by far my favorite book. \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" is #2. Everything else is much farther down the totem pole. \\"Was\\" that is! Why I never read \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" beats me (maybe the name threw me?). Anyway, on a whim, I ordered a copy thru Amazon, and I have been entranced ever since. \\"The Screwtape letters\\" is now my #3 favorite book. Gives you an idea about Satan's tactics ... and also how WE ourselves are often our own worst enemy. A superb book in my opinion. And, by the way, Amazon can really save you some big money with their price comparisons AND their shipping charge comparisons too. Wish I had tried Amazon a long time ago!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Whenever I review a book on a topic having to do with religion or politics, I always like to read the good and bad reviews. The bad reviews on this book are just amusing. This book is condemned as everything from sophmoric to \\"Christian brainwashing.\\" Anti-Christians exist just like anti-Semites and anti-Muslims and anti-Black and so forth.Anyway, the book is a pleasure to read. I suppose if you are hostile to open thought like many anti-Christians claim not to be, then you shouldn't read this if you aren't a Christian. C.S. Lewis never tried to hide his religion or his faith so how it comes as a surprise to some people that all of his books have a similar theme is beyond me.So the book is a series of letters written by the elder of two demons, Screwtape. In his letters he is writing to his nephew, Wormwood is out for the first time to bring about the spiritual ruin of his target, a young man.Through the letters, it is revealed the favorite tactics of the demon, such as creating a feeling of malaise and apathy in an individual so that they waste away time or fostering a resentment against family members.There is a continuing sense of humor in the letters as Screwtape becomes more and more annoyed by Wormwood's growing number of mistakes, such as allowing the man to remember to pray to God.The book delivers many messages, all of which are relevant today. One of the messages delivered is that spiritual ruin does not occur in one fell swoop but over time. The demons are patient and persistant. The fall from grace is gradual, much like any other form of corruption. I suppose these messages might not be accepted by some but what about the other messages, such as not giving in to apathy and by forgiving others, both of which are seen as counter-productive to the demons.For Christians, this is a wonderful book. Like much of his work, there is alot of allusion here. Does C.S. Lewis really believe that there is a department somewhere in Hell where demons do paperwork like some office building here on Earth? Or are the demons symbolic of our own internal struggle? Is it a demon that makes you lie or is it your own self giving in to your selfish desires? The book shows through the letters, how our internal struggles can turn us away from God over time.For non-Christians, well for those who aren't outright hostile towards this faith, this is a book that you can enjoy as well. So you may not believe in the Christian God or any god but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the Star Wars movies, now does it? There are still positive messages to be found in this book. Messages which can make all of us better people."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Lewis' famed series of letters from high-ranking demon Screwtape to his novice nephew Wormwood might seem to be his most accessible Christian work, yet it is strangely off-putting initially. I think it may be that because Lewis writes so well on bright, joyful subjects, managing to be pious without seeming self-righteous or stuffy, it's somehow a disappointment to read him playing a diabolical and uncharitable character--however cleverly he may do it. In the short preface included for \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" Lewis confirms this impression by noting that the writing was easy but not enjoyable: \\"Though I had never written anything more easily, I never wrote with less enjoyment. . . . [Although] it was easy to twist one's mind into the diabolical attitude, it was not fun, or not for long. The strain produced a sort of spiritual cramp\\" (183).That said, the book makes extremely good use of the device as it unfolds, providing Lewis with a platform to discuss the many chinks and weak spots in the spiritual armor of the new Christian without sounding paranoid or harassing. The story revolves around the efforts of an inexperienced tempter to assail the soul of a newly converted young man; in this enterprise he is advised by his uncle, who knows all the demonic tricks. Pride of one sort or another is especially worth encouraging, says Screwtape, even the pride of being a good Christian, as it leads to moral complacency, haughtiness, or flippancy about spiritual matters. Such \\"advice\\" can get old really fast if the writer takes himself too seriously, but of course Lewis is disarmingly humorous: in one especially funny scene Screwtape gets so mad at Wormwood he inadvertently transforms into a centipede.A quick read and a fun one, that also happens to be quite instructive.Included in the same book as The Screwtape Letters is the short follow-up, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" an especially fascinating speech given by the demon at a dinner of the \\"Tempters' Training College for young Devils.\\" Working from ideas in the larger work, those in attendance at this dinner are eating souls, and Screwtape is both regretful of the lack of really tasty sinners to feast on and full of hope and encouragement at the greater number of sinners finding their way to Hell. This opens a fascinating discussion of mediocrity and education. Here Lewis' predictions about the dangers of conformity and the undervaluing of individualism seem scarily accurate. Quite different in tone to the letters, yet still of a piece with them."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is only the second C.S. Lewis book i have read (the first being Mere Christianity). Therefore it was the first fiction work of his i have ever read.

It makes you realize there is probably a lot more going on in this life or in our existance that we don't understand or may not even be aware of."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I loved this book!

Quite a long time ago. I remembered being baffled about why all the fuss, and why was this supposed to be such a good book. Of course Kafka's Metamorphasis raised the same questioning at a slightly later date. Imagine my delight being able to approach these and many other books as an older adult, without worrying about a grade, and lapses in memory. The book is delightful, and the service of the supplier was equally pleasing. I am enamoured of Amazon.com and its suppliers."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"INTRODUCTION:This was my introduction to C.S. Lewis, as the writer. I have watched the Disney [the Chronicles of] Narnia, but never made time for his famous books \\"Mere Christianity\\", \\"Surprised by Joy\\", \\"Reflections on the Psalms\\", \\"Space Trilogy\\" and \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\"I am glad this book has been my first introduction to C.S. Lewis. This book is a unique book because I have never heard of a book being written from the perspective of the bad spirits. At least not in the Christian books genre.AUTHOR:CONTENT:Basically the book is a compilation of short chapters (2-4 pages). Each chapter is a letter that Screwtape (name of the uncle) to Corkscrew (name of the nephew). Both Screwtape and Corkscrew work for the Devil (whom they call .... ) and his kingdom is called ..... Corkscrew's mission is to subvert the human who was assigned to his care. Screwtape's mission is to advise his nephew in how to better accomplish his mission, and in the end work against God's Kingdom, which they call -Here are some excerpts from this wonderfully psychological book:CONCLUSION:You will be surprised by this book, because the format and idea behind the plot is quite unique. In the 1961 edition by Collier Books there is the great introduction to the topic by C.S. Lewis, which is fascinating and informative in its own right (especially about the topic of \\"angels\\" throught western history). What I took away from this book, is that the evil one will try to subvert us at the mental level, to work at the anti-psychology of our soul. Knowing the strategies of the enemy, is half-way towards winning the battle. This earthly life is the battle field. But someone in the 1st century Palestine, had already won the battle for us, God's children. How wonderful, and what a way to thrive on this beautiful planet."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I got this book for a friend around Christmas time and he'd read it in about a week after recieving it, despite being back in the thick of things at a busy job. So I figured it was good and borrowed it and quickly read every word, including the foreword, toast, preface all that.It's fascinating to only hear one side of a conversation, especially one that reads almost like a lecture from a parent. This parent however, would be an evil one trying to teach his child how to tempt a man away from Christ. Even if you aren't a Christian, this should give you a great insight into how Christian deals with concepts of temptation, compromise, struggles in life, etc. Because Lewis truly is an excellent writer, this is all done in a way that makes it fun to read and even funny at times, despite giving you an overwhelming sense that inevitably you'll fail in many ways...on the other hand \\"the Enemy\\" as Lewis's demon calls him is forgiving.It's a short book, but contains a lot of great social commentary on how people perceive each other, themselves, how the school system in the US is flawed, how war effects faith...all very meaty subjects all dealt with in short bursts. It gives you a lot to think about in a 4-5 page stint, but also vividly paints the picture so you can sort it out easier.Genius"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"A remarkably insightful and engaging description of the psychology of evil. While it is written from a Christian perspective, it speaks to anyone, regardless of religious inclination (even atheist) who is interested in how their dark side gets the better of them."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I feel like I am piling on with already having 292 positive reviews. However, I have to say that this book is a true, one of a kind, classic that every spiritual seeker should read.Most of us are keen to the overt tactics that we think Satan uses, but this book really opens up the subtlties of Satan's temptation of man or woman. You can almost put together your own Screwtape letters in your own life after reading the letters that Screwtape writes to Wormwood.CS Lewis has an enjoyable writing style with any work that he writes... this in itself is worth the purchase of the book. However, while you read through these entertaining letters, you will laugh and be deep in thought at the same time. What a great read for any one..... If you haven't read it... read it.... I am going to read it again."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I loved this book when I first read it a few years ago, and still learned a lot on reading it again. Lewis maintains a lively tone while handling serious subjects, and takes stabs at core issues that remain applicable today. The diabolic point of view is very thought-provoking and challenges the Christian to a better daily fight."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Definitely one of the best of C. S. Lewis books I've come across, and the man has written a fair number of good books I think.What stands out about this book is how it approaches the Christian life, and human experience in general, from the devil's perspective. The book is really a series of letters between a senior devil and a junior devil which lends insight into how the devil deceives man. As a Christian, I found the book both a challenge to be watchful and alert and also a reassurance of the Lord's ultimate power over Satan.The book is an entertaining read as well, humorous in many part. A piece of literary genius and a great Christian devotional book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The atheist probably wouldn't fully appreciate this book. The target audience for this one, like the un-named man that Wormwood has been assigned, is the Christian who needs a booster shot. Lewis, a former atheist himself, speaks through Wormwood of how a Christian, who despite being surrounded by the church, might fall away through simple atrophy. He is biting, sarcastic when he needs to be, and most of all, dead on target."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"\\"Not only a Christian but such a Christian - a vile, sneaking, simpering, demure, monosyllabic, mouse-like, watery, insignificant, virginal, bread-and-butter miss.

Screwtape literally reveals the devil's playbook in keeping their charges from the \\"Enemy\\", who (much to Screwtape's dismay) actually \\"loves the hairless bipeds.\\"C.S.

Lewis touches on love, spirituality, pride, and a plethora of other issues that may help undermine the desires of the \\"Enemy\\" and deliver the desired soul to \\"Our Father Below.\\" With wit and humor, Lewis delves into some deep issues, yet does not sound preachy or sermon-like in his prose. Indeed, Lewis does provide some scathing criticisms of the social order of his day (1941), and makes repeated attacks on the intelligentsia and socialists and those who \\"believe that earth can be turned into Heaven.\\"This novel is targeted toward a Christian audience, yet it would be an enjoyable read for those outside of this faith as well. On the surface, this is simply a mocking correspondence showing the conflict between spiritual forces. Yet, on a deeper level, this is a philosophical tale and provides various inherent truths for leading our lives. It manages to be both thought-provoking and entertaining without being overbearing and preachy.Overall, this is a good read, and is as relevant today as it was in 1941 when it was written."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Screwtape Letters is a short work of religious fiction by C.S. Lewis originally published in 1942. Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with well-known works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children's fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.The Screw Tape Letters consists of a series of letters between a senior demon and his apprentice regarding how to best tempt his human \\"patient\\". This setting is used by Lewis to discuss many of the hurdles and sins that humans encounter in day-to-day life. Lewis has the rare skill of being able to effectively communicate theological ideas in an unassuming manner to the general reader. From my perspective this is one of Lewis' best pieces of religious fiction (the other being the Great Divorce). Many of the challenges and failings mentioned in the book continue to resonate with the modern reader.Overall, I highly recommended this short book to all readers. Those who enjoy this small book may also enjoy The Great Divorce."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"From the start this book was fascinating.

One of the prefaces had an interesting testimony; a student had picked up the book because she said it was the least amount of pages and on the reading list for class. If looks can be deceiving The Screwtape Letters packs a wallop.The Screwtape Letters is simplistic in thought with only a handful of characters. The amazing thing is the perspective in which it was written. The author poses a new concept in written form on how the devil and his demons come against a believer in Christ. Everyday circumstances and emotions are the very target concept of the book.After reading this book a new perspective shed on the scripture, Ephesians 6:12. \\"We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this age, against spiritual host of wickedness in the heavenly places.\\"This book by C.S.

Wormwood, the novice demon, has taken on a new 'client' and receives advice from senior demon Screwtape.

I have heard that Lewis took some flack in his day for publishing these letters, they were just too real, too close to home, as if some would use them as a guide in being the devils advocate. In reality Lewis does a great service by showing how this world looks to those spirits that are working against the greatest &quot;enemy&quot; ever. To anyone new to C.S.

Unless you are unusually self-aware or totally self-unaware, this book may/will show you some dark spots of your heart, hidden so deeply that you no longer realize their presence. Satan (along with his minions) is truly worthy of the moniker deceiver. Maybe the devil does \\"make\\" us do it, but we still may suffer the eternal consequences if we let Satan play his hand to the full.This fictional book is well-written as a series of letters from a demon in his bureaucratic office to his subordinate field worker. It tells us how a young demon may learn the craft of temptation while we learn along with him. It also tells about the hearts of his temptees (us) and how noble we often feel while we are being lured away from Jesus. After all, pride may be our greatest sin.C.S.

It had that lovely smell that old books get after being read and spending many years on a library shelf, which makes it even more of a treasure in my opinion. It was a special gift to a young girl in my boyfriend's family that I discovered is an avid reader, and I was delighted to find that she and I shared a common love for literature. I sincerely hope that she not only enjoys the book not only for the entertainment value it provides, but takes from it the moral teachings, and that it makes her think on how temptation is always just around the corner, and every decision we make affects the paths we take in life. This book helped shape the way I looked at my own spirituality, and the choices I made in my life throughout the years. I hope it does the same for her. At fourteen, it is a wonderful book to help guide a teen without being overbearing or 'preachy'. It amuses, makes you both laugh, and worry about the plight of the victim, the goals of the demon trying to tempt the Christian, the failures of both from time to time, and the fragile nature of man.I highly recommend this to readers fourteen and older.

Lewis into current thought, I have not been able to recommend \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" to enough of my friends and colleagues. The book, although set with World War II as the back drop, is timeless.The idea for the series of Letters came to Lewis in July 1940 during a church service at Oxford. The idea was for a book titled \\"As One Devil to Another\\" and would be a series of letter to a new junior devil from his mature, ready to retire uncle. After further thought the main characters became \\"His Abysmal Sublimity Under-Secretary Screwtape\\" the uncle and his nephew Wormwood. The letters are the reverse of what a \\"Christian\\" would think with \\"Our Father Below\\" being the devil and \\"the Enemy\\" being God.The book consists of 31 letters. Each is a gift to the reader. They are all short and very pointed as to controlling the thoughts and actions of humans. Letter XI is one of my favorites. In it, Lewis discusses the cases of human laughter and Screwtape divides them into: Joy, Fun, the Joke Proper and Flippancy. Flippancy is wonderfully done:\\" But Flippancy is the best of all. In the first place it is very economical. Only a clever human can make a real Joke about virtue, or indeed about anything else; any of them can be trained to talk as if virtue were funny. Among flippant people the joke is always assume to have been made. No one actually makes it; but every serious subject is discussed in a manner which implies that they have already found a ridiculous side to it. If prolonged, the habit of Flippancy builds up around a man the finest armour-plating against the Enemy (God) that I know, and it is quite free from the dangers inherent ion the other sources of laughter. It is a thousand miles away from joy: it deadens, instead of sharpening, the intellect; and it excites no affection between those who practice it.\\"I'm buying more copies to give away now!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"It is difficult to describe the importance of The Screwtapes Letters in a few sentences. This captivating novel relates the dialogue between two demons who have the task of derailing their assigned person from following the Christian walk altogether or, at least, rendering their spiritual walk fruitless and joyless. It is very disturbing initially to read as they call God the enemy, but it is important to understand the true spiritual battle going on. Deep insights are coveyed. For instance, one of the demons relates discouragement that his human is going to church. The other one responds that often this is the best place for a Christian to dwell that they might be easily lulled into a complacent numbness to their spiritual condition. This is an honest and excellent book that you won't want to put down!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Great book. Lewis has taken this difficult subject (\\"How the Devil works\\") and put it in a format that everyone can read and enjoy. Well, some people may not enjoy it, but you can't help but learn from it. This is one of the few books that I can read over and over again (partly because it is pretty short, but mostly because it is so thought-provoking). If you liked this one, I might also suggest Lewis's space trilogy (\\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", \\"Perelandra\\", \\"That Hideous Strength\\") - which are very good, but not so well known. Lewis is one of my favorite authors and this is one of my favorite books of his. You can't miss."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is a series of letters written from an older temptor demon to a younger one. The book consists of a total of 31 letters and is one of the most profound extrapolations of how demons work in the world. Set against the backdrop of WWII Great Britain, Screwtape's \\"nephew\\" is Wormwood, a newly elevated demon that has been given his first patient. Each of Screwtape's letters provide advice to Wormwood on how best to bring his patient into his camp and then when the patient becomes a Christian, advice on how to keep the man from living his faith. We never read Wormwood's responses, but each of Screwtape's letters provide an almost uncanny insight into what is essentially demonic thinking. Much of what is written is rooted in Biblical scripture, though Lewis ties in many events of the 1942 world. The book, though full of challenging and thought-provoking ideas, is fairly easy to read. In fact, outside of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA it is Lewis' most easy-to-read work.C.S. Lewis referred to THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS as being the most difficult work he had ever written. He said writing from the perspective of a demon was too draining and darkened his life. Lewis was a popular author throughout most of his life, but very few of his works ever reached the audience that THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS did and does (the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series and MERE CHRISTIANITY being the only exceptions). The book vaulted Lewis from being an occassional literary personality, to a celebrated world-famous author. The book was so popular that the publishers courted Lewis for years to write a sequel. He never fully gave in because he couldn't bring himself back into the \\"diabolical ventriloquism\\" mindset. However, Lewis did acquiesce somewhat nearly a decade letter with the very short \\"essay\\" SCREWTAPE PROPOSES A TOAST. This edition of the book includes a nice introduction by Richard Gillman. Overall, THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is a great book and one of the best that I can recommend when one is trying to understand the nature of evil.\\"In the long run either Our Father of the Enemy will say 'mine' of each thing that exists, and specially of each man....At present the Enemy says 'mine' of everything on the pedantic, legalistic ground that He made it.\\" (Letter XXI)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Well, I won't repeat the other 100+ plus reviewers about what a great book &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is, other than to say it will reward you to read it. I'd just like to comment on the unabridged audio version, narrated by John Cleese. They couldn't have picked a better vocal talent to do the Letters. In the introduction, Cleese speaks the persona of the Oxford/Cambridge don C.S. Lewis, not mimicing Lewis' voice, but copying the style of speech heard on Lewis' World War II broadcasts that eventually became &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. Then, through the rest of the tapes, Cleese becomes the ultimate fiendish (literally) bureaucrat, Screwtape. Screwtape's sputtering indignation and fury at his nephew's incompetence, which leads him to turn into a giant centipede, is captured to perfection. In the closing essay, &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot;, his effete snobbery at the fine vintage of bottled Pharisee is delightful. All in all, the ideal audio presentation of Lewis' masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Ok, so you are curious about apologists and Christian theological writing, but aren't quite ready to tackle Tillich's Systematic Theology? Then the Screwtape Letters is a perfect choice. Not only a classic, it deals with questions of evil influence and human foibles in a way we can digest, both recognizing its relevance in our lives and laughing at Lewis' immense wit.The elderly devil Screwtape advises his devil nephew Wormwood on the subtleties of evil and how the easiest way to access the human soul is through the subject's own hubris.In a brief 134 pages Lewis captures the essential understanding of the existence of evil."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I'm not usually a fan of &quot;books on tape&quot; but this is a case where inspired reading (more of a one-man performance) brings out nuances which don't come across on paper. Screwtape was the first C.S. Lewis book I read as an adult (after reading the Narnia books nearly 10 times apiece as a child). Though I'm not a Christian, I found a lot of inspiration in Screwtape. Lewis is so good at capturing the little games we all play and the avoidance techniques we all use. He writes so well about the redemption of souls, and the meaning of our spiritual side. I remember finding some of the wit in the book a little obvious. Not so with Cleese's reading! He has never done anything better. His comedic talents bring out the humor of the book, including some lines which weren't funny on paper. But his performance ranges far beyond the merely funny: the menace with which he says &quot;I could show you a pretty cageful down here . . .&quot; or the quiet hypnotic way he reads Lewis's lines about the road to Hell being &quot;soft underfoot, . . . without milestones, without signposts&quot; -- these things send a chill down the spine. My only regret about these tapes is that four of the Letters are not included. But the remaining letters are read in full with no abridgement. I literally wore out my first copy of these tapes and have ordered a 2nd set."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S.

I HOPE she enjoys it, even as I wonder if a fifty year old book could strike a chord with her -- the way it did with me, when I was her age. She seemed eager enough to borrow a copy (I have two) just as soon as I described the book's delightful premise:\\"Screwtape\\" I told her, \\"is letters from a senior devil to a junior devil - and it's the funniest thing C.S. Lewis ever wrote - Have you heard of C.S. Lewis?\\" I asked. \\"No? Well he authored \`Narnia.' (Neither of us has seen the movie yet.)I told her 'Screwtape' is funny because (like all good humor) it seems so TRUE. Or at least you want to BELIEVE it's real, as \`Screwtape' the experienced devil coaches his nephew \`Wormwood' in his first assigned task: to \\"secure the damnation\\" of his 'patient' -- a young man who has just become a Christian.As with \\"Narnia,\\" the story unfolds in wartime (WWII) England. That's a long time ago for someone 21 years old and \\"I'm really interested\\" I said \\"to find out if the 'dialogue' of this book still speaks to someone your age.\\"\\"Personally, I think it would make good movie\\" I said. \\"It has been made into a talking book - read, I think, by John Cleese - the funny guy who starred in the movie \`A Fish Called Wanda\\" - I read somewhere he's recorded a version of \`Screwtape.' \\"----So . . after loaning that copy of \\"Screwtape\\" today, I opened, at random, my OTHER copy -- it fell open to page 24 -- and I re-discovered why I've loved this book so much for so many years.It's the sort of book you can open almost anywhere - years after you first read it -- and find yourself laughing out loud - and falling in love once again, with the written magic of C.S. Lewis at his 'finest hour.' Well here, if you can spare two minutes -- get comfortable and see if this random sampling, from page 24, \\"Chapter IV\\" -- 'speaks' to YOU:----\\"My dear Wormwood, The amateurish suggestions in your latest letter warn me that it is high time for me to write to you fully on the painful subject of prayer . . .\\"The best thing, where possible, is to keep the \`patient' (the young man who is spiritually up for grabs) from the serious intention of praying. When (someone like him) is an adult, recently re-converted to the Enemy' (Screwtape's term for Christianity's founder) - such as your man, this is best done by encouraging him to remember - or to THINK he remembers - the parrot-like nature of his prayers in childhood.\\"In reaction against that, he may be persuaded to aim at something entirely spontaneous, inward, informal, and \`un-regularized' And what this will actually mean to a beginner will be an effort to produce in himself a vaguely devotional MOOD . . . in which real concentration of will and intelligence have no part.\\"One of their poets, Coleridge, has recorded that he did not pray \`with moving lips and bended knees' but merely \`composed his spirit to love' and indulged a \`sense of supplication.' That is EXACTLY the sort of prayer we want; and since it bears a superficial resemblance to the prayer of silence, as practiced by those who are far advanced in the Enemy's service, clever and lazy \`patients' can be taken in by it for quite a long time.\\"At the very LEAST, they can be persuaded that the bodily position makes no difference to their prayers; for they constantly forget what you must always remember, that they are animals and that whatever their bodies do affects their souls.\\"It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things OUT.\\"If this fails, you MUST fall back on a subtler misdirection of his intention. Whenever they are attending to the Enemy Himself we are defeated, but there are ways of preventing them from doing so. The simplest is to turn their gaze away from Him towards themselves.\\"Keep them watching their own minds and trying to produce FEELINGS there, by the action of their own wills. (So that) when they meant to ask Him for Charity, let them instead start trying to manufacture charitable feelings for themselves - and not notice that this is what they are doing.\\"When they are meant to pray for courage, let them really be trying to FEEL brave. When they say they are praying for forgiveness, let them be trying to FEEL forgiven. Teach them to estimate the value of each prayer by their success in producing the desired feelings, and NEVER let them suspect how much success or failure of that kind depends on whether they are well or ill, fresh or tired, at the moment.\\"But of course, the Enemy will not meantime be idle. Whenever there is prayer there is danger of HIS own immediate action. He is cynically indifferent to the dignity of HIS position (and to OURS as pure spirits!) and to human animals on their knees He pours out self-knowledge in quite shameless fashion.\\"But even if He defeats your first attempt at misdirection, we have a subtler weapon . . .\\"After describing that more subtle \`weapon' in detail, -- and it concerns the true nature of God as opposed to the \`composite images' that can be \\"derived from pictures of the Enemy as He appeared during (His) Incarnation\\" (20 centuries earlier) Screwtape advises his green nephew:\\"Whatever the nature of his composite (picture of the \`Enemy') you must keep your \`patient' praying to IT - to the thing that he has made - be it something in his own head or a crucifix on the wall - and NOT to the Person who has made him.\\"You may even encourage him to attach great importance to the correction and improvement of his composite object, and to keep it steadily in his imagination during the whole prayer. For if he ever comes to make the distinction, if ever he consciously directs his prayers \`Not to what I think thou art, but to what thou knowest thyself to be,' our situation is, for the moment, desperate.\\"The good news, says the \`senior devil,' is that, \\"in avoiding this situation - the real nakedness of the human soul in prayer - you will be helped by the fact that the humans themselves do not desire it as much as they suppose. There's such a thing as getting more than they bargained for!\\"That \\"more than they bargained for,\\" Screwtape explains (earlier in this same chapter) is that humans (at least the majority, who are far from saints) - \\"have never known that ghastly luminosity, that stabbing and searing glare (of true self-knowledge) which makes the background of permanent pain in our own lives (as devils).Your affectionate uncle,Screwtape.-----Late in life C.S. Lewis was asked WHY he never wrote a sequel (apart from a few pages entitled, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\"). The greatest of Christian \`apologists' replied in effect, that it \\"hurt\\" him too much -- to maintain within himself the necessary state-of-mind where he was thinking purely as a devil -- in order that Screwtape's words could pour from his pen onto paper.Living 'inside' \\"Screwtape\\" Lewis experienced an exhausting -- even terrifying -- spiritual/psychological torment that he was NEVER prepared to re-visit. Despite the fact this little book was, until \\"Narnia,\\" his most enduring source of fame - so much so, it got C.S. Lewis onto the cover of TIME magazine -- fifty years ago -- a red cartoon devil on his shoulder, poised -- it seemed -- to whisper sweet words of prideful praise into Lewis' deaf ear.Mark BlackburnWinnipeg Canada"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This small book contains within its pages a powerful example of the authors' penetrating insight into human nature. Although aimed primarily at christians, it provides observations of the human condition useful to any student of moral psychology. These lessons are set in a series of fictional correspondances between Screwtape, a high ranking demon, and his young protege Wormwood, a young demon that has been sent out on his first assignment to ensnare a human. The seemingly gentle and fatherly advice to the young demon from his patron exposes the true designs of the masters of Hell, as well as the frailties of the human psyche that they seek to exploit in their attempts to gain a convert for their side. The demonic viewpoints are presented in an ironically sensitive and almost plaintive voice, expressing the motives and problems of the demons from their viewpoint. This wonderful literary mechanism adds power to this probing treatise on the common frailties and pitfalls of humans as they struggle in a morally ambiguous universe. Short, concise, and easily apprehended, this is a classic example of Mr. Lewis' great value as a christian apologist and an observer of human nature. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Leave it to C.S. Lewis to do the undoable--write an epistolary novel from Hell's vantage that delights as much as it educates, and illuminates even as it sends cold chills up your spine. But Lewis was a genius, and The Screwtape Letters is literary proof.Written as a series of letters from old devil Screwtape to his apprentice nephew, Wormwood, Lewis's novel tells the story of Wormwood's increasingly desperate efforts to ensnare the soul of a young Englishman during World War I. Through this correspondence we follow Wormwood's \\"patient\\" through conversion, to doubt, love and his ultimate fate. The novel's suspense comes from the question of whether or not the young man will actually escape becoming a midnight snack for Wormwood, and besides being a genuinely fun read the novel is packed with ingenious observations about innumerable human fallacies: from lust to \\"falling in love,\\" to cowardice to fanatic patriotism, piety to self-righteousness. One of Lewis's great literary gifts was his ability to pinpoint the subtle flaws in human nature that most of us probably don't think twice about but which we may end up regretting for all eternity. His eye for the touch of evil in the most seemingly innocuous areas of life lets Lewis hit all the major spiritual pressure points with amazing--and sometimes painful--accuracy.Deliciously funny as only a grand parody can be, yet likewise terrifying in its implications, The Screwtape Letters is a must-read for everyone who ever even thought about religion. A magical novel of wisdom, encouragement, and dire warning, The Screwtape Letters has my wholehearted recommendation."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Screwtape Letters is Lewis's classic collection of diabolical correspondence. In it, a senior devil gives continued advice to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on how best to tempt his victim and keep him from salvation.Lewis does not propose any concrete doctrine on devils here, and this is not his point. Rather he focuses on highlighting the ways, both large and small, that Christians are distracted from God. Lewis explores the dangers of not being purposeful toward God and life, as well as what happens to people when they give in to temptation.The book is presented as a collection of letters, all from Screwtape to Wormwood. But Lewis does a good job of making the conversation not feel one-sided, and he does a fantastic job with the devils' personalities. In fact the book is rather deeper than this, as there are two other plots going on. First is the fate of Wormwood's man. Second is the relationship between the devils, and the fate of Wormwood.The Screwtape Letters is deeper than it appears, and is thoroughly thought-provoking. Most every reader will find elements in it to which he or she can relate. Christians of all maturity levels can benefit from this book.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S. Lewis has said that he found it painful to write this book since it required him to spend days on end thinking upside-down. But it is lucky for us that he did, since the result is a book that both delights and enlightens.THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS documents the correspondence between Screwtape, a senior devil, and his nephew Wormwood, a novice tempter. Wormwood's mission is to win a soul for the underworld, and Screwtape offers him the accumulated iwdom of Hell on how to accomplish it. The result is a well-laid out map to the pitfalls to which we humans are all-too prey. Lewis' had great insight into human weakness, especially the uncanny way ou pride pops into almost every thought we might have. He is also alert to the ways our unquestioned assumtions can lead us astray. As Socrates said, the first step towards wisdom is to \\"know thyself\\" - and the tempters in this book do all they can to prevent that from happening.Lewis, of course, is a Christian, but THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS are useful to any person who is seriously engaged on the spiritual quest. I read this book about once a year, and am always chagrined to find that Screwtape is still one step ahead of me! (And he is unfailingly eloquent to boot.)This volume includes \\"Screwtape proposes a toast\\" which employs the same technique to discuss modern education. I find this a weaker part of the volume. It seems Lewis could have done more with the concept, but his arguments about the failings of modern education are much sharper in his book, THE ABOLITION OF MAN.Still, this is an invaluable volume. It is the book that I most often give away to people - it is laugh-out-loud funny, and sadly all-too true."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The only C.S. Lewis I had ever read up to this point was the Narnia series, when I was a kid. Those were great books that probably deserve a rereading at some point, even though I'm much older now. The Screwtape Letters find Lewis waxing on his favorite topic: Christianity. The book is a series of letters from Screwtape, a high-ranking administrator in Hell, to his nephew Wormwood, who is a tempter of man. The whole book is a wicked satire that Lewis pulls off well. Not only is this book fun to read, it has a serious message, too.I found myself laughing quite a bit with this book, although the laughter tends to be the nervous sort of chuckling that comes from discomfort. Too many times I found myself described within these pages. Especially when Screwtape discusses the types of laughter found among man and how these can be turned to good use in gaining souls for Hell. The most useful type of laughter for Satan is flippancy, when man laughs because he can always see a ridiculous side to everything. It is most useful because men who do this will never take anything as seriously as they should, especially the \\"Enemy\\" (the term Screwtape uses to describe God). Another interesting chapter deals with Jesus and the tendency of moderns to try to define and describe Jesus in terms that should be alien to him. Screwtape delights in efforts to make Jesus a Communist, a social theoretician or a magician/philosopher. All of these efforts divert man from whom and what Jesus really was. Screwtape also cackles over intellectuals, who are corrupted by the historical point of view. Intellectuals don't look for truth in what they read; they analyze writing styles, context, and historicity. By not looking for the truth, they are confused and turned away from God. Other topics are covered here as well: sex, marriage, prayer, Christianity and lots more. The best part of the book, by far, is the toast Screwtape gives at the end of the book. Lewis uses this toast to launch one of the most vigorous and thorough attacks on democracy that I've had the pleasure to read. I never knew Lewis had it in him!!A great book that should be read by a greater audience. I should make an effort to read more from this author. You should too. Recommended, with highest distinction."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"If you've ever heard the verse &quot;Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.&quot; (2 Cor. 11:14 NIV) and wonder what it means, Lewis masterfully illustrates it in this book.

Distraction from God toward anything else.The book is a series of letters from a senior devil to a junior devil on how to thwart or subvert a Christian's spiritual growth. This book shows that goal of the enemy is not necessarily overt sin, but anything that diverts focus away from God and his will, which is primarily demonstrating love to other people. By learning how the enemy tries to weaken your Christian walk, you will be better equiped to walk with God.I have read this book 4 times in the last 10 years, and will do so many more times. The lessons here are unique and penetrating, and worth reviewing regularly!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is a powerful little book which you can read in an evening, full of wit and wisdom regarding the cosmic warfare over the human soul. Screwtape fills his letters to young Wormwood with diabolically clever advice on how to thoroughly entangle his patient in the snares which will keep him from the Enemy, namely Jesus Christ. Screwtape advices Wormwood on how to capitalize on such things as domestic relationships, war, friendship, love, and sex, and includes many critical insights on the nature of pleasure, laughter, triviality, love, lust, humility, pride, anxiety, resignation, fear, etc.Reading over Wormwood's shoulder will do two things for you: it will make you laugh (this is an incredibly funny book) and it will make you painfully aware of the demon whispering in your own ear. Few authors understand the psychological labyrinth of the human soul as Lewis does. He has a way of uncovering the subconscious motives and thought-processes of one's soul and forcing them into the bright light of true righteousness and love.I read this book last night (it is a quick read) for the fourth time and walked away freshly challenged, convicted, and encouraged in my spiritual life.

The Screwtape Letters is written such that one feels as if he is reading a secret piece of correspondence. The whole novel is focused around one character, Screwtape. In every chapter, he is writing a letter back to his nephew who is always seeking to squeeze advice from him. Through this one character, Lewis reveals indirectly what he thinks is the devil's way to deceive humans into corruption. In addition, Lewis wrote it in this fashion so that people may notice and create their own strategy to counter the devil and remain faithful to God. For anyone who is deeply interested in religious matters this book is a must read.For anyone below the age of seventeen, this book would definitely be a challenge to understand. Not that the words themselves are difficult, but that Lewis's style can be tough to comprehend. Every page I read I felt my blood beginning to boil as I further understood the organized execution of such incredible evil. I want to reach into the pages and grab Screwtape by his throat. My blood boils when I realize that there is nothing I can do to stop their cruelty. For all I know, Lewis may be right and my own demons may be at this very moment plotting their next move against me. Lewis's genius is amazing to me because of how I respond to these letters.

This view is a polar opposite of ours - what is good to us is evil to him, and vice versa. He even refers to God as The Enemy... his goal is to aid his nephew in the \\"conversion\\" of a Christian male. As the book goes on, so does the man's faith, and as it begins to mature into a fuller form, the devils try to sabotage it at every turn. The book takes a unique look at how Christians try to live their lives. It peers inside the heart of the man, and details the great conflicts that go on in his, and all of our, hearts. It does this in a clever manner that will make you laugh, and even more importantly, think.

The book has helpful in that it made the existence and danger of demons very real. It caused me to think, \\"How do demons try and ruin me?\\" One of the most important tools of the demons is religion. Satan and his workers tried to use religion to draw people away from God and God's Word. This book was a fun read, but also a difficult read in some areas.

There's not too much I can say about this book that others haven't, but I would recommend it to anyone (Christian or otherwise) who wants a great read. The &quot;chapters&quot; (letters between Screwtape and Wormwood) are brief and easy to understand, but have a depth that most novels can only hope for.

Every time I do I gain deeper insight into the wiles of the evil we face in the world and especially the tricks encountered by believers in God.Lewis, who taught literature at Oxford and who wrote The Chronicles of Narnia, has a very active imagination (and this is not a negative thing) and tells the story from the point of view of letters written from one of the servants of the devil (referred to as Father) who is tutoring a young devil in how to keep a new believer from staying in The Way. The devil is subtle in many ways and really gives deep insight into the little tricks that men play.God is referred to as the Enemy and the devil, by explaining from the negative point of view, reveals how God operates and how a believe gains staying power. The bottom line is truly mysterious: grace. Lewis' writing packs a punch. There are no wasted words and each reading reveals more and more insight into the workings of evil in the world.It traces the journey of one individual and the assortment of characters who surround him and touches on aspects of culture, of family, of the church world and even of falling in love. It is written in such a style as to convict the reader without accusing as it is written not so much in generalities but in general truths that we can read ourselves into.For those who doubt the reality of evil in the world, this really opens one's eyes to its many manifestations, whether one believes in a personal (i.e. 'real') devil or the devil as abstraction or personifaction of evil. Either way, it is an eye opener."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Lewis handles an age old subject in a new light that only he could manage.

My letters were directed to my nephew Wormwood a junior devil on a tempting assignment working on a new Christian. He ultimately failed yet it wasn't a total loss as Wormwood became a nice gastronomically satisfying quiche which I immensely enjoyed eating. I narrowly escaped becoming a souffle myself by telling numerous lies to my superior blaming a whole host of junior tempters. I don't know if he really believed me but I do know he relished snacking on those junior mints as I spun my yarn to him. Still Wormwood could have had his man because men are fools and when they realize this is when they begin to approach the Enemy's camp in earnest. Our job is to make them believe they are truly fine fellows in fact maybe a little better than their neighbor a little superior than the rest and then the slide towards our fathers camp is all but assured. What the Enemy calls pride we call shrimp on the barbie. I tried to give Wormwood useful counsel on this in my letters:\\"Your patient has become humble; have you drawn his attention to the fact? All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware that he has them, but this is specially true of humility. Catch him at the moment when he is really poor in spirit and smuggle into his mind the gratifying reflection, \\"By jove! I'm being humble\\", and almost immediately pride--pride at his own humility--will appear. If he awakes to the danger and tries to smother this new form of pride, make him proud of his attempt--and so on, through as many stages as you please. But don't try this too long, for fear you awake his sense of humour and proportion, in which case he will merely laugh at you and go to bed. ... You must therefore conceal from the patient the true end of Humility. Let him think of it not as self-forgetfulness but as a certain kind of opinion (namely, a low opinion) of his own talents and character.\\"It is with gems such as these that I filled my letters to Wormwood yet the bumbler still lost the prize for my fathers kingdom and his patient made it safely into the Enemy camp. Legions of Devils, Thorns, and Shadies are plying our trade today and we are positively on the march winning victories for the kingdom below as people turn to self and turn away from the face of the Enemy.Ravenously yoursScrewtape"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"d recommend this be one of the first books you read as you start your spiritual journey.

Before I clicked on the link to \\"1 STAR\\" reviews on The Screwtape Letters, I already knew who these reviewers were and the jest of what they had written: They are Non-Christians; they know nothing about C.S. Lewis; and they erroneously associate the Christian's relationship with the Creator with \\"religion\\". I knew that at least one of them would attack Christianity with cynicism and/or venom. I was right.The Screwtape Letters was written by a thinking, truth-seeker who is/was one of the foremost atheist-turned-Christian, philosopher of all time. His intended audience was also thinking, truth-seekers (of whom are increasingly fewer and further between).Lewis goes where few people dare to tread - and even fewer dare to dwell for any length of time: At the mirror of man's TRUE self.

In it, a senior devil gives continued advice to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on how best to tempt his victim and keep him from salvation.Lewis does not propose any concrete doctrine on devils here, and this is not his point. Rather he focuses on highlighting the ways, both large and small, that Christians are distracted from God. Lewis explores the dangers of not being purposeful toward God and life, as well as what happens to people when they give in to temptation.The book is presented as a collection of letters, all from Screwtape to Wormwood. But Lewis does a good job of making the conversation not feel one-sided, and he does a fantastic job with the devils' personalities. In fact the book is rather deeper than this, as there are two other plots going on. First is the fate of Wormwood's man. Second is the relationship between the devils, and the fate of Wormwood.The Screwtape Letters is deeper than it appears, and is thoroughly thought-provoking.

In the letters Screwtape guides Wormwood on the finer nuances of ever so slowly leading a patient down the wrong path.

No one of true faith could wear such a hat!* Next, notice the shoes on the man seated next to him. They aren't the type of shoes he would wear.* Encourage him to look for the perfect church. This congregation doesn't sing right, this sermon is too long, I don't fit in here...never let him look at the bigger picture of unifying with one goal in mind.* When his mind begins to think of anything important, when he begins to see a glimpse that there is more to life than the physical, distract him with lunch time, the bus schedule, make him focus on \\"the real world\\".This is an inspiring read.

What makes this book so amazing (and quite honestly frightening!) is that as you read you begin to mentally check off each trick that you've encountered in your OWN life!

At the same time, it is carried forward by an inherent sense of hope and optimism -- Mr. Lewis doesn't fall into Milton's trap of admiring Screwtape. It also serves as a great spiritual pep-talk: you are given the secrets, if you will, of how the Enemy works...and strategies to foil him are freely confessed.Some letters are more entertaining than others, but each finds its mark (and each found at least one mark within me, to be sure).A friend of mine (a professed agnostic) once described this book as the most compelling case for Christianity he ever came across. I would have to agree.This book does contain the essay \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" but it lacks the wonderful introduction (by Mr. Lewis himself) that I found in another paperback (which I have since lost).

Never condemning, but always aware of human frailties, he guides one to look within oneself for the light that illuminates each of us. I do not find this book \\"preachy\\" in any way.

And the suggestions that Screwtape makes are not only wickedly ingenious, but it makes you shudder when you think about how this pans out in the real world.But for me, the real highlights of the book are when Wormwood screws up and Screwtape, almost beside himself, takes him to task in moments of great humor.

However, for me, C.S. Lewis' writing is a little hard to comprehend. It's written in proper 1940's English from England and I'm living in 2006 America - go figure. I thought the CD audio version was read by John Cleese, but I think that must have referred to the taped version, which is out of print. The reader is a good dramatist, just not who I expected. The book itself is illuminating to a Christian who thinks they're living a pretty good Christian life. It shines the light on little things we do and say that are not Christ-like, such as sarcasm, envy and thinking of ourselves first. It challenged me to consider all my actions and words and I think listening to the CD is a great way to digest this book. I don't know if one becomes confused while reading \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" but even in the audio version I sometimes had to remind myself that when Screwtape refers to the \\"enemy\\", for him that is Christ. Since we're used to referring to Satan as the enemy, it takes a bit of concentration to remember who we're talking about here. Overall, a great book that really gets to the heart of daily Christian living by revealing how Satan views our little slip-ups. He relishes them and we must mind what we do and say and each day strive to live and love as Christ."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I couldn't be more impressed with Joss Ackland's audio peformance of this book. For my money, it's the best ever audio Screwtape, and a masterpiece. Even better than the John Cleese performance, which is saying something.Ackland has a deep, resonant voice. The delivery is dryer than Cleese's, but at the same time heavier and more diabolical. And it's more pleasurable in general, the kind of voice that can be heard for hours without grating, a rarity in the audiobook world. For some, there may be too much benevolence (think of the warmth in Donald Sutherland's voice) in this Screwtape, but I think two things save that from being a real fault:1. It makes a more diabolical lie of Screwtape's \\"affection\\" for Wormwood by having him sound sometimes like a genuinley loving uncle, and 2. it is a large part of the visceral pleasure of listening to the book. In other words, it might be more realistic to hear Screwtape sound more obnoxious, but then we'd have to listen to someone being obnoxious for 4 hours!(You can get it on Amazon's audiobook branch, audible.com, and at the time of this review it costs less than $10 for the download.

In modern Christian writings there is very little about the value of time, worldly vanities, and choice of friends. Nihilism, nothing, is very strong. It can steal away a man's best years. The future is the least like eternity. Men are angered by misfortune conceived as injury.C.S.

To think that one could come up with something as genius as this, it blows one's mind! We find letters from the enemy, preferably Screwtape advising Wormwood, and we find caution in how to arm ourselves against the forces of Hell.While a wonderful addition to my library, I found it interesting that Lewis showed Screwtape as a discourager, rather than an encourager, which is not unlike the devil. He gave advice, yet always found a way to put Wormwood down, rather than lift him up.He hit the nail on the head once again. A well full of wisdom! Good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"In a brief book comprising 31 hypothetical letters from a wise-old demon, Screwtape, to his nephew Wormwood, C.S. Lewis gathers a wide host of temptations common to our own lives, and portrays them as bits of advice from Screwtape to his nephew. Screwtape is advising his nephew in how best to catch his prey, by various cunning means. The young man of whom Wormwood is given charge to tempt, could easily be any one of us, and the ways that Wormwood was advised to use in numbing the man to sin are certainly recognizable to our own existence. Two of the particularly notable things I pulled from this book were the way Screwtape suggested encouraging Flippancy and the false impression of Unselfishness in the young victim. The former is taking serious matters too lightly by making jokes of them, which dulls our senses to their import; and the latter is the dishonesty we enter into when we disguise our irritations to &quot;seem&quot; agreeable and unselfish, all the while harboring personal resentments. I wouldn't call this book a masterpiece, but it is well worth reading, and certainly awakens us to the need of living prayerful and watchful lives, asking for Christ's protection in our weakness and temptation, that we might remain faithful. Also, the addition of &quot;Screwtape Proposes A Toast&quot; at the end of my edition, was not nearly as interesting as the rest of the book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"You see, Screwtape's nephew's incompetance is rather good for us - the tempted. Lewis was such a great writer. He wrote so clearly - often it's as if there are no words coming between the writer's ideas and ms - the ideas flow with no interpretative medium at all. What a great idea to look at temptation from the other side - and then to reveal so many brilliant insights. Perhaps it should have been longer!!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I must say that I have mixed reactions to the Screwtape Letters of C.S. Lewis. These reactions are not unfounded and are even acknowledged by the author himself. The work presents itself as a set of imaginary correspondence between a major devil, Screwtape, and his nephew, Wormwood. The overall function of the dialogue in the text is to portray a view of morality from the eyes of Hell. The overall effect is one that is both witty and enlightening. Nonetheless, I share the reservations of Lewis himself and those reportedly held by J.R.R. Tolkien (to whom the text was dedicated) that claimed that Lewis had gone too far into the Enemy's camp. Lewis admitted that it was a difficult task to write these letters, given the spiritual dryness of the correspondents.Nonetheless, the overall work does a good job at expressing a variety of theological topics. It pursues the ongoing conversion of an individual living during the Second World War. Each chapter presents a different sin that is exploited by the minions of Hell. The action of each chapter indirectly teaches a lesson on the nature of the sin at hand as well as by delving into the nature of Hell. While I disagree on some of the notions of sin held by Lewis, he is mostly on track with standard orthodoxy. There is nothing dangerous in the text, although I feel that his view on the nature of devils' desires is a bit misdirected. The additionally included letter, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" is a most excellent wake-up call to the educators of the world, exposing the dangers inherent in many modern theories of education.I suggest the text with the caveat of prudence. The powers of Hell are temping in a great number of ways. It is quite possible that Lewis went too far into the camp of the Enemy in order to write this text. I know that this view may seem wimpy or fundamentalistic. It is based on the same motivating conviction which Tolkien had against such action, a motivation which influenced his own works in Middle Earth. While I must admit that his theology is mostly top-notch and that his writing is humorous, I also send you forth with a partial recommendation, given the afore-mentioned caveat."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S. Lewis is a very talented person and writes on an extremely intellectual level. This level of ability was ever so evident in his fictional novel called The Screwtape Letters. Written in the form of letters, the basis of this book focuses on a tale of the pursuit of Satan trying to win over the soul of a newly reborn Christian. The letters are written by a servant of Satan named Screwtape and are addressed to Screwtape's nephew, Wormwood, a tempter of the devil. Thirty-one letters exist in total and every letter is filled with increasingly desperate advice regarding how Wormwood should attempt to corrupt this newly reborn Christian. Screwtape's philosophy focuses mainly on the dirty basis of deception. This novel truly shows that deception lies at the root of all evil and is one of Satan's primary weapons. In the end Satan looses and the Christian goes to heaven. It is wonderfully refreshing!The biblical ties and accuracy within this book greatly add an effective level of credibility. This book was obviously written to speak up and point out to Christians the devious ways in which Satan works, but also to remind them that God does prevail. This was a very good book and within it lie many important messages about life and Christ."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I was introduced to the Screwtape Letters when I was a child. I always liked reading C. S. Lewis books. I devoured the Chronicles of Narnia in less than a month. After that I started looking for any books I could find by Lewis. That's how I found the Screwtape Letters.This book contains what are supposed to be &quot;demonic communications.&quot; A series of letters written by a greater demon, Screwtape, to his underling, Wormwood. Lewis doesn't tell us how he came into possession of these letters.Apparently, Wormwood is assigned to torment a human; which they call a &quot;patient.&quot; Screwtape gives him pointers on how to turn this human away from the cause of Christ. It's a very weighty book for a ten-year-old to read, but I have come back to the book again as an adult.The screwtape letters is a good read, I am enjoying reading it a second time. It reminds us that there really are fallen angels out there who don't want us to work for the cause of Christ."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Screwtape Letters is an extremely humorous and clever exposition of the traditional theology of temptation. The concept of a correspondance between devils is not entirely new; Mark Twain wrote a satire just as clever (though from an opposite perspective) in his &quot;Letters from the Earth.&quot; But Lewis brings a certain malevolent charm to his demonic bureaucracy, a darkness of soul that contrasts with his insistence of the importance of everyday actions in making one's way to heavenly bliss.As always with Lewis, I think, this book is really about himself as much as anything. Like Augustine, he is amazed to find both a devil and an angel within himself. Lewis admitted that writing the book placed a great cramp in his spiritual life. Then there is that strange statement in the introduction in which Lewis reveals that he developed a sort of occult technique that assisted him in writing the book. Lewis testily states that people who want to obtain this writing technique from him for nefarious purposes will be unsuccessful. One might ask who those &quot;evil people&quot; who want to &quot;use&quot; a writing technique (!) might be. I have often thought that getting in touch with his own dark side created such anxiety for Lewis that in this statement he is simply projecting dark desires onto others. (The other alternative is that Lewis really believed he was channeling demonic energies when he wrote the book. Such an act of admitted consorting with the enemy would be surprising in a Christian writer, however.)Lewis was fascinated his whole life with the figure of the magician, the manipulator of others, the evil, resentful monster that he insisted lives within each of us. More than most of us, he seems to have been aware of both the dark and light sides of himself. This is one of the best books he wrote in which to explore the personal obsessions of a deeply passionate soul."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I am going to go out on a limb and say that listening to John Cleese read Screwtape Letters is more enjoyable than reading it yourself. His continual insertion of pauses, snorts, intonations, etc. made Screwtape come completely alive as exactly the devil that was described in C.S. Lewis' wonderful book. Normally, I view audio books as a last ditch effort to keep myself awake when driving. This audio book is worth playing in your living room."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet. The Screwtape Letters is one of the most chilling books I've ever read. Anyone who enjoys reading great thought provoking literature needs to add this book to their collection. Bravo C.S. Lewis"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Witty, brief (no chapter more than four pages, the book easily read in an afternoon), timeless Truth presented with refreshing satire aimed where it should, C.S. Lewis' legendary \\"Screwtape Letters\\" is at once soul and brain food.Lewis tells his story through the title character, an experienced devil instructing his apprentice nephew to lure a young man to condemnation. The apprentice, Wormwood, tempts with everything from family (distancing prayers for the man's mother from behavior toward her) to social circle (flippant friends stray him from his new life, a new girlfriend moves him closer to it) to work and even worship.Lewis then flips God's love and law into effective, ironic Satanic reverses. He shows temptation most effective and deadly in its smallest doses: prayer posture, creation and consideration of an Historical Point of View (including an historical Jesus as opposed to One of faith). Lewis redefines gluttony, defends Puritanism, shows the misunderstanding of romantic feelings in love and sex, and misperception of the large ever-broken promise, \\"The Future.\\" (This book must be read if only to debunk one of Henry Ford's most famous quotes and the cliched, selfish phrase \\"impose on my time.\\")Lewis shows (and Screwtape plants) the landmines of an early Christian walk: the role of a Church, of humor and the temptation inherent in its roots, Christian truth made trivial and a commodity beside social causes. He even dissects everyday, mundane pleasures (books, walks, music, wine, dated references to cigarettes) for their own sake and not as means to follow an ever more mediocre crowd.Lewis' final Screwtape letter is his most moving. Sarcasm joins sanctification as we learn target's and tempter's final fate. It ties to themes present throughout Lewis' letters and providing fodder for his conjoined, equally humorous essay, Screwtape Proposes A Toast: \\"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one...without milestones, without signposts...\\" This absolutely essential book is just such signpost; \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is joyful, instructional, fun reading for anyone wishing to know what forces fight for the human soul."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I remember one of the opening lines to Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot;: This is how the world ends, not with an explosion, but a whisper. C.S. Lewis was exploring a similar theme a generation before that.The simple plot: Screwtape, a demon, writes letters to his nephew, who is in charge of getting a man to fall from morality and trust in God. But the plot goes much, much deeper...A real lesson you should take from the book is that damnation doesn't come all at once. Screwtape even says to his nephew that the best road to hell is a gradual, gently sloping one.The book really opened my eyes on how I live my life. Even the smallest things I do in this world have consequence in the next. The book may not cause earth-shaking changes in your life, but reading this book definitely will make you think. And any book that does that is worth 1,000 times the cover price.An interesting addition to this (and several other) version is a story Lewis wrote for the New Yorker more than a decade after &quot;Screwtape&quot; was first published. It serves as a wonderful epilouge to the tale, and I can only imagine the thrill of people who devoured the book when it first came out and then had to wait literally YEARS before they could get another small taste."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I checked out the audio cassette version from my public library. Wow! That's the simplest way to put it. I can't think of anyone who could have read this better. John Cleese has the perfect voice to play the cynical, yet comical, devil Screwtape. He puts himself full throttle into this roll and it's a joy to listen to."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Enjoyable recording and a reasonable value. The novel presentation of spiritual warfare through this perspective allows one to reflect on life's choices and their potential consequences. It reminds me of the concept that lies do not come in colors and all sins lead in the same direction."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"My book club chose this book and while we all found it insightful we also found it difficult to read in a typical novel fashion. Whether you're religious or not C.S. Lewis has an interesting grasp of human behavior and expresses his thoughts in a series of letters from a demon (Screwtape) to his student. (Screwtape's goal is to help the student control his human and turn him away from God.) Lewis packs a lot into each letter and because there is no traditional plot, reading more than one or two letters at a time can be mind numbing. My book club agreed that a better way to read this book would have been to read it during the course of a year; absorbing one or two letters at a time and disussing them along with our book of the month. Worth reading and discussing...slowly."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Lewis is, as any Narnia fan knows, an imaginative writer. That imagination is on display in The Screwtape Letters. The basic premise of the book is that this is a correspondence between a demon, who is a sort of \\"supervisor\\" in Hell's kingdom, and his idiot nephew Screwtape. Thus, the theological and factual perspective is backward from the intention... what Christians think of as \\"good and desirable\\" is hated by the demons, and what Christians think of as \\"abhorent\\" is lauded. So, it's a bit of a challenging read as one has to \\"translate\\" the storyline \\"right-side-up\\". In addition, as Lewis is British and the book reflects WWII realities, the present-day references in the book are a bit odd for today's American. But within the text is the anatomy of temptation, a picture of the realistic struggles of a new Christian, and a wide ranging commentary on the perspective of the World vs. the Believer. Not for novices, but still a stimulating and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I don't often read Christian literature, but after completing the Screwtape Letters, I may have to change that. I was entertained through the book, while also learning more about morality and life in general. The story is told through the correspondence of a veteran tempter of Hell to that of a young devil at the start of his career. For anyone who has worked in a bureaucracy before, they will have a good chuckle at Lewis' depiction of Hades as a bureaucratic organization.Beneath the surface humor of the Screwtape Letters lie the steps for a good Christian life. Since the reader presumably wants to avoid Wormwood and his kin, he learns by opposites in this book. Callousness and disabused cynicism are portrayed as friendly tools of the devil - it is not hard to guess why Lewis thought that. When people think there is no life but this one, they react in different ways. Some become Nietzsche's \`Last men' - boorish and vapid. Others become serial killers that, no longer afraid of eternal damnation, think they can beat the rap. Few people rape and murder with thoughts of their capture, after all. And then there are the Columbines of the world. When you think the world is only what you can touch and see, it tends to have a somewhat flattening effect. Believe me - I've learned that personally. Lewis' greatest accomplishment is that he reminds us of that numbness.All in all, the Screwtape Letters are pleasant mix of philosophy and literature - a rare achievement. I would highly recommend the appendix (and I don't normally read appendixes). Screwtape's toast reflects a problem of the modern world that has been commented on from Tocqueville to Nietzsche to Vonnegut. That problem can be summed up briefly: \\"You're no better than me.\\" The very words drip with indignity, no? Ironically, that attitude is useful in the destruction of democracy. If all are good as the other then all are also equally bad. Democracy becomes mob rule, and as Tocqueville said, 'There is nothing so miserable as democracy without liberty'. In 2006, the immediate threat to liberty isn't the Patriot Act, but being chained to the lowest common denominator."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I have read this book several times over the years and each time I've been really blessed. It really opened my eyes to the constant Spiritual warfare going on in the world. As a Christian, it really gave me an insight into ways that the enemy attempts to discourage or confuse Christians and pull them away from the Lord."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"No matter how many times I read this book I get a fresh insight into human spirituality. It's one of those slim little books that one can read in a flash, over and over. However, after the first reading I found that all subsequent readings had me dwelling over single paragraphs or even sentences, thinking of my own life as a &quot;patient&quot;! A must read for people of all creeds and none. A work of outstanding insight into the human spirit."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I first read The Screwtape Letters at the age of 15, and two years later I've read the book countless times and continue to find deeper meaning in each reading. Lewis expertly reveals the devices used to tempt the unsuspecting human; and I'm sure I'm not the only one who realizes several more of their own blunders every time they pick up the book. The traps of temptation are laid bare as Lewis ruthlessly exposes the suble art of manipulation.This book is highly philosophical, so don't pick it up when you're looking for some escape fiction. While some complain that the book lacks \\"excitment,\\" I hold that you cannot blame a philosophical book for being just that: philosophical. All the excitement needed is in the intellectual stimulation and in the wealth of knowledge provided by this book. The seriousness of this subject is artfully highlighted with Lewis's characteristic wit and humor. This is a refreshing touch to the deep and somewhat disturbing questions Lewis dares to answer. If nothing else, The Screwtape Letters will force you to truthfully examine yourself. I highly reccomend this book anyone seeking Christian literature or philosophy. It is well worth the time you take to read it."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This was a wonderful book by C.S. Lewis giving an insight to what it must be like to work for the prince of darkness.In this masterpiece you are reading letters from a devil named Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood who is rather young and inexperienced at the whole game of tempting and leading ones sould to hell. Screwtape tries to teach Wormwood some of the most effective ways to tempt a person but it also seems that he is leading the young villan astray.These are letters of hypocricy and deciet and quite frankly letters that will make you step back and evaluate your own life. I would highly recommend this to anyone whether you are looking for a mere story to read or if you are looking for deep insight as to ways you can better yourself."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"One of the best, and most influential, Christian authors of any time, C. S. Lewis's &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is a compelling, and chilling, fictional look at what goes on behind our back in the demonic spirit world.Screwtape, an upper level demonic spirit, often writes his subordinate, Wormwood, a demonic spirit assigned to misguide and misdirect a human on earth. The letters explain to Wormwood how he would best accomplish his mission of keeping the human our of the Enemy's (God's) hands and ensure that when he dies he goes straight to blazes.What is most chilling about &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is that, even after all of these years, how much a person can see of themselves in them. Letter after letter seemed to be talking about me directly. Time and time again I saw one demonic trap after another I had fallen into being explained in a letter.I have to caution you, however. This book is not an easy read. C. S. Lewis did not attempt to write a book that everybody could understand. You will probably have to spend some time re-reading many letters and looking up words in your dictionary and/or concordance for a better understanding of what is being said. This can become quite frustrating, but when you are able to break through and understand a letter you will be able to see how it can apply to your own life.If you were ever interested in getting a better understanding of how the Enemy and his demonic spirits work, this is a great book to do it with. But be warned: you will learn something about yourself in the process."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is the BEST place to start reading Lewis. If you enjoy the philosophy, you can move to Mere Christianity or A Grief Observed. If you enjoy the presentation you may try The Great Divorce, Space Trilogy (Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandrea, That Hideous Strength) or Narnia.The book is short, innovative. When read together it forms a short story but each letter can be read on its own. I like to pick it up from time to time and read a random letter or two.I read each letter twice when I first read it. First so I could understand the letter and a second time to meditate on what was said. It is not terribly hard to understand--there is just so much to think about in each letter..."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I have read The Screwtape Letters probably a dozen times. I was very excited to find John Cleese doing an audio tape of the book - having listened to too many Monty Python records (I said records! not CDs!!) The combination is exciting and excellent.Mr. Cleese really gets into the character of Screwtape, a senior devil, as he attempts to educate and train his &quot;nephew&quot;, a junior devil. His nuances and inflections lend a force to the writings. At times angry, surprised, and at others comtemplative, he brings a very good book further to life. Having read the book a number of times, he does my favorite passages very well."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I admit to having bought this cassette originally only on the strength of John Cleese's reading these letters fron a Senior Devil to his less-than-successful nephew, but once I started listening I didn't want to stop! C.S. Lewis (the celebrated author of the NARNIA series) wrote a searing and scathing work, but it's taken John Cleese's inimitable vocal genuis to bring these letters to life! His marvelous vocal nuances keep a grin on the listener's face throughout the whole six cassette sides (the Unabridged edition also includes the excellently done \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\" on Side 6), and the two letters in which Screwtape actually loses both his temper with his nephew and his self-control (Letter #22) and the final letter (Letter #31) in which Screwtape's own hidden despair at the thought of not only losing the patient to the Enemy but also the thought of a world where he (Screwtape) longs for deep inside but can never be a part of (even though he'd never admit it, especially not to his failure of a nephew!) can be heard are works of genuis on the part of Mr. Cleese! It doesn't matter what religion you are; these cassettes will make any denomination laugh the Devil to scorn!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Am laughing so hard now, I wasn't planning to write a review on this book, just wanted to see if others enjoyed it as much as I did, and HA! the reactions to the newer reviews just validate the truth behind the premise of the book, Christians truly are the object of attack by a real Satan and his minions: specifically, the reviews below are right-on in explaining the book, yet I noticed they were accompanied by \\"0 of 1 found the following review helpful,\\" which indicates to me the activity not just of a nonChristian, but what I call an 'antiChristian,' one who unable to steal a Christian's secure salvation, actively tries to stop his impact, to take-out or defeat the Christian from victory in the Christian life, from influencing others for God--as if clicking \\"unhelpful\\" will discourage a Christian, when it only encourages them that they're not AWOL from the spiritual battle, that truly the praise of men matters less than sharing the good news of Christ. This stumbling stone of discouragement is just one of the tactics exposed in 'Screwtape Letters' thru the format of a one-on-one demonic discipleship correspondence. Reading 'Screwtape' is a fun way for the Christian to stay alert, if not warned for the first time, to the various schemes the devil will use to oppose his effectiveness."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"With a smart \\"reverse psychology\\" slant, C.S. Lewis crafted a true classic in this one. The book, comprised of individual essays in the forms of letters from a demon to his \\"trainee,\\" shows you very powerfully how Satan is at work among us. Though it was written decades ago, its parallels with modern daily life are indispensable."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Man, this book was the BOMB! Those demons were so cool and funny it made me want to visit HELL to see them myself."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"...It is very well-written, and the premise is interesting. However, I found it so boring I could hardly pay attention. C.S. Lewis does make some good points, but he really beats them to death. The reason I'm rating the book two stars instead of one is that it really is very well-written, in spite of being extremely boring."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The book The Screwtape Letters is written for a more mature reader, one that is interested in philosophical thinking. The book is more a theological book, than an exciting book. I would not suggest this book for a high school student. Not that it is too complicated for a teenager to read, because the story is easy to understand and follow. The book was dull, the author could not keep my attention or interest, because there was little action or excitement. Although I found it dull the book is well written, the writing style is very creative. The story makes the reader think about their one life. The \\"patient\\" represents the every day man, therefore the situations in the book parallel people's own life experiences."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"In my perspective of reading The Screwtape Letters, I found the book being very repetitive to the point where it took the excitement away from the book. Don't get me wrong the book dealt with many social issues that we as individuals undergo each and everyday of our lives. Just because I wasn't overly excited with The Screwtape Letters shouldn't hender one from reading this book. On the other hand, reading The Screwtape Letters could encourage or help someone through their troubling times."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Written by C.S.Lewis, read by John Cleese? This is going to be great! There were a few chuckles I'll admit, but I kept waiting for some revelation, some new understanding, a new light on the matter. Alas, it was not to be. I found this book mostly boring and old hat, very old hat. I feel I wasted my time."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Try as I may, I find C.S.Lewis nearly impossible to read. Maybe that is because I have little interest in living a good Christian life -- as portrayed by a British professor of literature, writing at the time of the second world war.His basis premise seems to be that God and the Devil have some \\"interest\\" in the way human beings are living their lives. Both are trying to influence that. I just can't for the life of me understand why a God would want to do that. I mean if God is all powerful why couldn't he just create the perfect man and be done with it, why would he have to go around trying to find ways to improve on his design? And what benefit does the devil get by getting the human to do evil and collecting the odd soul? The whole subject is patently ridiculous. And to try to cast an argument, which is dubious at best, using the technique of diabolic ventriloquism or photographic negative is mind boggling. At the end what are we supposed to get out of this -- pure knowledge? an understanding of Lewis' philosophy? or just a chuckle? If it is the chuckle, then I would divide the causes of such a chuckle into Joy, Fun, the Joke Proper, and Flippancy. And I would relegate Lewis to the flippant. \\"It is a thousand miles away from joy; it deadens, instead of sharpening, the intellect; and it excites no affection between those who practice it.\\" (Page 51 Screwtape.)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This book was the selection for my reader's group this month and I must say, no offense to the member who picked it, that I couldn't get pass the third chapter. It's just a little too heavy for a summer read. It is problably best left for a person who is in the mood to delve into the corruption of human nature. Maybe I'll get back to it when the weather is dreary and I am already depressed."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I read this book when I was about ten and really liked it. Now, over thirty years later, I have reread it. I was surprised to see that the logic was so sophomoric. I think this would be a good book for a child, but for someone with a college education the arguments are too strained to provide enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is an incredibly dull book. I was forced to read it for a religion class and I can't believe there aren't more bad reviews of it. It is very tedious and the wording is old, making it all the more hard to read. I am not a hugely religious person and I would never recommend this book to a friend, possibly an enemy, but never a friend. If you're having sleeping problems, this book would be a great remedy."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Another step in the Christian brain-washing process. If you enjoy seeing intellectual inquiry portrayed as sin, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Even though this book was written many years ago, it fits the way the world is, even to date.

Lewis is a wonderful writer and story teller."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Throughout this book, The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis has a vivid imagination. He depicts great images with writing from the perspective of a senior demon known as Screwtape to his nephew, Wormwood. Across the book Wormwood is being mentored by his uncle to secure the damnation of a man who lives in Britain known as \\"the patient\\".This book provides great examples on how the Christian life is distracted and taken away from God's glory to our own. The patient goes through the constant battle of choosing wether to do what he knows is right, from what he knows God wants from him versus the distractions that are constantly placed in front of him by Wormwood. Lewis is a phenomenal author that with such a simple story can derive so many different thoughts and realizations."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Good literature, story I've heard before, but wanted my own copy.

Unfortunately that version was not available when I ordered my copy. This narrator is good, but not as funny as John Cleese. That is why I give this recording a 4-star rating.The Screwtape Letters are marvelous. For those who do not know, they are a series of letters between a mid-level bureaucrat devil, Screwtape, and a junior \\"tempter\\". (Yes, even in Hell, they have bureaucracy.) The tempter's job is to get his \\"patient\\" into Hell. Screwtape reviews his progress and provides pointers on how this might be better accomplished. It is quite funny because the diabolical mindset is completely opposite of ours. Still, it is intended to provoke thought and to guide you in avoiding the traps of the tempter assigned to your life.Screwtape Proposes A Toast describes our educational system and \\"democracy\\" to a T. It is worth the price of the recording just to hear that.I strongly recommend buying a copy of the Screwtape Letters -- though if possible, the John Cleese version."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Screwtape is definitely a Christian classic (and I would add a literature classic as well). As most know, the title character is a is a senior demon whose letters to his nephew, Wormwood, provide instructions in leading a person astray.

This is one of those books you can read again and again over a lifetime and pull something new from it each time it is read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Screwtape Letters by C.S.Lewis offers an alternate viewpoint of demons working in the life of an average Christian. The narrator is a demon writing to his nephew a lesser demon. He is coaching him on how to turn his \\"patient\\" away from God-\\"the Enemy\\" in the most effective way. It is an excellent description of the way Satan puts things into your mind or keeps things out to draw you away from God. The uncle says:\\"It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out.\\" The book is sectioned into different subjects that the demons attack. From as simple to the friends you make, to your relationship with your mother-in-law, your prayer life(or nonexistent one), to the Church. In regards to the Church the uncle says:\\" One of our greatest allies at present is the Church itself. Do not misunderstand me. I do not mean the Church as we see her spread out through all time and space rooted in eternity, terrible as an army with banners. That, I confess, is a spectacle which makes our boldest tempters uneasy. But fortunately it is quite invisible to these humans.\\"It helps you to realize that the demons try to draw you away from God in small steps over time so it doesn't seem like a big deal to you. This book reminds you to be more on guard for those seemingly little things. \\"We know that we have introduced a change of direction in his course which is already carrying him out of orbit around the Enemy (God); but he must be made to imagine that all the choices which have effected this change of course are trivial and revocable. He must not be allowed to suspect that he is now, however slowly, heading right away from the sun on a line which will carry him into the cold and dark of utmost space.\\"You will probably have to embrace your imagination and freedom of thought while reading this.

The Screwtape Letters is my personal favorite of Lewis's books, even more so than the Chronicles of Narnia.I must confess though, that I find reading The Screwtape Letters a slightly frightening experience.

The book is funny, instructive and impactful. The book is a series of letters from a senior demon to a newly assigned demon. The letters give instruction and evaluation to the junior demon on how to \\"poison\\" his assigned human or patient.Although how demons work in the spirit world has never been revealed to us, the scene that Lewis paints seems most realistic. Lewis depicts a world where the demon constantly monitors the activities of its patient and uses every opportunity to whisper lies, spin half truths and distort reality. It gave me pause when I considered the possibility that the world really is this way.By presenting the schemes of the demons, Lewis is really teaching us how to live in the way of God. I found myself taking some of these lessons to heart.God bless the soul of C. S. Lewis. I strongly recommend this book for any follower of Jesus."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"That's the initial impression of this book which is on my list of all time favorites. A series of letters between Screwtape, an undersecratary, and his nephew Wormwood, an apprenctice tempter in charge of securing the damnation of a young man. The \\"story\\" takes place during the second world war with the young man being a young englishman.The book is so well written because we're given insites to his own life, his own realistic experience, which make what Screwtape is advising that much more haunting. Everything from the man's relationship with his mother and his work to his relationship with his girl are given time.Screwtape regularly rakes his nephew over the coals for asking stupid questions he should know the answers to or just for being to naive.In the intro to the book Lewis says that nothing Screwtape says can be taken to seriously. That is most clearly seen when Screwtape talks about how when God wouldn't reveal the reason why he was making the \\"human vermin,\\" \\"Our Father Below\\" ceased his support of \\"The Enemy\\" and removed himself a great distance from him resulting in that ridiculous story that he was \\"forced\\" out of Heaven. A lot of what Screwtape talks about is how to corrupt what God has already created. Things like prayer and even going to church are attacked.My two favorite lines:\\"The truth is that whenever a man lies with a woman, there, whether they like it or not, a transcendental relation is set up between them that must be eternally enjoyed or eternally endured.\\"\\"He made the pleasures: of of our research so far has not enabled us to produce one. All we can do is to encourage the humans to take the pleasures which our enemy has produced, at times, or in ways, or in degrees, which He has forbidden.\\"After the Letters are over, there is also a prolonged speech in which Screwtape dispenses advice on how politics can be used.

Given the fact that Screwtape refers to God as the \\"Enemy\\" one gets the impression that for Lewis, writing \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" was akin to \\"going undercover\\" or \\"spying behind enemy lines.\\" The result is an impeccable piece of reverse theology which ultimately ends in an uplifting manner.

As Christians, we always look at upside of things. We focus on the attributes of God and the way he works in our lives. This book looks at it from the other side. It gave me a whole new perspective on the ways I am tempted. This novel could be described as &quot;the Christian's guide to outsmarting Satan and his tactics.&quot; I found that it was a very accurate description of the ways Satan comes after believers &quot;seeking whom he may devour.&quot; In reading this novel, one can be prepared for the fiery darts Satan will send his or her way and can be aware of the more subtle deceptions that the devil may use."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"John Cleese's rendition of \\"Screwtape\\" is phenomenal.

Wormwood has been assigned to corrupt an unnamed human. Screwtape coaches Wormwood on how to tempt the man and draw him away from God. Several of the pieces of advice given by Screwtape make poignant observances on how the soul can be corrupted. They will help the reader to examine his or her own spiritual life. At times, Wormwood disappoints Screwtape, and his \\"affectionate\\" uncle will lash out in anger and contempt. These letters take place during the Second World War, and it plays at least a minor role in the work. What can also be seen is Lewis's own thoughts on current cultural trends (of the 1940s) and how they affect one's faith.

This book will give you some hypothetical, all though theologically sound ideas as to how Saten and his dominion run chaos on earth. This book will make you take a look at how you think about how you are influenced by the secular world around us, and our reactions to it. Are we tempted in ways we have never thought about? It is easy to think of being tempted by money, lust, self-pity... but what about being tempted by the mundane, the obvious, the everyday? What about being tempted/preoccupied by the ails of the world at large, yet being soured by the needs of the person that lives next door to you? Does that seem to little or unnecessary? Or perhaps... if everyone chose to help and care for the person next door, then eventually the people a half of a world away would feel that influence? C.S.

My memory of this work was a little different than what I found recently. I was disturbed by the reading this time. I don't know what the change was, my guess is that it was because I now have a family of my own.The fact that Lewis appears to have been so prescient to my future doubts and failings on faith issues is troubling yet hopeful also.Obviously, youth and pride probably led me to ignore much of this book in my first reading. Yet, in retrospect it seems almost uncanny that I didn't feel a little bit of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as I lived my life.Anyway, this is a very good book.

Lewis has created a collection of letters written between two demons about the fate of one individual. One reason this book has remained so popular over there years is there is nothing quite like it. The complexities of Uncle Screwtape's spiritual arguments are compelling. C. S. Lewis said that writing the book was a very difficult process and after reading the book I can understand why.Coming from the perspective of Demons the books goes into implicit detail about what they think about the human race, Satan, the Enemy (God). The letters themselves can be cumbersome to read, but most of the letters are short.

It pushes the envelope on what most people think about Christianity. This book seems to show both sides Christianity. On one hand it shows devilish aspects and on the other hand it shows the power of god. It also shows the role we play in the plans of the world.The book is based on a young demon recruiter named wormwood that is learning how to recruit human on earth for the devil. Throughout the whole book he communicates with his uncle Screwtape that tells him how to predict what he should do to make sure his \\"patient\\" does the right thing to go to hell.I think this book is a book that must be read because it helps you better understand everyday temptations. It explains all problems of life, from fusses with parents to relationships with the opposite sex. That alone makes it a classic hand book to christen and maybe other religions. I truly recommend this book to any person. I say any person because this book works on many levels. Every statement has purpose. The shallow parts lead into the deeper parts of the book, so you can actually understand what you are reading. The picture the author paints for you is so vivid and vibrant that you have reason to say this book is boring or to hard to read. Having that quality in a book make it a universal treasure that should be seen, touched and heard all around the world. Not only by the wicked or just the wise, but I must stress that every person in should read this book.

The aging devil, named Screwtape, dispenses advise and wisdom gained from years as a tempter of humans.From this point of view, the reader gets a truly horrifying and entertaining view of one's own life and pursuits.

Many of you probably have heard about Randy Alcorn's book called, &quot;L-rd Falcron's Letters.&quot; That is nothing more than a complete rip off off Lewis' &quot;The Screwtape Letters!&quot;To Randy's credit, he was honest about his book being &quot;a modern version of Lewis' book.&quot; Unfortunately, that's just one more instance of the &quot;it's old, so it must be updated and become the victim of &quot;Fahrenheit 451!&quot; I'm not attacking Randy. I just have no intention of reading his book, especially since it's utterly useless compared to &quot;The Screwtape Letters.&quot;Lewis' &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is one of those timeless books that stands alone, just like Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Beecher-Stowes' &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; Shakespeares' &quot;Hamlet,&quot; Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward,&quot; and Harper-Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird, as a few examples.&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is one of those rare, timeless and redemptive classics. I recommend this book to everybody I know who likes to read, saved or lost. Lewis' book grips the reader very quickly and quite easily can be read in one day. The book is not very long. My only disappointment when I read it is that I cannot put it down until I've finished it, and then I feel a bit down because it's not longer!This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for everybody, lost and saved. Case cloed! In my opinion, a lost person with any grey matter between the ears cannot read this book and not be affected. For a Christian, I do not see how anybody can read this book and not be ecstatic that he/she has been eternally rescued from HELL!AWESOME BOOK! EVEN IN SPITE OF 1 COR 1:18, EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, SAVED AND LOST.

His nephew is a beginner of doing evil things and tempting bad things. The nephew's name is Wormwood and the devil's name is Screwtape.

As a person reads this book, they should be careful what the devil looks for and what he hates. Screwtape tells Wormwood what to do by writing letters to him. This book is interesting because what C.S. Lewis is saying is true.The setting of this book is probably in Hell, writing to Wormwood. I think my favorite part was when Screwtape explained to him about the temptations of evil is not easy to not do because when people want to do something they want to do but its illegal, they fall into the greatest sin and that is temptation. I get these temptations too by either playing games when I'm not supposed to and other temptations. I like this phrase because I think in my life, temptation is the most sin I lack on. I think that I have to watch out for this sin because it is not good to fall into temptation.i chose to read this book because my teacher and my sister wanted me to read this. When I looked at the pages and the words, I was shocked and didn't want o read, but when I read the first few pages, the book was getting intereasting.

Such a premise could easily have turned into a silly and not particullary interesting book. However, Lewis actually does a fantastic execution of his preimse. It held my interest. Lewis tales the story through letters written between the villians and weaves in some interesting commentaries on friendship, spiritual growth, and even the Second World War (I believe the book was finished in about 1941 or so though the particular edition I read had some later material as well).

Regarding the non-fictional material here, Lewis accurately considers the general stages of, and the pitfalls of, the Christian re-birth and growth.My only negative comment is that I found that the \\"upward progess\\" of the new Christian subject came perhaps a bit too easily, simply, and predictably. In my experience and observation as a long time \\"follower of Jesus\\" . . . it's been much more complex, more difficut, and more \\"tricky\\" than Lewis portrays it here.

Lewis - and no doubt whichever demons are working on damning me just did a high five knowing I enjoyed this based mainly on its entertainment value.Via a series of letters written in the voice of Screwtape, a senior demon mentoring his nephew who has been assigned as the lifelong \\"tempter\\" of a certain human, Lewis is able to convey ideas on diverse spiritual topics including the reason why God (who Screwtape calls \\"the enemy\\") allows wars and disasters to occur, the proper and false forms of humility and self-sacrifice, and - a big theme spelled out repeatedly - the idea that most people don't lose their souls by committing atrocities but through a gradual series of subtler transgressions that numb them to their sin even as they continue to see themselves as good Christians all the way down \\"the slippery slope\\".I also enjoyed the way John Cleese reads the audio book - often with overtones of patience but with increasingly frequent reminders of Screwtape's demonic nature as Wormwood stumbles in the battle for the human's soul. As that occurs, the story part of the book starts becoming as compelling as the idea part, but it's unapologetically polemical fiction all the way through. I didn't mind, though - I really enjoyed the material and Cleese's interpretation of it. Somehow I didn't get into Screwtape Proposes a Toast (the very short \\"sequel\\" also included in the audio book) the same way. I put sequel in quotes cuz it felt more like an essay critiquing the way democracy was practiced in England at the time of writing than a continuation of the previous story or even its themes.Speaking of sequels and such, I saw a link in the comments of another review about the people who made the Narnia movies having bought the movie rights for Screwtape. It definitely benefits from being acted out - I saw one or two reviewers of the print version who said they struggled with the writing style but with the way John Cleese read it I did not feel that way at all. But I'm thinking they'd need to take liberties with the story to avoid a movie version becoming too talky. I agree that the idea of a battle for a human soul seen from the demon's point of view is a great idea for a movie but it'd be interesting to see how they manage to show the beliefs Lewis was focused on conveying without Screwtape just doing a voice over throughout the movie."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Screwtape Letters primarily covers Lewis' theology of virtue. The dark, wry humor in Screwtape's letters to his nephew Wormwood works well as a framing device for what is largely a series of essays on temptation and virtue. There's no real plot as such and Wormwood's target is never more than a cipher, as Screwtape would hardly have cared, but doing otherwise - perhaps with letters from Wormwood as well - would have been a different book. This one works remarkably well, funny and thoughtful.It is flawed, though; Lewis dismisses some things too carelessly when they conflict with his own thoughts. A bit more ambiguity from Screwtape would have suited the work, particularly when he treads outside of the central conceits of the book. Screwtape Proposes a Toast, included at the end of the book, suffers from this particularly; showing a broader aim rather than the temptation of a single person, it veers into the political. Screwtape's musings work more effectively in other matters, though they remain entertaining to the end."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I love it! C. S. Lewis was a mastermind.

A senior demon instructs a junior demon on how to handle a soul. Lewis provides surprisingly deep spiritual insights using this format and humor as well. This book provides convicting lessons on humility, temptation, marriage, fellowship, and true Christianity. The book has been often imitated but never surpassed.John Cleese's performance is excellent. He brings out the nuances of the text. He enhances the humor and pathos. The perfectly timed smacking of the lips from Screwtape is worth the price of the tape. Clesse richly deserved the grammy he earned for this performance.This tape would be a great introduction to Lewis, if you never read him before.

While not practising I do understand alot of christian mythology and am always interested in anything that may reveal interpretations of faith. This novel was a wonderfully incightfull glimpse into the world of a demon (christian). The messages from Screwtape to his nephew challenge the thoughts and actions we take on a daily basis. Lewis tactfully chalenges those who would call themselves atheists not to mention challenging the justifications many of us use on a daily basis to avoid following an ethical life. While reading it makes you stop and say to yourself, wow I am doing the exact thing this demon wants me to do and while it doesn't make you fear that your soul will be taken it makes you wonder, what would it hurt to go that extra mile to take the ethical, morally right alternative. This book offers me a great reminder whenever I am having trouble making a decision on a problem in my life. But be warned if you have been preached to all your life many of this will sound familiar and in too large of doses can be off putting, but overall a wonderfull read."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Screwtape Letters is a unique book. I can think of no other work of literature that I have read or have heard of that is even remotely similar. Lewis' writing assumes the voice of a demon, Screwtape, authoring instructional letters to his nephew, Wormwood, on how to effectively tempt the man he has been assigned to, in order to pull him away from \`the Enemy' (God). It is an unmatched work of Lewis' grasp on human psychology seen through the lens of Christianity.The plot of the book traces the practicing temptations of Wormwood upon his subject, and then follows the continuing cosmic battles of God and the demonic throughout the events of what is seemingly everydayhuman life. The ultimate aim of the book, I believe, is for Christians to understand how demons/tempters utilize the mundane occurrences of life to lure us away from God. It is a spectacularly revealing book that helped me to realize that wickedness is not the absolute aim of Satan, but to promote repeated actions and thoughts within us that keep us from approaching God.I understand that the Screwtape Letters may seem cliche to many, because it sits atop every Christian's bookshelf as one of the absolute must reads along with the books we know everyone has: \`Mere Christianity,' \`Desiring God,' \`Narnia,' etc. (I would like to note that the presence of these books doesn't mean for a second that anyone has read them) It is like the Christian book equivalent of a star on your Christmas Tree- it just isn't right until it's there. But it really is a book that is more than worth its time to read. The Screwtape Letters will not only help you in more thoroughly thinking through your own faith, but also thinking through \`the little foxes' that seem to attack your system of belief. I think what amazes me most about the Screwtape Letters, is that while Lewis is a using a fictitious demon as his mouthpiece, there are wholly reverent, and worshipful ideas that are presented to the reader, despite the devout thoughts coming from a character that completely despises God. The Screwtape Letters will undoubtedly present to you ideas and theologies that help to foster a greater love and passion for the one in the book who is referred to as the \`Great Enemy.'I remember vividly when someone very close to me was hesitant about reading \`The Screwtape Letters' because the very idea of a demon being assigned to temp an individual was scary. I agree, the idea certainly isn't one that makes you want to party like its 1999. However, it is a reality that our enemy Satan is seeking to destroy us, and having a better grasp on his battle plan is like knowing the formation and strategy of an attacking army- it's going to help.All that being said, in no way is this a scary book to read, nor will it promote thoughts about the demonic in an unhealthy way. Your child is not going to be a practicing warlock that attends Hogwarts after reading the book. At worst you will notice areas in your life that you have forfeited to temptation that you never noticed. At best (which is what occurred to me, and I think every other Tom, Dick, and Harry that has read the book) you will find yourself emotionally stirred, and have a greater love for God who readily thwarts the attacks of the demonic.Put it on the top shelf, as cliche as it seem. It belongs there. Trust me.Check out my book review site: [...]"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I really enjoy this reading of \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". Mr. Cleese puts a lot of emotion and life into his reading. I felt that in some places, the pausing/emotion got a bit too much, and I detest the musical interludes, but otherwise, this adaptation is lovely. One of my favorites, and I recommend it highly to everyone."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is the second time that I have read this book. The first time was as a youth a very long time ago and it had a positive impact on me. I decided to reread it and see what additional insights it would bring into my life. It was clearly worth the few hours of my time it took to read this book. The device Lewis uses is very clever and forces one to look at sin, pride, and mediocrity from a totally different viewpoint. It becomes clear that it's not the big mistakes we make in life that really hurts us; sometimes those are the things that cause us to reevaluate our lives and repent. The things that really hurt us are the pride and the accumulation of little sins. Lewis seem to really be pushing for greatness of soul. Bottom line is this little book made me think about my life. That is what a good book should do.The book also includes the essay, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\". This was written much later and instead of Screwtape writing letters advising Wormwood, he is at an awards ceremony at the school for tempters proposing a toast to future and past successes. It is basically a vehicle to complain about how the modern education system focuses on mediocrity. It also brings out some very good points to ponder.I highly recommend this book to everyone. The principles espoused here apply to all people, religious or not."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"It's funny because most of us think we're so much smarter and more progressive than the ones from the past generations. We act as if we've grown out of certain things and 'evolved' since our grandparents' time. Yet, everytime I read books from people like C.S Lewis and Watchman Nee, who were active 50-60 years ago, I realize the true wisdom come from the Lord not our schools or the cutting edge science we boast.While reading this book, I caught myself doing exactly the same things Screwtape was instructing his newphe to get his 'patient' to do. There're so many distractions in our lives that we constantly lose our focus from the most important thing! Jesus Christ! I also loved the way Screwtape described the true prayer. It's about communicating with the Christ as who He really is not as who we want Him to be or think He should be. It's amazing to see C.S. Lewis glorify the Lord with the amazing talent that's given to him."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C. S. Lewis takes a very interesting perspective in this book, writing letters from an affectionate and established professional devil in the field of human temptation to his beloved but inexperienced nephew, a young devil who has just recently entered the field. Told completely through these letters, the story unfolds of how the uncle constantly tries to correct the younger devil's foul-ups as the younger tries to corrupt his assigned human's soul. Through this arrangement, Lewis gives poignant comment on humanity, Christianity, and what is truly important. Written in an older English style, the grammar is at times hard to follow, but that only makes the reader concentrate more and therefore gain more from the story. A rewarding read, if not always enjoyable due to the effort."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I would characterize this as something like Lewis's \\"modest proposal\\" for the temptation of mankind. In the epistolary tradition, but representing only one side of the conversation, the letters in question are those of a senior demon, the eponymous Screwtape, to his nephew Wormwood, a minor devil, and represent Screwtape's collected wisdom on the subject of the temptation of human beings from the straight and narrow.Like much of Lewis's writing, The Screwtape Letters is essentially an apology for Christianity, but unlike some of his other books, Screwtape is funny, sly, witty, and full of sarcastic japes and jests. Of course, it also provides plenty of Lewis's own wisdom (demonstrated \\"in reverse\\" by Screwtape, as true a \\"devil's advocate\\" as ever there has been).A very entertaining and illuminating read! Even if you've found some of Lewis's theological writings difficult or tedious, try The Screwtape Letters."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I loved this book. It was amusing and insightful. Lewis really captured the character of a demonic bureaucrat and makes it come alive. I am buying copies for all of my friends so they can enjoy this book as well. Very insightful on human nature and the temptation to sin; gives you pause the next time you're arguing with your wife as to whether it's really you that wants to prolong the fight or someone else whispering in your ear."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"After at least a decade and several personal recommendations to read it each year, I finally got around to buying \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\" The initial emotion I experienced after reading its introduction was jealously as I could not help but wish that it was I, and not Lewis, who had such an ingenious idea. Once you discover the book's method, which is of a senior demon writing to his nephew with recommendations on how to steal souls, you'll be astounded at the wonderful complexity of the author's mind. His reverse theological technique provided ample opportunity to skewer many of the most powerful members of England's WWII society. What is most remarkable about the book is that it is even more applicable to our present day world than it was to the author's era. Moderate and touchy-feely churches are ubiquitous to our landscape and Screwtape undoubtedly would be most pleased with their constant empthasis on social issues rather than the Lord's Word. The book has tremendous meaning as it difficult to dismiss the possibility that the Devil influences our daily lives and the world around us. One cannot help but wonder if their are Screwtapes and Wormwoods in the air we breath who attempt, with subtle direction, to steer us away from productive activities and into the netherworld of souless entertainment."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I've made a few attempts to read this book, but could never make it all the way through. When I heard that John Cleese made an audio version of it, I bought a copy immediately. Who could be a more perfect reader for this book? He read it in perfect character. One unavoidable problem is that there is so much thought provoking stuff packed into the lines of this book, that you frequently have to stop the tape to think about what you've heard, then go back and re-listen. But that's OK. I'm an atheist, but I find the book fascinating. It's a tremendous mental challenge to go through and figure out the subtle little logic twistings Lewis uses in his defense of Christianity. He actually seems to have condensed several behavioral psychology courses into the book. It actually deals mostly with origins of complacency in the face of beliefs that should strongly motivate a person. The book didn't persuade me, but I can see how it could easily fire up any nominal Christian who stumbled upon it. I would consider it one of the masterworks of the 20th century. In case you're wondering (since the Amazon.com description doesn't tell you), the unabridged tapes are a set of 3 tapes, with no written material at all. And yes, they do contain &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S. Lewis writes the ultimate Christian primer -- telling his readers how best to be faithful Christians by showing us how we should NOT behave! Screwtape, a high level denomic bureaucrat, is advising his neophyte demon nephew Wormwood on how to win over to &quot;Our Father Below&quot; his &quot;patient,&quot; a new Christian who must be wooed away from &quot;the Enemy,&quot; who is, of course, God. What makes this book so profound is that the temptations Screwtape suggests to Wormwood are not just the obvious ones, but the subtle ones that get to us everyday, sometimes under the guise of &quot;doing good.&quot; How many of us, for example, have gotten into arguments with a loved one over who was being more unselfish -- &quot;I don't want pepperoni on the pizza, but go ahead, have pepperoni, I don't mind.&quot; &quot;No, I insist. No pepperoni, even though I love it so much, because I know you hate it.&quot; &quot;No, please, have the pepperoni, darn it!&quot; And so the resentment builds. It is this sort of sin and temptation that Screwtape urges Wormwood to play upon his hapless &quot;patient.&quot;But Screwtape knows his &quot;enemy&quot; and he knows his limits. My favorite line, and one well worth hanging on to for all of us who feel we have lost hope: &quot;Do not be deceived, Wormwood. Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do our Enemy's will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys&quot; (p. 40). And never forget. The demons never deny the existence of either Father or Son."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Through a creative twist of irony, C. S. Lewis illustrates the wiles of Satan's demons as they pursue the souls of human beings. Certainly versed enough to approach this subject using systematic Biblical exposition, the author rather chooses to present letters from a seasoned devil, Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood, an apprentice devil. This discourse is intended to raise an awareness among people of the evil influences, both purposeful and personal, that we are all exposed to. Lewis does a crafty job in a way that holds interest while at the same time allows for contemplation.One particular individual, Wormwood's \\"patient\\", is in focus as he is drawn to Christ and proceeds to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus as his Creator/Redeemer. Uncle Screwtape consistently hounds his nephew as he struggles with his formidable task of destroying his human assignment. Every situation described is from the perspective of evil. Lying is in vogue; guilt and fear are used extensively.It is good that this book is written as a collection of short letters. Several can be read at a sitting and then the topics can be pondered. It seemed best to read small sections at a time, because the perspective shift requires an extra measure of brainwork. Screwtape, bent on wickedness, refers to God as the enemy.Wormwood is fighting a losing battle, and it is encouraging as Lewis shows this. In his preface to the book he clarifies that Satan is not the opposite of God. God is eternal and all sufficient. Satan is a created angel, destined to serve God's purposes. Screwtape grows more frustrated as the plot progresses. When the \\"patient\\" meets a Christian girl and is also meeting more and more Christian friends, the uncle gets flat out mad and scolds Wormwood. Screwtape was patronizing Wormwood in the early letters. Towards the end he can hide his hatred no longer - \\"My dear Wormwood, you seem to be doing very little good at present.\\" (Do not forget the shift.)This book brought to mind many dumb things that I have done as a Christian. That can be a good thing, especially when followed with the reminder that God is in control and wants me to learn that He is drawing me to his side. Lewis' book has that effect, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I enjoy a book for its combination of conciseness, clarity, and profound meaning -- \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" has this very enjoyable combination.An earlier post suggested that those under the age of 17 not read this marvelous book, and I'm supposing this certain someone says so with a good intention, just with not much thought. I am now 17, and when I first read this book I was sixteen.My suggestion, is, of course, quite different then: no one should be told not to read this book merely because of age, because wisdom has no preference of age. This wisdom that I speak of is not \\"worldy\\" wisdom, but heavenly; it comes from only the Good and Eternal Father, our Maker. Worldy wisdom is gained by experience neccesarily, yet heavenly wisdom is freely given by Him.\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is filled with this heavenly wisdom, this profound meaning which I spoke of at the first. How? Because Lewis was (and is) a son of God; God blessed his heart, soul, and MIND. Each man --whether non-christian or \\"not of age\\" -- who reads this book will be possibly graced with this heavenly wisdom. My first tip then is: Do not feel yourself below or above this book, for it has wisdom even for the smallest and biggest of minds.Lewis accomplished in this book, a very strenuous task: he communicated heavenly wisdom through the view-point of a devil. It is astonishing to think some find this book funny, as suggested by some other reviewers; this book was written with much discipline and if that provokes some laughs, reconsider yourself. Lewis has communicated his thoughts in this book so well, he has poured out so much effort, that this book is not to be taken lightly. God and his creeds, viewed through the eyes of demons, is serious. My second tip is: Much is to be learned from this eloquent work; therefore, be an alert reader, and pray for God's guidance on this one.Ryan"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"One of this Oxford Don's best known works is this profound little book. It comprises letters written by the demon Screwtape to his nephew a lower demon. These letters are written from the Devil's perspective as they try to tempt...pull over to their side...their victim.This is the kind of book that deserves to be read many times. There are passages that I recommend underlining as it is nice to be able to go back, from time to time, and find these small vignettes."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"&quot;There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors and . . . &quot;With these words C.S. Lewis opens the preface of this fascinating book. This is spritual classic unlike any other in the way it deals with temptation, evil, and demons. I've purchased several copies over the years, but everybody keeps borrowing them. I've learned to keep a copy or two on my self, just for loaning out. Usually they are loaned to teens who are beginning to grapple with the possibilty of personalized evil.It is not hard to recommend this book. An added bonus of interest is the dedication of the book. Lewis dedicated it to his long time friend and fellow member of his writing club, J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This allegory is both a hilarious and unsettling examination of the pitfalls that can trip up ANY Christian (irregardless of denomination) during his or her walk of faith. Again and again the administrative devil Screwtape offers advises to his novice nephew Wormwood on how best to distract, trip-up, or out and out blind a patient (Lewis's term for the human victim of the devil's temptations). Each letter is a microscopic examination on a worldly weakness, or strength, that can be slowly twisted and, without the patient being truly aware of it, lead him off the path to salvation. Anybody on the Christian path will no doubt chuckle and relate to these temptations, easily seeing his or her self facing the problematic issues that Screwtape urges Wormwood to exploit. I find it hard to believe that this book's of examination of faith and belief and how human weakness can either undermine or strengthen both can be surpassed, either in fiction or non. An essential book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"...except for a few minor theological points. As the reviews above discuss, this book is a compilation of hilarious letters between demons on how to lead a person, or &quot;patient,&quot; astray. Most of the letters provide good advice as to how to lead a good life.While the book is deeply routed in orthodox Christianity, anyone can enjoy most, if not all, of the lessons taught here. Some people may want to ignore the implications that evolution, the historical Jesus studies, paganism, state-controlled education, etc., are the ways of the Devil, but these are minor points, which do not get major airplay in the Letters.Finally, John Cleese's reading is absolutely inspired. His intonation and timing maximize the comedy. If you can, check out the audiobook. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Although C.S. Lewis published &#65533;The Screwtape Letters&#65533; in 1942, its theme is every bit as appropriate today. A collection of correspondence from a veteran devil to an apprentice demon, the learned counsel for debasing virtue is all too commonplace in practice today.The corruption of language has been articulated by many social critics over the past decade to so, but Mr. Lewis referenced this nascent technique sixty years ago. The experienced devil, Screwtape, seems to be embracing modern day parlance when he brags about the word &#65533;Puritanism&#65533; taking on its pejorative status. &#65533;The value we have given to that word is one of the really solid triumphs of the last hundred years; by it we rescue annually thousands of humans from temperance, chastity and sobriety.&#65533;Today we often hear the cant that one religion is as good as another, and saying a certain religion is true will elicit terms like discrimatory or judgmental. While most churches advocate truth and righteousness, a lack of loyalty to one is not a positive development and Screwtape was knew this to be true. He waxed, &#65533;if a man can&#65533;t be cured of church, the next best thing is to send him all over the neighborhood looking for a church that suits him until he becomes a taster or connoisseur of churches.&#65533; He was especially fond of churches that change to meet current demand and praised a church where &#65533;the vicar is a man who has so long engaged in watering down the faith to make it easier for a supposedly incredulous and hard-headed congregation that it is now he who shocks his parishioners with his unbelief.&#65533;Often Mr. Lewis's healthy sense of humor is artfully displayed. An exasperated Screwtape writes desparigingly that one mortal is &#65533;not only a Christian such a Christian--a vile, sneaking, simpering, demure, monosyllabic, mouselike, watery, insignificant, virginal, bread-and-butter miss. The little brute, she makes me vomit.&#65533;Throughout the fantasy, a bounty of real advice is present. Simple tidbits such as Screwtape&#65533;s simple statement that &#65533;the safest road to hell is the gradual one&#65533; should serve as a tocsin for many readers. With wit, ingenuity, reverence, and jocularity, C.S. Lewis created a timeless classic to exhort the ages."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"There's no way to avoid writing a review of this work without it reading like a Dear John letter.Cleesey...brilliant choice of medium. Sir John, my man, you are in top form.To our dear reader/listenter:If you &quot;loved&quot; Shakespeare's Richard III's playful villainy, the Devil's tearful plea to his fellow fallen angels in Milton's Paradise Lost (thank you for pointing that our Dr. Sellin), or the mental judo the witches use on MacBeth leading to his final downfall...this tome on temptation is for you."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I picked up this book because it was recommended to me as very funny and, having been a huge fan of The Chronicles of Narnia as a child, I wanted to read an example of C.S. Lewis's overt literary argument for Christianity. I thought I might find a Christian counterpoint to Twain's Letters from the Earth. I'm afraid I was somewhat disappointed.The Screwtape Letters is an epistolary novel with the central conceit being that C.S. Lewis has recovered letters of advice that a Demon from the depths -- Screwtape -- had written to one of his foot soldiers -- Wormwood -- whose job it was to stick by a mortal and suggest certain lines of thought to him and exaggerate certain emotions in key moments, leading him astray. We are only privy to Screwtape's letters, and it is through his criticism of his apprentice's efforts, and his advice, that the reader is to divine the mortal's story, the efforts of Wormwood, and the nature and methods of Evil and Good.But Screwtape is Evil, and thus his advice may not necessarily be intended to help his charge, and I think we are to take The Screwtape Letters as an investigation into the psychology of Evil as it reveals itself in the mischievous advice. The difficulty in knowing which advice is straightforward is illustrative of Lewis's epistemology, \\"A great human philosopher nearly let our secret out when he said that where Virtue is concerned \`Experience is the mother of illusion' ....\\" -- which is also a dig at the modernist concept of the untrustworthy author. In the final analysis there's not much you can do with liars outside of laugh at them. Hence, \\"A more modern writer -- someone with a name like Pshaw -- has, however, grasped the truth.\\"And Lewis obviously had a lot of Dickensian fun with his demons' names, \\"Toadpipe\\", \\"Triptweeze\\", \\"Glubose\\", \\"Slubgob\\" and \\"Slumtrimpet\\", and there are some pretty funny lines like \\"Only the learned read old books and we have now so dealt with the learned that they are of all men the least likely to acquire wisdom by doing so.\\" And \\"Do not let us be infected by our own propaganda.\\"There are also compelling lines like \\"Humans are amphibians -- half spirit and half animal.\\" and \\"For the present is the point at which time touches eternity.\\" But in my opinion, to be honest, the book is really not all that funny. It is interesting, very well written, and even describes a profound vision of human psychology. But it is not particularly funny. It is humorous, but not Catch 22, At Swim Two Birds or The Magic Christian belly laugh funny. You end up finding yourself quietly amused.I suppose we are warned, the two epigrams at the start of the book refer to scorn and contempt, not humor: \\"The best way to drive out the devil, if he will not yield to texts of Scripture, is to jeer and flout him, for he cannot bear scorn.\\" -- Luther. And \\"The devil .. the prowde spirite .. cannot endure to be mocked.\\" -- Thomas More. It all reminds me of St. Augustine's vision of the saved gloating over the torments of the damned. (St. Augustine also had some insights into the psychology of man.)In fact, in Screwtape Lewis suggests the best method with which to corrupt man is to make him feel like he is doing good, being Christian, when in reality he is only doing so to feed his own pride, his own vanity. Unfortunately, I think more Christians will feel the sting of this critique in Twain's Letters from the Earth than they will in Screwtape. I'm afraid that Lewis inadvertently helps the \\"saved\\" feel comfortable in their self-regard, which, of course, would be terribly ironic, but not terribly funny.This edition also includes Screwtape Proposes a Toast, which was initially an Op-Ed for the Saturday Evening Post attacking the leveling psychology of democracy, which Lewis sees as dangerous because it produces a type of person who \\"resents every kind of superiority in others; denigrates it; wishes its annihilation. Presently he suspects every mere difference of being a claim to superiority.\\" He considers this phenomena to be a banal version of envy, and predicts -- in the vein of Arendt -- a new mass of sinners who aren't of the great sinners variety, but damned by their lack of humility nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Didn't expect the pages to be so yellowed and dry...but it is readable and does the job."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This book is good for Christains and laychristains alike.

Hell is depicted as the ultimate bureaucracy, staffed by tempters who are motivated by the fear of punishment. Lewis frequently displays great insight when dissecting the less charitable elements of human nature. However, he also comes across as disdainful, dismissive and condescending toward non-Christians.At times, he shows himself to be in possession of prejudices that, in my eyes at least, disqualify him from being the moral authority that many believe him to be. The best example of this can be found in the epilogue, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\\" in which Lewis laments the tendency of some to interpret the political ideal of \\"equality\\" as a moral justification for dragging everyone down to the same level of mediocrity. He claims that the feeling that prompts someone to claim that they are just as good as anyone else is one of the root causes of sin and is really just \\"the itching, writhing, smarting awareness of an inferiority which the patient refuses to accept.\\" Among the examples of inferiority that he provides are some really stunning cases, whether stunningly irrelevant and frivolous (such as the claim that toy dogs are inferior to Saint Bernards) or stunningly wrong-headed and shallow (such as the claim that plain women are inferior to beauties).Whatever you may think of his content, though, Lewis always makes his case clearly and, in this case, through the conception of a brilliant metaphor."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"It is an excellent book to be kept in one's library and read many times."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"But, of course, it is out of print.

Here is a fictional book based on both absolute truth and non-fiction ideas. There is a battle being fought by demons and angels over the lives of humans. Both God and Satan are wanting your soul for their kingdoms. Through his specific situations and diction, Lewis allows us to see the influence of demons in our own lives. Also Lewis takes a new spin on point of view from the devil's side. No one really ever thinks of God as &quot;The Enemy.&quot; Usually the sterotypes of God are good and majestic, but through &quot;The Screwtape Letters,&quot; the devil is seen as the &quot;good guy.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone searching for answers to life, or wanting to know more about spiritual warfare."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is a classic piece of Christian fiction.

He also wrote the Chronicles of Narnia for kids. But Screwtape Letters is for adults. It is readable. And not a dense theological writing. In fact, most of Lewis's stuff is not super hard to understand. At least on the surface. He makes you think. His writing is probably not for the average person, but if you are looking to be stretched in your understanding of practical Christianity by an intelligent writer, Lewis is a good choice.His writings are not brand new, as he died quite a few years ago. But the things he writes about are timeless.I fell into reading Lewis while I was in junior high and he was a total revelation to me. I loved him.

I plan on reading this book a second time in the near future to better capture the fullness of what it has to say."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"In this book C.S. Lewis conveys guidance on moral and spiritual improvement, engagingly and creatively packaged in the form of a series of letters from an \\"uncle\\" devil, senior in the bureaucracy of Hell, to his \\"nephew,\\" a junior devil charged with tempting a certain individual mortal soul. Uncle Screwtape offers nephew Wormwood fiendishly avuncular advice on how to lead the young man in question astray. Each letter discusses some human vice or flaw from the Devil's point of view (e.g. intellectual vanity, pride, hypocrisy and selfishness) in the context of the young man's daily life in England during the Blitz: living with his mother, joining a church, making new friends, falling in love, and enduring bombing raids.For me, this book was both enjoyable and uplifting. It reminded me, in a light but pointed fashion, that being good, and becoming better, demand constant vigilance, discipline and care. Lewis skewers neatly the petty vanities and cruelties that we can fall into -- using an impatient or unkind tone with one's mother; snickering at the dowdy outfit on the person in the next pew; feeling a little too self-satisfied about having the coolest laptop on the plane. If you are one of the many who strive for virtue, yet sometimes fall into sin, you can learn from this book, whether or not you have the faith that Christian doctrine generally posits as necessary for salvation.The device of having a devil explain morality in reverse creates amusing ironies, though eventually it gets tiring -- like trying to make out a photographic image by looking at the negative. Also tiring is that the main speaker is inhumanly unattractive (of course), and no appealing characters appear in the foreground at all. As a result, there is not enough dramatic tension or human warmth to carry the reader for very long, but that is not too much of a fault because the book is quite short. Substantively, I was disappointed in Lewis's dismissive attitude toward the question of an individual's responsibility with respect to larger social issues (was there an irony that I missed?). He handles this better in other works such as That Hideous Strength. In closing I would note a metaphysical question that stumped my book group: if humans go to heaven or hell when they die, and angels enjoy eternal life, where do dead devils go?For those who want to try more C.S. Lewis, I would recommend the Perelandra Trilogy, especially That Hideous Strength. Another unconventional and charming interpretation of Christian notions of right conduct that may interest those who enjoyed this book is Franny and Zooey by J.D. Salinger."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"If you're lokking for a book that has a good clear message, this is a good one.

These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]One of Lewis's most famous books, \\"The Screwtape Letters\\", written in late 1940 to early 1941, are letters \\"From One Devil to Another\\" (the original title o fthe work). The book is a fictional account of an older devil named Screwtape, giving a younger devil, Wormwood, advice on how to lead Wormwood's first \\"patient\\" astray. Both profound and psychologically astute, Lewis displays a mental virtuosity in these letters that has garnered him such acclaim. Most editions also include a second piece, \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\", written in the early 1960s just before Lewis died, years after initial composition.Before I continue, be aware of newer editions of Lewis's works in regards to textual accuracy. In Letter 22, the sentence read \\"A more modern writer - someone with a name like Pshaw\\", was changed to Lewis's name himself. If you read any copy that Screwtape refers to the works of C. S. Lewis, know you are dealing with a tampered, adulterated text. Why the estate would allow such hackeyed editing to take place is beyond me.[Of interest is Lewis's decidication.] Lewis dedicated the book to J. R. R. Tolkien. Written in a draft letter to his son Michael Tolkien after Lewis's death (Letter 252 in \\"Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien)), Tolkien discussed his relationship with Jack, and how by various events (first, the appearance of Charles Williams, who died in 1945, and secondly his marriage), they drifted apart, although they remained friends with deep affection and love for one another, though not as imitate as once they were. To quote Tolkien \\"I was wrly amused to be told (D. Telegraph) that \`Lewis was never very fond of \`The Screwtape Letters' - his best seller (250,000). He dedicated it t me. I wondered why. Now I know - says they.\\" Lewis also dedicated \\"The Problem of Pain\\" to the Inklings (the same group the initial first editon of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was dedicated too). Tolkien and Humphrey Carpenter made numerous suggestions that Lewis incorporated in \\"The Problem of Pain\\".Although the book has long proven to be one of his most popular, Lewis did not like the actual writing process. He found it quite easy to get into a \\"devilish\\" point of view, but did not think it good for his character to write for extended periods of time in this type of work. He also felt the work was out of balance - there should be a companion piece, a book of angelic wisdom. However, such a book's prose should have the very air of heaven itself, and Lewis felt quite unequaled to write such a text.After writing the letters Lewis published them in a now defunct periodical called \\"The Guardian\\", an Church of England publication. Although he did not want to harm any publication that issued his work, Lewis was found fond of telling the story that he was directly responsible for losing \\"The Guardian\\" at least one reader, due to the \\"diabolical device advice\\" present in the letters. For whatever readership these letters lost \\"The Guardian\\" were more than made up, as these letters brought in many new readers to the periodical.The manuscript of \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" actually survives, which is unusual for several Lewis books, due to his habit of destroying them after publication as he had no place to store them. After completing the letters, he sent them to Sister Penelope as he was afraid they could be destroyed in a bombing raid by Germany before the book publication appeared, and he felt it may be difficult to reassemble the text from the various issues of \\"The Guardian\\".The first two letters especially are very relevant to today's society. Lewis brings out the fact that, indeed, devils cannot produce any type of virtues, and vices are only perversions of what God has ordained as good. The only thing demons can do is take the pleasure that God has created and encourage us to use it the wrong way. In letter two, he speaks of the mental habits of thinking people are better than what they really are. One thing that especially rings true is that it is very easy for new-born Christians to think that those around them, who they know and that these people's lives are not in proper order, for, after all, they are human beings, cannot be the Christian Church because of little things.In the subsequent letters Lewis deals with a wide variety of practical, everyday matters. Letter Four deals with prayer (far more concisely and succinctly than Lewis' own \\"Letters to Malcolm\\") and has more truth about that subject than many full length books. Letter deight deals with free will. Letter Twelve shows us Lewis's thoughts on pleasure, and how one of Satan's chief tactics is to set up false pleasures and false good activities. Time is so valuable, and Lewis demonstrates that so often when people arrive in hell they find that they have neither spent their time worthilily nor did they do what they truly enjoyed doing. Letter Fourteen distinguishes true humility and false humility, and how false humility becomes a very mockery of what it claims to be. False humiility leads to pride, and gives one a falsely low view of both yourself and God's other creations. Also, denying your identity in God is not true humility - we were made wonderfully.There are several letters on vice, including those small ones that may not seem like vice at all. Lewis writes about love, marriage, and lust as well. Letter sixteen [deals] demonstrate the vigilance God must develop within you regarding preachers - so often people wander from church to church, looking either for watered down faith or controversy. One must seek the heart of God - not \\"party churches\\" that seem more about pomp and circumstances than about getting to the heart of the Father.There are ways to mythologize the church into this grand and wonderful place that leaves out all the real elements in life and what it means to be a Christian. Letter twenty nine tells us how cowardice will never be approved of, and if you make a human a coward there is the very real danger that his other faults will be evident when he goes on a real soul searching on why he ran.Lewis's wit is rampant throughout the book, and especially with Screwtape's treatment of Wormwood. They both wish to consume one another, and when Wormwood begs for mercy it is considered heresy because that is not how demons behave.After completing the work, Lewis took too regular confessions with a priest, as he felt that the habit allowed him to better understand his own temptations and how to work through them and defeat them. Just like Lewis, reading this book will sharpen your senses of right and wrong from a Biblical perspective, and give you new understanding for your Christian walk.Strangely enough there is both a stage production and a possible movie in the works. I have not seen the stage production, but as the book is primarily concerned with spiritual matters written in a largely non-fictional manner, I found it hard to understand how they could make an actual movie out of this book. While there is a definie narrative, \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is much more about understanding the Enemy and is more akin to his apologetic works than his novels.The idea of devils writing letters to one another would prove to be an influential device in Christian publications, as various other writers have also played with the concept. I have even written such a letter years ago for a class assignmentThis is an essential text for both C. S. Lewis fans and Christians in general.(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S. Lewis approaches the side of this enemy in this unbiased account of two demons trying to secure the rapture if this unnamed \\"patient\\" during a war torn era. His ability to bring things to life almost makes you learn the voice if your own demons and to challenge your own depths in this enlightening book. With 31 letters, this book is perfect for studying over the course of a month. I would recommend The Screwtape Letters to anybody that deals with unknown demons."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Apart from the chronicles of Narnia, if I could have only one of the books of C. S. Lewis, the Screwtape Letters would be it. It's vibrant, exciting, colorful and very precise and clever in the points it makes.The book centers around two demons; the young, inexperienced Wormwood, and the elder demon named Screwtape, who writes him letters of advice and encouragement. These letters are much needed, as poor Wormwood keeps screwing up, and letting his human do things like become a Christian, make some new friends when his old ones become a bad influence, take a relaxing walk to clear his head so that he can think straight, etc... Why, there's a very real danger that Wormwood might even let this particular human make it to Heaven, if he's not careful.Every perspective in this book is cleverly inverted. Screwtape praises the ability to sew confusion in the mind of a human being, the use of tiny slogans instead of rational explanations, to convince people of a point, the use of the word \\"democracy\\" to discourage people from excelling and so forth. His advice to his young demon friend reveals, very cleverly, the things that we must avoid, and the kinds of traps we can easily fall into if we're not careful, as well as precisely how to stay on the right track for our lives, and all in a sort of backwards, underworld style of writing which, to be honest, I found very humorous; even largely tongue-in-cheek.Of course, we know that demons don't really come in \\"older\\" and \\"younger,\\" nor do they learn anything, and they don't really -devour- humans or one another. Their motives are pure spite. Still, those slight deviations from actual theology make the story more fun and easier to tell, and perhaps even better.The mini-sequel, also included in most editions, entitled \\"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\\" is just as good as the original book, though it does, of course, have a slightly different premise. The particularly excellent quotes and points made would simply take too long to outline. If you haven't read this book yet, check it out. Even if you've made the mistake of not being a Christian, you'll probably still get a kick out of Screwtape and his bungling \\"nephew.\\""},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" by C.S. Lewis is an interesting book that's 209 pages long. It's a fictitious account of a senior demon writing to a junior demon about one man, the junior demon's \\"patient\\".While I have been a fan of C.S. Lewis and his books for a sometime, believe it or not I have never read \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" until now. I have to admit that it took a little bit for me to get into the book but once I was about a quarter of the way through the book it defiantly kept my attention. Each letter is about three pages long which makes it easy to grab and read a letter if you only have a few minutes.There were many insights I found and some things that made me pause and think long and hard about, things that hit a little too close to home.The book is not too hard to read but remember it was written by Lewis and he was not an American living in 2012 so some of the words and sayings might not connect but the overall flavor of the book should have its impact on you.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"As in C.S. Lewis style, this is not a quick read, but a thought provoking twist on the battle of the soul. Written to disrupt our thoughts on salvation and temptation, this book still grabs the reader by the collar as if to say, \\"Wake up! Can't you see what is happening here?\\" If for no other reason than curiosity, this should be a classic everyone reads. It could change your life."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is a literary and philosophical Classic making it difficult to review. I think my humble opinion compared to its popularity through the years pales. It leads to further study making me want to read more C. S. Lewis like Mere Christianity or A Question of Faith!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The book surely was worth the buy and it definitely has shed some light on situations that we Christians face in life."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S. Lewis had some great points that opened my eyes much, much wider to how demons work, and how to best resist them and their deceptions. I loved this book, and it was not frightening like other demon related books, it in fact had a sense of humor."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I find it refreshing to read the old books. Days when things were clearly one way or the other. Being a Chirstian, I agree with the book. Its a fun read anyway."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I had already read this, but I wanted a copy for myself before I went to college. The book came quickly, in great condition, and included \\"Screwtape Proposes A Toast,\\" which is a wonderful addition to the story. I suppose a cheaper, used version is safe enough too, but this price definitely beats a store-bought copy in every way. The cover I got was the one with the actual photo of a gargoyle statue thing, not the red one pictured here, but I didn't really care.The book itself is powerful and very readable. It gives amazing insight on temptation, is both challenging and encouraging, and can be read multiple times and in short sittings. It really is a must-read. For everyone, for realz!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I had forgotten how good this book by C. S. Lewis is. It has been quite a while since I last read it; I am rereading it now. As is everything C. S. Lewis writes, it is thought-provoking and stimulating. It is amazing how a book which was written 60 years ago can still serve as such an up-to-date critique of our culture, and of the state of the church in the West. I am actually using it in a high school literature class, and even my more reluctant students are finding ideas in the book that they have never thought about before."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"If you have ever been distracted, it was not an accident! Screwtape and his minions have just that in mind as he instructs his nephew in a myriad of ways to keep us occupied with the details of life; keeping us from thinking about death, and what might come after, or what the Enemy might have awaiting us. He wants us to focus on feelings - not to attend to all the evidence around us that the Enemy (God) is who He claims to be, and is more than able to provide our needs, and to insure an eternity of peace and joy for those who attend to Him. Screwtape has only winning us away from the Enemy in mind; this is his sole goal, and he will put all his energy into the competition. He is a sore loser!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The Magnum Opus of theological egghead Clive Staples Lewis. It's almost as if Lewis is a spy who has stolen Satan's top secret information and has presented it to Christians everywhere in this intelligence report. It opens the eyes of a Christian to the little but deadly tricks and traps that the anti-father below uses to separate us from God. It caused me to rethink some things, all the while having aspects of a dark comedy."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"It's kinda wild, but a great read. I love CS Lewis' style of writing and, as specifically evidenced here, his keen insight into humanity and the way we live our lives. It is a fictional (or at least hypothetical) story, but quite powerful."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Great book by an even greater author. C.S. Lewis is one of my literary heros. He seems to pull out little tid bits that easily get over looked yet with a little attention could change your life around. This book is fully recommended to anyone."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Most people I had spoken to had problems reading this book. Read it as a novel and you will find it a remarkable story and concept, and that you will have a spiritual awakening while do so. If you read it as a religious book and try to find the meanings along the way,you will not get very far, reading or spiritually. I Loved this book!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Definitely more advanced reading than the Chronicles of Narnia, but still a great book. May be easier to read than to listen to."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I moderate a Sunday school class for College Age students. We are currently using this as a class discussion tool. The book is a classic and the content timeless. We are using it in conjunction with the audio presentation by John Cleese.Very entertaining with real discussion and learning points."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Lewis always has amazing books that are strange yet satisfying to read. There was nothing spectacular about this specific edition of the book it's exactly what I paid for. Nothing more, nothing less."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I loved this book and found a nice little hard bound copy of this classic for 10 cents at a booksale."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Starting the preparation for studying abroad, I began to read \\"The CHRONICLES of NARNIA,\\" written by C. S. Lewis. It is more interesting than \\"Harry Potter\\" - the world bestseller. I was fascinated to C. S. Lewis, so I called last August the month of reading C. S. Lewis. I finished reading \\"The Screwtape Letters\\", one of his famous novels.This book is full of interest, wit, and seriousness. A magazine said, \\"The point about reading C. S. Lewis is that he makes you sure, whatever you believe, that religion accepted or rejected means something extremely serious, demanding entire energy of mind. I totally agree with this. Also, it has many witty sentences about Christianity, human being, and death.My point about reading this novel is that it makes me discover and understand the mistakes and illusion that I have. The most impressed sentence is this: \\"Despair is a greater sin than any of the sins which provoke it.\\" These day I have the trouble in preparing to go abroad. I feel l am alone and in a despair. Sometimes my feeling justified escaping my duties. Moreover, my behaviour make me sad. It was I that was in a bed while saying \\"Somebody kill me please.\\" However I know, but I don't fell as I know. After reading the evil's letters, I believe that my despair is a sin. Although studying abroad is one of the most worried issue, I have never prayed for it. From now on, I will pray for it whether I am in a despair or not.Reading this valuable book takes a month. Despite forgetting many things that I read a long ago, I memorize much in my heart. The impression keeps me going on the next book, \\"The Weight of Glory.\\""},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This book jumped into my top 10 favourite books of all time, which shouldn't have surprised me as I had already realized that Lewis was bound to be a big influence on my thought... but artistically and intellectually, this book entertained me like few others I have read.Past the brilliance of the original idea (I call it 'reverse theology', reverse in the sense of reverse psychology), its strengths lie in C.S. Lewis' astoundingly insightful analysis of how the devil tries to trip us up. A recurrent theme is the need for a demon to keep his human target hazy - reacting to or embracing terms and ideas without carefully considering them, living on the surface. Lewis does the reader a great service - we learn from Screwtape how to be better, more thorough, thinkers. And the psychological and ethical insights go far beyond this one example.I recommend this book to all and I have a suggestion for getting the most out of it: take it letter by letter. Read a chapter and go about your daily business, letting the thoughts sparked by the chapter grow and develop. I sometimes did this, other times I was too addicted and kept reading, but I find the latter method sometimes made me stay too much on the surface - letting go of the trains of thought great sentences or phrases might have taken me on.I actually had the idea of writing a book called \\"The Screwtape Ideas: A Letter-by-Letter Look at C.S. Lewis' Classic\\"... with exploration of the theological, philosophical, socio-political, historical, and artistic issues raised by the book, in content and in form. I found out here at amazon.com there's already a study guide written, so I guess if I actually did this I would need to be very original. Anyway, at some point, I must own the John Cleese book-on-tape version The Screwtape Letters, I'm sure it's delightful."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Though C.S. Lewis himself said he disliked writing this book, I enjoyed reading it more than almost any other book by him or anyone else. It's an incredibly funny book about a deadly serious topic. The letters are laced with moral implications and incredible humor. Even for a non-christian, this is a truly funny book. The constant references to \\"Our father down below\\" was funny, and the one letter where Screwtape gets so angry he accidently transforms himself into a millipede is alone worth the price of the book! Please, purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I have nothing but the highest praise for Screwtape Letters. The first time I read it, I got about a third of the way through before deciding that I needed to start over so that I could take good notes. I've probably given away 6 or 7 copies of this book in the past month or two."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The basic principle of this book is that it is written by a senior devil, Screwtape, to his nephew, a &quot;junior tempter.&quot; Just the idea that there is a devil specially assigned to tempt each of us to hell is motivating, but there is so much to learn from this slim little book!This is one of my spiritual &quot;mainstays&quot; -- that book I keep returning to or keep quoting. Lewis addresses many of the following (most of which I have never heard mentioned elsewhere): annoying relatives, &quot;sophisticated&quot; friends who look down on Christianity, bravery, folks who may not look like much but may be people of great faith. (As Screwtape writes, &quot;They may be great warriors for the enemy, but the patient only sees the neighborhood grocer.&quot; That's a paraphrase, by the way!)The writing is very clear and not too dense, for those who are just beginning their journey with spiritual reading. At the same time, &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; has a lot to offer those who are more advanced. You'll definitely keep coming back to this one."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"The wonderful thing about C.S. Lewis was that he put an amazing amount of thought into his faith. He understood better than most that becoming a Christian meant constantly trying to understand more, to examine both one's self and one's relationship to God. His penetrating intellegence towards Christianity is something that is often lacking in religion, and every time I read Lewis I learn something new, both about myself and my faith. Lewis is a true master. Another author who I'd highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Lewis, one who explores the Christian faith as brilliantly as Lewis, is Brian Caldwell. His novel, We All Fall Down is breathtaking. I'd put him on a par with Lewis, both for writing ability and theological brilliance. His novel is one of the few Christian masterpieces. Both Lewis and Caldwell should be read by those who have discovered God and want to explore that faith as deeply as possible, and perhaps more importantly, by those who have not."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"I first read this book maybe 30 years ago. While its truths have probably helped me understand life better, it wasn't my favorite of Lewis' books. Maybe I felt some of the same ambiguity Lewis himself expressed about thinking from the perspective of the devil -- maybe I overdosed on Marx in college.A few months ago, though, I found the Screwtape tape in a local library. I don't know how much a compliment it is to say John Cleese makes a great devil, but he really does. He brings Lewis' brilliant insights to life all over again.Screwtape is not a detailed philosophical argument. As Lewis says, a non-Christian can read the book with profit if he takes premise as an entirely literary device. One reviewer complains that he does not understand why God wants us to pray if he already knows what we think. Lewis actually answers this objection in Mere Christianity. A recent reviewer claims that Lewis makes \\"intellectual inquiry\\" out to be a sin, and that no one with a college education will find this worthwhile. That's silly. Taking his ideas with me to college, graduate school, and professional study of world religions, the \\"Jesus Seminar,\\" and skepticism, I found his works the best possible preparation for understanding the most prestigious currents of modern human thought.Lewis does not \\"prove\\" Christianity in this book; that is not his purpose. But neither does he \\"take it as a matter of (blind) faith.\\" Lewis understood that Christian faith rests on reason, and gives reasons in other books; but what he does here, brilliantly, is reveal how devious not the devil, but we humans can be, giving a comic and deeply enlightening tour of the many subtle ways we rationalize, are lazy, hate, and deceive ourselves. Of Lewis' books, Great Divorce and Till We Have Faces probably come closest as docudramas of ground zero in the human soul.Those who enjoy Screwtape Letters should read J. Budziszewski's What We Can't Not Know. His arguments on natural law may even surpass Lewis in content, if not style."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"One of the greatest minds of the 20th Century exposes the greatest Evil of all time. \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" is C. S. Lewis' masterfield expos&egrave; of Satan--the False Seducer--and his insidious, diabolical schemes and temptations.Screwtape is a senior demon training his nephew, Wormwood, in the finer arts of infiltrating and influencing, for evil, the human mind, heart, and soul. Letter by letter, point by point, as Lewis pens the imagined correspondence between these two demons, you feel as if Lewis has stepped inside your soul and listened to the secret musings of your mind.How? How did Lewis gain access to the process of spiritual seduction? The same way the great saints of old did--through knowing God, knowing self, and knowing Scripture. This trilogy of epistemological awareness is essential for understanding the schemes of Satan. Combined, they allowed Lewis to penetrate into the inner workings of his soul, and ours.If you want company along your spiritual journey, if you want to feel like, \\"Wow, others have felt and thought and experienced this, too!\\" then read \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\"Reviewer: Dr. Robert W. Kellemen is the author of \\"Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" \\"Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" and the forthcoming, \\"Sacred Companions: A History of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\""},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"According to C.S. Lewis, The Screwtape Letters was both \\"easy and distasteful\\" to write. The Screwtape Letters is a collection of letters written by Screwtape (a senior demon) to his nephew Wormwood (a junior demon). The letters chronicle Screwtape's advice in how to seduce the patient (the individual that Wormwood is assigned) to \\"the Father Below\\" (the Devil) for eternal damnation. The correspondence is exclusively from Screwtape to Wormwood, and it gives the reader a \`fly on the wall' view of the tricks that are employed to eternally win the patient's soul. The story starts off with the patient giving his life to \`the Enemy' (God) and the subsequent letters deal with ensuring damnation for the patient. Through the series of letters, Screwtape uses a variety of ways to secure the patient - sex, alcohol, war, religion among others to win the patient's soul. While the author does not divulge on how he \`stumbled' onto the letters, the author C.S. Lewis makes it clear in the preface that the letters do provide insight into the Devil's workings.The Screwtape Letters is perhaps one of the most thought-provoking novels that I have ever read. The author's use of the epistolary novel (a literary technique in which a novel is composed as a series of letters, though diary entries, newspaper clippings and other documents) provides the reader with a difficult chore of trying to figure out what is going on. The letters do not have any date, and while reading there is noticeably times when letters are not in chronological order (the author does acknowledge this) which makes it difficult to follow. Nevertheless, I believe that C.S. Lewis did a wonderful job in getting the purpose of the book out, the deception of the Devil.The author extended his purpose throughout the letters with a dialogue that is very easy to read and surprisingly fresh. As one reads it is obvious that the letters took place in the early 1940's. The way Screwtape speaks to Wormwood provides the reader with a lesson in \`securing Damnation'. In every letter Screwtape responds (you assume because we never see Wormwood's letters) to Wormwood's updates about the patient. Screwtape's replies are usually very structured, a full of information to support his arguments. For example, Wormwood is dismayed by the patient's decision to join a church, but Screwtape provides instructions for using this to his advantage. Amongst the subjects that Screwtape speaks about is war, and the implications that it could have for the patients soul. Still, the books format presents itself as difficult to read, due to the format which is very different from your average book.All in all, I found The Screwtape Letters to be a delightful read. Not only does the novel provide an \`inside look' into the workings of the Devil, it gives the reader serious though provoking questions about one's on life and struggle with evil. The author's use of theology, however, is subtle enough to make it interesting while capturing the reader's imagination. The reason that I have given this book four stars, is because it is a difficult read. My guess is that the format of the book does provide some problems, but still the book is interesting. I definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This is the first Lewis book that I have read and it made a permanent impression on me. This cut me to the heart when I read this my freshman year in high school. It has also given me hope in my darkest hour.As many know, Lewis engages the reader into a dialogue between two devils, Screwtape and his apprentice, Wormwood. Screwtape gives advice to Wormwood on how to tempt a new Christian.I have read this book several times and am conviced that it is either a perfect witnessing tool, or a tool to build up a young believer. I encourage the matured saint to master the book and become conversant with it, being able to enter into dialogue with Sceptics and young believers."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"My brother bought me this one for Christmas. Beautifully written. This will change the way you look at everyday things. Every believer should read as much C.S. Lewis as possible."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"C.S. Lewis' 'Screwtape Letters' gives true insight on both faith and the human condition.Lewis shows off some of his most inventive story telling in his postal service tale between a Devil(Screwtape) and his nephew (wormwood).This book give perfect insight to the nature of Satan and the hungering forces of evil, while including a refined English charm to his characters. He takes the dark side and adds a bit of hillarity to it; making this a slightly sinister dark comedy and a truely beautiful peice of literature that is both well written and inspirational to its audience.C.S. Lewis' wit, charm and intellect is perfectly reflected in this novel. No wonder it has remained a classic of his writtings."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"Awesome book.I first read &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; in high school. I re-read it every few years (I'm now mid 30's), and I continue to learn from this book.I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This audio version of THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is the third one that I have listened to (the first being a version released by Audio Forum [I don't remember the reader, but I remember that his \\"Screwtape\\" dictated his letters into a tape recorder and that this version began with actual sounds of Hell!] and the other being John Cleese's inspired reading. While I am the first to say that Joss Ackland is a superb actor and that his \\"Screwtape\\" is an excellent reading, I cannot say that his reading keeps me as rivetted as the Cleese version. Mr. Ackland gives his \\"Screwtape\\" a superbly oily and unctuous voice (perfect for a Senior Tempter and Undersecretary of Department of Hell!) and his reading is in itself excellent, but I also have to say (as a Voice Actor myself) that Mr. Ackland is primarily a Stage Actor and not a Voice Actor and his performance does not really ensnare the listener. Still, he does very well, he gives some good emotional nuances to his \\"Screwtape\\" and there's absolutely no doubt that he is thoroughly enjoying himself in the role.Since the Cleese version is mostly out-of-print, then I will recommend the Ackland version, but be SURE that you choose the UNABRIDGED version; after all, THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS should be heard in its entirety!"},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"You've got to read the Screwtape Letters!It's fascinating. The spiritual insights are so rich and deep.You'll never think about spiritual evil the same way again."},{"Title":"The Screwtape letters","review":"This book is about the devil writing a letter to his nephew. His nephew is a beginner of doing evil things and tempting bad things. The nephew's name is Wormwood and the devil's name is Screwtape. Wormwood needs advice frome his uncle, Screwtape of what to do to temp people to do what he wants them to. Screwtape tells Wormwood about what to watch out and what to go for target. As a person reads this book, they should be careful what the devil looks for and what he hates. Screwtape tells Wormwood what to do by writing letters to him. This book is interesting because what C.S. Lewis is saying is true.The setting of this book is probably in Hell, writing to Wormwood. I think my favorite part was when Screwtape explained to him about the temptations of evil is not easy to not do because when people want to do something they want to do but its illegal, they fall into the greatest sin and that is temptation. I get these temptations too by either playing games when I'm not supposed to and other temptations. I like this phrase because I think in my life, temptation is the most sin I lack on. I think that I have to watch out for this sin because it is not good to fall into temptation.i chose to read this book because my teacher and my sister wanted me to read this. When I looked at the pages and the words, I was shocked and didn't want o read, but when I read the first few pages, the book was getting intereasting. As I read this book, I knew I was living my life wrong. This book tells me what to watch out for and what to do to get the devil out of my life.
