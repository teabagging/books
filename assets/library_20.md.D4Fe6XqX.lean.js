She took her time, paced the book well, it felt GREAT to be reading a book from her again that I REALLY enjoyed!I am glad that she took into account that we are not stupid people who will be slaves to an overused formula...however successful.My problems with her last two books was that the story was forced and plagued by scenes that were far too explicit for characters I desperately wanted to be \\"in love\\" not \\"in lust\\" with each other.I am not even sure this is a romance novel...at least not yet. The main characters are plagued with obstacles that make romance at this time impossible...But I do like where it is going and the anticipation is spectacular. At the conclusion of the book I am left with tons of questions and I am absolutely going to buy the next in the series. (Even if the bits with V'lane were treading the slippery slope of tastefulness...its briefness made them easier to tolerate.)I guess in the end if Moning can remember that her previous books were about falling in love and then the great sex will just happen naturally as the story and plot evolves it won't be offensive."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning is a world-building, story-telling genius! Her FEVER series consists of 5 books: Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever and Shadowfever. The first book sets the stage for the most incredible, wild roller coaster between good and evil, human and fae, life and death, damnation and salvation, ruin and redemption. MacKayla Lane starts her journey as a pampered, pink-loving, 20-something Southern blonde, who travels to Ireland to investigate her sister's murder. When she arrives, she learns that she and her sister were born to an ancient line of women called sidhe-seers, who see and battle fae. She walks a tightrope of alliances with druids, fae (good and evil), local law enforcement and other sidhe-seers, and discovers her dark-side in the process. Will she be able to help keep the walls up between Earth and Fairy? Will she learn to embrace the darkness? Read the series and learn!I am not the kind of person to write a review, unless I believe something is over-the-top excellent. I have recommended the FEVER series to MANY friends and colleagues, and to a person, they all become as addicted to the storyline as I have! Well, maybe not - I own the whole series in both hard cover and paperback now. :-) I've read the whole series twice, and I'm sure I'll read it again in the near future! I promise you, you will NOT be disappointed with your purchase! Just make sure you read them all in order, as the tension - and Mac's knowledge - increase throughout each. You're lucky - you can read the whole series of books back-to-back. I waited with baited breath for the release of each one as it was released!Enjoy! And stay to the lights!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Book one of five. Much to Karen Moning's distress, this series has been labeled as romance. It is not. This is a paranormal book/series with characters who evolve as events progress. This is my favorite series by far. Main character does not start out in leather, killing everything with ease and uber powers. She starts out as a barbie from the South who's sister is murdered while attending school in Ireland. There will be romance, but not till book five :) Which comes out in Jan 2011!!! Wonderful community of fellow Moning Maniac book lovers on Karen's website. Wondering what something means? [...] If you love the emotional attachment, to either love or hate a character, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I know nothing about the author's other works. I see most of the author's fans are female. I don't read romance novels much. I walked into reading Darkfever with no expectations. It's a good book. Complaints about Mac are misplaced. She's cute and also sexy. Her first-person narrative voice is appealing. She's a woman who finds herself going through a well-developed and dangerous urban fantasy world. Whether she's lounging by the pool, getting spooked, disbelieving her eyes, melting from alien charisma, or battling, she's plausible all the way. Sure, her concerns are shallow but that's the point. She's a fish out of water. She's used to hanging by the pool and listening to tunes, tending bar, dancing . . . but she's got to save the world - or at least Dublin. There's a lot of clever invention here. The use of Dublin is effective as well.It's a fun book. The heroine is often in peril, but her ultimate survival never feels in doubt. Her sister is dead, and she cries a river for her, but the clever and effective author doesn't reach a sort of deep and authentic, throbbing pain. Fun's good. Drama without really wrenching pain is fine. You'll definitely keep turning the pages to follow Mac's adventure. Also, the developing relationship with her partner in crime adds another element of suspense. All-in-all it's an accomplished and fun work.One of my favorite urban fantasy books is Scent of Shadows. If you like Mac, you'll like Scent of Shadows as well. There's a passion to the writing in Scent of Shadows, and a depth of emotion in it, that transcends the urban fantasy genre. Another great book that is filled with passion is the mystery \\"The Wounded Man.\\" Both \\"Scent of Shadows\\" and \\"The Wounded Man\\" are able to connect to some sort of subterranean source of shocking emotion, turning each of those novels into compelling works. I read them both pretty long ago, and I've read tons of Kindle books since then, but they stay with me. Don't get me wrong, they're genre novels and not high-brow literature. Yet they are steeped in real emotional contact between the reader and the characters. Darkfever isn't infused with that level of passion even when dealing with the erotic fae or the grief of loss. A certain emotional distance remains in the book despite the first-person narrative. It's terrifically inventive. It's writing is accomplished, and it's full of intriguing concepts. Also, the situation is rife with drama and action. It's good."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Give me fever in the morning and fever all through the night! The Fever Series! Love KMM's style. Incredible characters, great plot, lots of action. I can't believe my luck that I did not hear about this series until this month thus missing the frustration with the cliffhangers and the long wait between books. I read all 4 and only have less than 2 months for the final story. I like this series so much that I will do a first ever event and buy a hardback new release. Loved this series so much that I actually visited the discussion boards for the first time and now I have a new list of authors I want to read. Thanks Amazon for this service. Thanks KMM for the entertainment!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Mackayla Lane goes to Ireland to find her sister's murderer. She ends up living in a bookstore with Jericho Barrons, helping him find a powerful book. To make matters worse, she confronted by a \\"death-by-sex\\" Fae, Vlane, who adds humiliation to her emotional ride abroad.I loved this book. It had everything: action, mystery, paranormal, and even a little bit of romance...a little bit....more like a hint of a possible romance. There were moments that had me laughing out loud. The contrast between Mac and Barrons made their relationship much more interesting to read. The bickering that went on between the two of them was hilarious. I just wish that the hint of romance would have turned into something more. Hopefully in the following books, their relationship will grow.The action was thrilling and suspenseful. I read the book in one day-I couldn't stop reading. I absolutely LOVED it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"(This review was originally posted at VampireBookClub.net)I have heard friends, Goodreads pals and fellow bloggers opine on the wonders of Karen Marie Moning's Fever series and how the Barrons character will make any woman weak in the knees. Then I was advised to wait to start the series until November, so I wouldn't die in anticipation of the final book's release (Shadowfever comes out in January). So, let's just say I went into this one with very high expectations.And, early on, I didn't get the big deal. But I kept reading Darkfever, and before I knew it I was roped into Moning's witty writing and engaging characters. I get it. (Though, the way people talk about Barrons I expected romance in the first book -- there is none. He's just really insanely alpha and sexy.)In this urban fantasy page-turner, we meet MacKayla. She's heading to Ireland from Georgia because her sister -- who had been studying abroad -- was murdered and the Dublin police aren't doing a damn thing. Her plan is to find evidence to get them to open the case. She is determined to find her sister's killer. Unfortunately, all she has to go on is a cryptic voicemail mentioning a phrase she doesn't understand and a whole lot of panic.What follows is her decent into the world of the fae. Not the pretty faeries of Disney movies, but cruel beings who think themselves better than humans. Mac is a sidhe seer, or one who can see though faery glamour, only she doesn't understand it. This is where the brusque Jericho Barrons comes in. He'll teach her about the fae, if she'll help him in his own mission.And she's going to need his help, not only to find her sister's murder, but to stay alive. Dark faeries are escaping an Unseelie prison and arriving in Dublin. People are dying and her sister may just have been the latest casualty.The wry tone of our protagonist keeps the dark fantasy in Darkfever from weighing on the reader. With constant danger, overwhelming new experiences and a bold \`other' world, it is near impossible to put Darkfever down once you're acquainted with MacKayla.(And, yes, I plan to devour the whole Fever series before January. I can already see why it's so addictive.)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I absolutely LOVE this series!!! I am impatiently waiting for the last one to be released, a MUST read !!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"So far I have really enjoyed this series. Fantasy and so many hints and temptations of romance, keeps you wanting to read more, just to see if she falls into who's arms! A Great read!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is another one of the many series that I have read this summer and, as the rest of them, it is excellent. I love the female main character and I absolutely think that the male characters are awesome as well. At the beginning of this first volume you don't know what to expect of the argument but it becomes better and better. An absolute page turn over. I couldn't stop reading all the series and I've preordered the next and last one. Another must read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I grabbed the Kindle version of this book. I have to say it was very well written. I like the flow, and main character is likable and believable. I would be happy to give this book 5 stars and buy the rest of the series except I did not care for the scenes between Mac and the \\"death by sex\\" Fae. I can only assume there will be more like that in future books. Its a shame to because if those scenes were cut from the story it would not hurt the story at all, would not have even been missed. Reading on the authors web site tells me she plans more of that in future, so I will move on.This is my first book I have read by this author, so I assume this is typical for her.Again, her writing is great, and it is a great tale, so if you do not mind being in the mid of a young girl as she deals with a \\"death by sex\\" Fae, then you might really enjoy these books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book sets the stage for a really amazing story. I started this novel and almost didn't move on to the next, because, as many people have noted, the main character seems like a spoiled brat. It's intentionally that you don't really like her in the beginning, because she turns into a more developed interesting character as the series continues. Part of the draw of this book is seeing the transformation or all the characters: how circumstance changes them and how they affect each other. I have to applaud Karen Moning for this story because everything in it is intentional and it eventually comes full circle. So even if you don't like this book, try the next one, and by the third you will be completely sucked into this world and emotionally invested in the characters."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Despite my aversion to reading Urban Fantasy and first person narrative, I love stories rooted in druid and faerie legend so out of deference to Karen M. Moning's outstanding Highlanders series when I saw a copy of Dark Fever on the free shelf at the library, I decided to give the author's Fever series a try.Moning's plot premise of fae magic is intriguing; however, her female protagonist is anything but. I was far more intrigued by the enigmatic Jerricho Barrons and the mysterious fae, V'lane. Terry Brooks' Shannara series is far superior fantasy series of druid/mystical world-building and storytelling.The motivation behind stretching this thin story into five books and hawking Fever trinkets on the author's web page is to market these books as a potential script treatment. Mac certainly comes across as a dense, self-centered Buffy/Sookie Stackhouse-esque character who is simply bestowed with super powers.So far, I feel compelled to finish reading this the series since it is incomplete but I have no desire to invest in the books. I only read subsequent books when they are available at library and feel no compulsion to write a review for Faefever, Bloodfever, or Dreamfever, inasmuch as narrator and protagonist Mac shows very little promise of growth or maturity and the storyline only grows darker.I just hope that Mac doesn't end up with Christian...this D-student and southern hick has no place among the intelligent, witty, educated MacKeltar women."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I like this series - really, I do. I like Ms. Moning's writing style, I like the heroine, the mysterious Jericho, the story itself. But I cannot stand this \\"series\\" format. There is no real ending to any of the books - the \\"endings\\" are more akin to the close of a chapter. What a letdown. I started reading the first book knowing it was a series and I was fine with it, looked forward to it actually. I hate saying goodbye to characters I've grown fond of at the end of books. My first \\"series\\" was the Twilight series and from there, I read the Southern Vampire series (Charlaine Harris), the Mercy Thompson series and the Alpha/Omega books (Patricia Briggs). The books in each of those series actually end. A complete story is finished. Not so with this Fever series. The books don't end, they barely pause. I think this story - that now spands 4 books - should not have been piecemealed out to us the way it has been. I see no reason why it shouldn't have been in one publication. (Can you imagine breaking up Stephen King's The Stand into 5 books?) I've gone on with the series, despite my dislike of the \\"series\\" approach, because I really do like the story and the characters, and I do enjoy Ms. Moning's writing style. But I dont know that I'll buy any more of her \\"series\\" books. Too frustrating."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really liked the plot of this book, but I could only give it three stars because the main female character just a little too \\"whiny\\"."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Gosh - so I go into this series thinking it is a continuation of the Highlander series (as I was told on the Amazon blog) and I disappointed. I read this first book, and nothing was resolved, I read the back of the second book and realized nothing was resolved then, I read the back of the 3rd book, and alas.....still nothing resolved. I agree with a very early review that this series shouldn't be read until the series is over. I equate this series of books to Lynn Kurland's recent series or maybe a push to put herself (Karen) in the avenue of Diana Gabladon.Regardless, it's highly unlikely I'll continue the series. I have the first 3 books and may or may not decide to read them."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"First, the story seems up to par, at least as much of it as there was. It seems to me there was barely time to develop any characters before the book waived goodbye until next time.So this story goes on for 4 more books? If they're all this lenght they could easily be combined into 2 or 3 books and we would have something substantial to read. I read this on a 3 hour plane ride, and I'm a slow reader. But why sell 2 books for $50 when you can sell 5 for $100. Please, Karen, consider combining these and give us a BOOK and not a teaser."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As a LONG time romance reader, I've found myself a bit bored with the lack of quality books out there. I have a few long time favorite authors, including Karen Marie Moning, that hold my interest and keep me coming back for more.Most fans of Ms. Moning's work knew going into Darkfever that it was not a traditional romance novel (thank God). It's the first part of a series. It lays groundwork and introduces characters for what I'm sure will be an incredible love story.A previous reviewer implied it was nothing more than glorified pornography. I'd like to invite that person to look up the word pornography in the dictionary.pornography (pr-ngr-f)n.Sexually explicit pictures, writing, or other material whose primary purpose is to cause sexual arousal.I'm fairly certain Ms. Moning did not spend months, if not years, researching the thoughts, ideas and places of this novel just so people could get their jollies from two people having sex. While her novels to usually include well written, erotic love scenes between people who love each other, this book had no place for that.I hope eveyone will give this book a chance and read it for what it is... the first part of a story that promises to keep us on he edge of our seats, unable to be put down, until we finally reach the end, in which case, some of us will start right back at the beginning and read it again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"WOW - I'm so absolutely excited for this new series! Do you ever simply devour a GREAT book and then sit back and wish the book were longer, because you cannot believe you've reached the end of such an amazing adventure?Well , I think Ms. Moning is going to give us just THAT with her new series - a chance to prolong the magic and the excitement of discovering a new world, amazing characters and their adventures. If you're a book nut like me, you'll probably develop a love-hate relationship with this series, between loving the fact that there's more to look forward to and hating the wait for the next installment. (remember The Lord of the Rings? Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series? Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series? even the Harry Potter books?)DARKFEVER is the beginning of the tales of the Unseelie Fae, whereas Moning's Highlander books explored the Seelie Fae. Much Darker and gritty in nature, this adventure begins with a happy and naiive young woman's world shattering into a thousand pieces by the mysterious murder of her sister. Caught between her desire to discover what happened to her sister and her own coming-out (from a sheltered and happy world), everything, as Mac knew it, is about to be turned upside down...In her quest to learn about her sisters death, Mac discovers things several lifetimes couldn't have prepared her for. Logic and normalcy become and alternate reality, as she gradually pieces together a world that very much EXISTS parallel to the one she grew up in. It is in this new world, that she meets Jericho Barrons. Jericho is a mysterious character who at first glance appears helpful, but getting to know him and learning more about exactly who/what he is, sets Mac on her path of acquiring street-smarts in the world of Fae...I devoured it fast, and simply had to go back and savor each and every detail, that I know I will want to know and remember for the unforlding of this saga!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so looking forward to this and had to wait on it from the library for 2 months. What a disappointment. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS BOOK! It's shameful an author would publish a work such as this for loyal fans and not feel massive guilt. There was NO romance, NO climax, NO resolution, NO satifying ending. I agree to what another reviewer said: Wait until all 5 books are published and read them back-to-back as one book. Individually, at least this first book, was more like one long chapter. What a let down. Shame, Shame, Shame."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love karen Moning books, however I did not know it was going to be told in the first person and not even having my favorite, previous characters, was not enough to warrant the purchase of the fourth book. I do not like clift hangers, especially when it takes so long for the next book to hit the shelves. Nothing really makes any sense and I am familar with the fey realm. This series was borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring and a waste of hard covers prices. It should have been free from the onset. Take a tip from other series writers. They give some closure but you know there is more to come without frustration."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"To add to what others have said, the story concept is intriguing, but the heroine, Mac, is not. Mac is a twenty-something, but a mental and emotional pre-teen. Starting as a mystery, the story quickly evolves into a horror fest with erotic twists. Mac goes to Ireland to push the investigation surrounding her sister's death, since it seems to have burned out. Then, like Alice, she falls down the rabbit hole by taking a wrong turn in Dublin to enter an underworld where a battle between evil and not-so-evil? is taking place. She discovers she has special powers, can not figure out who the good and bad guys really are, and, as others have said enters a strained relationship with Barrons, some kind of dark prince. There is a lot of ambiguity in the story and characters, with no clear ending. Mac does seem to mature a bit toward the end, thank God, or I would have had to stop reading the book. Overall, the novelty of the story and descriptions of fae kept me interested to finish the book and even read the follow up story, where hopefully our heroine will act her age."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I haven't read romance novels since I was a teenager, when my grandmother lent me a mystery collection that included the gothic romances of Victoria Holt. That said, I am guessing that the dark, dangerous, enigmatic man whom the heroine fears but who is really in love with her is a romance novel convention. Ditto for the occasionally explicit sexual reactions of the heroine. None of it kept me from enjoying the dark fantasy elements of the story, which is set in Dublin, a city I had visited just a few weeks before reading Darkfever. I finished the novel in a few sittings. It was pleasant entertainment of the cotton-candy variety."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning's books has NEVER failed me before, but NOW it has!The first person plott leaves you guessing what the heck is going on & what everyone else is thinking. Mac is awfully chatty, not neccessarily a bad thing, but in this case, distracting & off subject at times. The sex scenes are all about lust with no romance, making them cheap & distastefull.I ordered this book presale, w/o really knowing what the plott was & now I wished I had waited till I could have gotten it from a used book store.I normally don't read first person but it was JMM book(need I say more). My opinion dramatically changed after reading this book. There is not much romance to it & the ending left me pretty dissatisfied. Not dissaisfied as in I going to buy the next book to find out what the heck is going on but dissatisfied as in I am pissed at how this plott is going & probably won't buy one of her books new - either going to the library or used book store.Nora Roberts usually have her series within a month apart & KMM's books has a history of taking a while to produce so not only do we lose the feel of the story but also the interest. My advice, buy one of her older books (preferably 'Spell of a Highlander') if you haven't read it already. I guess you could be brave & read the next in series but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers on the character (or lack thereof) of the 'heroine', Mac.This book is a stream-of-consciousness rambling for the Twitter generation. Every vapid thought this girl has comes swarming onto the page, often more than once. I also agree with the reviewer who said Mac encompasses the worst of Bella and Sookie. Despite Sookie's endless self-absorption and the irrelevant \\"what I am wearing today\\", I do enjoy the Stackhouse books for a fast, fun, fantasy read. I managed the first 2 Twilights before giving up on Bella as a mindless idiot with no self-will (although at least she did not endlessly describe her outfits and how gorgeous she was). But Mac! Mac is the shallowest, most irritating protagonist ever and I do hope, really do hope, that she does NOT become the role model for any young girl.I got about a third of the way through and gave up on this with a sigh of relief. I only stuck it out that long because the concept seemed interesting and I hoped it would better. It didn't.Despite some one-star reviewers saying they liked the Highlander series, based on this awful effort I am not inclined to try any more of Ms Moning's other books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed the book, really I did! I will even buy the next installment, but not for $20.00. I will wait and can wait, if the 2nd installment comes out in hardback, for the paperback version! Just my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this start to a new way of looking at Ms. Moning's universe. Personally, I like it when we get to know a character over a longer period AND when all the loose ends aren't tied up into a \\"happily ever after\\" in 350 pages. The book had mystery without answers obviously staring you in the face. Her best work so far! I look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Having read all 5 books of this series, which I now regret even though I got them all from the library, I will save anyone in the future from wasting their time. Don't read this series. She will drag you through 5 books of repetitive drivel that leads no where. The first two books are interesting enough to get you hooked and then the last three just ramble around in circles. She throws in a shocking gang rape and then continue to bring it up as if it was supposed to be some kind of character building experience for the main character. By the ending you will see there was no reason to even have it in the book and it was that point that changed the story's credibility and went downhill from there. That alone is a good enough reason not to read these books, but the rest of the storyline is all over the map and never comes together nor does it build to any finale. Boredom will set in after book two, and you will wonder why you are bothering to continue. By the end of the series, you will be so bored you just don't care anymore, which will come in handy since the ending doesn't end or resolve anything. The main character in the book is no hero and she is just as whiney and clueless at the end as she is at the beginning.There are plenty of decent authors out there that can write books that are worth reading. This author isn't one of them. I will never waste my time on her again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is well written, but an absolutely miserable series. I would sell mine, but I bought it for my Kindle. What a waste of money!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am not familiar with the author or her previous romance work, so unlike some I didn't care that this was obviously not a romance novel. The authors style of writing and turns of phrase and very readable. I really liked the way she worded some of her descriptions as well. And her Mythos was awesome and thought out. However, I have to wonder if it would have been a better story if Mac had died and Alina were in her place. *sigh* I'm not a pink fan as it is, but I dislike it even more after having read this. and how many times a day can one paint their nails? And, uh, you're going 4000 miles from home and you're packing HOW many polishes? Seriously, I found her so annoying I was hoping Barrons would just snap her neck and be done with it. Had SOMETHING been tied up I probably wouldn't have found the cliffhanger so annoying but as it was nothing was made very clear so I was left feeling cold. I probably won't be picking up any of the rest of the series unless I catch it at a very bargain price."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this book, but had to struggle through it. I agree with another reviewer - how dumb can a heroine be. Come on - no one is that clueless except in the movies. It makes one wonder what the author really thinks about women - obviously not much. The heroine is stupid, careless, and an idiot, and I don't believe anyone would really act the way she did. I was really disappointed in this latest book, and I don't think I'm going to read any more of the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, I picked it up expecting a great mystery/romance story. Once I started reading I was annoyed with the main character immediately with her love for pink-everything was pink. Once they introduced Barrons-who I am expecting at some point to be her love interest-I was hoping the story would get better, but it didn't. He refers to her as Ms. Lane (her last name) every other sentence, after a while he started to annoy me as well. I will read the next book in hopes of seeing why so many people love this series. I just wasn't impressed with the first book, I hope my view of this series changes because I really did want to like it. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't terrible and I was able get through the book and didn't just put it down without getting to the ending."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read the entire series, and I gotta say- fantastic. Fantastic plot, fantastic character development, fantastic writing, and fantastic originality. I am a voracious reader of the urban fantasy/paranormal romance genre and books in general so when I say the story is completely original and different from every other urban fantasy series, I have some experience to go by. I really, REALLY didn't want this series to end (although the author ended it beautifully). In fact, I would LOVE to see the author begin another series that centers on the stories of Jericho's men.I can't say enough how awesome it was to see a fully formed character grow and evolve throughout the series. Not only that, but it was SO refreshing to read a book in which the love interest is not the cliched gorgeous, perfect-in-every-way mate. Life isn't always like that, and I loved that the author didn't go down that route with Mac and Jericho's romance.Really, REALLY loved this series. And I really, REALLY hope the author does a series on Jericho's men."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved the first book in the Fever series!! The only thing that would have made this book better is if some areas had been edited a little more; to avoid the superfluous paragraphs here and there with Mac's repetitive thoughts. Otherwise the story is thrilling and hints at a romance. Barrons and Mac's interactions were comical and sassy, leaving you wanting more; I found myself wondering if the tension between the two of them would lead to something as I read quickly through this book. I would suggest reading all of the books one after the other as they are quick reads and since each book really melts into the next. You will defimitely feel like this book leaves an open ending so having the next book available is a good idea."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I first had the sample, read it and deleted it!

Give her a try these are my new fav series!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"If you like the Sookie series, you're going to love the Fever series. It's more grown up that Twilight and better written. It sucks you in and you do not want to put a book down!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The whole series is just a huge cliffhanger. If I could send myself a message in the past, I would warn myself not to start reading it.I loved it for so many reasons: finally the older-than-life-on-earth characters act and speak according to their age (and makes the heroes of a lot of poplar series seem juvenile). I didn't mind the initial pinkness of the heroine - she was fun, and the story from her perspective was gripping and smartly told. This is one of those authors whose shopping list I would enjoy reading so, from this point of view, this book was such a treat!And the fact that she doesn't draw the line between good and evil. Even the bad ones have motivations that lead me to think I could have done the same. I love this in a book!But then comes Barrons. There are a lot of entries on the popular romance blogs about people who, after reading the series, can't take him out of their minds, can't find anything that can cure them from the addiction he creates. I subscribe. It's like a drug and at the end you don't receive the antidote. Not only the end of this book (which, honestly, in it's content it's like the first two chapters of a normal one), but the whole 5.An then are the cliffhangers: the lack of satisfaction they provide - instead of a happy-ending you're left wanting more. And the last book, that delivers thousands of other questions. I never had a love/hate relationship but this book is close to it.One more thing: if you're looking for hot scenes from her romance novels, there are none for you here.Sometimes I feel like giving it one star and write a message to the author to go find another job. This tease is not fair. Other times I admit that the other two series I couldn't get out of are Lord of the Rings and Dune - and I'm glad to live in the same time as Karen Moning. As I said, love&hate.; And hope."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"A friend introduced me to this series and I fell in love immediately. My husband and children missed me for a few days while I read the first 4 books. I would start reading when I woke up and wouldn't stop til I could no longer hold my eyes open, then start over the next day. I anxiously awaited the 5th and final book for the series for over a year, and it felt like an eternity. Right after Shadowfever, the 5th book, was released, the author, Karen, had a book signing and discussion where she answered questions the fans had about the series in Atlanta, which I was able to attend. She was the sweetest person. Then soon after that a group of fans had a lunch together and she showed up. She was more than happy to sign the books for those who hadn't had the chance to make it a signing. She stuck around for a while and socialized, we got have pictures with her. It was really nice and personal. Karen has always taken a personal interest in her fans. This series keeps you on edge the entire time. There isn't a dull moment. Now I am awaiting her next series. The first book is supposed to be released hopefully some time next year and I cannot wait!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Just finished Shadowfever, book 5 in the Fever series, and felt compelled to come back to address new readers of book 1.

(all five books). I will say that the first book Darkfever is probably the most annoying and the slowest out of all of the books in the series, but i say that out of love because it was captivating enough to keep me reading, and it got better and better. I loved the second book better than the first, i loved the third book better than the second, etc. An unfolding masterpiece.This series is a page turner and can be read by people (like me) that don't typically even identify with romance or science fiction/fantasy.

Moning crafted a gem with the first book of this series. She takes you brilliantly through the main character's disbelief in all things Fae so you're not going this journey alone. Mac is smart, sassy and endearingly human with mistakes and weaknesses and plenty of non-stellar moments... the kinship you sense to such a sister brings this magical story more alive so you can suspend that disbelief and inhale the intriguing plot Moning wafts around you! She will challenge your deepest thoughts on good and evil, how you define yourself between these polarities. What do you hear and what do you see? Upon which do you base your beliefs? Love the story, delve as deeply as you wish. Just join me up on the limb. It's worth the climb!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I admit I've been going between 4 and 5 stars on this one. I ultimately decided on 5 because I think the little things that annoyed me weren't bad enough to knock of an entire star. Here's what I liked:Mac is a pretty fun character. Annoyingly stereotypical blonde girly-girl at times (think Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde), she also stood up for herself and wasn't afraid to get in anybody's face who got in her way (namely sexy and mysterious Barrons). All in all, MacKayla is a fun character. You could actually see her development, both outward and inward, over the course of the story, and I look forward to seeing where she goes from here. Barrons' domineering manner commands attention. We know pretty much nothing about him except that he is mysterious, sexy, rich, and dangerous. Enough to keep us interested? Definitely.I like how the Fae are portrayed in this book. Though we don't know a lot about them yet, they are interesting in how they work and their background. I'm intrigued enough to want to know more about them. I enjoyed the author's writing style. The setting is serious, yet the book is not dark with just the right amount of humor (mostly from Mac) thrown in.Now, what I didn't like: Really, it was small things. Mac did some pretty stupid things sometimes, enough to make me actually cringe. And the fact that, although the book was full of action, nothing really happened. This book was a setup for the rest of the series, but there was nothing in this book that came to a conclusion. However, I gave it 5 stars because, as I said above, those two small things don't cancel out everything I liked about the book.I listened to the audio of Darkfever. The narration was good in every way except when she did Barrons' voice; that made me cringe every time. I think she was going for sexy but ended up raspy and kind of creepy. Anyway, I have books 2-5 already cued up on my iPod waiting for me, so off I go to #2!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was first introduced to the FEVER series by my friend and fellow author Amber Lynn Natusch. I'd seen it advertised here and there, but had never looked into it. Amber raved about its twists, turns, and how everything fit together in surprising ways. That kind of book speaks to me, so I read the synopsis. Urban fantasy where the protagonist is drawn into the dark world of the fae. Count me in.I load it up on my Kindle (yeah, I read everything on Kindle these days), and on page two, I'm greeted to the following:\\"The Seelie and Unseelie have been smearing their bloody war all over our world since her disappearance, and although some might say I'm being broody and pessimistic, I think the Unseelie are gaining the distinct upper hand over their fairer brethren.\\"Yeah, this is going to be one of those stay up until 2am reading it books, huh?Yes. It was.This prologue did kind of prime me for something a little different than I expected. In a typical urban fantasy, the fantasy part is unknown to common people. This made it sound like some kind of post-apocalyptic world, although in reality, our narrator, Mac, is only hinting at things to come, as she does throughout the book.Mac's a spunky little hero from small town Georgia, off to explore the seedy side of Dublin after her sister is murdered there. What she doesn't expect (and who would?) is to get tied up in a struggle between the Unseelie and the Seelie. She can see them for what they are, which does not make them happy.Moning takes classic Irish myths, like the Gray Man, and applies wicked, grotesque twists to them. Her description of this creature, of the way it sucks the beauty and life from a girl, allows us to feel Mac's horror as we are forced to watch right alongside her.I loved this novel quite a lot, but there were some world-building decisions I'm on the fence on. One, I won't spoil because I don't want to give anything away. The other... I'm reading along in the story about the fae, about sidhe-seers, about Irish and Scottish mythology. I'm comfortable. Or at least I'm enjoying the inherent discomfort in the otherworldliness of the fae. And then, out of the blue, a vampire (and I don't mean a type of fae like the leanan sidhe). Yeah, not unusual for urban fantasy, right? But it feels out of place here. Maybe it's just me.That said, Moning handles every moment expertly. We never quite know who Mac can trust, and where she's going to be led astray, but thanks to the foreshadowing, we know Really Bad Things are coming.Not yet convinced to give this urban fantasy a try? Let me leave you with this quotation to help you out:\\"The way I saw it, what Barrons had just told me was this: A Faery not only wouldn't care whether I lived or died, it wouldn't even really register that I was dead, just that, before, I could walk and talk and change my clothes by myself, but afterward I couldn't, as if someone had yanked the batteries out of me.It occurred to me that I could really learn to hate the Fae.\\"I give DARKFEVER 5 phoenix hatchlings. Moning has an ebook box set for the whole series coming out soon, and that's definitely on my wish list."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After Mac's sister is murdered in Dublin, Mac travels to Ireland without her parents' blessing. Soon after arriving there she meets mysterious Jericho Barrons, and learns that there's whole other world hidden in there. Mac discovers she's sidhe-seer; someone who can see through fay's glamour. She can also sense powerful fae objects and Barrons sees an opportunity to find the book he's after.I've heard so much about these books and about Barrons that I finally craved in and started reading. It seems like I'm the last one to read these but oh well...I liked the Ireland setting and Dublin's darkness which was, thankfully, the opposite of Mac's character. For me the biggest problem with the book was Mac. When the book starts she's this, nave, not-so-bright, I love all things pink-bright-fluffy-rainbows-clothes-makeup kind of girl that I wouldn't want to be locked in the same room with. The kind who nearly gets driven over by a car and the first thing is if your hair looks good. It just made her sound little shallow and there was just too much telling what kind of nail polish she uses and stuff.Also the book is told by first person Mac, but by Mac in the future. She would tell these annoying hindsight things that got old very quickly.Or so I thought. It would turn out to be just one more of those things I was wrong about. Soon, we would be living inside each other's pockets, whether we liked it or not.And believe you me, we didn't. pg. 75Believe you me? I certainly won't but apparently the editor does.I've been reading so much about Mac and Barrons and I was waiting to see some attraction between them but nada. Nothing. I guess that's for later books. I didn't hate Barrons but I didn't see that something that everyone else seems to see.All in all the book was enjoyable but not great. But I'm curious enough to see if that will change in future books to read more."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Can't wait to read the next one! characters are real and easy to get attached to.

It is never an easy thing to do. It is one of the distinguishing characteristics between survivors and victims. Letting go of what was, to survive what is.\\"MacKayla Lane is living the perfect life. She has a perfect family, perfect frie4nds, and a perfect job. But that is all about to change...When the sudden news of her sister's death brings her life crashing down Mac is intent on finding her killer. To follow the path she must travel to Ireland and discover the life her sister had there. What she isn't prepared is for the truths she is about to discover on her journey. A journey in the dangerous realm of the Fae isn't what Perfect Mac expected. She especially didn't expect to have to seek help from the one person that is making her life a living hell, Jericho Barron's.Jericho is a mysterious man that doesn't' have time for nonsense or helping anyone but himself. When Barron's has no other choice but to help Mac he quickly learns a lesson in compassion. Or at least in sociability. Mac isn't about to let Barrons' control her and her actions in any way.When they both discover that Mac is much more vital to their survival, the two must work together to find out the answers to their questions.But will following the trail lead to their ultimate demise?I have to say that this book was a little hard to get into at the beginning. Mac was not the kind of character that I can put up with but the action and other characters made up for it. When Mac suddenly transforms from a spoiled rich kid to a kick ass protag the story begins to make a turn for the better.Her stubbornness makes Barron's temper flare and it was hilarious to read. Barron's is one tough cookie to crack, and even though at the end he still is, you can't help but like the fact that he's pretty much a real bad ass.All in all, this book was good.

SO while waiting for some of my new young adult books to arrive...I decided to give it a try. Well....I am soooo happy I did. I loved this book from the beginning to end. I immediately adored the main character, Mac, from the very beginning. She is quirky, funny, strong, and independent She is the perfect heroine. Moning's writing style is just beautiful. She really embraces her characters and you feel and understand what they are going through.The story begins with the death of Mac's sister which causes Mac to go to Ireland (where her sister was killed) and try to discover the truth. The police are no help..they have no leads so she takes matters into her own hands. I love her ferocity and her will to survive. She faces everything with little to no fear and even when she does..she overcomes it against all odds.I also truly liked the \\"other\\" character, Barrons. I am not sure what to call him yet...I have a feeling more will be told in the next part in the series. He is very mysterious and of course HOT...lol..I look forward to trying to discover what his secrets are.Mac ends up not only searching for her sister's killer but also searching for her true heritage.

The fey are interesting as hell, as are most of the characters (though the main character starts out as a sickening powderpuff of naive, prudish and sunshiney poodle-primped deeply southern hottie-belle,) and the suspense and mystery just keep building as it goes. I do have a quibble with a particular ability of Mac's that gives her an advantage over fey (besides being able to sense and see them) because it seems like a hastily devised and unlikely plot device tacked on for the sake of simplifying the protagonist's life (think \\"freeze tag\\"). I would also like to point out that this is the first book I've read that seemed to be riddled with product placement, specifically mentioning nokia phones and ipods and a myriad of name brands; annoying, but it fades as the story progresses (although Mac never lets up on naming which exact shade of pink nail polish would go best with her mood or outfit)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I honestly wasn't expecting this book to be any good.

I decided to give this series a read because this book was offered as a free Kindle book and I love to try out new authors and new genres. The books in this series are in the following orderDarkfever (Fever Series, Book 1),Bloodfever,Faefever,Dreamfever, and Shadowfever - release date TBD.. I have so far only read, Darkfever, but I am picking the others tonight. These books are for adults. There is strong language.The book is narrated in the first person by MacKayla (Mac) Lane, a sidhe-seer. The story begins on July 9th, in Ashford, Georgia. That was the day she got the phone called that changed everything - that was the day she was told her 24 year old sister, Alina Lane, was murdered. For the last 8 months Alina had been studying at Trinity College, in Dublin Ireland. After only 21 days the case was being turned over to the unsolved division. In the beginning her father had spent endless hours of the phone calling every person he could, and then he retreated to his studying and hasn't resurfaced. Mac was determined to get them to reopen the case by going to Ireland, her mother disagrees - she doesn't want to lose another daughter. Later that day Mac remembered that she had dropped her phone in the pool and it needed to be replaced. After getting a new phone she listened to the 17 messages - and one was from her sister. The time/date on the call and her determined time of death were only 4 hours apart.Mac, Jet-lagged, and 4 thousand miles from home, checks into the room she reserved at The Clarin House. Her first few ventures into Dublin didn't end well she (1) was thrown out of a pub, (2) got lost and (3) met the mysterious Jericho Barrons. When Mac arrived in Dublin her only goal was to find her sister's killer, but she soon discovered that she must find the Sinsar Dubh, an all-powerful Dark Book, before someone else claims it. Since she couldn't get the information she needed from Jericho, she went to the library. She discovered that the Tuatha De' Danaan possessed 8 ancient relics called Hallows, ~~ 4 Light - (1) the stone, (2) the spear, (3) the sword, and (4) the cauldron ~~ 4 Dark - (1) the mirror, (2) the box, (3) the amulet, and (4) the book - aka the Sinsar Dubh. Since one mysterious, arrogant male was enough, she has to add another one. V'lane, prince of the Tuatha De' Danaan takes an interest in her. Can she trust either? Jericho seems to be using her - as a bloodhound. V'lane seems to want to use her - for sex.There are 2 breeds of Fae (1) The Unseelie and (2) The Seelie. They are at war and ever since the Seelie Queen, Aoibheal, disappeared. Now things are back to like before the Compact was struck, around 4000 B.C., between Man and the Fae. The Compact forbid the Fae to spill human blood, but that no longer is being honored. The Unseelie are the larger treat, since they just hunt and kill - no questions asked. At least the Seelie breed doesn't kill a sidhe; they have another use for them - Sex. This has it repercussions as well - unprotected Sex with the Fae leaves the woman a mess. It takes the woman a long time to get over the sexual hunger and she is never able to forget. She craves it; it is like a drug addiction.This book held my attention. I read it in one sitting - this book pulled me chapter after chapter without a break. Now I am going to admit that the Fae in this book were a little over the top for me, but they didn't deter from the story to much. There is also a lot of filler, but again it doesn't detract from the story. Do yourself a favor grab this book; introduce yourself to the world and characters created by Karen Marie Morning. I have added the other books in this series to my list of future reads - I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My review will be brief given that there are over 100 reviews for this book already. I misjudged this book by its cover thinking it was a romance novel; I couldn't have been further from the truth. Although I found some parts a bit too wordy and bit too much rehashing on some issues; this book also had a good solid plot with eerie inclinations that intensified the mystery and anticipation. However, if you have a wild imagination and tend to be jumpy by nature, I don't recommend that you read this book after midnight, in the dark, with only a little booklight that tends to shed lots of shadows.lol I recommend this book to dark urban fantasy readers and look forward to the second book in the series Bloodfever.I also recommend:Magic to the Bone (Allie Beckstrom)Storm Born (Dark Swan, Book 1)Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, Book 1)Bad Blood (Crimson Moon, Book 1)Witchling (Sisters of the Moon, Book 1)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Holy cow!

I still haven't seen it yet, but the adventures and description of the places and people are well done. Contrary to the other reviewers who hated Mac for being shallow, I thought it was kind of refreshing. Because all the heroines who always seem to be good looking and you never read about them putting on make-up or being concerned about their look really seem to get on my nerves. Granted, it is a novel, so the good looking guy is always ridiculously good looking (and I am happy about it), but since the books are mainly read by women, I personally can relate to the main character who is concerned about her nail polish color being an issue :)because I think sometimes its the little familiar things that keep us going."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love the Karen Marie Moning Fever series!

She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she's your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks...until something extraordinary happens.When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death-a cryptic message on Mac's cell phone-Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister's killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed-a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae....As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister's death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless V'lane-an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women-closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac's true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book-because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands. . . .Fine Printings' ReviewCould not put this book down for a minute!

Her first book written in the first person paradigm, she weaves Mac's world and throws her from fanciful, carefree southern bell into the dangerous Dublin streets teeming with Tuatha de Dananns, Seelie and Unseelie alike.If you have read her previous books in the Highlander Series, some of this first book may seem a bit repetitive as Mac learns about the world between man and Fae, but fear not, for you Moning fans a new cast (and some old ones) enter to form fascinating relationships that will not let you down!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I come across this book by chance, Its a wonderful read i couldnt put it down. Karen marie moning did her research with this book everything is explained to the detail, Its a book that leaves you wanting more and more a great first book in the fever series.Mac lane is a small town girl who's only problems in life seem to be what outfit shes going to wear that day, and whether covergirl is still carrying her favorite shade of lipgloss.Until her sister who was studying in ireland is found dead, recieving a voice mail from her sister before her death leaves mac wanting answers. Answers about her past, her family and her heritage. She goes to ireland looking for her sisters murderer only to find that her sister wasnt killed by any regular human... but Fae.There are two sides of Fae seelie (the light) who live side by side with humans and the unseelie (the dark) who want to destroy the human world and take power.Both sides are looking for a book a book so powerful it could mean the differance between life and death of not just mac but the whole world. Mac comes to find out she was adopted and is actually a seer, (a woman who can see the Fae) it becomes her job to try and retrieve the book and avenge her sisters murderer.Then come J barrons a book store owner (who is some sort of warrior, we guess) he agrees to train mac if she helps him find the book. but what does he need the book for? we still dont know and this mistery man doesnt tell you anything about himself.And v'lane a death by sex Fae prince who works for the seelie queen who needs mac to help him find the book and restore order in the fae world before the unseelie take over and break down the walls between the two worlds.who can mac trust? she has no idea but she has to use each of them to her advantage to gain as much info as she can.I love this book at first mac got on my nerves acting like a barbie but the change in her becomes dramatic she becomes a fighter with a mission and i really like her character, the mistery with barrons just keeps you wanting more, you can just feel the sexual tention between him and mac.. and then there is v'lane a fae you just cant help but want. It makes for a good book and i would recomend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book is a page turner. Fast read, interesting from beginning to end. Interesting and mysterious characters fill these pages. You don't know what to expect from them and you don't know who to believe. I am not going talk about the book. It's free so you should just download it and see for yourself. Be warned if you're one of those people who like to start a series and read it from beginning to end without interuption, then do not pick up this book. The last installment, book 5, should be coming out in 2010 and if you hate waiting don't torture yourself. If your into PNR this is a must read. It's not really romance but there is some sexual content and it gets steamer as you get through the rest of the books. I went into this not knowing what to expect. Now I am a fan to the fever series; biting my lip until then next book comes out."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The Fever Series is nothing like Moning's previous Highlander Series. It's set in present-day Ireland and draws on Celtic/Gaelic/Druid myths and legends to form the basis of the conflict. She takes her time developing the relationships between the primary charaters - and no, there are no hot and heavy sex scenes in this book, but don't think there isn't tension building along the way. Having read all four books in this series, it's difficult to only comment on this one book. This series may seem to get off to a slow start in DARKFEVER, but it's absolutely worth it. Moning does an amazing job of character development, laying the landscape for the story to unfold, and building the suspense. I cannot wait for the fifth and final book in this series! If you like the unusual, you should read this series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was hooked from the get go with this book. I couldn't put it down. Barrons is intriguing and Ms. Moning fed me the bait and I took it hook, line & sinker.The Shades are creepy and well written, and her description of Dublin is fascinating. I felt like I was there when I was immersed in the story."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I got this book because it was free. I am glad I did. It was interesting and made me by the next one.got to see what happens!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked up DARKFEVER two days ago, and just a few hours back I finished the fourth book in the series, DREAMFEVER - if the fifth one was out, I'd be reading it now. I don't know how people who started with earlier installments have managed to wait for each new book to come out, what with the heart-in-your-throat cliffhanger endings. Putting up with that kind of anxiety for years would be tough; as it is, the fifth will be the last one in the series so I'll only be biting my nails through one cycle.Point here is: the Fever books will suck you in and pull you along like the funnest, sexiest, scariest roller coaster you have ever ridden.A few of the reviewers have expressed some frustration with Mac, the protagonist, and expressed their undying devotion for Jericho Barrons, the male lead. I have a few qualms with that. We'll root for tough-girl Mac in later books because we meet Southern sweetheart Mac in this one. DARKFEVER is the first book in the series, and there is a LOT of character development throughout. In DARKFEVER, Mac starts off as a pampered small-town girl who loves pink, looking pretty, and cute boys. We get to experience her innocence, and we'll watch as it's stripped away. One of the things that I loved about DARKFEVER is the poignancy of it - Mac narrates the novel, but it's an older Mac re-living the past. I cherished young Mac's naivete right along with the narrator, because I knew it could not last.By the end of the novel, it's clear that Mac is smart, insightful, and tough. One of the things that tipped me off to Mac's true grit - what made me really start to LIKE her - was the fact that she refused to even contemplate sleeping with Jericho Barrons. He's a character that's got a lot of evolving to do too. He's a dangerous, and dangerously appealing man - physically powerful, wealthy, seemingly omniscient, living by the credo that might makes right and utterly convinced that he's the mightiest, and therefore the rightest. He is exactly the kind of larger-than-life, too-thrilling hero that will make readers swoon, and I was soooooo proud of Mac for resisting the temptation. Because it would have been suicide.The whole series is full of amazing stories that keep you on the edge of your seat, but that's one of the things that fascinated me most: the more I read, the more I fell for Jericho Barrons, and the more convinced I was that Mac (who I was rooting for wholeheartedly) should keep a safe distance.I would recommend this book (very highly!) to readers who like strong urban fantasy - not just romance readers. If you like Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Kim Harrison, Jim Butcher, or Charlaine Harris, this is definitely a series you should check out. The author's background is in romance, and I'd intentionally avoided her until now, but these books completely reversed my opinion. Her writing is muscular, smooth, and fast-paced. The setting is amazing, the secondary characters crackle with life and energy, and she's not afraid to go some very dark places."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"this is my first karen marie moning book. i read alot of knootz and king. i enjoyed darkfever and look forward to reading more of ms. k.m. moning's books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I downloaded this book because it was free. I normally do not like books about Vampires or demons... BUT I will say this book kept my interest and has made it so I HAD to purchase the next part of the series. I can't wait to start reading \\"BloodFever\\""},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've read all of Ms. Moning's other romance books and was immediately told about all the things that make this series different. \\"It's told in the first person.\\" \\"It doesn't have any sex.\\" Those sorts of things.Well, let me tell you what it DOES have in common. Karen Marie has again created a fully fleshed-out and believable world that is compelling and alluring. Her characters are ones you either love, want, or love to hate.There is danger in this world she has created. Whether it presents itself in the form of a shadow that could literally suck the life out of you, or a death-by-sex-Fae that could enslave you. And there are sure to be even more dangers revealed.There are characters I am chomping at the bit to find out more about! Who is Jericho? WHAT is Jericho?The common thread is that she has again created a world and characters that I CARE about. Mac is a heroine with flaws. She has, up to this point in her young life, been only concerned with herself. It takes a tragedy to get her to look past her own nose. But she is strong, and I absolutely adore her. This road we have begun to walk with Mac is one that I absolutely would not miss!FYI - as for those other things . . . I didn't find the first-person distracting in the slightest. Actually, it was cool to be inside Mac's head. And as for the sex, I didn't miss it. I wished it had been there before I read the book, but after, I realized it'll happen eventually. And oh, boy! Watch out when it does!!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"At first I will admit I thought it was way off from her Highlanders books but as I read it I began to make all the connections back to some of our favorite hunks. Like why didn't Adam just kill Darroc from \\"THe Immortal Highlander\\" and be done with it? Because he is the villian in the \\"Fever\\" series (Lord Master). Darroc was briefly mentioned in conversation with Lucan in the \\"Spell of the Highlander\\". I can't wait to see Queen Aoibheal bring her other Druids (Drustan, Dageus and Cian) into the story to battle this new threat and hope there is some new ones written in to do battle also. I for one was glad to see no romance between Mac and Jericho Barrons in this first book. There is an attraction but remember, we are not sure what Barrons is exactly yet and with them keeping this on a non-personal matter for now will only make for better romance down the road. Besides who has time for romance when you are busy saving the world? Great Read and can't wait for the next books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a hugely enjoyable book with an engaging heroine, MacKayla Lane, who recounts the way in which her life changed irrevocably following a telephone call from Dublin to say that her sister had been murdered. Mac, as the narrator, is looking back to events which happened over a year ago so we occasionally are told things that she didn't know at the time as we follow her travelling from her small town in Georgia to Dublin to try and find out more about Alina's death.Mac's investigations seem hopeless and yet she perseveres but her attention is soon taken by some very strange events - an odd woman accosting her, a strange vision of a handsome man turning into an evil monster, and some unusual shadows. When Mac meets Jericho Barrons, rich owner of a bookstore right next to a strangely dark and empty part of the city, she is forced to face up to some unwelcome new truths - that Mac has skills as a Sidhe-seer and that her life is in danger.Mac and Barrons team up in order to search for an ancient book that Alina was pursuing in order to try to defeat the Unseelies who are flooding into Dublin. However Mac is given little information with which to work, Barrons being master of cryptic conversation, and her own mission to find Alina's killer is still important to her.The writing style of this book is excellent with Mac, as narrator, a very amusing character whose take on the world can be great fun, even as she's facing evil and dark things worse than she's ever considered. Her descriptions of some of the Unseelie are very amusing and yet her sense of fear as her world falls apart is also very well written. Although billed as a romance there's almost no romance in this story but it is clearly the beginning of a series and there are some hints as to the romantic direction into which it will go. The only real drawback of this book is that it doesn't reach any kind of a resolution, it just sets the reader on the path of Darkfever's world and makes the next book obligatory reading. This book feels rather like scene-setting for the major battle which one assumes will come in a future book. It is still, however, a really enjoyable read with some great characters, a light and fresh writing style and an interesting setting in Dublin.[...]."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I don't know why there are soo many people giving bad reviews of the book. KMM is diverting from her Highlander storyline to give us something a bit more entertaining. Personally, I am happy that she is trying something new and different because I was very, very tired of the almost formulaic storylines in that series.I am an avid reader of sci-fi, fantasy and romance. I am quite used to reading trilogies. Often, in these trilogies, the first book is just enough to suck you in, and then leave you hanging. There are often not many answers forthcoming until you get to the 2nd and 3rd books. As far as the lack of romance or sex, I don't need either of these to enjoy a good story. I think everyone who picks up this series needs to understand that this is not KMM's tpical novel; you CANNOT judge this book based on her previous writing. I, for one, think it's fantastic that she is trying her hand at something new.I really enjoyed this story. It's darker than any of her other novels, but that's a genre that I greatly enjoy. If you don't like a grittier, serious, 'maybe not a happy-ending' story, then don't read this book. Now, having said that, I will say that I haven't developed much sympathy for her heroine yet. I think she comes across as too young, naive, and way to much 'Valley girl' mentality. KMM is trying for a combination of spunk/sass and innocence with her that just doesn't jive right with me. The spunk and sass are at odds with the innocence, and it creates a bit of discord with me.I can't wait to find out if Mac grows up and into the abilities that KMM is weaving for her. KMM has given us many tidbits of what's in store for Mac, so I'm looking forward the adventure. And, of course, finding out who she eventually falls for.It will definitely be intriguing to see if KMM ties this series in, at alll, with the Highlander series. I'll give away one tinsy story killer. It appears (though I could be wrong) that the Lord Master is a character from one of the Highlander novels."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The first book in Ms Moning's new Fever series is a breath of fresh air, even if it isn't romance thus far. Personally, I'm tired of paying upwards of $6.99 for books that are poorly plotted, have poor characterization and while there are a couple of the mandatory steamy sex scenes, the relationship between the two main characters isn't fully developed or is unconvincing. The formula doesn't always work, and since I love to read paranormals, I've come across more and more books that just fall flat. Even though I can't quite figure out where Moning is going with this sidhe-seer series, it's showing signs of promise. It's not *all* good, but it kept me guessing and I'm excited to read Bloodfever as soon as it comes out.MacKayla Lane does undergo a transformation (physical, mental and emotional) from the first chapter to the last. When she arrives in Ireland following her sister's death, she's a naive, annoying and immature blonde who thinks the gardia (police) can gelp her get justice for Alina's murder. By the end of this book, she's learned that there's more to the world than she ever knew - including who she is and what she's capable of - and that she's become part of a war she had no idea existed. I'd like to think she's a work in progress, changing in order to stay alive. Character development is always a good thing, IMHO. Hopefully the Mac of the final book will be a character I can relate to and like a little more. Fingers crossed!Now, I wonder if Jericho Barrons and Mac are going to become more than just allies? Right now, I cannot tell, but I think it would be genius if the author took a couple of books to build that relationship into something solid before she throws romance into the mix. All I know is that Jericho manages to be an enigmatic alpha without falling into any of the typical romance stereotypes and pitfalls.. so there's a lot of potential, but whether or not the author intends to fulfil it.. I have no problem waiting for relationships to develop and plots to play out, providing the story is well written and conceived. I didn't quite feel like I got enough out of Darkfever (I felt like there should have been a just little more to the Mac/Jerricho thing to hold us over to the next book) but on the whole, I was hooked and there's a lot to look forward to in this series. Nicely done!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"With the ringing of a phone, MacKayla \\"Mac\\" Lane's sedate world was destroyed. Her sister, Alina, was gruesomely murdered in Dublin but the case has gone cold despite some cryptic clues. With revenge on her mind, Mac heads to Ireland against her parents' wishes and learns the terrifying truth that the Fae exist. A dark world opens up for Mac as she forms a dubious partnership with Jericho Barrons. Will Mac unravel the meaning of Alina's messages as the veil between the Fae and mortal worlds crumbles?DARKFEVER is a fabulous addition to the urban fantasy genre. Fans of Karen Marie Moning's Highlander series should be cautioned that DARKFEVER is not a paranormal romance so that they are not surprised by the direction of the novel. This is not a happily-ever-after book but rather a dark and perhaps even a bit disturbing look at the shadowy world of the Fae. Good and evil are often intertwined and it is difficult to tell friend from foe in this world.Karen Marie Moning does a superb job at creating contrasts in DARKFEVER. These contrasts emphasize the disturbing nature of the Fae. At one point, Mac is referred to as a Rainbow and her bright viewpoint on the world highlights the horror of the shadowy corners where the Fae lurk. Jericho, on the other hand, is a complete enigma and this reviewer is looking forward to see what Ms. Moning has in store for his future.DARKFEVER will be greatly loved by fans of dark or urban fantasy. Karen Marie Moning does a splendid job at crafting a world guaranteed to send shivers down your spine. Mac is a character readers will want to learn more about as she stumbles her way through learning her heritage and her abilities. Well done, Ms. Moning!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever has everything a girl could want. Mystery, intrigue, romance, creatures of the night and the fae are all intertwined in this hard to put down book!Our hero, Mac, travels to Ireland to uncover the mysterious and violent death of her sister, Alina. She gets much more than she bargained for when she arrives and finds that all is not as it seems in the world.Once, Mac and Alina were two fun loving pretty sisters who had not a care in the world that is until Alina went abroad to Ireland to study. Mac noticed that Alina had not been herself the last few months, leaving her family worried but it was easy to write it off as stress from her studies and being so far from home.Just prior to Alina's brutal murder, Mac receives a confusing voice mail from her. Alina is talking crazily about the love of her life not being who he said he was and making a startling comment that he 'was one of them'. She went on to tell Mac she didn't even know what she was and then the mysterious Sinsar Dubh, which Mac barely caught. The call ends in a dramatic silence, leaving Mac sure there was much more to her sister's murder than the authorities were aware.Of course, Mac is not content with the authority's performance regarding her sister's murder; she hops a plane and goes to Ireland to try to solve it by herself. There she meets the secretive and devilishly handsome Jericho Barrons.He quickly draws her into the shadowy underworld of the fae when he discovers she is a sidhe seer with special abilities.Jericho is icy cool to Mac and only tells her what he thinks she should know about his quest to find the Sinsar Dubh, what he does reveal is if this mystifying book falls into the wrong hands, the world will end as she knows it.This book is amazing and I fell in love with the fantasy realm and felt like I was traveling with Mac thru it all.Ms. Moning has such a gift of making you feel as if you are right there with the character.I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting Bloodfever and cannot wait until it comes out.This truly is a must read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Unlike most who reviewed this book, I'd never heard of the author or her books before. Given the quality of this book, I sure ain't gonna read any more of them. Not one of the characters is likeable, especially the main character. Annoying!

Like all of the free Kindle books, this book was meant to entice us into buying more from this author. No way!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is the first and last book I've read by Moning. It was truly awful. The characters were so annoying. Mac, the main character, was shallow, petty, unimaginative, self-righteous, and boring. All she did was talk about her hair and accessories and criticize what everybody else was wearing. She had no depth at all, and her main goal in life was to be a slacker, living off her parents, in a podunk town. And what was with Jericho? All he did was shout orders at her (which she never questioned), constantly jerk her around physically and leave bruises (and she never fought back), order her to keep her mouth shut at parties (which she mindlessly did), and made her wear a bunch of slutty outfits (she didn't want to, but she couldn't go against his orders, could she?). It was quite sickening. The dialogue was mainly her getting verbally abused, and her response would be something witty like, \\"Huh?\\" The plot was weak and stayed unresolved at the end. There was basically no action, and the Southern stereotypes got old too. There was absolutely no point to this book. I love reading and am addicted to books, so I've come across some bad authors in the past, but Moning has got to be one of the worst."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm a fan of paranormal romance and picky about quality, but somehow I'd managed to go without getting into this series.

I've met so many fans of the book, guess I'd better read them.&#34; I could discuss the many reasons I enjoyed Darkfever, but I'll just say this: I read this at the expense of sleep, and immediately had to buy the rest of the series for Kindle.

This first book of the Fever series is so good, I know I will be reading everyone of the books while everything around me will be falling apart...Hehehehehehe!!. What surprises me, is why this not been a actual TV series.I feel so bad for all the people who started on this book from day 1, having to wait for all the sequels....man, do I know how that feels. I read Caroline Hansons book Love is Darkness, and had to wait for the 2nd, which was only within a month or so after I read the 1st book.

This book is mostly paranormal with a very, very slight hint of romance. It's about fairies or \\"fae\\" being evil and coming to our world through a magical portal. \\"Mac\\" the main character travels to Berlin to find her sisters killer & discovers she is a very valuable player in the war against the fae. Mac meets a mysterious & handsome man named \\"Barons\\" in the process and although she learns to need him, she can't shake the feeling of not fully trusting him.The story is great & magical for true lovers of paranormal books. However, the romance is lacking.... severely. I think the romance should pick up in the next FIVE books.... if I make it that far in the series. The thing I didn't like was that the author had a tendency to add to much filler in places. She would go on and on about Macs fingernail polish or her personal thoughts to the point where I would skip paragraphs or pages at times and miss nothing of substance. I will read the next book \\"Bloodfever\\" but if there is not more romance or she adds too much filler again, I am done with this series.If you liked this book check out the \\"Jolie Wilkins\\" series by H.P. Mallory..... It's very similar but much better. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"For any woman who just loves Sci Fi, I highly recommend the entire series.

She meets some interesting, but dangerous, people and some of them might not be altogether human. Before her sister died, she leaves Mac a very cryptic message on her cell phone voice mail. Because of that message, Mac feels compelled to travel to Ireland and solve the mystery surrounding her sister's murder.I could only feel medium Milk Chocolate warmth for this book. Have you ever watched a horror movie where the dumb chick is being stalked by some killer monster dude and she comes across a room where the lights are out? Everyone sits in their seat and says \`don't go into the room!' but she does anyway .... That is the type of character Mac is. Over and over again. Until the end when she magically turns into a ninja.I know this is the first book in the series so there was a lot of character and world building going on in this book to set up the series, so I will be a little lenient. This book is not a PNR. There was no romance in this book and there is no one in this book to be romantic about. You cannot count the seduction Fae, Vlane, because his type of play is equivalent to date rape. (Theater person yells: Git your clothes on Ethel!)There is something very mysterious about Barrens and we never do discover what that is. He is barely tolerant of Mac, yet she keeps returning to him. Although the end of the book has them sitting all soft and cozy together, he is barely civil to her most of the time and has admitted that he just wants her around for what she can do for him. Yet, here is Mac, starting to get all mushy, feely toward him. (Theater person yells: Get away from him you idiot!)The Narration ReviewThis was the second book I listened to that was narrated by Joyce Bean. The first wasAll The Pretty Girls (Taylor Jackson), by J.T. Ellison. Her narration for this novel was completely different from the crime novel and I wouldn't have realized it was the same narrator. She did really well giving the host of characters different voices and her narration was clear and very easy to listen to."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a catalyst.It brings about a change in more ways than one. For starters, as a spinoff from Karen Marie Moning's Highlander series about timetraveling romance between Highlanders, the Fever series is a five book storyline that isn't a traditional romance. It's Urban Fantasy. There are no defined heroes (or are there?). It also is start of Mac's journey. Pink, ignorant, and without a care in the world...Mac 1.0 isn't the most exciting main character. Give the story a few chapters. Many readers will agree with me when I say don't give up on the story, get to chapter 3 or 4. Let yourself meet Jericho Barrons when Mac visits Barrons Books and Baubles for the first time and you may find yourself hooked. Also, as far as catalysts go, in regards to the 5 book journey...Mac's arrival in Dublin may be one of the biggest catalysts of all. If you want to know why, read the book.One of the most noteworthy aspects of this series is how dynamic of a character MacKayla Lane is. Each book she progresses. The Mac you meet in chapter 1 is not the same girl when you leave her at the end of chapter 54 of Shadowfever.If you are ready to take a chance, enjoy an escape into a dark fantastical world, epic characters consisting of good guys that do some bad things and bad guys that surprise you constantly...you'll love the fever series.

Every book so far ends practically mid-sentence, definitely mid-thought/action, worse than Lord of the Rings. I read all four books in one week, and yes, I have a day job.These are crunchy snack food: tasty; light reading; and based in a good mythology. Though I am as desperate for the two main characters to finally come together, I appreciate the author's attempt to make this a fantasy novel (A Novel, not 5) rather than a romance.The first book was a little hard for me to get into, never having been or known a perky, pink-laced woman-child. But as her eyes are opened, fairly literally, to the world at large, we start to wonder what else is out there, and how Barrons fits in.And how we wish he'd fit in. Admit it, if there was a rent-a-barrons site this author would never have to write another thing to be set for life... after \\"book\\" 5, that is.I will definitely be re-reading all of these just before ordering the 5th installment. Because I can.--edit--So, after re-reading these books, I realized what happened. I was so addicted and unable to put them down that I sped through them. This isn't a novella. I just devoured it like one. So, I'm now obligated to give it 5 stars. Well-written and thoroughly engaging. My deepest apologies to the author for loving it so much that I thought they were too short. I just NEED more! ;)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am a fan of Vampire-lit and this came up as a suggested reading from Amazon. As a free Kindle download, this was hard to pass up.In general I thing Moning nailed the main character's naivet&eacute; and selfish silliness. At first, I found it annoying that Mac was immature and lacked depth, but as the story is told first person, I chalked it up to \\"keeping in character.\\" Her story was more of an average girl with untaped extraordinary powers. I was more interested in the locale and mysterious Jericho, the male lead. Not much was revealed about Jericho-- lots of unanswered questions, but there is something very interesting and compelling about him. The story started off slow, but midway through, became face paced and interesting. I could have used a little more explanation of the non-human characters, those were odd and needed a little more detail. In fact, overall, the whole story could have used a little more depth. More than anything, I see that this book laid the foundation for a series of interesting encounters and plot lines, perhaps even a little romance (but at the end of our tale, heat was still lacking)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This isn't my usual genre, but it's hard to put this book into a genre. It has elements of sci-fi, paranormal, adventure and a little romance.What I like best about the book is the writing. This gal has talent. Well done, tight and concise in character development, dialogue, and action.What I didn't like is the fact that this book doesn't end, it's not a stand alone, but a continuation that lasts for 5 books. Having said that, I'll still continue the series because I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I originally downloaded this book because it was a freebie, thinking I wasn't out anything if it wasn't any good. It was a GREAT book....loved it so much in fact, that I quickly bought the next 2 in the series right after I was done reading it! The 4th book in the series comes out in a little over a week, and I'm hoping that it is available for Kindle right away - very anxious to read it! :)If you like a paranormal adventure, with some mystery thrown in, this is a good book for you. Not a whole lot of romance, but there are definitely sparks between the main characters and I'm hoping to see them develop into more in the next books!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Finally, an interesting mystery, and a great fae book: two things that I have been looking for for awhile. In this murder mystery a 22 year old named Mac is thrown into bad situation after bad situation. Mac's sister is killed and she goes to Dublin to find out more about the murder. From the first day she arrives, she experiences nothing but trouble. An old woman attacks her for no reason, she starts stripping in the middle of the street, pieces of paper make her nauseous, and those are just a few of Mac's troubles. She is guided by a not so friendly book store owner on a journey to find her sister's killer and to possibly save the world.Although Mac's interest in pink nail polish and clothes is a bit annoying, it is obvious that the trials she goes through in this book help her mature a bit (though maybe not enough to not wear the nail polish). I can't wait to find out more about the fae, the bookstore owner, and Mac. This was a great start to what I think will be a great series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a hugely enjoyable book with an engaging heroine, MacKayla Lane, who recounts the way in which her life changed irrevocably following a telephone call from Dublin to say that her sister had been murdered. Mac, as the narrator, is looking back to events which happened over a year ago so we occasionally are told things that she didn't know at the time as we follow her travelling from her small town in Georgia to Dublin to try and find out more about Alina's death.Mac's investigations seem hopeless and yet she perseveres but her attention is soon taken by some very strange events - an odd woman accosting her, a strange vision of a handsome man turning into an evil monster, and some unusual shadows. When Mac meets Jericho Barrons, rich owner of a bookstore right next to a strangely dark and empty part of the city, she is forced to face up to some unwelcome new truths - that Mac has skills as a Sidhe-seer and that her life is in danger.Mac and Barrons team up in order to search for an ancient book that Alina was pursuing in order to try to defeat the Unseelies who are flooding into Dublin. However Mac is given little information with which to work, Barrons being master of cryptic conversation, and her own mission to find Alina's killer is still important to her.The writing style of this book is excellent with Mac, as narrator, a very amusing character whose take on the world can be great fun, even as she's facing evil and dark things worse than she's ever considered. Her descriptions of some of the Unseelie are very amusing and yet her sense of fear as her world falls apart is also very well written. Although billed as a romance there's almost no romance in this story but it is clearly the beginning of a series and there are some hints as to the romantic direction into which it will go. The only real drawback of this book is that it doesn't reach any kind of a resolution, it just sets the reader on the path of Darkfever's world and makes the next book obligatory reading. This book feels rather like scene-setting for the major battle which one assumes will come in a future book. It is still, however, a really enjoyable read with some great characters, a light and fresh writing style and an interesting setting in Dublin.[...]"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a hugely enjoyable book with an engaging heroine, MacKayla Lane, who recounts the way in which her life changed irrevocably following a telephone call from Dublin to say that her sister had been murdered.

I think the sex in the book diminish the storyline."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I generally love romance novels with any sort of paranomal view. As we all know vampires, werewolves, and witches have come and gone time and time again. Well Karen(writer) takes fantasy to a whole new direction. The word fairy is NOTHING like we all believe in our world. This book is dark, magical, DIFFerent, lust, anger, murder, passion, basically not your average romance novel. Incredible story line but the books are cliffhangers which leave you either losing sleep =) or impatient for the final book to come out in january 2011.A girl atteming to avenge her sisters death goes on a journey much more intense and gets much more than she bargained for in ireland. She finds out she's not quite your average human when she gets there and meets \\"people\\" and things that appear to be people but then aren't the next second. They're called the Fae, most monsters really. Will she ever find out who murdered her sister? Will she get to avenge her sister's death before she's killed herself?"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just finished this whole series. I was enthrawled chapter after chapter and could not pyut it down. Mac and Jerrico's relationship sometimes wants to make you pull your hair and infuriates you. The story really gives amazing ups and downs. It gives you cliff hangers and heart stoppers but definitely gives an amazingly full story and paints a world that you feel is real. She does so amazingly at wrapping it all in at the end and left me happy but wanting to start all over again with the first book.

Then I started to read it and I was still dubious. I read book two, then three, burning through the whole series in about a week and when I hit the end I felt like I needed Prozac. I was so bummed I wouldn't see my characters again.Yeah, my characters. It's one of those rare series where you know the men, you love them and they surprised you. Very LKH before the crazy sex.the plot got a little confusing and there were points where I just wished she'd ask a stupid question and solve her own problems instead of making us indulge a 100 page plot line that was a red herring. this happened more than once. Despite that- 5 stars."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This was the first novel by Karen Marie Moning that I have ever read. I didn't even realize she wrote romance novels or I wouldn't have ordered it. I love supernatural mysteries. I read as many books as I can find about vampires, weres, and the Fae. The book came up on a recommendation and I ordered Dark Fever. I enjoyed the book. It was a different look at the Fae. It takes place in Ireland so it's something different and fun. I liked Barrons, I thought that he would reveal himself as a vampire, but that didn't happen. He has vampire behaviors, only showing up at night, very strong, lots of knowledge that comes with time and experience. He was a mystery and I wanted more information about his character but the book isn't very revealing. I wasn't crazy about Mac, I don't like the Barbie Doll pink finger nails blonde bimbo thing she has going on. I am hoping she matures in the next book. She is lazy and seems more concerned with her appearance and seems pretty sure she is gorgeous. Her outfit or nail color doesn't improve the book at all. I do really hope she gets a reality slap in the next book. I would recommend this book to a friend. I am hoping the next book in the series is better. I was surprised at the ending which is a cliff hanger. It just makes it seem like the book stopped so you can buy the second one to finish reading."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I don't really know how to feel about this book. I liked the setting and hated the characters. I gave it three stars because, despite everything, I want to read the sequel.What I liked:* One thing: the world building. I like Dublin and Ireland, so I could relate to the feeling of magic you get in a lot of places. I also liked the concept of the Dark Zone. It took me a while, but slowly I got interested in the Fae world.* Jericho Barrons' ambiguity. The fact I still don't know where he stands makes me want to read the following book.What I didn't like:* The prologue put me off, it seemed useless, it didn't grab my attention. It read like an attempt at being sophisticated, but it seemed just patched up at the beginning of the book, with no real information. A prologue shoud be a teaser, or should partake the reader of information one will keep in mind constantly, but it was just annoying.* The main character, Mac. Was she so shallow because she was young? Usually the death of a person you love should make you grow up. Nothing. She said many times how the death of her sister affected her, but she never showed it, not once. Why is she always paying attention to what she's wearing, her I-don't-want-to-change-the-world-but-decorate-it attitude really made me grit my teeth.*** spoilerish***And then I just couldn't believe that Mac/Barbie could fight like Uma Thurman in a Quentin Tarantino's movie. There's no hint in the whole book she had this in her.* I don't like heroes who behave like jerks, but I understand and condone Barrons' behaviour, she was stupid and annoying most of the time. He acts misterious, he is misterious, but he's so flat... Well, maybe the problem is Mac, because we are reading the story through her eyes. He's gorgeous, strong and I think he's also cultivated, he should be perfect, but at the beginning of the book he manhandles her a couple of times, and though I would have done the same thing with someone like Mac, it was too much. I hope I'll like him better later."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a great series, can't wait for the last one to come out in Jan. 2011, if you haven't read this series and you like supernatural, scifi, paranormal romances, then you'll love this one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked this book up when it was a free download on the Kindle. I don't typically read romance novels so I was not familiar with the author's other work. Maybe based on what other reviewers have written...that's a good thing. I got the book because I was intrigued by the paranormal aspect and not by the hint of romance. It does seem obvious that the two main characters will eventually develop a romantic interest in each other but the fact that didn't happen in this first book didn't bother me at all. I loved the fact that this book set the story up for the rest of the series. I didn't see it as a problem the book didn't \\"wrap up nicely\\" as most books set out to be a series from the beginning don't do that. They typically \\"wrap up nicely\\" when authors aren't planning to continue the story and then do so as a result of sales. This storyline is obviously meant to be an in-depth exploration of how Mac changes over time and adopts to her new role as sidhe-seer. This book did have a lot of new terms (at least for me) but there is a helpful glossary at the end of the book, taken from Mac's journal...so we learn as she learns. Because it is written from Mac's perspective, we are often left in the shadows as to what is really going on and I enjoyed that here. If you are someone who needs to know all the motivations of all the characters up front, you will be left disappointed and confused with this book. Yes, I agree with other reviewers about Mac's whiny surface level behavior at the beginning. It does seem a bit of a stretch--however I think it's meant to contrast with the amount of growth she undertakes while in Ireland. All in all, I thought it was a great beginning to a story and have already purchased the next book in the series. I am looking forward to see how Mac's story continues and to (I assume) the eventual romance with Jericho."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. So far, I have read the first 2 books, and am currently reading the 3rd book. I would highly recommend this series to those who like action, mystery, a little romance, and magic. To me, this series would be comparable to the House of Night series and City of Glass series - if you liked those books, you will like this series. I can't wait to keep reading!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Too many people have already mentioned how the main character, Mac, was a shallow, annoying, immature and whinny girl. I don't need to repeat them here. Everyone also knows how those books pretty much end in a mid sentence so you need to buy the next book to know what happened; therefore, I am not going to bash them again.However, there is something pretty annoying to me that I haven't seen many people complaining was the descriptions of those characters.Just to be sure, I am not a romance novel reader and have never read her Highlander series.Picture this: The main character, Mac, loves wearing pink color everything, love golden lace-up saddles, and love to wear the colors of the rainbow. Now picture this: all main male characters are 6'3\\", dark tanned, (gold, colors of honey), long hair down to their waist line, chiseled jaws and tight jeans/leather pants. At one point, she even described one \\"hot\\" guy was a \\"Fabio\\".Now, how many people in the audience under the age of 40 know who Fabio is? (OK, you, you and you.)How many people in her 20's think Fabio is hot? (Anybody?)I appreciate the author's effort to get trendy by mentioning iPod, MP3, (and later in book 3, Nine Inch Nails), however, her taste in fashion and men really betrayed her real age. It's absolutely fine to like people who look like they just walked off the set of an 80's cheesy movie. However, as a first person perspective view of a 21st century 22 year old girl, this is just down right bizarre.On the plus side, this is a page turner. I personally want my answers and I want to know what happens to those characters. I just wish I didn't have to skip a few lines every time Mac puts on her dress (Seriously? Every time in graphic details about her pink dress and golden accessories? Add a head band and we are back in the 80's) or when she runs into a tall, dark, and handsome man. (Tall, dark, muscular and long hair? I can't keep the WWE wrestlers out of my mental picture.)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Had I known what I was getting into with the Fever series, I would have waited until all 5 books were finished. Typically one expects a novel to be complete, even if it leads into a continuing saga. The books in the fever series do not follow this, they are a single story, organized into 5 separate books or as Ms. Moning calls them \\"installments\\", each with a cliffhanger that leaves you feeling empty -- albeit wanting more, if only to know how the story ends. To me the series feels more like a made for SyFy TV miniseries that should be aired over the course of weeks, not years. It is a little unfair to fans to have to pay complete novel prices for the books, but not get a complete story in any of them. I was pulled in and now must wait until the final installment is published in January 2011 to get to the end of the story, and believe me, it's too long to wait.Still having said this, the \\"installments\\" are seductive, page-turning thrillers. The story pulls you in, like an addiction, and once you are hooked, you devour each book, raging from one \\"fix\\" to another. Problem is now, I'm going through painful withdrawal. Of course I'll read the final installment, but I am not sure I will invest this type of energy in anymore of Ms. Moning's incomplete works -- at least not until they are complete. It's just too frustating.After January 18, 2011 when the final installment is scheduled to be released, I highly recommend the series as long as you are committed to reading (and paying for) all 5 installments. Before January 18th, begin this series at your own risk!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this book when i foumd it on the free list for my Kindle....I had to buy the rest of the books and am now waiting for the next book to come out.

Nothing for him to do!!! Mac was sort of iffy for me. She was okay but I really wish this had been a straight romance. The only romance in it was Mac and the lusty fairy. I didn't like that. You have someone like Jericho Barrons around and nothing for him?I didn't like this book--I borrowed it from the library. This is the first KMM book that I didn't buy and put on my keeper shelf.

Anyway lets get to the gist of it.Problem number one: The characters in this book are sooo bad. Seriously. The heroine is this southern girl who just loves to wear pink and have matching nail polish and who is so whiney and self-absorbed, that i really just wanted to throw the book down and give up after the firt 100 page of it. For thoes of you who hated the Dependent-Bella as much as i did, don't pick this book up. (also the damn discription of her clothes goes on forever. Who cares! Get on with the story already)Problem number two: Unoriginal. How many times am i going to have to read about characters going completley stubid and acting like damn mating animals in heat?Problem number three: The plot (mixed with the horrible cast of characters) is is simply at a stand still for most of the book. The plot is (i think) centered on the heroine traveling to Ierland to solve the murder of her sister (another terrible character) with absoluley no experience what so ever. Oh, before i forget they both discover there something more than just some simple human while they're there. Do i even need to say how bored i am with that happening in paranormal?For your own sake, if you do decide to read this book against my judgement, don't buy it.You'll only want your money back."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Great book. I have read all her series. I can't wait for her next book"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Sexy covers, great copy, but it's the inside that's lacking. While some of Moning's alpha males are worthy of the page, for some reason this writeris either incapable of, or unwilling to write an intelligent heroine - the current heroine, MacKayla, is a study in stupidity with her \\"barbie doll\\" looks who is forever mesmerized by her nail polish, hair, pop language, etc. The first Moning novel I read \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\", Gwen, the heroine, was the same type of female character as in Darkfever, and least you don't believe me, I quote:\\"Gwen peered at Bert through her Jennifer Aniston fringed bangs, expensively beveled to attract her own Brad Pitt\\".\\"Perhaps before quiting (cigarettes) she should have waited until she'd found her cherry picker, she mused\\". (Numerous mentions of \\"her cherry picker\\" when she looks at Drustan - the character is a virgin)\\".\\"After discovering she couldn't check into her room at the inn until after four o'clock, and firm in her resolve to not march into the nearest shop and buy a pack of what's that word-she-wasn't-saying-anymore.....\\" (cigarettes)\\".\\"Gwen stared: \\"There's no way that's part of you. You must have gotten a sock or ..something.....stuck.

Now, no one likes to put someone down, but if you can believe that, you can believe anything. If Moning can write good alpha males, what happens with the women?Here's some of my favorite recommendations for good reading - some better than others, but usually all a good read.*****Judith Mc Naught's - \\"A Kingdom of Dreams\\" -While it's a bit overwritten, and would have been better if edited down somewhat, there's something about Royce Westmoreland that gets under your skin in the same way the character Maximus (Russell Crow) did in \\"The Gladiator\\". He's smart, savvy, a feared warrior, but also one with honor, integrity, gentleness, humor, and a conscience. Of all the books listed here and the many I've read that aren't, \\"A Kingdom of Dreams\\" remains one of my favorites.Keep in mind, reading \\"A Kingdom of Dreams\\", Mary Stewart's books, and Elizabeth Vaughan's \\"Warprize\\", \\"Warsworn\\", and \\"Warlord\\" are some of the best and spoils you for some of the others listed.*****Mary Stewart's fine, fine, Arthurian Books - \\"The Crystal Cave\\" - \\"The Hollow Hills\\" - \\"The Last Enchantment\\" - \\"The Wicked Day\\" -*****Elizabeth Vaughan's \\"Warprize\\", \\"Warsworn\\", and \\"Warlord\\" -Tina St. John's - \\"Lady of Valor\\" - Heart of the Flame\\" -Kresley Cole's MacCarrick Trilogy -Strong Alpha Males:\\"If You Dare\\" - \\"If You Desire\\" - \\"If You Deceive\\" -Susan Carroll's well-written \\"Dark Queen Trilogy\\": - book 1 -\\"The Dark Queen\\" - book 2 \\"The Courtesan\\" and book 3 \\"The Silver Rose\\" -Monica McCarty's - Highlander Untamed - Highlander Unmasked -Betina Krahn's - \\"The Princess & The Barbarian\\" - \\"The Husband Test\\" -Jen Holling's - \\"My Wicked Highlander\\"-Karyn Monk's - \\"Once a Warrior\\" - \\"The Rose and the Warrior\\"Julie Garwood's - \\"The Prize\\" - \\"The Bride\\" - \\"Ransom\\" - \\"The Secret\\" -Sara Bennett's - \\"The Lily and The Sword\\" -For Viking Warriors check out - Josie Litton's:\\"Dream of Me\\" - \\"Believe in Me\\" - \\"Come Back to Me\\" -Amanda Scott's - \\"Highland Princess\\" -Arnette Lamb's - \\"The Chieftain\\" - \\"Highland Rouge\\"Hannah Howell's - \\"Highland Bride\\" -Jen Holling's - \\"My Wicked Highlander\\" - \\"My Devilish Scotsman\\" -Karen Monk's - \\"Once a Warrior\\" - \\"The Witch & The Warrior\\" -Madeline Hunter's - \\"By Possession\\" -Margaret Moore's - \\"The Unwilling Bride\\" - \\"Lord of Dunkeathe\\" -\\"The Overlords Bride\\" -Marsha Canham's - \\"The Pride of Lions\\" -Mary Reed McCall's -\\"The Maiden Warrior\\" - \\"Secret Vows\\"-Penelope Williamson's - \\"Keeper of the Dream\\" -Rebecca Hagan Lee's - \\"A Hint of Heather\\" -Shelly Thacker's - \\"His Forbidden Touch\\" -Shana Abe's - \\"Intimate Enemies\\" -Sophia Johnson - \\"Risk Everything\\" -Tamara Leigh's - \\"Blackheart\\" -Philippa Gregory - \\"The Other Boelyn Girl\\" - Historical TudorsOn my \\"Authors to Avoid\\" List:Karen Marie Moning - Connie Mason - Sue Ellen Welfonder - Johanna Lindsey - Dawn Thompson - Teresa Mederios - Sabrina Jeffries - Tanya Anne Crosby - Mercedes Lackey.-"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Let's be honest, Dark Fever was not what I expected.

I enjoy campy, quirky writing style at times, what I call \\"mind candy\\", such as Laurel K. Hamilton's series (at least the first nine or so) and am not a snob about literature as some can be. But I truly was astounded at how many very high marks this book gets, along with the moniker \\"#1 Bestselling Author...\\" on various publishing lists! It's style reminds me of a high school creative writing assignment that had to be finished in two days, with inconsistent characters (Barrons often uses Mac's own speaking style), overused phrases (\\"pretty this, pretty that\\") and unconvincing plot points. I love to lose myself in books, regardless of the content, and I only found myself chastising the immature phrasings. There are moments of intrigue that start to hold, such as the search for the O'Bannion's home in the sewers, but then it dissolves into prattle. For the fans of the series, forgive me, this is my own opinion, but I just don't see what all the fuss is about this pretty little series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've been trying to find a better author then Laurell K. Hamilton's fairy series. I have found it! Karen has created characters that I feel emotions to and none of them on this book have sex on every other page. She has a wonderful plot and characters with different views. This series has a mixture of mystery, fantasy, and a little bit of romance. I'm sure there will be more later in these books. If you adore later novels of Laurell K. Hamilton, you may not enjoy this book. The only bad thing I found about Darkfever is the fact that it's 1 of 5 books, I believe, and the ending to this book was very abrupt. I do plan on reading the next one and hope you find her as entertaing as I did."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was really nervous about gettingt this book. The reviews were very mixed. Some loved it others hated it. Me I read romance period (historical, suspense, modern. Everyone from J.E. (Stephanie Plum) to Johanna Lindsey, Mary Balough, Christine Skye, Kay Hooper, Linda Howard etc and more recently C. Feehan(the mutant stuff only). I usually dont get into the really weird stuff such as vampires. A little paranormal is fine.Two weeks ago I stumbled onto K. Moning at the library. I quickly reserved all the books of hers they had. Her books can be read alone, in order or whatever. They are wonderful. They do reference other books but you can get it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am a Major Moning FAN. I have every book & story she ever wrote and read them all more than I want to admit. What Happened??? First, I feel taken advantage of - HardBack, Big Bucks and a major disappointment in the story.The kindest thing I have to write (in frustration but still hoping for better) is that maybe her romance & marriage dulled her edge a bit for just this book? Had it been a paperback I would feel less used. I do not have lots of disposable income for hardbacks. Frankly, I am very wary to shell out for another hardback.The elements of her style are there, they remain undeveloped, the reader unfulfilled. In truth, there is an edge you want to glide along and then a repetitive \\"chase scene\\" mentality frustrates the reader. How many times are we sneaking off somewhere to see the critters? Too many not-quite-developed scenarios. Way too much time on Unseelie descriptions. The action is slow, it insults the reader - there was not a move by any character that I did not anticipate. That is not characteristic of Moning. The characters' interactions are stilted, they do not mesh, yet I do want to learn more about them, assuming they will - her characters always have before. It should have happened in THIS book! And I am not buying five hardbacks to have something fleshed out for me. Each book, at this price should stand alone and make you wait breathlessly for the next and the next.... The paperbacks did!Why, with so much to criticize do I still have hope? Because there are several elements from several of her former books showing up in this one that are probably going to be fun when pulled together. (HINT: Tua De Sword) And this is the only Moning book out of many that had no ZIP and almost no substance - so the zip and substance have got to be in the next four.My advice: Skip this one, check out the next one before you buy, but I think in the long run she'll be Back!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I purchased this book because I have enjoyed reading this author. I was terribly disappointed in Darkfever. First it moved so slowly with little action and pages of boring exposition. It lacked romance and even the attempt at the beginnings of lust were flat. I found myself scanning the pages hoping for something better. When the book ended without resolving even one mystery, I was horrified. What a waste of my time. Also what a shameless ploy to sell books. If I want to know more I can by the next book which happens to be a more expensive hardcover. I can tell you I am not pre-ordering that volume. Also in reading the author's question and answer section I see that the story of Mac won't end in the next book. I have no problem with a continuing character. In fact I like it but each book must have some resolution or the buyer must be warned that this is only part one of a continuing story not book one of a continuing series. If I could I would be asking for my money back"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love to get \\"get lost\\" in Karen Monings' stories.

I can only hope that the plethora of foreshadowing in this opening series will eventually lead to something, but alas, I will not be reading another Fever book to find out. I feel the $1.99 I paid was $2.00 too much. I generally devour 300 pages in less than a day, but I choked on this book for 3 days, hoping something good would come of it. The writing is so superficial and terribly redundant. My husband asked while I was reading if it was a roller coaster & I told him it wasn't even a merry-go-round. Bottom line...skip it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"A wonderful series of books and storytellers filled with fantasies.However, the lead character, Mac, is without doubt the most irritatingand insulting of any character in any fiction.

However, if a story line is going to continue with cliff hangers at the end of each of the books, there should be a warning in bold print on the front page about the ongoing story line!!! Five books before we receive the answers to questions asked in the first book is ridiculous!!! I have quit reading other authors who tried this tact to get their books sold. I hate to think I will have to give up Ms. Moning, but I will if this is how she plans to write in the future."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"So I have actually been listening to this as a podcast, which I am entirely grateful for, because truthfully it's just not a story worth paying for. If you're interested, check it out at the library. Whatever you do don't buy the audiobook! The reader is the same in both the audiobook and the podcast, and while she does well coming across as a an empty headed teen girl, she sounds like Sm&eacute;agol (from lord of the rings) when she's attempting male voices."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was a bit wary about reading this book because of some of the bad reviews. My disappointment at the short length of the book was mostly because I wasn't ready for the story to end. I really enjoyed it. Many reviewers are complaining about the main character Mac and her less than stellar characteristics. I think that most of them must have forgotten that precarious age of young adulthood that I believe Moning captured very well. Everything about the character makes sense to me. Her lack of ambition is due to the comfortable, loving existence that was so prevalent in her life before her sister's death. What surprised me most about her character was her ability to not succumb to the Faerie Prince V'lane! I am older, hence a little wiser than I was in my early twenties, but not so self-indulgent to forget how I was at that age and Mac embodies many of those characteristics. I am not proud of once being naive or more concerned with my clothes or even my lack of ambition at that age, but perhaps it is because I also come from a loving and comfortable home environment that I can so readily identify with her. I think she is a great character and I am looking forward to her maturing with the guidance of the enigmatic Barrons. My one complaint is that the story could have been longer or the book could have been distributed as a paperback rather than hardcover. But I suspect that complaint resides more with the publisher's decision rather than Ms. Moning. I am looking forward to continued adventures with Mac and Barrons. Despite the limited sexuality that is uncharacteristic of Ms. Moning's earlier work, I give kudos to the author for branching out into the urban paranormal genre that has been previously paved by Kelley Armstrong, LKH, Kim Harrison, Charlaine Harris, et al. I think what is jarring about this character is she has no sense of her own supernatural abilities as you would find in the main characters of those other urban fantasy books. Mac has just begun learning about who she is and what she is able to do and so the reader also has this learning curve to struggle against. Mac reminds me a bit of Stephanie Plum when she rushes into things without thinking them through and again I think that characterizes her youth very well. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and would recommend reading it. I am looking forward to the other installments and like one reviewer said, I hope we don't have to wait to long for it. But since I am not a writer and not governed by a muse or publishers, I suppose I'll wait as long as I must."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a brilliant read, and officially bumped my addiction to Karen Moning's books from acute to terminally ill. I can't get the characters and events of Darkfever out of my head, and it's been a week since I've put the book down. It's taken a mammoth effort to not pick it up again and read it over, and then do the same with her previous books right away. The world that Moning has created blows everything else out of the water with her perfectly concocted world of reality, mythology, and heart-pounding suspense. Everything in her previous novels is incorporated into this series and raises a plethora of new questions--and makes me want to dig deeper and further outside the box. If it takes five or more years to get to the end of the story, so be it. I want quality vs. quantity--and I got my money's worth and so much more.The story provoked a multitude of emotions, especially as we felt firsthand the heartbreak that Mac experienced at the death of her sister and the discovery of who--and what--she is. She is funny and clever, and the way she describes Jericho's reactions to her is priceless. The first person point of view added so much to the story, as the descriptions were written so that I could put myself in Mac's place and actually see them happen. There is so much mystery in the story that having it told from Mac's perspective only adds to it--and leaves me needing more!!!And the million dollar question: what exactly is Jericho? I so can't wait to find that out! I've never met such an enigmatically intriguing character, and I must have more. He just out of reach at this time, but he's gradually warming up and I just know I'm going to need a box of Kleenex nearby when Mac tears down the barriers he's erected. As the story progresses, we get little glimpses of him that warm the heart.Their Happily Ever After will be one that I will be sticking around for."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I tend to agree with many of the negative reviews that I've seen for this book. A girlfriend of mine, and long-time member of my book club, recommended the Fever series to me and compared it to Twilight (a series that we both enjoyed). Although I don't think that the Twilight books are particularly well written, I found the story to be engaging and I enjoyed the character development. Other than the fact that there is a supernatural element in both series, I don't find any other parallels. The characters in Darkfever are undeveloped and not particularly likable, I don't care for the fact that the book ends abruptly (though I was forewarned by other reviews so I expected it), and certain elements of the story - the death-by-sex Fae and the uncomfortable scenes that arise from the main female protagonist's encounters with him being at the top of my list - feel forced and just plain bizarre. All of that being said, the book was a fast read and I think that the overall concept for the book is interesting so I am giving it two stars. While I bought a used copy of this first book off of Amazon, I will be getting the rest of my copies from the library and giving my copy of Darkfever away. If you are thinking about checking this out for some light reading - though the themes are certainly not light - I would recommend that you also venture out to your local library.Update: As I mentioned in my initial review, I checked out the remaining books in the Fever series from the library and I'm pleased to say that I really enjoyed books 2, 3, and 4 (and am looking forward to the final book later this year). They still have cliffhanger endings (though more artfully executed than in the first book), I did tire of reading our heroine's cutesy curse words, and the sexual element can be over the top, but the characters were much better developed and more likable - or more interesting at least. Although I'm leaving my rating of this book at just two stars, I would recommend that you read it anyway because the subsequent books in the series are worth your time if you enjoy the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a tantalizing introduction to a seamy underworld centered in Dublin, Ireland. Mackayla Lane, a 22-year old Southern Belle, goes to Dublin to try to find answers about Alina's (her older sister) murder. She is sucked into the Fae world, just as Alina was. Mac seems to be somewhat more fortunate than Alina in that she has attracted two very powerful allies, V'Lane (a Seelie Prince) and Jericho Z. Barrons (a ???). Mac is shallow and blissfully ignorant, but she is quickly (and rudely) awakened to the danger the world is in.Despite the author's beginnings as a romance novelist, this is NOT a romance. This is a gritty fantasy fiction with a bit of lust thrown in.Darkfever is the first installment of the Fever saga. I have now read the first three, and I regret doing so before all five installments have been published. There is one storyline. It's a huge saga, of that there is no doubt. But, it is one story, despite being serialized. (Think of your favorite long book, then imagine it being chopped into five parts, each sold separately, a year or so apart. Yeah.)I had written a similar caution in my review for Faefever, but realized that potential readers should be forewarned before even starting the series. As much as I am enjoying the series, I doubt it will end up being worth the nearly $100 I will have paid for it.So, my recommendation to potential readers is to wait until all five books have been released, then borrow them from your local public library. At that point, decide for yourself if this saga is worth buying."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane is a bright, colorful, and overall happy girl.Her sister is murdered in Ireland, the only clue left to her is a strange message on her cellphone, the same cellphone she had dropped in the pool. Mac feels guilty that she had missed her sister's last call she'd ever make.She decides to go to Ireland to avenge her sister and to find out answers. What Mac finds in Ireland is that she sees things she has never seen before, monsters who prey on human flesh and more. Mac is thrown outside of her pretty world into a horrid one where she has to be constantly on guard in order to survive. Mac meets Jericho Barrons, a man who seems to be looking for the same thing she is; a book called the Sinsar Dubh. Mac is on a mission and she has to win.Dark Fever will keep you up all night reading.You feel like you are on the adventure wth Mac everystep of the way.Moning does a great job with the Fever series, the novels aren't all about sex and romance. If anything they are more about mystery and adventure. She blends in so many good aspects to make a good story.How scary would it be to be in Mac's place? Your sister dies in Ireland and all of a sudden you can see monsters all around you? Wow.I'd have to say Mac is a strong character.She changes a lot in the book, necessary developments,and Moning does excellant work in bringing this about. The books are not confusing and everything happens in chronological order.Dark fever left me waiting desperately for Blood Fever to come out. I HAD to know what happens to Mac. Moning is an author you want see good things from for the rest of your life. Her books leave you wanting more and more! I want to cry everytime I get to the last chapter because I dont want the book to end because its that good."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I found this book to be an ok read. I found Mac the main character to annoying and shallow, way to obsessed with her appearance. The detailed descriptions of Mac clothes and appearance were way over done. When I read a book I really don't care if a character's outfit matches her pink manicure and pedicure. Maybe in the next books the author won't be as descriptive. I don't find the main characters likable and the story dragged. But I did finish it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didn't order this book when it first came out because the reviews from reviewers like me did not sound good. But last week I found this book at a sale for 2 bucks and bought it. Was I wrong to listen to the first reviewers? Yes! Yes! Yes! This is an awesome start to a wonderful series. There is very little romance in the first two books so maybe that is why the reviewers were abit hard on the novel. However, I love it.Mackayla Lane is searching for her sister, who has disappeared. The last message she got was very confusing and she knows something terrible happened. When her sister's body was found it was terribly ripped and torn. Traveling to Ireland against her parents wishes she follows in her sister's footsteps and discovers that she is one of a unique few people who can see the fae. She meets a mysterious man in a book shop and from there she falls deeper and deeper into the mystery of the Fae.Jericho Barrens owns the book store but he is much more than a shop keeper. Mac can't figure him out and she is leery of him for more than one reason. He seems to know alot about what is going on and somehow she knows he is involved deeply in the mystery.Togather they are searching for Fae artifacts, Mac has the power to recognize anything made by the Fae. The Fae are dangerous and deadly, only with the help of a man she hardly trusts can Mac find her way around and try to discover what happened to her sister.I loved it and bought BLOODFEVER right away, the next one FAEFEVER comes out in September. Do not miss this series. It is outstanding in the genre."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a fun book. No, it's not a romance. No, it's not a \\"young adult\\" book. It's a book about a young adult coming to terms with life in a chaotic and challenging situation. Which makes it a *story.* Duh. In any case, I don't know why people whine about what other people write.I liked that the lead character was a 20-something Georgia peach -- clueless, aimless, and fearless because she didn't know any better.

If, however, you are looking for a sizzling romance, you may be disappointed. This book is different from previous books in Ms. Moning's immortal highlander series in that it is written in the first person. The story, a murder mystery, unfolds as seen through the eyes of the victim's sister. Some of the Fae concepts introduced in Ms. Moning's previous books are seen here together with an abundance of new dark Fae characters and concepts. After finishing this book I found myself looking over my shoulder when out jogging alone at night."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can hardly wait for the next book.

I would give it a higher rating but Mac's personality annoyed me to the point where I had to deduct points. That being said, I did read the entire series, which I am glad is completed because the cliffhangers at the each book's end really would have driven me crazy. All in all a solid series that I would recommend to folks who, say, like the Mercy Thompson or Rachel Morgan series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read lots of paranormal and I thought this book was really good.

I think a lot of my reluctance was coming from two areas.First would be the writing style. In a lot of instances the author would add something to the effect of \\"I didn't know this at the time but would find out years later...\\" or \\"Barrons and I didn't discuss it then but we would weeks later.\\" It is said quite a lot was starting to grate on me a little.Second is Mac in general. I think this is just because I am coming off a few books where the lead is a strong and confident female. I know she has been thrown into a world she didn't know about and didn't want to know about but you are knee deep now, buck up! Too many times she would refer to her 'old life' of bartending, fashion magazines, sunbathing, clothes, her long blood hair or her pink nails. She is just very superficial. Even toward the end when she finally kicked ass she thinks about her three broken nails and after she was applying her new coat of nail polish. I hope she is over the little lamb lost act in the next book and has finally accepted what she is and what she needs to do.There is so much to learn about Barrons and I have a feeling I am going to enjoying finding those things out..."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this book as it was the selection from my Kindle Shelf post. In the beginning, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. It seemed like a lot was going on and I was getting confused. However, I persevered and I am glad that I did. As the pieces slowly came together, I was intrigued and wanted to keep reading. It was a quick read after that.There are a lot of things that were going on that I don't want to give away, but were the best part of the book. I guess what I can say is that as you read, don't get discouraged with all that is going on. The pieces of the puzzle are not as cleanly put together and so getting through the rough areas can be tough.I did like Patrick and Darina, the main characters. Patrick holds a lot of secrets and some he did not know himself. However, Darina's people also hold a lot of secrets as well, and as these are revealed this is when the story comes alive. The author has created some great characters besides Patrick and Darina, the two young boys grabbed my heart strings.I loved the paranormal action going on. This is what I think the other books are hinged on. This book definitely leaves you hanging. Several things have not been resolved, in fact several avenues are left unfulfilled. I am intrigued enough to want to continue on with the series.What to Read Next?If you enjoyed this but want less confusion, try Julie Garwood's The Secret. Definitely very similar in feel."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Different from what I normally read, but I couldn't put the book down!!!I can't wait to tear through the other ones."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I do not recommend on it's own. the story has potential but it never gets there, you never really know any of the characters, the plot is not strong and there is no ending!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book is a total disappointment. I loved the \\"Highlanders\\" books and expected this book to be the start of another equally enjoyable series. No such luck! The main female character MacKayla Lane (O'Connor) is really boring and she rambles on and on about irrelevant rubbish. The book could have been condensed to half the size and still the reader would still not have missed anything of the essential plot. Mind you what Plot? That is also so thin I can't believe this is the same author who wrote the \\"Highlander\\" series. As for the main male character, Jericho Barrons, well he is totally unbelievable and certainly has no redeeming qualities. Maybe the next in this series will be better, who knows? All I know is I won't be buying it, maybe I will get it from the Library. I own all of the \\"Highlander\\" books but I won't be buying this series.

It is a dark book full of evil characters and a story that isn't so great.

I wish I had read the reviews here before purchasing it. First of all, this is hands down, no kidding, not ambiguous at all, NOT A ROMANCE NOVEL!!!! It may develop into a romance series, but it has NO ROMANCE WHATSOEVER in it as yet. Okay, I take that back, the heroine gets chills once when the ostensible hero puts his arm around her - and she maybe once wonders what it would be like to kiss him. There's also a sexy fairy who makes women want him so bad they strip off their clothes immediately and start panting. That actually had some potential, despite how lame it sounds. But seriously, aside from that, nothing. And really, I don't just mean there was no sex in the novel - I do mean, there was no romance at all. The relationship that builds between the hero and heroine is not a romantic one. It's interesting, but it is not (yet, at least) romantic.I am REALLY REALLY ANGRY with the publishing company for marketing this as a romance. SHAME ON THEM, the should have known better.Aside from that, however, it actually is a decent book - despite my still livid anger from being TRICKED into buying this book by a soulless corporation who probably doesn't give a rat's behind that I'm in graduate school and only had enough time to read one \\"pleasure\\" book before finals and reasearch and papers consumed my life for the next several months and instead of the romance novel I was hoping for, I got this. But despite all that, hey, she's Karen Moning - she's a great author.So, if you're looking for a good paranormal, go for it. If you're looking for romance, skip it. Or maybe just wait till the next one in the series comes out and then read them together (if the series is actually going to go in the romance direction)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just finished the last page and I loved it.

I thought it was a follow up to the other highlander books, but it is a different storyline, but along the same path. Well worth the money!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm a big fan of Moning's books. I love her stories and characters and often re-read her books. That said, when I first saw the synopsis of this book last year I refused to read it. I didn't want to read a book in an ongoing series where there is no happily ever after at the end of the first book. I definitely didn't want to read a romance written in first person narrative. I've read other romances set in first person narrative and found them less than enjoyable.After nearly a year I finally decided to read \\"Darkfever\\" and approached it like I'd never read a romance or any of Moning's previous work (and didn't see the cover art which has nothing to do with the story). I admit that against my will I like the book and will continue to read the series.Other fans have commented that Mac is immature. Yes she is. She has five books to grow through. If she started out as an \\"alpha\\" heroine, she'd have no character arc and no development. She needs to start out in a place we're not used to. Sometimes our heroines too easily accept the crazy situations they are placed in. As unhappy as we might be to admit it, Mac is much closer to the truth in how an average young woman her age would act. Mac's character provides drama because she is absolutely unaware of the danger. Even as fans, we are unable to anticipate all the new dangers that are introduced.In addition to being a fan of Moning's books, I'm also a \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" fan and I enjoyed the movie \\"Legally Blonde.\\" There is something immensely satisfying about a tiny, blonde girl (who is perceived by others as shallow and not too smart) kicking some serious butt. There is humor in contrasting two sides of these types of characters: the seemingly superficial, ultra fashion conscious and the smart, intuitive fighter. If you like Buffy or Elle, you'll enjoy reading about Mac.Take a chance on this book. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla, also known as Mac, starts out as just a typical blonde 22 year old in this book. She's flighty and a little shallow, and loves the color pink, her only worry in the world is what she wants to wear that day. Everything changes when she gets the worst phone call of her life, the one that tells her that her sister, Alina, has been brutally murdered in Dublin. When she finds out the police have stopped investigating Alina's death, Mac sets out to find the killer herself. She quickly gets in way over her head when she runs into the mysterious Barrons and finds out she can see the Fae, a very rare talent. The Fae do not like to be seen, so Mac must learn everything she can from Barrons quickly if she is to have any hope of survival.While she still has a ways to go, Mac did come a long way towards growing up and character growth. She was raised in a very sheltered life, and when she is thrown into this \\"new\\" one, it really showed. However, after much protesting, she finally started to realize that she couldn't just hide her head in the sand anymore. She is very important to the fate of humanity. I think with some time she will truly become a force to be reckoned with. Even at her most flightiness in the beginning, some of her inner strength showed considering only someone with a solid constitution would be able to fly across the ocean to a strange country to track down a murderer. Yes, this idea is a little foolish, but requires strength none the less.I loved Jericho Barren's character. He is a gruff, opinionated, very masculine character. He does everything he can to get rid of Mac in the beginning, but when she gets too deep he takes her under his wing. He insists its not for altruist purposes, that he only is helping her because she can be of use to him. However, every so often he shows a slight softness under that gruff armor. I have a feeling a love interest is brewing between the two. I think the two would work well as they would balance each other out, with Mac softening him, and he would toughen her up some.This book was really good, while mostly a world building book as it did take a while for anything to really happen. However, I didn't mind the initial slowness of the book, as Mac really needed things thrown at her slowly to give her a chance to grow up a little each time. It ended on a cliff hanger, while frustrating, makes me very eager to read the next installment. This book was a little dark, with no real romance, but there seems to be a definite potential in the future for that. It is a very good first installment in a series, and I cannot wait to see what more is in store for Mac."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This was one of my first forays into urban-fantasy-romance. I actually think the first book in the series is the weakest but I was interested enough to keep reading the rest and now I am HOOKED. Mac's character in this book is weak BUT I can appreciate the transformation she goes through and in the latter books she is presented as a more serious and less annoying character.BUT the real reason to read this series? JERICHO BARRONS. His character and one-liners are what keep me hooked. He is the perefct dark alpha male fantasy with a healthy dose of sarcastic wit. If you prefer sexy blonds keep reading for V'lane.There are a few weaknesses in the first book which thankfully go away. These are:1) Mac constantly thinking of herself as pretty. I get that you have long tanned legs. Get over it. This self-centered commentary basically stopped by Book 2.2) Fashion disaster!! What modern day 22 year old goes around wearing yellow linen suits or full length rainbow frothy skirts? Thankfully Ms. Moning stops the Mac fashion show from Book 2 forward."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Tastes are so subjective, the value of them can be questionable. That's the dilemma I faced with Darkfever. Okay... let's just get to it. Darkfever wasn't my kind of read. What's interesting is I can see why a lot of other people would like it for the very same reasons I didn't.Let's start with the main character, Mac. She reminded me a lot of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse. In fact, I wouldn't even be surprised if the two were related. Southern bells, blond, perky cute, and both prone to getting into situations most would avoid. Although, I do believe Mac is a wee less intelligent than Sookie. All-in-all, the Mac/Sookie persona isn't bad. I admit to being a Sookie follower, even if I think she's too stupid to live at times. But really, one Sookie is enough for me. Despite the subtle differences, I just couldn't get into the Mac girl. *Subjective dislike*Barrons, on the other hand, I liked him. I guess, liked isn't the exact word. It's not like I'm fond of him as a person. I'd certainly never befriend him. HOWEVER, the character added a unique flare. Is he good? Is he bad? Just who is this guy? I liked the mystery of Barrons, but would have liked to have learned something significant about him by the end of the story.Okay... some weird turnoffs for me.I'm not into fashion. Here's where my husband had to remind me tastes are subjective. Lots of women are big into the glamor, makeup, clothes, and accessories. The main reason I wear clothing is so others won't be embarrassed. Some days you can catch me gardening in a nightgown or bathrobe. I don't think I've worn eye shadow since my wedding day, and even then it was so light folks probably didn't notice. Mac focused A LOT on fashion. As for me, I could care less what funky name her nail polish had or what shade of pink her hair bow was. Frankly, I got tired of reading about her attire and accessories and found myself skipping over paragraphs of description, given in a laundry-list style, to get to the meat of the story. *Subjective dislike*Then we had the Fae, which is a huge part of the story. Okay, without the Fae, there would be no story. I discovered after reading the Iron King by Julie Kawaga that I wasn't a fan of the Seelie and Unseelie courts. I like my faeries to be like Tinkerbell... not human-sized beings of royalty. This is where the importance of reading blurbs come into play. Still, I'd heard of Ms. Moning and had wanted to read her works for awhile. So the Fae might not have been a big enough discouragement to have avoided this novel. *Subjective dislike*Even before I realized this was a Fae novel, I remember thinking this might not be my read, even as early as page 8. You might wonder why I kept reading, because I had contemplated shelving it. I remembered the slow start of Unearthly and how much I loved that novel once I hit around page 40-60. So many people boasted about the Darkfever series, I pushed onward, thinking it might be a funky start.Well, it wasn't. The writing style wasn't to my preference. It was rather rambly. Before you mention Ramblings of an Amateur Author, keep in mind I'm a hypocrite. I do things I don't always enjoy in others. Rambling-yeah... not so fond of listening to others do it. Told from the first person point of view, Mac loved to ramble. I could almost get over that, except she ruined the story in other ways also.The way this was written was as if Mac was telling me, the reader, what had happened during her adventure in Dublin. I've started books written with sentences like you'd never imagined life would be so tough, but I've never warmed up to the style (*Subjective dislike). Mac took it one step further with foretelling at the end of most scenes and sometimes in the middle, which made an otherwise okay storyline too predictable for words, and frankly, rather anticlimactic.Here's an example by what I mean. I'm all excited about an upcoming fight. I can feel my heart pick up speed in anticipation. Yeah... I get that into books. My eyes are glued to the page. Mac reveals her plan, and I'm like oh yeah! Let's do this thing. I'm tensed, and then she narrates:\\"It could have worked that way, it should have worked that way, but I made one critical error.\\"At that moment, I put the book down and contemplate tearing it in half. Why in the world did she ruin the surprise? If anything ruined the book, it was stuff like that in every single scene. Seriously. I'd be hard pressed to find a scene without that kind of foretelling. What's wrong with slamming a reader with the unexpected when it happens.Story also hopped back and forth between time rather just telling it in a linear fashion. I hated that. I thought a matter was settled and was ready to move on, since we had. Then she popped back to the time directly after two scenes ago and filled in a gap. Why not just fill in the information so the gap was never there to begin with? *More subjective dislikes*Finally, the tense wasn't consistent. Others might not notice or care, for me the switches between past and present tense were jarring. Yeah... I'm all over the place in this post with tense.... but remember... hypocrite here.So Darkfever wasn't for me, and I'm certainly not ragging on it. This novel/series has received a lot of praise, and I'm sure for good reason. If you're into the Fae, fashion, and Southern bell-like heroines, you might really dig this work.I did have a favorite passage. Perhaps it's because I'm as morbid as Mac.\\"Don't accuse me of being morbid when I'm merely the product of a culture that buries the bones of the ones they love in pretty, manicured flower gardens so they can keep them nearby and go talk to them whenever they feel troubled or depressed. That's morbid. Not to mention bizarre. Dogs bury bones, too.\\"One other thing, if you're looking for a story with a finite ending, this isn't it. Darkfever is only the beginning and very open-ended."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Can't recommend anyone start this series. Books are installments, not stand-alone stories and get more depressing and unsatisfactory as it drags out. Two male leads are domineering and abusive, if you're into that, rape theme runs thru first three books (so far) and heroine starts as a weak sort of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (minus campy humor and interesting friends) and gets darker and more pathetic. This book just kind of sets the scene without resolving anything, and isn't much fun. The 'ick' factor increases in subsequent books. Really disappointing for fans of this author."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After not reading fiction for about 20 years this was recommended to me and reawakened my love of reading so much have been reading ever since. Its the first of a series told over five books so don't expect the answers at the end of each book.

You get to see Mac grow from a 22 year old carefree color me pink girl to a saviour of the world vision in black, and although the journey is arduous and life threatening at times its well worth hanging on for the ride of your life.Often found in the romance section this is certainly not your usual romance so don't expect hearts and flowers but does have a romantic thread evolving throughout the series.Looking forward to more books in the Fever WorldBloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)Faefever: The Fever SeriesDreamfever: The Fever SeriesShadowfever"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read all 5 of the fever Series and enjoyed every single word on every single page. Enjoyed them so much that I read the Highlander series too.I originally downloaded the book for free on the Kindle and started reading with no preconception...because really how could a FREE book be THAT good. I was more than pleasantly surprised. I loved the contrast of Mac's innocent pink hued view of life smacking against Barrons' hard edged black world. I loved her for her innocence and desire to keep her world full of color even though she was being pushed on all sides by sorrow and grief to make her world dark. Mac 1.0 (as she calls herself) IS overprotected and spoiled, but it is from that point that she is able to grow-up. Mac is forced into an ever more dangerous existence where she has to learn to rely on the one person she fears to trust fully. With each book in the series Mac's world crashes a little more and she is forced to recreate herself in response to the situations around her.These books are a journey thru Hell and back. The reader is just as confused as the characters and that is part of what makes these books terrific. They are an edge of your seat roller coaster ride where new discoveries and dangers are around every corner. Just like Mac's bookstore these books have it all... humor, romance, mystery, fantasy and adventure. It was a terrific adventure that I'm sorry to see end.

During her search for answers, she uncovers a world she never knew existed. The more she unravels, the more she gets drawn into this dangerous world- that includes some dangerous men. As she tries to find answers about who to trust and who killed her sister, she also is finding out answers about herself. Typically, I always figure out \\"who did it\\" well before an author spills the beans.

While there, she discovers that she is one of the few humans who can see faeries, which are actually aliens from another dimension with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (OK, I'm getting too supermannish here!). She teams up with a mystery man named Jerico who helps her realize her powers and learn about how she can use them to fight the icky critters that betrayed and killed her sister. The romantic tension between her and Jericho is nice, but never comes to fruition, thus saving the book from degenerating into a paranormal romance (shudder, ick, yuck!).

It's a little slow and sometimes very confusing with all the creatures and rare terms everywhere. Also, it's written in first person, something I usually don't enjoy very much.The main problem I had with the book is the heroine. I couldn't stand her!! She's immature, dumb, irritating, too pink... She really got into my nerves, and I don't buy that she's young and was very sheltered. I'm young too (23), and I couldn't identify with her in anything.At least she matures a little as the story progresses, but I was too annoyed with her to care.The hero, Jericho Barrons, is more interesting, although he is very stereotypical in the sort of dark-sexy-mysterious way. It seemed to me that I'd read him in countless romances, but at least he has potential.The last problem I had is that the book doesn't have an end. It feels more like the first chapters of a story than a book of its own, which is very frustrating. I think it would be better to wait for all the sequels and read them in order, and from paperbacks or the library.

The latest installment, Shadowfever, which is book 5, was receiving so much attention in many of the book groups/clubs that I participate in. There were people literally counting down the minutes to when their pre-orders kicked in to download. I figured if so many people were on the edge of their seats in anticipation of it, then I had to give it a look-see.So I went out of line in my \\"to be read\\" book list and downloaded the 1st of Karen Marie Moning's Fever series expecting brilliant things. I was not disappointed in the least. As a matter of fact, I became an addict. The world created by Karen was so well developed with mystery and intrigue that I could not wait to get to the next page. And when I wasn't able to read, I was constantly thinking about it, pining for that moment that I'd be able to pick it back up and enter this world again.There was nothing I did not like in this book. The plot was fantastic. MacKayla Lane, a simple bartender who's only real worry is that her favorite color nail polish will be discontinued is thrown into a world that she never could have imagined when she finds out her sister, and in most respects, her best friend is murdered while studying abroad in Ireland. After listening to a message that her sister left her before she died telling her that she had been betrayed and that their lives were not as they seemed, Mac sets out to find her sister's killer. What she finds in Dublin is beyond her wildest dreams. Not only does she encounter monsters that shouldn't even exist, but she also uncovers that she is not who she thought she was.The characters were superbly written. While Mac seemed to be so nave at times, she made up for it with her determination and heart. Best of all, she had my favorite feature, wittiness. I love a great witty character and Mac was sometimes downright, laugh-out-loud funny.The supernatural characters were very well described. I could picture the grotesque monsters that Mac encountered and found myself cringing at the sight. What I did not cringe at was Jericho Barrons. Ahhh, the infamous Mr. Barrons. This has to be my favorite male lead character. He is so mysterious and sexy. Just when you think he is cold as ice and shows no emotion, he lets us see that little sign of HOTNESS. I don't know exactly what it is about this man (or whatever he may be), but he had me at hello. And will probably continue to have me for the rest of the series. Hell, probably after the series is long over. Well, am I right, ladies?I anticipate that this series will be one of my best reads of 2011 and I highly recommend those of you that enjoy urban fantasy/paranormal reads with a bit of sexy steamy to top it all off, to check it out if you haven't already. Me, I'm off to read the next installment, Bloodfever, as soon as I can get my hands on it.Note: I do not recommend this book to younger readers, as there is adult sexual content in it.Have you read the Fever series yet?

I brought the book home and started reading...6 hours later I had finished DarkFever and the long wait for the next book began. I decided that I would have to read it again, because of the many questions I kept asking myself about various parts in the story.

I have watched Mac change from a fluffy little southern girl with no real purpose in life, into a person that I envision being someone I would like to know and have a vested interest her story.

But what the reader should take into consideration is that fact that each Highlander book was pretty much the beginning and conclusion to the assigned heroine and hero; this Fever Series (which I'm hearing is supposed to be five books) features the same heroine throughout the entire thing. So you have to read the books like episodes; and expect cliffhangers.While eloquently written in typical Moning fashion; I did, however, find myself skipping throughout extra, in-depth details throughout both books. While she obviously thoroughly researched for this book, which I appreciated, it was a bit much in sections.I warn all Moning fans NOT to listen to the audio of these books first. I made the sad attempt; and was horrified to hear the 22 yr old heroine sounding like a 60 yr. old southern grandma (almost the equivalence of the \\"Oracle\\" from the \\"Matrix\\"). But the absolute worst was the male character. Personally I find it quite difficult to imagine a sexy male character/hero when the vocalist made him sound like Bilbo Baggins. I got to disc 3, and couldn't listen anymore. It says something about how much I respect this author that I even picked up the books after listening to the horrific audio.I have faith in Moning, however, that this series as whole will probably be great; but I agree with other readers that maybe I should've waited until the entire series was finished before starting it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've been eyeing this book for quite some time..not willing to buy it at the hardcover price and when it went to paperback I still felt it wasn't worth investing the time. Time is a precious commodity for me. Being on a long flight is what did it for me. Let me start with the positives: I like the 1st person aspect of the book. I like getting in the head of the heroine a bit more. That's one of my nits with romance books that the women seem so shallow. Here Mac seems like a full bodied character with tons of personality. She does a good job with fleshing her out. I was ok going along with the story..I'm a sci/fi/fantasy fan which is what drew me to the book. Negatives: too many loose ends, mysteries not yet revealed but hinted at. I don't mid the mysteries but it really seems drawn out for sake of getting the reader primed for the second book. Maybe I just don't feeling duped into buying the second book to see how it plays out. I would have like some sort of conclusion. I didn't get it so two stars."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Why hurry to the romance? When I'm reading books, I enjoy the leading up to the good stuff. Usualy, if the two main characters fall in love early in the book, it gets boring with the same lovey-dovey stuff going on every page. I'd rather read a whole book that has no romance and then read the next with more of it and then the ones after that with even more romance than before. Building up the romance in 5 books is way better than summing it all up in one book. I like to go back and read my books over. With this series, I can read all 5 books and not get bored with the same level of romance going on through all 5. Plus, I read the sneak peek to the next book, and it seemed pretty exciting. You can read it on Karen Moning's website on the latest newsletter. Anyway, if you don't like to read a lot, then one book that speeds up the romance might be enough for you. But for us possessed readers, we love the suspense, gives us more pages to read. Karen probably doesn't want to spoil the story with a quick romance. Give her a chance, she's going to make it hot, she always does. ;)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ok, like everyone else, i was a bit skeptical about Dark Fever, because she said point blank that it wasnt like her other books,which i loved loved loved. However, i found the book wonderful, true there is no romance, or sex, but i was so completely drawn in to Dublin, and the things that Mac was experiencing. I know this book cant really be called a romance, in comparison to her other books, but i dont see how other readers didnt enjoy it. I found the book to be well written, mesmerizing and i was completely sucked in.Like the other reviewer said \\"Its not a romance novel YET\\" I personally think that when Jericho and Mac get together its going to be hot, and i will be patiently waiting for that to happen. I am dreading waiting the long months for Bloodfever to be released, but i definitely will be buying it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am a huge Karen Marie Moning fan. I mean, I mark my calendars with her book release dates, just to be first in line when they come out. I buy her books in hardcover, because I can't wait on paperback release. But this latest book, Darkfever, has left me very disappointed. I was assuming this would be a romance. It was NOT. The story wasn't bad (I could have done without the first person point of view). But I am a romance novel collector and reader. Once I made it through 3/4 of the book, I finally had to accept that romance just wasn't happening. I was so let down, it felt as if a good friend had played a nasty trick on me. Again, the story seems to be a great paranormal mystery or thriller, I'll just have to pass on the remainder of the series(I must have my romance fix). I wish Ms. Moning the best of luck in her new genre."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"i pre-ordered this book because i had stumbled upon the highlander's kiss while on a 6 hours bus ride home. After that i knew i had to read all her work. She is one of the few writers that makes romance worth reading because she writes in a way that draws the reader in with researched details and true humor. i have read all her previous work so i was highly anticipating this book. i knew it was going to be a series however there are ways to write series and yet have a solid closing. Her previous books were sort of like series yet they stood alone. The first person narrative style also made it shallow. It is hard to project series of connected events from one person view. The depth and richness of delving into the mind Barron, Lord Master, the sex Fae and etc that are critical to grounding the reader, were missing. This caused some readers to feel annoyance instead of appreciation for the MAC's mind. In addition, the book could have definatly been longer if the story is going to take five series. Can you imagine the diappointment i felt when i realize i that milking and savoring this book for days will not be possible because it is so short? On the positive, it provides more details about the Fae world that any KMM fan would enjoy and the characters are more realistic. Mac is like any 22 year old girl from the south,plus the two main characters didn't just fall in love and start humping on site. They are going through the process of building a rapport that would be expected in reality. This i think is the true romance of this series. Can you imagine when they will finally kiss? Please KMM if you are gonna pull a cliffhanger stunt at least shorten the time between the series to like 5 or 6 months. To the avid readers out there that enjoy humor, and good writing Carl Hiassen's new book Nature Girl is out, i will defiantly be using it too wean this wait"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When Mac's sister is murdered, she decides to head out to Ireland to track down the killer herself. However, when she gets there she has no idea what she just stepped into. She spent her whole life not knowing what she is, a sidhe-seer, one who can see the fae. Oh and not just any sidhe-seer this action barbie is a Null, which means that she can freeze the fae with a touch. So when she comes across Barrons who just happens to be looking for a book that only a sidhe-seer can find, he decides to put up with her pink painted nails and her brightly colored Barbie clothes in order to get his hands on the book.I really couldn't handle Mac at first. She walks around with a juicy purse and pastels... and she is blonde! Not that I have a thing against blondes but the description of her takes me back to my childhood when I would play Barbies. However, you have to push through her naivety and superficial ways in the beginning because by the end of the book you start to see her get serious a little. I still think there is a lot more growing left for her but at least it is a start.Barrons... where do I start with him. He is dark, mysterious and can be quite overpowering. You would think that would be bad but some reason it works for him. He is as Alpha as it can get. For the second he is introduced into the story her screams predator. He threatens Mac and even choked her but for some reason, I didn't hate him because it suits him. He knows the danger that the world is in with the releasing of all the unseelie fae and he isn't about to let some pampered American come bouncing in and screwing up everything. I mean, if the world was about to end as we know it, wouldn't you get a little hyped up over things and want to smack dumb people upside their heads? Heck, there isn't the danger of Unseelie Fae over running the earth and I still want to hit some of the stupid people I come across.I think my favorite thing about this book besides Barrons is the world and character building. Moning put a great deal of detail in her story to paint the reader a picture of everything that she has created. You understand the reasoning behind what makes the characters tick and even though I sometimes have a hard time envisioning creatures outside the box, I was able to picture the Gray Man with no problem."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What a page turner! A friend suggested I read this series and I am so glad I did. This is a great book, tons of characters that are at the very beginning of their development. A great story & a page turner. I truly can't stop reading these books. Can't wait for book #2."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The Fever Series is is multilayered in every sense. The world that Karen Moning has created has different levels of reality which Mac struggles to understand until the very last book. The story is also multilayered in that it is a highly entertaining and highly addictive fun story, but it is also psychological, philosophical, and political at the same time. You wouldn't guess that it had so much depth at first blush. Mac can sometimes appear shallow and dwell on things that anyone at her age would. For example, she can't decide whether she should let go of her \\"Rainbow Girl\\" persona. I think this story could have been an epic to outdo all of the other paranormal fiction stories if it had toned down some of the surface value reflections. The best part of the Fever Series is the incredibly creative world and stunning visual imagery. It honestly feels as if you are having a waking dream while reading it. My favorite books are probably some of the later ones. I can't tell which was which at this point because they were all so addictive that I read one right after the other in an exhausting marathon. It's that addictive!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Let my preface this by saying I am an avid reader of fantasy fiction; I finished Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series in 2 months! Loved them all. When I first read some of the reviews for this series I was kind of shocked at the wonderful reviews it had gotten, being as I had never heard of them or the author before... I am SOOOO glad that I bought this book, it is truly wonderful. The first person narrative is spot on; you really get a sense of who Mac is and everything that she is going through- pain/heartache/depression/revenge/anger/lust/happiness... it's all here!!! I'm now on the 3rd book and can I just tell you how in love with Jericho Barrons I am?! AHHHH... I have a problem with falling for fictional men. The thing I love the most about this book is that, although it is about the Fae Seelie/Unseelie Courts, etc... It seems so real. The author has really done her homework in regards to old Irish and Gaelic folklore including the Tuatha De Danann (This is real stuff, folks!) and a lot of the Fae themselves... Her description of Dublin is so detailed, you can almost feel the cobblestone below your feet as you follow Mac around in her city of foreboding apocalypse and lustful endeavors with Barrons and V'lane... Not to mention the cryptic, almost silence of the lambs sections where you're thinking-- WOW, I was not expecting anything like this! This book can get creepy, keep the lights on, not step into shadows kind of reading. The kind that I love! It is my suggestion that you purchase this entire series, you will be SO happy you did!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Awesome series, original and captivating. A new type of heroine battling a mysterious enemy and battling her personal demons while trying to save our world. Had me glued to the pages well into the night!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I LOVED this novel. It was exciting, totally imaginative, and captured my attention like none other. If you're looking for something sexy and adventurous this is the series for you. The plot is exciting and keeps you interested. The characters are enthralling, esp Mac you feel like you ARE Mac. It's not a difficult read at all, it's perfect for long plane flights and reading at the beach. Its a great escape!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can't tell you how much I loved this series. I just finished reading it for the third time,and will most defiantly read it again. Karen Moning is a fantastic story teller, she grabs you and whisks you away into a fantasy world. I recommend this series to everybody. Can't wait for \\"Iced\\" to come out this fall"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As I first started reading Darkfever by Karen Marie Moning it seemed to me to be a simple mystery/suspense book with simple characters and simple themes. Makayla Lane was an ordinary young woman, wealthy and a bit bored. She was annoying, to put it bluntly.After she receives a message that her sister who was studying abroad has been murdered in Dublin she goes to Dublin to try to find out what had happened to her sister.Once she gets to Dublin and starts asking questions the pace of the book begins to rev up. Things are not what they seemed. Paranormal fantasy becomes apart of the mystery and suspense of the story. None of the characters are what they seem.I found this to be an awesome book and part of a five-book series that never disappoints. It is entralling! I had a hard time putting these books down, wanting to read through the entire series in as few sittings as possible.I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys paranormal fantasy stories with suspense who are over the age of about fifteen years old."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"One of five books and just won't want it to end! Everyone I've recommended has loved this series as well and has continued to spread the fever.Can't wait for the next book Into the Dreaming, a spin off from the fever!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This was my first foray into dark urban fantasy, and anything written by Ms. Moning. I will say that I bought the entire Feverseries on a whim based soley on the backcover synopsis, and a few of the reviews I read. Without going into lengthy detail concerning the plot, here are the pros and cons I found with Darkfever.Pros:1. The world builing in phenomenal, and richly described. I felt as if there was a dark and seedy reality that counterbalanced the 'normal' everyday Dublin.2. The plot and overall mystery of the novel kept me up all hours, hunting for clues and trying to piece them together with Mac.3. Jericho Z. Barrons, I do not think that I have ever come across a character in fiction (books, television, or films) that had me loving to hate him and just loving him altogether. He is dangerous, snarky, handsome, and a complete puzzle that I wanted to solve. Just as a side note, if this ever gets made into a movie, I pictured JZB as Clive Owens (yum).4. Mac, I loved that she was not perfect, she was just an ordinary girl faced with a terrible tragedy.Cons:1. The first person point-of-view, did turn me off, well scratch that, Mac's point-of-view turned me off for 2/3 of the book. I do not need to know every minute detail of what you are wearing and what you look like. Other than Mac describing herself endlessly and her woe-is-me mindset, I enjoyed connecting with Mac as a stranger in a strange land, trying to understand her heritage.2. Mac, to be honest I thought to myself, what did I just get my self into and thought of returning the entire series. Mac, well I will say she is a character that readers will either love or hate. It might be because this series is told from the perspective of Mac, but for me she came off as childish, naive, and self involved. I will be honest and say that she grated on my nerves for the better part of this book.Yes, Alina was murdered but it is not all about YOU. Cry a river, build and bridge and get over it! I don't want to come off as if I lack compassion and empathy, I fully understand what is it like to lose a family member tragically, but to beat a dead horse, practically every other paragraph got annoying. The reader understands that you are greiving and your reasons for travelling to Ireland, you do not have to remind us every five seconds.I know this sounds as if I hate Mac, I don't, somewhere along the line her character clicked for me, and became less irritating, and more relatable. I think it had more to do with Barrons and then anything else, but I did see a maturing of Mac towards the end of the book.Overall, I did not regret my rash decision to buy this book or the series on a whim. I completed the entire Feverseries in about a month (reviews for books 2-5 to follow,) and felt a bit of a sadness at having come to the end of the series. However, I would recommend to potential readers to pick up Darkefever first before deciding to continue with the series, as quite a few readers loathed the main character Mac. As I stated, she is a type of character that a person with either love or hate, and without spoiling the series I will say that her character grows and transforms through the series, into someone whose story I cared about."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this entire series and the only bad thing about it was that it ended. I absolutely LOVE Moning and again she didnt disappoint."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I envy you if you are just stumbling across this book and thinking about reading it. I didn't think much when I came across it but I picked it up and quickly devoured this book, luckily all books were published and was able to read them one after the next. It's such a beautiful story with the awesome, lovable Mac and the dark and steamy Barrons. If you love Romance, adventures, paranormal, fantasy pick it up now and have all the books ready because you'll want them on hand when you finish each one. I can not wait to read them all over again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Now I finally realized Karen Marie Moning is on the New York Times Bestseller List! She is one of those authors that just blow you away with their writing that you come back hungry for more and more. I have to say that this was my very first Adult Urban Fantasy Series and my all-time favorite. Karen throws us in a world of that I would love to explore to the fullest. Mackayla Lane has just lost her sister in Dublin. She flies to Dublin, Ireland to investigate her sisters murder, but the police has dropped her sister's case. When she arrives she finds out that everything is not as it seems and her world will change forever.Darkfever centers on fae, but not those sweet innocent fae like Tinkerbell, but fae to their darkest, even more darker than you can possibly imagine. The last message from Mackayla's sister was about the Sinsar-Dubh and how Mackalya must find it at all costs, that is when she encounters Jerricho Barrons, he is a total ass, but one of those bad-ass guys you just want all to yourself. Barrons helps Mackayla on her quest in his own way.At first it took me a little bit to really get into this book, and when I did I could not stop reading. I had become addicted to the FEVER! Mackayla Lane is described as the pretty barbie doll, but she is a lot tougher than people give her credit for, through the book Mackayla becomes one of the strongest heroines that I have ever seen in action and she fights for what she believes in. I truly believe by the end of the series that she will become someone both physically and mentally strong.Jerricho Barrons. Oh, my love. I love this guy. At the beginning of the book, I admit he was a complete ass and he is very intimidating at times, but I love him! He is tough, knowledgeable, arrogant, rude, and all the above, but by the end of the novel I truly believe that there is another side to this man than we realize. He is such a mystery that I NEED to know more about this guy. And when I say mysetery I mean it in a way that will drive you crazy. Barrons is after the Sinsar-Dubh and makes that very clear, but what will he do with it when he gets his hands on the book? The both need each other for their own agendas.We also have V'lane, our Fae Prince. His top priority is his queen , but V'lane and his queen need Mackayla to find the Sinsar-Dubh also. I don't really know what to think of V'lane as of yet, he seems like one of them that don't really care for Mackalyla until he gets what he wants. We didn't get much of V'lane, but I hope to find out more of his characters in the next book. Darkfever has a formidable cast of characters that you can't help but love and want to learn more about their pasts, what kind of power are they capable of, and what exactly their agendas are.So basically Darkfever is one of those series I can say why hadn't I read this book sooner? And yes, when of those series where I read each book back to back without stopping because I became addicted to the series. Darkfever has twists and turns that will leave you breathless and craving for the next book in the series. I am looking forward for book 2, Bloodfever and hope that it is even better than Darkfever!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked this up when it was a free kindle download, figuring that despite the book's lineage (first non-romance from a romance (bodice ripper) author) that it didn't cost me anything, so nothing risked.I got pulled into the premise and the world despite my reservations. The writing's nothing that'll be referenced decades hence, but it's clear, it has a strong voice in the narrator/main character, and it's engaging. At the end of the day, what more do we really need from our fiction?The only down side to this is the ending that lacks only \\"to be continued\\" to be the book version of the season ending cliffhanger that the evening soaps used to have. The fact that the story isn't really contained, but sprawls across five books is a little irritating, but I'll still be picking up book two to see what else is really going on in this story's world."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"OMG I love this series. I can't believe I have waited so long to read this. Karen Moning has an incredible talent for bringing rich, interesting incredible characters to life. You will not put this book down until you have read the very last sentence.This is the story of Mackala Lane, a spoiled beautiful little Barbie who loses her heart when her sister is murdered while away at school in Dublin, Ireland. Mac, much to the dismay of her parents, travels to Ireland to get to the bottom of what happened to her sister. Mac's character evolves so incredibly after she meets Jericho Barrons, a mysterious and sexy man that just oozes danger, who helps her discover who she is, gives her a home and teaches her how to protect herself from the Unseelie monsters that lurk in the shadows. All throughout this series you are left wondering what Mac is constantly asking, \\"What the hell is Jericho Barrons?\\" He is obviously more than human, but it's a constant mystery throughout the series. He is not your typical hero, he is charming, but he can also be a total bastard or as Mac would put it a \\"Constant Jackass,\\" but he is the most fascinating character I have ever read about. I just can't get enough of this guy. Mac works for Jericho and is helping him find the Sinsar Dubh, a powerful book of Dark Magic that Jericho and everyone else in town wants in a bad way, including Mac as it was her sister's last wish. Mac also meets V'lane who is a Seelie Prince and a Death by Sex Fae. He is dangerous and sexual and oh so hot, but he can't hold a candle to Jericho IMO. He wants the book too and wants to use Mac to get it.There is quite a bit of danger, a lot of humor and oh so sexy banter between Mac and Jericho. This series is hot and addicting and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever started out a little slow but then picked up the pace.

Hey it is fiction, but some of the story line was seriously hokey, but it kept me coming back for more. The end was not done as well as it could have been done. Overall if you like paranormal fiction this is a decent read, I will certainly be checking out the next book to see if the story line improves but honestly as far as paranormals I have read go, this one ranks right there with the rest of them. I give it a 4."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Okay, so the main character is Mac. She is a 22 year old girl who has just had her world turned upside down. Lounging by the pool anxiously awaiting the day her sister returns, she gets the call that her beloved sister Alina has been murdered 4,000 miles away in Ireland. The contrast of where Mac is from (Georgia) to where she ends up (Dublin, Ireland) is enough of a shock for anyone. On top of that her world goes kaboom when she meets Jericho and finds out that not only is she a sidhe-seer but a Null. The story begins to start and then stops as you wait for the next installment.I liked the characters and overall wittiness of the book. What I didn't like would be when Mac would do something or learn something new it was often followed by: \\"Later I would learn...\\" I got so tired of that line that I would skip a paragraph if it so much as hinted to having hte words in it. I also didn't like that there was obvious chemistry between Jericho and Mac but NOTHING not even kinship really blossomed there. Oh well, who knows, maybe in the next one? There are tons of openness on where this story could go. I am intrigued enough to snatch up the next one and read it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I'm liking \\"Mac\\" (Makayla) a whole lot more as she transgresses from the annoying southern pink princess into a deeper & richer character (enough already with the nail polish!) Though the books are found in the Romance section, they could easily be found in the Adult Fantasy genre. I'm a true fantasy buff, so these books greatly appealed to me. Karen Moning does a wonderful job delving into Fae Lore.

I never really thought about reading a series that is about Faes. This book was suggested to me and I decided to buy it just to try it out. After the first chapter I was hooked.

I was NOT disappointed. This book drew me in and kept me interested through it's entirity. It had \\"fae\\" (one of my favorite book subject matters), humor, and intrigue. I read this book in a couple of days, and couldn't wait to start the next one, \\"Bloodfever\\" (which also proved to be a one-day read) -- I'm eagerly awaiting the third book in this series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"So, if by some happenstance you are not aware that this book isn't really a romance, let me enlighten you. It's marketed as a romance and the author normally writes romance--but just because it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck does not mean it is a duck. Having said that, I can now talk about what an awesomely entertaining piece of fantasy this was.The Plot:Mac travels to Ireland in search of her dead sister's killer. She starts to see some very bizarre and unexplainable things. On her quest she stumbled across Jericho Barrons, wealthy and very unlikely ally, who explains to her that what she is seeing are the Fae--some sort of alien? alternate dimension?--group of magical beings that have recently begun to spill from their own world into the human world. Mac starts to believe that the Fae had a hand in her sisters untimely death, and wonders if she is next.What Was Good About It:If we view this as a fantasy, we have to admit that style-wise it's pretty typical. Girl who's lived normal life encounters not normal things--right. But Moning does it with a certain grace and humor that keeps it from getting overly predictable. The use of mythology is intensely interesting. In addition, I found Mac to be not only likable but easy to relate to--if at times somewhat irritating.It Lost a Star Because:There is a lot of exposition in this book, typical of any first in a series. It can get a bit dull--although in my opinion the dull points were blessedly brief.I have mixed feelings about the first person telling of the story. In a lot of ways it works for this particular story because you can get right into Mac's head. But overall I file it as a negative because it can be maddeningly frustrating and contributes to the aforementioned dullness.And yes, one does need to be aware that this is one of the least romantic books you'll see on the romance shelf. But in the end, it is a wonderfully entertaining and fun read, obviously setting up for an epic adventure of a series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"There's been a constant flood of paranormal books in the market that it is sometimes a struggle navigating your way around hoping you don't end up with a disappointment. It was while rummaging through the shelves of Barnes and Noble that I saw the first two books in Karen Marie Moning's Fever series. I thought I might as well get acquainted with this author. It turned out to be a good decision, indeed. The prologue itself was a sign of the excitement and suspense to come. The main character, MacKayla Lane, gives us a brief background on the Fae and how she ended up knee-deep in supernatural terror. She narrates back to the day when her perfect rainbow world comes crumbling down after receiving a shocking phone call from the Irish Garda: her beloved sister is savagely murdered. With no leads for the police to investigate, it seems that Alina Lane is simply another girl who meets her untimely death in a foreign land. But when MacKayla hears Alina's last message on her phone, Mac knows that the answer to solving her sister's death lies across the seas. It is with sheer determination and limited funds that Mac finds herself in Ireland realizing that she is in way over her head.Barely having acquainted herself to the Emerald Isle, Mac sees something freaky at the local pub in which a guy appears too beautiful to be human, or perhaps he isn't at all? She is then accosted by an old lady who thinks she's from the O'Connor clan and who tells her to either honor her bloodline or go die somewhere else. Then an innocent question about the elusive Sinsar Dubh ends up with her being under the protection of the enigmatic Jericho Barrons. Or is she really? Could her mysterious host and alleged protector have more to do with her sister's death? And what's the deal with V'lane, alpha Fae to the max? Beware of Fae bearing gifts for this prince gives new meaning to the words death-by-sex.Reading the story from MacKayla's point of view allows us to delve deeper into her mind and feel her fears and bewilderment. We follow the voyage of this fun-loving Southern Belle who will leave her colorful world behind - yes, she adores pink - for a world of inexplicable madness where one book rules them all and whoever gets their hands on it holds the fate of both human and Fae. Freaky...DARKFEVER is not your usual vampire or werewolf-filled urban fantasy, filled instead with Faery creatures that you can gorge on. Indeed, there are so many of those otherworldly creatures to feast on that, upon reaching the last pages, I knew for certain that the fever will persist as the saga of MacKayla Lane continues inBloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning has outdone herself with this series. Once I started Darkfever, I couldn't put it down. It has all the elements a reader enjoys such as humor, intrigue, a hint at romance, and of course the dark mysteries that make you want more. I can't wait to start BloodFever. The only hold back on this series is having to wait until the other book comes out."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really really liked this whole series. They are quick reads in that you have to finish them and finish them fast! Ms. Moning has introduced a world within a world and one that humans know nothing about. Makayla or Mac as she goes by has led a pretty simple life in a small town in Georgia. Her older sister goes to Dublin to study. While there she is horribly murdered. Mac goes to Dublin to find out answers as to who killed her sister and why. Weird things start happening pretty quickly. She meets a man named Jericho Barron who is very arrogant and definitely knows what is going on. Love interest for Mac? Most definitely. A man that will drive her nuts- also most definitely. But there is lots more going on in this book then a paranormal romance. There is mystery and intrigue and of course lots of things that go bump in the night-literally. I was really glad that I didn't have to wait for the next books as that would have been just too hard. That is how good the books are. Definitely need to read them in order because they are not stand alone books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just finished This book, and I am excited to read the rest of the series. It was really entertaining."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The book starts out with the murder of MacKayla Lane's sister in Dublin. Mac is bound and determined to find the murderer, since the police have closed the case.She flys to Ireland, where all the fun begins. This book is a nonstop mystery, from the events that took place, to the characters involved. You are on a journey right along with our heroine, trying to put all the clues together, not knowing who is her ally, and who isn't. I absolutley loved the unfolding and events in this story, full of supernatural beings, and fae folklore. Found it to be one of those, \\"I have to finish this book, regardless of the hour of night' books.I am so glad that I started this book, with 5 already being published in the series, because the book doesn't actually end with this one. So, without a break, I've gone on to the next."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I like Darkfever a lot. Can not stop reading it. It became one of my favorite series. Love all other The Fever Series too!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm not a fan of vampire, monster and 'other-being' type books and movies, but I really liked this book! I had read a lot of good reviews on another book site and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the first three in the series from Amazon because I purchased them for $1, and I'm so glad I did! I finished the first book yesterday and can't wait to start the 2nd!! It was very well written, flowed nicely, exciting and intriguing.....and I loved the 2 main characters! Definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"First off, I absolutely adore this series. Barrons (our main man) is dark and dangerous but has a sexual pull thats hard to resist as you read on. Though there are a lot of cliff hangers, they are worth the wait, trust me. If your just starting the series, I have a bit of advice, start with the Highlander series. Each of the highlander books goes over a different couple, but most of them come back in the fever series for a bit to lend a hand so it means more if you actually get their family references. Currently, Karen is working on her Dani series, Iced just came out on Oct. 30, 2012 and is about Mac's (main character of the fever series) \\"sidekick\\". A term used loosely since Dani is 14 and refers to herself as a superhero all the time. (back to fever series talk) The sexual tention between Mac and Barrons is high but no sex between any of the main characters occurs until a good number of books into the series (won't say which one, can't ruin the suprise ;)) all in all, a fantastic read that has Drama, Mystery, Suspence, Violence, Action, and of course, Romance (though not the run of the mill guy gives girl chocolate kind). The nifty thing about Mac is that yes, she does start of as a small town girl that cares way to much about her looks, but as the books advance, so does she. As the books progress, she refers to herself as \\"mac 1.0\\" and so on as she recognises the changes in herself. Pretty in pink could easily get her killed but she has to keep in touch with what makes her Mac if she wants to find her sisters killer and keep her sanity in tact. Catch the fever and you won't be sorry, this is by far my favorite series of all time."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I needed something different, with a little paranormal twist. picked this series off a goodreads list and read through the whole series in a week! MAC is an awesome heroine, my favorite since Sookie, I usually am put off by books that need their own glossary to understand the plot, put Moning artfully pulls the terminology together with characters you will love (and hate)! A great escape from those college angst novels..."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have been looking for a new read after the Hunger Games and 50 Shades Series, and was struggling. I normally like smut type novels, Jackie Collins being my favorite, but I also like reading books in order wether or not they are in a series and hers are not all on the kindle. So when my boss recommended this series I was excited, but also very hesitant. I am not used to these paranormal type books, but it turned out to be amazing! I am already on the second book, and I am already sad that it will come to an end after a few more!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"If you like fantasy, science fiction and mysteries, this series combines it all! Follow Mackayla Lane down the rabbit hole, as she discovers who she really is!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was recommended this book by a twitter group that I follow. I can't believe how awesome it is! The characters are well developed and Ms Moning does a very discriptive job of building the world that keeps you very engrossed. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm not going to write a book review I'm only going to write what I thought of it. I read the entire series. Once I got started I didn't want to put it down. The story is a little out of the ordinary which is refreshing to find. Moning has a great imagination and her writing flows seamlessly. There are some sexual scenes in the later books but the story is not based on sex, that can sometimes become repetitious. Her characters are well developed, the story does not leave you hanging as long as plan on reading all five. I would recommend this to anyone that likes mystery and fantasy. I will probably read this again someday."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"If you haven't caught the fever yet you need to get over to Barrons Books and Baubles and get busy! There are five books in this series... Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever and Shadowfever. I plowed through all of these books in a week and could not put them down. Very creative characters and lots of room for growth with this story. I do hope Karen Moning continues to build on this story line because you are definitely left wondering what the heck is going to happen now??!! I like this series mostly because the romance does take a back seat to the action. There is romance but it occurs at its rightful time and place. The build up to the eventual coming together of Mac and Jericho was great. Fantastic series and highly recommend! And if you don't like the series then you can just &#34;kiss my petunia&#34;... :)(less)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love Ms Moning's Highlander Series. This is very different. It's not a typical romance where you know all will work out in the end. Some would say that makes it more realistic. The characters have real problems, doubts, and insecurities. I think it makes them more relatable. If you are looking for happy endings I would read no further but if you want a book that will immerse you in the nitty gritty this series is for you."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Well.. the book could have more potential. I enjoy a good Fae story as the next fantasy lover but it had traits of other books that didn't rub me well. First, Mac was the twin of Sookie Stackhouse from the Charlene Harris cult. I really had a hard time relating to her in all her girly-ness. Second, Jericho Barren needs to stop calling her \\"Ms. Lane\\" in every sentence he says. Third, it bugged me when some of the Unseelie Fae were given stupid names like \\"Rhino-boys\\" It's something right out of the Yasmine Galenorn D'Artigo Sister series which were cheesy as hell. If these beings are so ancient, why can't they have a name I probably won't be able to pronounce like the other Fea creatures of higher rank? I'll probably order the next book in the series just out of curiosity's sake."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I liked the individual book but I found that it was a little hard to get into. I also thought the series puttered out and lost my interest around the third book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book series continues to surprise. This series is on of the best. I love the writing style of Karen Mining from the highland series to this one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can not believe it took me this long to start this series! I had heard good things about it but kept putting it on the back burner. I absolutely LOVE the way KMM tells a story! It's nice to see a character like Mac grow and even though she fights it sometimes you can really tell she is not going to turn her back on humanity. Every damn time Barrons or V'lane show up my breath catches... Damn KMM don't I have enough imaginary boyfriends on my plate? Why did you have to make em so delicious? I have been hopelessly drawn into her world and, like Mac, don't think leaving is an option (not that I would WANT to with characters like V'lane and Barrons running around...) I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I decided to take the plunge and begin reading the hyped Fever series. After finishing the first installment, there's no turning back for me! I anticipate devouring this series rather quickly. There's a lot of character development and world building in this novel, which is to be expected from the first book of a series. Darkfever opened up a whole new universe for me and I can only see the story getting better from here!Mac's story starts out as a life of entitlement. I had my doubts about her as the main character from the get-go. She's your typical airhead blonde who's main concern is choosing what shade of pink to wear on any given day. That soon changes though as she's bombarded with one life shattering revelation after another. Her whole world is turned upside down. At first, she digs in her heels and resists her new reality but eventually comes to the realization that there's no going back. Mac changes and grows by leaps and bounds in this novel and it's only the beginning. I have a feeling she'll continue to evolve throughout this series. I also got a kick out of the contrasts between her rainbow persona and the dark world she finds herself in.Karen Marie Moning has a real talent for world building! Countless Fae types, terminology and lore are covered without being overpowering. I read this book in one day, but for slower readers there's a handy glossary in case you get lost. The author also stays true to existing Irish folklore so if you're already knowledgeable on the subject the learning curve is lessened immensely. I enjoyed rediscovering Fae that I was already familiar with.Barrons is Mac's unwilling ally and a fascinating character. They both try to avoid each other like the plague at first but finally realize that they need each other and are partners for the long haul. Jericho is opinionated, mysterious and all man. He had me drooling for most of the story, definitely a good sign! After finishing this book, I still haven't entirely figured him out. I'm looking forward to learning more in the next installment. Barrons fluctuates between being the good guy and the bad guy. The jury is still out on the final verdict.There's not much romance or steamy goodness to be had in Darkfever but I'm betting that will change in the next books. The death-by-sex-faes are a good indication of that! From the brief encounters Mac has with Vlane, I gather there's to be some mind-blowing carnal action further in this series. One can only hope!I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. I wasn't expecting something so detailed yet easy to grasp. The author's choice of a 22 year old blonde as the main character left me feeling apprehensive at first but Mac quickly won me over. This book is not only a great story but is also a fun walk through Irish lore, which I've always been fascinated by. I'm regretting postponing reading the Fever series until now. I will not be making the same mistake with Bloodfever! I'm already missing Barrons!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read the entire series and it was awesome. I was given the first book by a friend it was not what I usually read but it was great. If you read this series you will love it. It keeps you guessing through out the books. After I finished the first book I could not wait to read the next. All the characters in the books are great and there are many of them. I hope you enjoy the series. I do not know how Karen Marie Moning kept up with all the characters but she did a great job writing these books. I hope you enjoy them. Happy Reading"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this first book and have been stuck on the series ever since. New and refreshing storyline. Nicely written. Really pulls you into the world Moning created."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After reading Darkfever, I immediately purchased the rest of the series! Karen Moning has created characters that live with you long after you put the books down. I have read every book she has published to date. She has become one of my favorite authors and I am proud to call myself one of her Moning Maniacs."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Usually I stay away from faerie books because they always turn out to be cruel. At least it seems that way. Yeah, I know other mythical beings can be malevolent...but there's just something about faeries that creep me out. However, I thought this book was really interesting and I read it fairly quickly. This is not to say it's not dark, because it is. It's just really compelling.Mac's older sister Alina is brutally murdered while attending college in Ireland, but with lack of evidence and witnesses the Dublin police turn it over to the unsolved division after only twenty-one days. Spurred by a veiled message left to her cell phone Mac goes to Ireland to try to motivate them to continue the investigation. It turns out both Alina and Mac shared the same gift and are sidhe-seer's who can see through Fae glamour and sense objects of power. Jericho Barrons bookstore owner, and collector of rare things is in search for these objects of power. Mac agrees to help him in hopes it will lead to her sister's killer.It's a huge whodunit, and Mac acts like Barbie. She's really immature and can get pretty annoying when she refuses to see what's right in front of her. I can't say by the end of the book that she's grown, but I can say in the overall picture (having read the series) she grows and is determined to survive in this whole new world. Barrons is not charming at all. In fact he broods all over the place and is offish to everyone. He comes off as heartless and patronizing, but he's like this huge riddle that's begging to be solved. That's part of the intrigue of the book. Who is he, and why are we still putting up with him?One thing I majorly hate are cliffhangers...this series is full of them (five books,)like irritating cliffhangers in the middle of an important scene kind. This series reads like one huge book with breaks. The good thing is the series is finished now so as long as you have all the books nearby your good. The books get better, and I admit this first one is a bit weak, but you have to start there. My friend was telling me that it's interesting how we can get embarrassed from reading certain books even when reading is a private experience. That's sort of how I felt reading the Fever series, mostly the last book can be a bit risqu&eacute; so if you don't feel comfortable reading immodest scenes then don't start the series at all. It was the last book in this series that made me cry so much though. I was that involved with what I was reading. In the end I'm glad I read them, maybe you will be too."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Moning has become one of my favorite authors! She is right up there with Laurell K. Hamilton, J.R. Ward and Charlaine Harris!Moning takes us into a world of the Seelie and Unseelie and the quest for the Sinsar Dubh. MacKayla Lane's sister has been murdered in Ireland. Mac feels the police aren't doing their job so she flies to Dublin in hopes of finding the killer. She discovers more then she could ever bargain for. Not only is she and her sister adopted but that she is a sidhe-seer. After stumbling upon a store called Barrons Books and Baubles, she learns about her new life. Jericho Barrons is the one that is going to teach her. Barrons has been searching for the Sinsar Dubh for ages. Now that he knows Mac can sense any sidhe relic, his job has just gotten easier...or has it. The chemistry just kills me every time these two are in the same room!!Mac wants to deny what she is now. She just wants to go back to her pink bubble where everything is normal. Unfortunately that isn't going to be possible. Even the prince of the Tuatha De Danaan, V'lane wants her help. The scenes where she meets V'lane are WOW. I probably wouldn't have had her control!Underneath the whole story is the story of a family coming to grips with a tragedy. When Mac calls home to check in she finds that her father has started drinking and her mother will never come to the phone. It is really heartbreaking.Fantastic fantasy! Love the characters and the world that Moning has created. The endings leaves you wanting more. I had to go out and buy the next two books! I could really go on and on about this book and the characters but that would give too many spoilers! Buy, borrow or steal this book!! It will be worth it!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"i bought this book and didn't know anything about the series. i was just looking for another series to read and saw it on amazon and decided to try it. the first books are reasonably priced and i figured i had nothing to lose, except a few dollars. i really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to starting the second one as soon as it comes in. i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sort of otherworldly, if you will, series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This series has been in my TBR pile for a while, and I'm glad I'm finally delving into it. I enjoyed the world the author built, and the overall plot is great. Characterization was well-done, too. I didn't personally like Mac's immaturity and shallowness, but the author did a good job portraying her as a vain, coddled, young socialite twenty-something. She did mature some through this book, but I hope she matures even more in the future. I usually prefer more focus on relationships in my books, but Mac isn't ready for that yet, and it wouldn't have played well. Hopefully that'll also improve in future books. I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Cross-posted from [...]---Post-DARKFEVER HazeReview coming. Soon. Seriously. Like, wow.---Later That Day, After My Brain Has Had Time to RecuperateSee the \\"Seriously. Like, wow\\" comment above, in the first section? Yeah. That's what this book was like. The book was a constant action-and-drama-fest. People rip on MacKayla \\"Lane\\" all the time, but I don't see what's so wrong with her. I mean, besides all the Barbie-type mannerisms and hair flips and unwillingness to use dye, she's actually quite a kick-ass chick. (Please pardon my French.) For me, she's totally likeable and non-stereotypical (I mean, maybe I'm biased, since I played with Barbies when I was five. [Yeah. Deal with it.]), and I loved her heroism and the immediate revenge-factor after her sister's mysterious and cryptic death. All of the characters were likeable, really, including the Mr. Mysterious Jericho Barrons (whom I adored, really, but didn't see the OMG-death-from-attraction factor). I was a little thrown off by how seemingly important V'lane was in the summary, but in the book, he only showed up twice (or maybe three times; the middle-ish of the book is a little hazy).The Ireland setting was described well, as was her hometown (her backyard, especially), and I felt like her sister would've been a great person if I'd have known her while she was alive. Maybe a lot like Mac, but still a good person.(And, seriously. The name. Mac? I'd personally go by Kayla if MacKayla was my name. Hearing 'Mac' reminds me of the Disney movie CARS.)On to BLOODFEVER."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have gotten little sleep this past week, as I cannot put these books down! They grab you and pull you into a world that nobody wants to be in, but can't leave at the same time. I picked up the 1st four books in the series at once. I am a huge fan of Fae Novels, however, it is difficult to find adult ones (most are directed to teens). As a little girl (like age 5-6), I wanted my dad to read me true fae lore not the fairy book magic glitter books. Book one - I started reading on a Thursday night June 30th at 11:00pm; Read through the night without even realizing it until my dog came to get me for our morning walk. Walked the dog and finished reading Book 1 by 9:00am Fri morning. Book 2, I decided I would take my time, but ended up reading it in two different reading sessions. Book 3 was another all nighter. And I am currently reading book 4, which so far is proving to be my favorite. I was up until 1:00am this morning - Friday one week later (July 8) from when I originally picked up the books. I thought I would wait until the final book - Shawdowfever came out in soft back (Aug 30), but just ordered it as I doubt I can wait an entire month. I enjoy the concept that what you see is only the surface. I think most people see and hear what they want to see and hear, but beneath the surface of our rainbow colored lives there is much darkness and danger."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The story is written perfectly. Characters are very believable. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. So looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really like science fiction, but some of the longer more difficult books just don't hold my attention, and quite frankly I don't have time to commit to long tomes. So I really liked this small easy to read book. I read it on a day off and found it entertaining. I was a little annoyed that this book has no ending and requires you purchase the next book to get any resolution. I think that is a bit of a fail, and a touch lazy. . .but not enough so to turn me off completely from the series. The character has an \\"Elle Woods\\" feel, which could be annoying, but her concern for her family does redeem her a bit. Overall it is a fun and quick read with an interesting paranormal turn."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was surprised in a good way with this 1st installment of this series. I thought that it was fresh, witty, scary @ times, & completely off the wall.I like the world building in this and character set up. There isn't alot of places in this one where the story drags. Which sometimes when u are reading in 1st person & dealing with world building happens alot. So I was happy that wasn't the case with this book. Because I was just anxious to find out as much as I could about what Mac was experiencing or stumbling upon, I did find that I would get impatient & a little irritated with her flash backs in the middle of a scene when it felt like something was about to be revealed... Ergo the 3 star rating.V'lane.. I do not like this dude! Ugh. He irked me with the power he has and the \\"compromising\\" positions he would put or leave Mac in.Barrons.. Don't know what to say about this guy. He's mysterious, sexy, intelligent, & a complete arrogant a**! But he can & will surprise u @ times in this one. I really like how things concerning he & Mac has not taken the predictable course when it comes to this type of genre. This book leaves alot of questions 2 be answered & only makes me eager to know more about this world & the people in it. U will definitely become invested in these characters I promise. I recommend this read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Once again Karen Moning has hooked me. As with the Highlander series, I was sucked in from almost the first sentence. Her characters are always well put together, and you can always identify with the heroine in some way. At the very least, you cheer her on. Mac has just lost her sister, and basically her innocence. It's endearing the way she admits to her \\"fairy tale\\" sort of life, and her expectations. She's coming to terms with her nature, and heredity and Barrons is just the one to do it.Moning has a way with her characters that has you feeling what they feel, laughing when they laugh, and crying when they are crying or should be crying."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen's book 2 in the series continues to chronicle Mac's journey into the ever changing world of the Fae. Karen continues to perfect the writing genre as she details Mac's life...you will find yourself smiling as you recognize a few favored characters, and the ending is perfect! This book will leave you wanting Faefever sooner than it's slated release date, but remembering that Karen's health comes first and the release date will give her time to write AND take care of herself.Thank you Karen for this series and for all your other books!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Unimpressed is being nice actually. I understand having flawed characters. In fact, most of my favorite characters in literature are the really flawed ones. But in her attempt to make her charactets \\"flawed\\" the author just made them flat. The story seemed forced. The interactions between Mac and Barrons were superficial. The idea of bad faeries breaking into our world was great. Its a shame the author was unable to write it well."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Moning always gets a lot of positive kudos on the Amazon forums, so when Darkfever was offered free on Kindle, I thought why not try one of her novels.Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be a good book to start reading Moning. I gather it is book one of a five book series. However, there wasn't much in this book that made me want to read the next four. The heroine seemed weak and at least for me not very likeable as she seems very immature. The hero on the other hand seems rather aggressive and too strong for the heroine. They don't seem to have much chemistry or much in common emotionally.The end of the book leads you to the next book in the series. I guess since this is my first Moning book, I would not recommend it for others reading this author for the first time. It might have been better to start with one of her better known Highlander books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As a writer myself, I became so engrossed in this story, I couldn't put it down, which kept me away from my own work. Loved the first person voice, I use it myself and it's not as easy as it might seem, so when it's done well, it works like a charm.I liked it so much, I'll pay the price for hardback when the next one comes out. It took me less than 24 hours to finish the book and yearn for the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I must first say that I have only read a couple Moning books and I enjoyed this one a lot. I liked the fact that unlike Laurell K. Hamilton (who sucks)she did not throw sex in there for the sake of sex. My biggest criticism of Hamilton is that sometimes the story gets lost in all the sex for the sake of sex stuff. And the only reason that I am comparing is that they both discuss the Fae, Unseelie and Seelie. Moning was refreshing in that for once folks, an author is building a story. For those who think that Jericho is not romantic, I think they are going to be surprised as the story evolves. I love Jericho in that he is an enigma. We aren't sure what he is, but believe me, when he and Mac finally get together they are going to be something.Now, on to the review. At first you think the story is simple...girl goes to Dublin to find out who killed her sister. But as the story unfolds, you find that there is more than meets the eye. Yes, Mac finds that the world that she has left in Georgia is larger than she ever imagined, and that her sister had gotten in above her head. But what I liked the most was how Moning, took a girl, who in the opening of the book was sunning by the pool in a bikini, to the woman that we see at the end, killing Unseelie Fae. I liked the evolution of the character and the way the story is told, in flashbacks. No matter what, Mac is determined to find the truth and save the world (maybe) by locating a very bad book. Now, Jericho who I think is trying a little too hard to act like he doesn't like our fearless heroine, is looked for the same book and would like to use Mac as a \\"bloodhound\\" of sorts (she can sense things).As Mac realizes that there are things that go bump in the night (vampires, gray men, and things with multiple mouths that feed on women), she prepares for the ultimate battle between good and evil.I can't wait for the other Fever novels to be released. I think they will be worth the wait. I can wait on the sex, if the story is good and I know that it will eventually come when it should."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ms. Moning has done it again; darkfever is awesome. Mac is so for real that you just get sucked into her downward spin in Dublin.It is lovely how the threads that were alluded to in the prior books are pulled into this one. Lucan and his collection in London; The Queen of the Fae and I do believe a disposed high council member that was made human(immortal Highlander-Darroc). I am ready for the next installment-BLOODFEVER.keep up the writing as usual you are awesome."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane is stunned when she is informed that her sister Alina was murdered in Ireland. When Mac concludes that the Dublin police seem uninterested or incapable of solving the homicide, she flies from Ashford, Georgia to Ireland. Her plan is to light a fire under the cops or if that fails investigate on her own.However, Mac is further stunned when Alina leaves her with a odd cell phone message on top of her sudden ability to see creatures that do not exist outside of mythology, fantasy or horror tales. Jericho Barrons insists Mac is a sidhe seer who has the uncanny skill to see fairy and other supernatural species. He needs her to find the stolen Sinsar Dubh, a tome that can be used to open the gates between dimensions. Mac agrees on the condition he helps her find out who killed her sibling and why.DARKFEVER is an excellent twenty-first century fantasy that brings to life paranormal species and elements in a modern day context. The story line starts off as a seemingly straightforward mystery, but quickly turns into a romp on the wild side as Mac and her mysterious Jericho partner try to locate the dark tome and uncover who killed her sister. Karen Marie Moning provides a terific thriller starring an intrpied heroine who already could see the Fae, but has to adapt to much more good and evil in a vast universe filled strange and wonderous things.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Dark fever is a great beginning to what I hope will be another long series from this author. The abandoned neighborhood is a really cool idea taht I can't wait to explore more with Moning as the series progresses. the authors descriptions are vivid enough that the not-yet-made movie is already running through mind in full detail. With elements of a detective novel, a paranormal story and a thriller all wrapped up in one, I recommend this book to all readers."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After reading the whole Highlander series of novels--(And I have read them all--several will always be favorites) -- I was expecting romance and a challenging plot--I got the challenging plot--but I wasn't expecting a mystery/thriller with nothing more then foreplay by imagination and a little old kiss--not even really decribed at the end....Yes, I was disappointed! I didn't buy this book because I was looking for a mystery/thriller---I would have enjoyed it anyway if it had smacked even a little of romance.....I will be leery of the next publication. . . unfortunately Ms. Moning has moved on to a sphere of entertainment I'm not overly interested in.Why the cover--with two naked people on it--when these two never got naked at all...Why wasn't the genre of this book stated openly on the cover--instead the reviews on the back were all about romance...it made for a very misleading sales pitch for this book..and I find THAT very disturbing."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane's life is turned upside down when her sister, a student sutdying abroad, is murdered. Unsatisfied with the outcome of the police investigation she goes to Dublin, Ireland to try and get answers.Ok, I can see the majority of the reviewers love this book. To each his own. Overall I thought the book had a lot of potential, but was lost in the muddle of the childish, annoying, shallow lead female character MacKayla (Mac) Lane. Sorry, but this girl came off as a bubble-headed idiot. Much of this book is devoted to Mac's internal dialogue that was overwhelmingly confined to her apperance (wardrobe/hair/nails). I was inundated with multiple references to her \\"pretty blond hair\\", her \\"pretty pink nails\\", and her \\"pretty pink clothes\\". Her entire being seemed to revolve around her being pretty. And, this book (and I suspect the entire series) would have been better told from more than just Mac's point of view.The male lead character, Jerico Barrons, may well be very interesting, but other than his interactions with Mac I have very little sense of him as a strong character. Another reason this story would have been better served being told from more than one point of view.In 304 pages I was given very little actual story. To be specific the story advanced very little from page 1 to page 304. A good portion of the book was repeated dialogue from Mac that had been established earlier in the story. Pages 1-16 and 268-304 pretty much tell the story.I believe this is a five book series. However, in this first installment not one of the important questions raised through out the book was answered. I have read other series' with on-going storylines and this is the first where the author declined to give closure to even one plot point in the very first book. What exactly would be my motivation for purchasing the second book?The book could have been so much better with very little effort."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love this new fae world.

There are passages that just make me pause and think of how well it explains some things in my life. So very beautiful. Now, here I just finished re-reading the first book in the Fever series. How well she develops an immature, protected Makayla into a more rounded person through trauma and having to face heavy, horrible responsibilities. How well she brings a world weary, sophisticated Barrons around and how he works with \\"Mac\\" without taking advantage of her youth, because it is very apparent, though there is a gross age difference between the two, they are made for each other. Once she grows up some. Look for the slow passages around the adventure scenes, there are gems there. And you gotta love the wordless conversations the two have. It would be easy to pass off the plot devices as just implausible gibberish, but Ms. Moning makes it way more than that and more human as well."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"You MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!

She dropped her cell phone in the pool earlier in the week which leads to the house phone ringing from Ireland to inform her that her sister, Alina, was found murdered. Their parents were away on a cruise so Mac was left to identify her body once it arrived in Georgia where the Lane's live.Distraut with grief, seeking answers MacKayla decides to go to Ireland and figure out what the police can't seem to do. What happened to Alina?Mac's first night there she rents a room, goes to a pub for dinner and sees a fae. She doesn't realize what it was and nearly gave herself away by staring at it when an old lady starts knocking her in her head telling her to stop staring and go somewhere else and die.Mac does some investigating the next day at Alina's campus, gets lost in Dublin, and strays into a bookstore, the best bookstore she's ever been in, to call a cab. Before going in she swears she's seen the shadows move. The bookstore is called Barrons Books and Baubles. The owner is a dark, sexy man named Jericho Barrons.Through the rest of the book Mac discovers that she is a sidhe-seer; she can see and sense the fae and fae objects. Barrons takes her under his care, lets her move into the bookstore, trains her to use her senses while using her as an OOP (Object of Power). The steal the Spear from a mobster. She meets a Seelie death-by-sex Fae Prince named V'lane, who wants Mac to work with him to find the BOOK! The book is the object of the entire book. Everyone wants it. It's real name is Sinsar Dubh (she-suh-DOO)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Overall, a solid first book to a new series.The story follows a young woman who travels across the world to find out what happened to her sister. She tries to retrace her sister's steps hoping it will lead her to clues somehow missed by the police. And soon she discovers that the lines of reality are blurred, as she's thrust into that new world of magic and mystery and strange creatures, completely unprepared. And in that new world, her only link, is a shifty stranger she's just met at a bookstore. But if she wants to truly know what happened to her sister, she'll have to jump head first into the magical world, and put her trust into a complete stranger.The story features characters from fae to vampires.Good story, intriguing characters. I liked the main character a lot, and the shifty stranger was pretty interesting as well."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am still trying to get through this....I usually devour Ms. Moning's work in hours...it has been almost a week and I am dreading picking it up again. The heroine is laughable. I am rather disappointed. Mildly entertaining so far if you can stomach the juvenile ramblings of Mac. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will get better or that I will at lest have some closure and Mac is severed from this series forever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was just great. I read it in almost one sitting! Some of the best writing and story line I've read in a long time. The main characters are very interesting. The heroine, Mac (or Ms. Lane as Barrons calls her) is a joy - seemingly frivolous at times but then incredibly brave when needed and ALWAYS highly intelligent. (Very refreshing). I love that Barrons is so frustratingly mysterious and aloof (well, most of the time). The chemistry is great - only hints now and then, but very special - Karen Marie Moning's writing here is carefully balanced - doesn't reveal too much, but just enough to tempt you and make you wonder (really fun to read). The villians are extremely nasty/evil/ect., but still very very interesting. The paranormal descriptions and action are wonderful. This book is a true keeper. Highly recommended. Can't wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane has a very easy going life. Pool lounging & occasional classes by day & bar tending at night have afforded her that luxury. While living at home still, she does have greater aspirations for her life. They may not be as high as those of her currently-studying-in-Ireland sister Alina, but Mac can hold her own. Her sun kissed world is shattered though when the Irish police call to inform Mac & her currently-on-an-extended-vacation parents that Alina has been murdered.At first Mac, like any caring soul, is blinded by grief, though that doesn't last long. When she finally receives a perplexing & mysterious voicemail from her sister the day she died. This settles Mac's mind to travel to Ireland & help the police hunt down Alina's killer. Fortunately while living at home she has been able to save up quite a little nest egg & will make it on her own. Despite the police labeling this a \\"no leads\\" case (meaning they have no evidence, witness, or even a suspect), Mac is determined to see justice brought forth on Alina's behalf. At first Mac spends a lot of time orienting herself, analyzing just how far her money will get her & what she needs to do to accomplish her goal; but weird things keep happening to her. She seems to suffer from double-visions as well as having a knack for getting in trouble with little old Irish ladies. They keep telling her not to give herself away & to have some survival instincts.It's not until she meets Jericho Barrons that she realizes just what she is supposed to be surviving. Barrons reluctantly ushers her into a world of fae, magic, & danger. A long-standing member of this society, Barrons really just wants to use Mac to further his own pursuits & thwart those who in competition with him. When Mac finally relinquishes her death grip on everything she has held to be true. There really are things that go bump in the night... and she has to fight with them to get the justice that Alina deserves.This was a captivating read! I was sold from the very beginning, not just for the characters, but for the writing as well. Karen Moning has a way with words that really allows the reader to develop their own sense of place & purpose. She does not spell every little thing out for you, but she'll give you just enough to allow you to formulate your own understanding. That being said, Mac & Barrons are such demanding characters! Their interactions are much along the same lines of some other great \\"partnerships\\" I could list (Booth & Bones, Mulder & Scully, etc) & really display their personalities in an amusing light.The story itself was equal parts fascinating & frightening. There was enough gaiety to help counterbalance the fae doom & gloom. Rest assured that these are NOT your average fae. They are meaner than many that I have encountered in books recently & that probably has to do with the fact that the cute, helpful fae are few & far between. The \\"worst\\" part is that there is a sexual element to these fae that I haven't really seen addressed even in the adult realm. Think about what happens when you ask a fae for a favor & the consequences that brings & you're along the same lines. Maybe I just haven't read enough. Also, the descriptions of these creatures sent shivers down my spine & really made me feel the same things as the main character. If that's not a resounding endorsement for quality writing, then I don't know what to tell you."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsI've got to do this review before I start the next book BlOODFEVER. I don't want to confuse the story lines at all.I have two friends that are die hard fans for this \\"Fever\\" series by Moning. I do love a good series and particularly love when a series is well underway. That way I can read the books back to back uninterrupted. So the \\"Fever\\" series is perfect in that respect. I was pretty confident I was going to like all the books so I just went ahead and purchased them all.I have to say that I enjoyed the first book DARKFEVER but I didn't LOVE it. I think that this series must get better and better with each book. I am guessing that once I invest more into the characters I will be obsessed as everyone else. I can feel the pull.Lets talk about the characters for a bit. I really like MacKayla Lane. She kinda reminds me of me. Okay so not the beautiful, blonde, skinny part but more the wanting to paint the world in colours, loving her nails polished and just being a girlie girl. Yet at the same time, stubborn and refusing to believe what is happening to her even though it is right in front of her eyes. She is also brave as she walked into the Dark Zone. Okay, maybe I wouldn't have done that. My heart was breaking for the devastation she felt with her sister's murder. (That's not a spoiler because it happens practically on the first few pages.)Jericho Barrons is a very mysterious character indeed. I can't quite put my finger on him. Yes he is masculine, rich and down right handsome but I can't figure him out. I kinda felt like that author Moning didn't quite know what to do with him yet. There really wasn't a draw to him. *ducks from flying objects from the Barrons lovers* Okay come on! Admit it. You didn't love him first book did you? Really?V'lane - okay there is a character I want to learn more about. Super curious. I can't wait to read more about his role as Prince and his special powers.What was really missing from DARKFEVER for me was a sexual sort of chemistry between MacKayla and Barrons. Aside of admiration for each other's bodies I wouldn't even say there is a friendship there yet. It's like they could barely stand each other yet alone trust each other. However if the author was just doing a stand alone book, that lack of chemistry would have failed miserably for me. BUT (a big BUT here) since this is a series, it turns out to be a genius move by the author Moning because there is potential there and a faithful book reader loves angsty potential in characters. Barrons and Mac have a huge following so I'm all game to dive right into BLOODFEVER book 2.Now let me move away from the characters and focus on the story. That I LOVED. It was beyond interesting and I stayed up until I finished DARKFEVER. I would say that DARKFEVER is an excellent \\"set up\\" book. It was perfect for having the readers commit to this Fae & human world. I loved that Moning didn't just try and jam all of the DARKFEVER history into a few crammed chapters and confuse the heck out of me. I am glad she is taking her time with the character development and the set up of the different artifacts, villains and pending war.So out the gate, I'm going to give DARKFEVER a strong 4 hearts with the anticipation that the other books will jump to the 5 heart rating. On to BLOODFEVER now.Teasers - Barrons Books and Baubles, journals, creepy creatures, spear"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever by Karen Marie Moning is the first book in the Fever Series. I picked up this book because I've heard a lot of positive buzz around the blogosphere for this series. I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about. I'm happy to report back that I really liked this first book. What I like most about it was it was not like I thought it would be. It was a lot darker. The story centers around Mac. Mac travels to Ireland after the brutal murder of her sister. The police have closed the case and Mac travels to the emerald island to change their mind. Mac's love and devotion towards her sister is heart breaking. Mac starts asking questions and seeing things that don't make any sense. Mac learns that she has a special ability to see Fae. As cool as that might sound it's anything but. You see the fairies in this story are nothing like Tinker Bell. The Fairies in this story are cruel and dangerous. However Mac stays on course to find out the truth behind her sisters death. Along the way she meets the tall, dark and mysterious stranger, Jericho Barrons. When Barrons hears her in a public place asking about things she shouldn't be asking about it sets him off. On top of that Barrons finds out that she can see Fae. He plans to use that to his advantage. I love Mac. She's a girly girl who is not afraid to kick a little butt. She is a strong female character but not in the obvious sense. I love her quirky sense of humor and her swear words. I was not so crazy about Jericho Barrons character in the beginning. He is too much of a jerk. However as the story progresses Karen Marie Moning lets us see a more relaxed side of Barrons.Overall I thought this story was great. It was not as I expected but it was more. I love the ancient myths and legends used in Darkfever. It is dark, enigmatic and formidable. I've got the fever! I definitely will continue reading this series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am so mad at myself for waiting sooo long to start this series. Darkfever was beyond an amazingly thrilling read. I loved the world Moning created, I felt like I was right there besides Mac and Barrons living in their world.This book surprised me, despite all the rave reviews I kept hearing about this series in general I kept putting it off since i'm not really into the whole \\"fae\\" thing. Well that was the case until now.Mac is a favorite of mine. She was your typical girly girl which I did find odd in an urban fantasy read, but her character develops throughout the book and while not completely losing her love for pink or pretty girly clothes she does turn into one bad ass chick. Even when she was depicted as just the girly girl I still found her to be a strong character, and the reason being she had no problems traveling thousands of miles to avenge her sisters killer.There is also Jericho Barrons. I freaking love his character although he is still a complete mystery. Can't wait to get to know more about him as I continue the series.I did enjoy Mac and Barrons interaction with each other, no love at first sight they downright can't stand each other. There really is no romance at all in Darkfever. I'm not even sure if there is going to be a \\"Mac & Barrons,\\" I'm just assuming based off of the sexual tension between the two.Overall one of the best Paranormal Urban Fantasy books I've read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My sister highly recommended this author/series to me. When I noticed that the Highlander series came first, I read it first. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although some of its books are SUPER good and some just GOOD. I approached this series cautiously, as I much prefer romance/historical romance to dark paranormal stories. For me, this book was just okay. While understanding Mac's motivation and determination to find justice for her sister, she seemed unduly reckless and impulsive much of the time. I came away with the feeling that blind luck saved her much of the time because she so often showed such poor judgment. That being said, I will read further into the series to see if I come to like it better and if I come to agree with my sister's high recommendation of the series. The first book in the Highlander series was just okay for me, but the rest I really enjoyed, so maybe this series will improve also. I just hope that a romance does develop along the way between Barrons and Mac. I also hope that the author does not abandon her Highlander series. There were some secondary characters in some of those books that I would like to see get a book of their own."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I did not want this book initially. The dark mysterious man is named Jericho Barrons for goodness sake!! It just seemed too cliche, like a dime store romance. But it was free or .99 and I couldn't find anything else so I bought it and I'm glad I did. I loved this book! It just sucked me right in! It really has it all, action, adventure, suspense, and some romance, but the good kind :). I finished it and immediately bought the rest of the series and have enjoyed every one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The first half of this book is spent introducing characters and setting up the storyline, so it is a little slow. However, I think that is perfectly normal in the first book of a series. The second half more than makes up for the lack of action in the beginning. I've also read the 2nd book in the series (Bloodfever) and can say that the momentum continues through the second book. So truly, it is only the setup that seems a little slow.I'd never read a paranormal novel that was specifically written about Irish folklore before this one, so I found this book very unique and interesting as a result. It is well written, descriptive, and moves at a very agreeable pace after the story gets going. It was not predictable at all, which makes it even better in my opinion. The author does a great job of only releasing tiny little portions of secrets at a time rather than one big release of info. The readers are not privy to any more info than the main character Mac, which will keep you searching for answers as much as she is.The main characther in the book in MacKayla Lane, predominantly known as Mac throughout the series. Mac lives a relatively normal life until the day her older sister is found murdered in Ireland. Frustrated with the lack of results from the Irish Police in finding her sister's killer, Mac jumps on a plane and heads to Dublin to hunt down the killer herself.Ireland proves to be a place of awakening for Mac. While there, she not only discovers that her sister was much different from the person she knew, but she also discovers that she has a rare ability to see both the human and Fae worlds. Having this vision makes her a sidhe-seer, and also makes her a target for those in the Fae world who wish to secretly infiltrate the human world.While searching for the killer, Mac meets the mysterious owner of Barron's Books and Baubles named Jericho Barrons. Mac quickly develops a love-hate relationship with Barrons because she is both drawn to his strength and frustrated by his secretive nature. She doesn't know who she can trust in this strange land, but eventually connects herself to Barrons only because he can provide her with a safe place to live and because he knows more about her plight than she could discover on her own.Barrons provides Mac with protection In trade for her sidhe-seer services and ability to sense Fae artifacts. He has his own motives of course, but despite the distrust between them, Mac and Barrons work together.I really don't have any significant criticisms about this book. If I were to get nit-picky, I could really only come up with one. The main character Mac is a bartender from a small town who cares very little for school and has only a few classes at a community college under her belt. However, she uses vocabulary words like plebian, erudite, raison d'etre, anachronistic, sepulchre and genuflecting..... It was just a tiny bit hard to believe that this particular character would use words like this based on her personal history. I have friends with post-grad degrees from Ivy league colleges who don't use words like this in normal conversation.With that said, I'm enjoying these vocab additions now after reading 2 of Karen Marie Moning's books. I like that the author is not dumbing-down her own vocabulary in her writing. It's almost like a scattering of little mental challenges for the reader, keeping us on our toes. Every time I come across a new word that is unexpected, it now makes me smile. There was one word in the 2nd book (I'm not admitting to which one) that I had to look up in the dictionary. How clever Ms. Moning, thanks for the lesson.I haven't quite figured out where the title of this series comes from. I don't believe I've seen the word fever used in either of the books I've read, except for the titles of course. I find that interesting and wonder if that is a mystery that will be explained further in later booksRecommended for fans of Paranormal Fiction/Romance. There is not a clear romance yet, but the stage has been set for a potential relationship between Mac and Barrons."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This first book in the Fever series is a bit action-intense, with a lot of basic information the reader needs to really grasp the world created by Moning. Rather than really try to sort it out, I just kept reading, hoping that sooner or later I'd get the main idea behind the \\"Fae\\" world and who was good and bad. That might have been too simple of an approach, seeing as most of the characters could have been good and bad for all we knew. It's that limbo as readers that left me nervous for McKayla throughout much of the book. Jericho Barrons, the guy who takes her in, is described as some type of massive male Adonis, built to protect and defend, brooding and sulking in a very manly fashion. The thing is, in this first installment, there is little you feel you know about him, and therefore never feel certain whether he is there to help McKayla or not.McKayla is a quick character to get a grasp on, but I often felt like she was in so much danger from the start, that I didn't really have a chance to like her or not. Okay, so she's our main character and I don't want to see her die at the hands of some shadow-like creature or crazy demon, but other than that, I don't know that I get her yet. Jericho is just the brooding male figure in the story so far, and the other peripheral characters all blend in the background of what is a fast-moving story.My thought is that this first book must be meant to give the reader a good understanding of the Fae world that Moning has set up. This isn't a book I'd skip to move on to later installments, as I'm already part way into the second book and can see how lost you'd be without the first. The action is crazy at times, scary at times, and even a little sad at times, but really all intriguing. I'm one to usually get annoyed or bored with drawn out fight scenes or Paranormals galore, but these books have me intrigued and I'm going to keep reading them. They definitely have their own unique premise on the Paranormal world!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I like this author, so I picked up this book to read without reading any reviews. I wish I had not done that....First off, this is a series book. And one problem with series books is that they abruptly end and leave you hanging for months (or years, or even forever in the case of a book I read a long time ago that the author never got back to.) This book REALLY leaves you hanging. Generally, with these books, I wait till ALL the books are out before starting. That way I know the author actually finished them and I don't have a repeat of the event mentioned above. Second, it is really hard to get back into a story after months and years without the characters in your mind.For those of you expecting a romance, there is one blooming, but it is subtle and it probably will come out later, but it isn't here now. For those who like a good paranormal story, it is good, just not fully developed because of the series thing. I hope the next book is good, but to be honest, if the characters are not with me at the time of release, I may not buy it. And I will never buy another book by this author without checking reviews first. Thanks everyone else for your postings. I appreciate all of you taking the time. It really helps."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I don't know what book the other reviewers read--obviously notDarkfever. The book I read was the first in what promises to be oneof the most incredible paranormal series out there. Mac is in no wayimmature. Does she like pink? Yes. Does she like fashion? Yes. Doesthis make a woman immature? No. Mac is a typical 22 year old womanthat has never suffered any tragedy in her life. All that changes whenher sister dies, and so does Mac. I LOVED her character and found hermature beyond her years. She's a go-getter, determined to solve hersister's murder, and willing to walk straight into hell to do it.Immature would have been jumping some guys bones in the middle of herproblems like a tstl romance heroine. Moning crafts a fascinatingyoung woman who will no doubt over the course of the series, grow intoan even more fascinating, kick-butt heroine.As far as leaving us hanging? Duh. It's part of a series. Why would anauthor that's writing a series wrap everything up in the first book?It sounds to me like a lot of people are pissed off because theywanted to read more. That hardly makes a book bad. In my opinion, itmakes a book awesome! When I got to the end, if I'd had the next 4books, I wouldn't have stopped reading until the last word, and itsounds like most of the negative reviewers would have too. Get overit! Authors don't have to keep writing the same thing over and over.They have the right to move into a new direction and I think Moninghas done it brilliantly. I LOVED this BOOK and can't wait forBloodfever in August!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"DarkfeverEDITED REVIEW: 4 StarsI was expecting ROMANCE and I didn't get it. I bought this not knowing KMM had said this series wouldn't be the romance series of the Highlanders. It does, however paralell the Highlanders. The character, Mac, is a fru fru southern girl, not altogether annoying more like cluless. Being a southern girl myself, I get her. Barrons is a brooding Alpha Male that isn't easy to deifne. Mac's sister has been murdered and she goes to Ireland only to learn there's more to life the pink nail polish, and accessorizing an outfit. If you are expecting romance, look elsewhere, but do give it a chance. I am not disappointed in this book since I now know what the series is supposed to be. This series gets better, and the Keltar men begin making an appearance in the second book Bloodfever. It is a lot darker than what she normally writes, but it was written really well. Give it a chance and hopefully I've given you enough to know what to expect."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was at first very excited to have an author that has a slightly different way of telling the romance such as timetravel included with paranormal. But just having recently purchased Darkfever,it was such a hugh disappointment. Beginning with the very first page the shallowness of the main character ie MAC, what follows is mainly death and destruction. Any romance at all? A few sexually sick Fae's, and a kiss between Mac and Jerrico three pages before the end.

I read it because it was recommended by readers who liked the Outlander Series (by Diana Gabaldon), but this is not in the same ball park as that series. Not even the same sport. I am rarely moved enough to write a review, but I was so under-whelmed by this book I just had to. It is so far-fetched (yes, I know it's fantasy, but really?), has no redeeming characters....even the protagonist is such a \\"pretty\\" nuisance, you will find yourself cheering when she breaks one of her manicured pink nails. And the death-by-sex fae characters are hilarious. I guess it might be worth a chuckle or two; hence the one star."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read. My first impression from reading the back is that this was going to be a great new series for me to pick up. Unfortunately I was wrong.I was annoyed that the main character never grew a back bone. This first book should have defined the character and where the characters personality was going. By the end of the book I was so sick of the main character I just stopped reading. I stopped caring about what happened to her sister or Barron. A person cannot go from small town, never had anything bad happen to them to big city half way across the world surrounded by death and not get over pink ice nail polish that match silver sandals. By the end of this book you should have started to see a person who is starting to mature and find their purpose.Ooh and I was tired of the word demarcation which seemed to be used every other page."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really liked the book, however I'm disappointed with the way it (doesn't) ends especially since we have to wait so long for the next.

Many authors release a series very close together as not to lose the reader...just a suggestion."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I preordered months ago, so unaware of any plog message or warning I opened the book and as I was reading and the pages on the right side lessened and the heroes hadn't proceded beyond last name stage, the battle against the fae-aliens not even really started- I got nervous - real nervous.Karen Marie Moning is not a fast paced writer - which is fine - with stand alone books. I sincerely hope the Chronicles of Mac is a finished project and the next book comes out - in six months or so?Otherwise I won't survive the wait. Nope .... Rather I really wait and when the chronicles are written and finished I dive in and have a binge. Around 2011 or so as one other reader calculated.Other than that I kinda like Legally Blond turned Lara Croft kind of heroine \\"Mac\\" Mac-Kayla and Jericho Barrons really has potential .... the Vlane - death sex Fae Alien - character and his encounters with Mac where shere ridiculous, odd and a sorry excuse for sensuous elements in the book.How will I survive the wait -Does anyone know when the next is out?If it is not soon I am very sorry to have waisted a lot of money on a hardcover - could have waited for the PB before the next HC is out - or maybe dear publisher forget all about the HC releases .... maybe when the series is finished readers like to celebrate and add the HC collection - Now I don't really feel generous for the next installment.The pages have only 31 lines per page - compared with her Spell of a Highlanders 35 lines per page - which also adds to the feeling a little less text for a lot of money."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am such a fan of Karen Marie Moning. I preordered this book and was very excited to receive it. As others said...I should've read the author's plog before purchasing. This was such a let down. The main character 'Mac' was phenomenally annoying. It was hard to get through. I am faintly curious to know what happens next, but not enough to buy the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever represents a departure from KMM's usual style in that it is in the first person. The heroine is chatty, informative and really, really boring. I get the impression that KMM was trying for something as cute as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels and as edgy as Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake, but the result is dreadful! To make matters worse, Nothing is resolved, the romantic \\"sparks\\" are almost non-existent, and this book is only a set up for the next one. I feel used.KMM is a hot writer. She has never failed me before. I buy her books, IN HARDCOVER, on sight, without even reading the description. I have recommended her to many people looking for a good read. But this was not even worth the paper it was printed on. I hope she returns to her \\"formula\\" soon. I miss it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is the first book I have read by the author. Will not be reading more. I blustered past the \\"mini skirt, high heels\\" crap but it did not get better. The main character is 22 and she calls other people adults. And the slang is annoying also. I love books about the fae. This is not a book about the fae but a book that has the fae in it and is about the main character who is boring and not very smart. Try Patricia Briggs (I got the author's name in a review of hers, boy was that person wrong to compare them), or Laurel K. Hamilton. No comparison."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As much as I love Karen Marie Moning this book really didn't do it for me. I could have bought another book and heard about this book from someone else. I feel as though I waisted my money on it. And now after reading this book I am scared to buy the next one because I might not like that one eiher. Normally her books make me want to stay up all night and all day because I can't put it down. But with Darkfever I couldn't wait until it was over.."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I got it free for my new Kindle and for some reason, was reluctant to start it, but I'm so glad I did. It is a really dark take on the topic of fae/fairies. I'm not going to bother with a synopsis because it's easy to find plenty of those online. I'll just say that I loved it. It's definitely not YA (incase you were wondering) -- there are some pretty intense sexual encounters. Apparently Karen Marie Moning was a romance author before trying out her hand in the paranormal genre, but I've never read any of those. I'm sure that experience helps her out in these books though. There is also quite a bit of swearing, if you're sensitive to that. The main character, Mac (MacKayla Lane) is a little annoying to me, mostly just because when the story begins she is basically a Barbie doll. Her favorite colors are rainbow pastels and she has long blonde hair. She's always talking about her clothes and how they're pink and peach and gold and how her legs are so tan. Blah, blah, blah. It's seriously annoying. However, it is definitely worth getting past. The concept of the story is really great and I think the character development is coming. I'm already in the third book now, so I would recommend to anyone to keep going!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can't wait until the movie comes out. This is a great series. I am a Barrons Fan! It is quite a read and each book ends in a cliff hanger. Which only makes you want to get the next one ASAP!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first started reading Darkfever I waited throughout the whole first three chapters to stop and have to say to myself again that this was just another one of those boring, over zealous, and so badly written novels that it takes true patience and and some major concentration to finish....I was very wrong. The book took me through a loop and keep me reading until the early morning hours. I loved Mac's need to find the killer who murdered her sister. She travels all the way to Ireland, determined to find out who and why. The stories fast paced, with curve balls and side steps at every turn. And Barrons, never have I wanted to get so close to a character yet at the same time run as fast as I could the other way. If anyone should come across this series, take the time and a few extra dollars and buy the complete series because once your done with the first book you won't be able to stand a few short minutes to start the next."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Where do I start. I have read every single book she has written. I started with the Fever series and moved on to the highland series. When I start one of her books I can't stop reading till I have finished the entire book it is worse then Godiva (less calories) :)If you love suspense, mystery, magic and a bit of spice then her books are the best by far. I don't want to spoil the story line for anyone so I say this if you have a iPad get a sample; if you have a library borrow and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It's been a while since I read an adult urban fantasy book. I choose this series in particular because I have heard nothing but praise about this book and I thought it was time.The final verdict? I loved it. The story get you all wrapped in it from the very beginning, I do have to admit that at first is a little slow but I think that is necessary because once Mrs. Moning take you into his Fey world, you gotta pay attention to every detail because eventually everything would click together in some point of the book or in the others books coming.What make this book so good to me was Mackayla, she was the combination of Elle Woods (Legally Blonde) with Buffy the vampire Slayer but in her early days. She was an everyday girl with a high sense of fashion but she had spunk and not to mention a lot of courage because not anyone would have flown to a different continent to find out about their twin sister murder. She had to make a 360 change in her life and with all the complications it could bring she does it without thinking. The other good thing about Mackayla is that evolves, into a stronger and more independent person of course with the help of Barons (going there in just a few words more) and her survivor instincts kicks making her more stronger through all the book. I have to give kudos to Mrs. Moning for giving us a kick ass heroine but with a good heart and of course a very high fashion style.So then comes Jerricho Barons, the warrior, taker, user and another few adjectives I could use to describe him. At first I was kind piss off at him for being an ass with her but at first he just want her not to get into trouble but as soon as he realize of her \\"ability\\" then his force to take her under his care and at first he user her for his own purpose but in the end he little by little warm at her and we to read a few sexuals moments between this two and of course it comes the biggest mistery of the book, who and what the hell is Barons? Mrs. Moning gives nothing away.And of course I can't forget to mention the Seelies who are the beautiful ones but the ones that can makes you sex slave which bring us to Vlane, the sexy Fey Prince, who \\"needs\\" Mac and of course make her have very sexy and hillarious moments and then are the Unseelies who are the ugliest one but they are dangerous and are being released and controlled by the real antagonist of the story the Lord Master. Which also you don't get much information about just to know that it was the person that it was involved in the murder of Mac's sister and of course everybody have ulter motives and hidden agenda with Mac and believe me that's not a good thing.Like a mention before Mrs. Moning is a really gifted author because she submerges you in the Dublin Fey world and even though is fantasy book she makes a wonderful job describing the human personality. Her writing is elegant, very descriptive and also natural.This is a kick ass beginning for the series even with a slow start but very strong ending and of course I already devour the second book (review coming soon). Mrs. Moning has become one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I think I must have sucked this whole series through a straw. It was that delicious. As a bonus for romance lovers, this series had a delectable cast of male characters that were just enough of the good stuff without distracting from the story. For those more focused on the action, this world was most definitely exciting and colorful. I woke up and read before work, I read while I brushed my teeth, washed my hands, in between calls (I'm a phone rep), and before after n during meals. The characters were vibrant. The danger had my heart pumping. When Mac felt pain, it was excruciating for me. When she did the happy dance, I danced with her. When she was frustrated, I ground my teeth and forgot it was just a story. The plot kept me buying the next story and the next and the next. I was so sad when it ended, but it ended well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a little of everything: mystery, suspense, action, love, fantasy, and up to date world culture. You just can't get much better than this. Hi-5 to the author and everyone that helped make this series happen. Thank you."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"So over the weekend I found myself completely in the thrall of Moning's Fever series. It's not every day I run into a series earns a solid place on my \\"Favorites\\" list, but this series earned itself an unequivocal place of honor. It may even make my top 10 favorite series of all time list. It's a series I can see re-reading many, many times.This is actually a review of the whole series (no spoilers, I promise). Since I held off on reading this series for so long because of the first few chapters of the first book, I thought I'd put in a good word in hopes of giving anyone still on the fence about reading it the courge to dive in. You won't regret it - I promise. :D This series is FANTASTIC!Here's a list of the books:DarkfeverBloodfeverFaefeverDreamfeverShadowfeverBasic storyline involves the Fae must like so many other urban fantasy book these days. But it's a darker version of the Fae we find in this series. It's them on our turf, invading our world.What sets this series apart from many of its urban fantasy counterparts it the complexity, epic scope, and unpredictability of the story. It's a many layered story - the first book starts with a mystery that turns into an epic world altering adventure as the story moves on. It's party post-apocalyptic adventure, part mystery, part romance, part suspense. It defies genre stereo types. The story is rich, dark, and unpredictable. There are plots within plots throughout the whole story. Just when I thought I had part of the story figured out, I found out my theories were wrong. But I never felt like the author was over complicating things and her truths when she revealed them never disappointed. She just kept me guessing up to the very end - and that in and of itself is a noteworthy accomplishment as it can be pretty hard to surprise me.The characters are very likeable. I'd actually looked at this series earlier, but decided not to read it because the sample chapters from the first part of the first book made it seem like main character MacKeyla, is a glorified fashion hungry, pink obsessed Barbie doll. I pegged her as a silly girly girl from those chapters (which is not my cup of tea at all). You might be inclined to do the same thing, but I encourage you - read on. You'll fall in love with Mac, I promise. She's strong, kind, determined, but reasonable (I dislike the common urban fantasy theme of bull headed spunky heroines that constantly make silly mistakes because they are too stubborn to see reason - Mac lacks that folly). She also is powerful in her own right but not invincible. One of the biggest themes present in this series is a strong admonishment to not judge a based on a person's words or appearance - but judge them based on their actions. Mac becomes an amazing character - actually she always was one, I just had a hard time getting passed her pretty pink nails, and cute shoes. The side characters are fantastic too - Barrons being a personal favorite, Dani, V'Lane, Christian - I liked them all.Sadly romance is not a major theme in this story - it's present (and yummie), but takes back seat in the face of the world altering events occurring in the rest of the story. Even though it doesn't take center stage, the I found I really enjoyed the romance elements of the story. This author tends to create sort of strong, exceedingly mysterious, possessive, alpha male types. Normally too much alpha throws me off, but it really worked in this story and I found myself suitably swoony. I found it interesting that I sort of fell in love with the males of this story slowly, right along with Mac, and for the same reasons. I wasn't so sure about some of them in the beginning, but their actions won me over (there's that theme again).I'd read a some Amazon reviews that warned that the first book started off a bit slow and was a bit weaker prose wise than the rest of the series, but I actually really enjoyed the first book, the series just kept getting better the farther I read. I had such a hard time putting any of the books down - I'd read until I fell asleep, and then pick up again the next day. The story from start to finish was amazing, and the end was completely satisfying. All loose ends were tied up beautifully.Another thing I appreciated about the series is the wisdom present in it, and the moral quandaries the story raises. There's the aforementioned lesson about judging based on actions not words that's a constant theme. But there's also an ever present question of right and wrong, good and evil, black and white. The lines aren't so clearly drawn here, and you as the reader have to sort of puzzle through and make your own judgments right along with Mac.Okay, so I think I've gushed enough. I highly recommended series! I'd say even a must read for the urban fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It's taken me awhile to catch up with this author but I'm certainly glad I did. I hope the rest of the series is as great as Book #1."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was wondering around the book store trying to find a good book, to many to choose from, but then,.. This one caught my eye. I picked it up and read the back of it to give me an idea what it was about, \\" a possible maybe\\" I thought.Well, turns out it was the winner, so to speak. When I finally got a chance to read it on that Sunday,..Nothing else got done at my house that day. I could not put that book down, I absolutely was wrapped in the book!! I have read some of the reviews afterwards, and I have to say to me, Mac, was a great character, an you have to remember, she is 21. I thought her character, was spot on for her thought process at that age, and her intelligence, was quick to come to light. I personally can not wait to get back to the store to pick up the rest of the series, I have a kindle, but this is a series, I plan to loan out to my friends and family. If you didn't like this book, well, I can't understand why, I absolutely loved it. It keeps to turning page after page, just to see what is going to happen next. To the Author, Karen Moning, I am glad this \\"showed up\\" on your door step."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This author really knows how to suck you into her stories! I read half of book one and was immediately connected with the main character and her story. I downloaded the following books immediately and couldn't get enough of this series! Great novel and fantastic read! Hope to see the main character again in another novel of hers!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much! I love to read about the fae and vamps and all that supernatural stuff. This book has a great story behind it, I could stand a little more romance but I think that will come in the other books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"At first when I started I thought I would be confused with all the different types of characters, but I could'nt put it down and finished it in 3 days. I loved this book. I loved the characters Mac and Barrons, the story line. I will be purchasing the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can't tell you how much I loved this book...quick paced, you'll find it hard to put down. It's dark, entertaining, scarey and Jericho will begin to haunt you into trying to figure out just what he is. I find the heroine endearing. She is young and naive...but she has balls leaving her safe little world to persue her sister's killer in a foreign land. You gotta admire her courage and her journey. This book is the tip of the iceberg and introduces us to a world so terrifying you'll be chilled to the bone. As someone who has read four of the series I got to tell you that Mac evolves and grows up into a kicka-s character you've got to admire..and her relationship with the mysterious Jericho is hot, frustrating and will have you obsessing about in blogs all over the internet!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and was compelled to buy the next two. The books do read like chapters. You can't quite believe they end where they do."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This a really good book if you like paranormal books has sexy scenes comical scenes heart breaking scenes very suspenseful also makes you want to continue to read to find out what is next I personally enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla has the perfect life...or does she? With the tragic death of her beloved sister, MacKayla is practically thrown into a world unimaginable to her. Bound and determined to get answers and find the one responsible for her sister's death, she is way over her head traveling to Dublin, Ireland where her world explodes!Her only ally is Jericho Barrons, or is he? She soon finds out that she is the most powerful Sidhe-seer, one that can see the Seelie ( the light) and the Unseelie (the Dark) of the Fae realm. She can also sense the Fae objects especially the Dark Book which everyone seems to be after. Barrons uses MacKayla's Sidhe-seer abilities to hunt these objects as well as the infamous Book, the Sinsar Dubh. MacKayla agrees to help Barrons in exchange for information and to help her find who she truely is.V'lane is a death-by-sex Seelie Fae who is also very interested in MacKayla and wants her to get the Sinsar Dubh for him or should I say for the Seelie queen. She is so confused on who to trust just learning of herself and still trying to solve the murder of her sister not to mention keeping herself alive long enough to accomplish what needs to be done, her whole world is in a tail spin!There really is so much more to the story, learning about the fae world and why it is so important to find the Sinsar Dubh, but I can't very well spoil it! I downloaded this as a freebie and I can say it is an easy read and worth the download! I have since downloaded the the other 3 books and have enjoyed them just as much.I have to say Karen Marie Moning keeps you guessing and once you think you may have an answer or two she completely stumps you and your back to square one, guessing again! Barrons, Barrons, Barrons! Very handsome, built, sexy, and mysterious. I found myself thinking, just throw him down and take him to wanting to kick his head in! I still have not figured his character out. Is he the good guy or the bad guy?MacKayla's character is very snobby and immature. I wished she would have broken all her nails so she wouldn't have to worry about getting her hands on that discontinued pink polish. Her character really needs to toughen up. She suppose to save the world or be the destruction of it!I agree with the other reviews regarding reading all the books when they come out. I read all 4 back to back and now I am left with a huge cliffhanger from book 4, waiting for the fifth book! Moning promises to wrap everything up in Book 5 as this will be the last in the series.Series in Order;Darkfever, Book 1Bloodfever (Fever Series, Book 2)Faefever, Book 3Dreamfever, Book 4Shadowfever Book 5 - soon to be released!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book is a real page-turner! It is a fantasy that some will think outlandish, but Moning does a great job of introducing it and making her character as incredulous about it as most of us would be if presented the same situation. This first installment of the \\"Fever\\" series lacks romance, but there is some tension building between the heroin and her mentor. This book is a quick, delightful read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I normally don't read romance but I thought what the hell. I sure am glad I read this one. I wouldn't classify it as romance though. I kept me on my toes. I enjoyed it and plan on reading the whole series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first bought this book I was expecting another story along the lines of Moning's \\"Highlander\\" books. What I found was an enthralling urban fantasy that sucked me in and left me hanging.The Fever books are NOT a series, they are a true serial, something you don't find very often. The driving plot extends through all three books, so you won't find any resolution in this book, only questions.In this installment, MacKayla, or Mac, is dealing with the shock of her sister's death. Determined to find answers, she travels to Ireland and finds herself thrust into a strange world.I love that this book constantly raises questions without offering easy answers, and that the answers, once found, come with questions of their own. We get a real feel for Mac and how she is forced to transform herself from and average American party-girl to a tough woman who is able to fight for her life.While this is not a romance, there is tension between Mac and her one ally, Barrons. He is, at once, her only hope and possibly her greatest enemy. Despite the antagonistic nature of their tenative relationship there is a small thread of attraction between them. Even so, this is no romance and should not be misconstrued as one.I highly recommend this book and this three book serial to fans of Moning as well as anyone who loves urban fantasy. It is intense with plenty of action and a storyline that will make the reader question everything that happens from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read all of KMM's Highlander series and enjoyed most of them (some were better than others). Having appreciated KMM's writing style in that series, I bought this one before reading any reviews. It is a quick read and I and really \\"got into\\" the story. It has sort of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1st season) feel to it. Mac, the herione, is just learning what she is up against when she visits Dublin to find out more about her sister's murder.Mac is young, immature, and totally unaware of her supernatural gift/curse. The author does a good job portraying Mac's youthful zeal and impulsiveness. She is sort of a girlie girl (Barbie doll). The story-line gained my interest immediately. Jericho, her protector (or nemesis ?), is a real mystery man and there were only little glimpses into his life. We learn about him as Mac learns about him. Her first challenge will be whether to trust him or not.The book ended much too quickly for me and I wasn't aware it had such a cliff-hanger ending. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series, but I'm not a big fan of cliff-hangers."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've read all of Karen Monings books. I can see where some readers may be distressed at her new book because it does not align with the structure of her previous books - a very sexy, happily ever after storyline encompassed in one book.However, I'm glad to see that she strayed from the ordinary because you can only write so many books with the same formula. I think that this was a good starting point of what's to come, it was darker and the heroine (though a bit ditzy at times) has potential. This is definitely worth the read and I can't wait until the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Wow! I am away on business and picked up my book at a local bookstore. I devoured it in one night and just closed the cover.However, before I did, I shouted out (in the lobby!!) OH, that is just not right! I hate that it ended and is leaving me waiting, wanting more. This book was a wonderful building block for the story to come. I cant wait to peel the petals back on this whole plot. This is not a departure from her usual style--It is wonderful and new. I love the descriptions, the character building. Bring it on! I just went to the website to find out fast when the next book is arriving and it statesAugust--I cant wait! Hurry Hurry Karen.Kathleen"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Picked up this book a few days ago and WOW really enjoyed it. I didn't really care about the romance factor especially at the end when Jericho and Mac have readched a new level in their relationship. Started off fast and didn't end they're. Mac's sister Alina is suddenly murdered and Mac rushes to Ireland to find the murderer not knowing what awaits her. Jericho Barrnes suddenly appears and becomes a big Pain in her life. I highly recommend this book even low on the romance scale, because if you read book the romance is still they're. Can't wait to Bloodfever now,so many unanswered questions. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm not normally a fan of first person stories. Karen proved that it can be done extremely well.I've seen some complaints about the lack of sex in this book. If there had been, it would have been gratuitous at best. I appreciate that she doesn't insult my intelligence by just throwing it in there. She's taking the time to craft her story, and oh boy, what a story it's turning out to be. I'm smart enough to figure out it's a series, and I'm much happier for it. That means more and more (at least 4 more) of this particular story.It is obvious that she has researched and plotted this series well. You're not led by the nose to see everything that's going on. There are a lot of questions raised in the opening book, and I'm having a blast trying to figure out what they all can mean."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Expect to enjoy this for it's humor and quick pace. I loved the action. Even knowing there won't be real romance. Even knowing this will be an entire series based on MacKayla O'Connor (all straight from this horse's mouth?/1st person-narrative overhaul!). I DID like it. So, why do I feel like Mac coming around on the museum floor surrounded by onlookers, half naked and dripping with anticipation of -- something that just didn't happen?? There is a lot she left out. Not just the sex. It's everything that goes into knowing that there will be intimacy. Here, there's not even a ? of it. Nothings gonna happen, and you know it.It's as if the author said, get your kicks somewhere else while I tell ya about my Ipod. Her few attempts at sexuality reminded me of things Nicole Richie would say; or a 15 year old boy."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'll give this book a three, a solid three- but a three none the less. Now, when I bought the book I was fully aware of the genre-shift in progress but I was unprepared for the extent of the shift. One move at a time, please? Simultanious shifts in Genre and person are too much for one book.My quibbles with the book are few and none are really fatal flaws. First the attempt at realism makes the protag irritating. This maybe so that she can grow into something we actually want to read about, but right now she fights the book too much. If the main character is refusing to play along it becomes difficult to invest in the story. This may be an artifact of the first person narrative-- We could just be to much in one person's head for a paranormal romance setting, which thrive on the unknown.My other concern is the V'lane character and his scenes of questionable taste. I always thought of the Highlander novels as tasteful romances with minimal squicky sex. It's one of the reasons I like the author. No more panting panty shots, please?"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I do not want to say I didn't like the book at all since I enjoy Karen's writing so much, but I was so disappointed. I am afraid \\"fever\\" is one series I will not be reading unless I find the books in a second hand store. I didn't find out anymore about the story at the end of the book then I did in the first few chapters. Mac sees fae objects and feas (good and bad). Jericho Barrins is either a good guy or the devil in disguise. Mac's sister is still dead and we don't know who killed her or where her journal is. I always pre-order all of Karen's books, but when the price is $20.00 per book I expect a complete story not a very long prologue. . Karen states this is the first of 5 books about the same story plot, $120 is way out of my budget for 5 incomplete stories."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This has been edited, didn't feel right about my original review:I've read everything KMM's ever written. Some I've reread. That rarely happens these days. But when I saw she was writing a new series I was a little apprehensive. Something new? Not romance? NO SEX!! She wouldn't be continuing with the MacKelters? I wasn't at all sure about this. But finally I bought Darkfever and read it. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great either but I'm not reading literary fiction here. First my complaints (I always have complaints):In her other books KMM uses the same heroine over and over again. I can't even tell you which book Chloe was in and which one Gwen was in and I can't remember the names of any of the others. But I got the heroes down pat - in romance, I think that's the point but I'm not 100 percent sure. Mac was actually a little more defined than the others believe it or not. I just didn't see her heading to Ireland alone - with a friend maybe but not alone. Unless she had a past history of running away from home or a juvie record - that would have ROCKED! Come on, she was pretty cool about going into pubs alone for a Barbie knock off. But in romance a heroine with a record isn't cool - too bad. She could still have been TSTL - another requirement in romance, I think. The pink was a little irritating. And blonde! I guess they do have more fun.The story started dragging a bit somewhere around the time the cars were introduced. Come on, Karen, write a hero with an environemental conscious - I'll bet there are electric Porsches out there. The Black and White Mansion was almost like a black and white hole. I almost put the book down at that point. Thank god for the vampire! He really picked things up. I'd like to see him more.So I liked the vampire. I started liking Jerricho more as I read. He started out kind of repulsive - the word 'Carnal' doesn't seem to work for me. I think he's going to end up being the romantic interest for Mac but I kind of like him better as a twisted, dark mentor. The fae were pretty well drawn I thought. I could see the grey man and the many-mouthed thing pretty well. Her descriptions of Dublin were excellent. I could see the city as Mac did. Of course, I have my own memory of a hotel room in London decades ago to compare with her little hotel room. The lore was fascinating. The description of dark zone was wonderfully vivid. The lord master could have used more build up. I'm glad the people who died did; I didn't like them and they contributed nothing to the story. So after a rocky start the story picked up and improved. Mac rose to the challenges that were set before her.I honestly do think this book was a near miss for me but fortunately KMM has a lot of credibility with me. I can name a few authors that don't. She's come through for me on all of her other books and I have every reason to believe this series will only improve. And I've got to say I think it's very funny that the most common complaints I've seen here about this series is the lack of sex. She does write some good ones.I will read the rest of the series. Maybe I'll wait for the paperback version - but I'm already getting kind of itchy for Bloodfever.Sure hope she brings in some Mackelters though. I would thing they're about to go stir crazy sitting in the castle with those cardboard blondes. Go Daegus!! Go Drustan!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved the 1st book in the fever series! It's different than the highlanders books.Not quite a love story yet. I still couldn't stop reading!! I so wish she could write faster!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I LOVED IT! Man, the Prologue gets your attention, and the first chapter just sucks you right in. I stopped reading this only while driving or to sleep. I couldn't put the book down. I love reading Karen's books, and she is by far one of my favorite writers for Historical Romance books.MAC is this down to earth, totally her generation, type of girl. Life is bliss, no real cares in the world...the kind of kids we, of the previous generation (or generations), would like to knock on the head with something really hard, probably out of jealousy (tanning by a pool, living off the parents, not REALLY working or getting an education), and Yell --- Get A Life Barbie!Well MAC did. Now she's knee deep in it. I'm only sorry that I have to wait until October to read the next part of her life...and Barrons'. Looks to be quite interesting. I also hope some of the future 4 books engage some familiar people from the past that come to help out; particularly Druids."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla (Mac) Lane tends bar, thinks about college (some day), works on her perfect tan, and enjoys being blond, beautiful, and virtually Barbie. But when her sister is murdered while an exchange student in Dublin Ireland, and the local police are unable to make progress, Mac decides she needs to do something. That something consists of ignorning her parents' advice and flying to Dublin in an effort to get the police to re-open the case. Somehow or other, Mac intends to find her sister's killer.Dublin is strange to a young woman who's only been outside her small Georgia town for a few (essential) shopping trips to Atlanta. The bar scene is super-active, but Mac is shocked to see beings that appear sometimes as beautiful people and simultaneously as horrible monsters. The monsters are devouring people, swallowing their beauty, or simply promising to give them so much sex it ultimately kills them. When she openly stares, a stranger calls her a strange Irish name and demands that she not give herself away. By luck or fate, though Mac's search brings her to a strange bookstore in the midst of a dead and deserted part of the city. Its owner, handsome but dangerous Gabriel Barrons, knows about the monsters. After first demanding that Mac run for her life, he abruptly switches tactics and demands that she join him to prevent the Unseelie from destroying the world.Mac can't decide whether Barrons is on her side, her enemy, or (which seems most likely) on a side that's completely his own. But he is interested in the one clue that her sister left--and the two form a grudging partnership. Their partnership takes them into some of the most dangerous places in Dublin--including a possible vampire's den and a gangster hangout.Author Karen Marie Moning writes a compelling paranormal adventure. Barrons is a wonderfully mysterious hero--dark, dangerous, and keeping secrets that just might be deadly. Mac begins as a complete ditz, more interested in her nail polish than in the possibility that all humanity is threatened, but grows as a character without really loosing that ditzy charm. Moning offers a take on the Seelie Courts that is darker than most modern fiction and I found this a refreshing difference.DARKFEVER is clearly the beginning of a series and neither the romance nor the danger was brought to conclusion, but my interests were definitely engaged and I found this a hard book to put down. I'll definitely look for the next book in this series, and am happy to recommend DARKFEVER for those who enjoy paranormal romance and truly dangerous alpha heroes."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio edition of Dark fever, and I must say I'm impressed. The narrator did an excellent job bringing the likes of Mac and Jericho to life. Her southern accent was very well done and quite appealing to me.The plot is an interesting story, set around a murder mystery. The heroine is a young Naive woman who travels to Ireland to find her sister's killer. Instead she discover that she has an unexpected ability: the ability to see fey, fairy beings and to stop \\"Freeze\\" them.Mac also meets a mysterious man who works at a bookstore.Strangely, while I loved the plot (It reminds me of the Merry Gentry series), I didn't like the two main characters. Mac is an irksome girly-girl who despite the masculine nickname, is about as prissy as you can get. I got bored hearing how the perfect, beautiful heroine can eat what she wants due to her great metabolism. (Meh). I'd prefer the heroine to be more flawed and less perfect. Someone I can relate to. Mac's flawlessness was a chore. Plus I don't care for the masculine nicknames on female characters.I also didn't care for Jericho. I'm not sure if he is intended to be the hero, but I found him to be an abusive jerk. I'm not a big fan of aggressively alpha a**holes but Jericho suits the bill. I really wanted to see him taken down a peg of two, and I hated the way he manhandles Mac. At one point he picks her up and holds her against the wall, bruising her. This is supposed to be appealing? yuck.I did enjoy the fae lore. The various creatures Mac encounters on her quest are interesting. I felt a bit disenchanted by Mac/Jericho. I saw no real chemistry there, and would like to see them hook up with other people. Also, I really like the world-building Moning has created, the characters and setting was very sensual and descriptive. I hope future books aren't set all in Ireland, 'tho. One of the interesting things about Urban Fantasy is that the Fae could be anywhere."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I bought this book with a lot of trepidation because I knew that this was not a romance and I was not sure I was going to like Karen's books without it.I was extremely happy to be proven wrong. I LOVED the book. The characters are human (or not) depending on who we are talking about. You find yourself so drawn into the story and worrying about the heroine and wondering how you could help her (with what WE know as the readers of the other Karen books). I found myself screaming at the herine not to do this or to do that. To me that is the mark of a great story and a great story teller. I can NOT wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Wow! I didn't think anything could top Moning's Highlander series, but now I know she's been keeping the good stuff for last. Know the world that's been the background of her Highlander books? It's the foreground of the new series. We finally get to learn more about Adam's race, the Seelie and the Unseelie. Mac is an amazing character, one I could totally relate to. Jericho is a gorgeous enigma and V'lane, well, he's downright terrifying with all that sex appeal, which is what I think Moning intended. As far as waiting for the next book, sure I wish I had it now, but I wish I had the next Harry Potter now too. Don't let the negative reviews fool you. The characters are complex, the plot rips you along and I think it's Moning's best work yet."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen has to be my favorite author. I love all the books in her series. I was so excited when I found out about this release. I pre-ordered it on Amazon and counted the months to the release.The book was very suspenseful and well written. It carried on the story line started in previous books, which was nice. It was nice being able to get a different version of the story line from someone other than the MacKeltars (although I love the Mackeltars!!!).Where this book disappoints is that it is not a romance novel and I love romance novels. And I am not talking about sex scenes, which there aren't any. That isn't what makes a book a romance novel for me. The characters never seem to connect on any meaningful level for me. They are using each other to survive and get through, so for me it is more an action novel, which is fine if you want to read a supernatural action novel.The heroine is OK, nothing great there. I doubt we would be friends in real life (unlike Gwen or Chloe from previous books). Barrons, the \\"hero?\\", is too self centered. Which is normally fine, if the hero redeems himself throughout the book. I never really felt he did.If this story and the characters are carried on into the next book, I hope that we see the characters develop a little faster. I, personally, don't want to read several books to get to the growth that usually occurs in one novel. Just not me.I will definitely buy the next book, but with less enthusiasm as before."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I knew from KMM's website that Darkfever was the start of a new series and that many of the elements that characterized her other romance titles would be missing from this book. I think that preparation helped me enjoy what was, in my opinion, a fast-paced and intriguing read that has me totally hooked. I'm really looking forward to the next installment in the series and seeing what else KMM has up her story-telling sleeve.Twenty-two year old MacKayla Lane's life changes the day she gets the call informing her that her older sister Alina has been murdered in Dublin. After she receives a mysterious voicemail message from her sister, left on the day she died, Mac -- in a fit of impulse and determination -- takes off for Ireland to find her sister's murderer. From her first day in Dublin, however, things begin to spiral out of control and Mac finds herself immersed in a situation that is as unexpected as it is unbelievable. Partnered with the mysterious Jerricho Barrons, who promises to keep Mac alive as long as she's willing to help him, Mac finds herself running for her life from Unseelie bad guys who know she is a sidhe-seer and will gladly kill her for that offense alone. To stop the \\"Lord Master\\" of the Unseelie Fae from unleashing his race upon unsuspecting mankind, Mac and Jerricho must seek out the powerful Fae Hallows and the evil Sinsar Dubh.Easier said than done.I very much enjoyed the fast pace of this novel and the fresh interpretation of Fae mythology. The moment I saw the words \\"Seelie\\" and \\"Unseelie\\", I cringed, fearing that I'd see a rehash of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series. But Moning's angle was her own -- and no sex scenes were harmed during the writing of this book! KMM, author of the well-known Highlander romance novels, promises that the romance and sex scenes will come in future books, but I have to say that I didn't miss them here. Darkfever, refreshingly UNLIKE the Merry Gentry series, was more plot than porn, and while the book left a lot of loose ends waiting to be tied off in future books, I was intrigued rather than frustrated by all the unanswered questions.I had two minor quibbles about this book. The first relates to Mac. Short, sexily-curved, and sassy-mouthed, with long blond hair and green eyes, Mac is highly reminiscent of Moning's other heroines. Also like Moning's other heroines, she's smart and capable and not lacking in courage, even if she does regularly rush in where angels fear to tread. Still, the familiarity irked me a bit. I would have appreciated a different sort of heroine for this different sort of book. My other quibble is with the mysterious Jerricho Barrons. After the first book, all we really know of him is that he's wealthy, abrasive, and arrogant. He asks questions and demands answers, but offers none in return. Who is he? WHAT is he? I suppose that for the pacing of the series, we know all that we need to know of him at this point. In fact, his mysteriousness may be one of the biggest factors in keeping me reading, for I'm well and truly hooked on him now. But at the same time I guess I wanted just a little bit more, because by the time the book ended, I still wasn't sure he could be trusted.If you're interested in Fae mythology and willing to step outside the box Moning built with her other novels, you may enjoy this one quite a bit. I sure did!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love KMM's Highlander Series, and I think I'm going to love this new series as well! It's completely different and frankly, refreshing written in first person. I like the characters she has selected for this series, and it will be interesting to watch them develop over the 5 books planned. For romance-diehards, this book is not for you. It's a mystery/crime novel more than anything, and is set in modern-day. It has the fantasy elements Ms. Moning is known for, and is definitely not a period piece. There is no tidied-up ending - actually, there is no ending. So beware if you were expecting something along her Highlander Series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":".....she has never let us down before with her yummy highlanders, and she doesn't this time either! This will be a romance series eventually, but if you take into account that this book covers only the first couple of months after Mac's sister dies, romance RIGHT NOW would be a disservice to these characters! I read the book in one sitting, and was irritated when it ended ONLY because there was no more to read! This looks like it will be a great series and I CANNOT WAIT until the next one comes out. Give it a chance...don't be turned away by these bad reviews."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I expected to enjoy this book because I have really enjoyed the author's more recent novels. WHat I found is that it reads very much like a Janet Evanovich novel, an author I know Moning admires because she has mentioned Janet in this book and the previous one. The book is written in the first person with zippy dialogue, like an Evanovich novel.That said, the plot is all Moning with Fae intrigue. I think its a good idea to read her earlier books first so that you understand the Fae realm and have an idea about why the fabric of the two worlds (Fae and human)may have come undone (as a result of the Keltar family).I finished the book really wanting to read more. It seems obvious that MacKayla and Barrons will get together eventually and I don't mind waiting for it. (After all, in the Stephanie Plum series by Evanovich, the two lead characters didn't get together until book 4.) In the absense of sex between the two main characters, the long looks and sexual Faes keep up the heat. I liked that a bunch!Enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I should begin by saying that KMM is, by far, my favorite author. This book is a huge departure from her usual writing style. The plot does relate (in a roundabout way) to her highlander series. It is written in the first person (not her usual style), which I found to be distracting.The main character, Mac, is terribly annoying. I suspect the author intentionally made her vain and immature so that we, the readers, can watch her evolve over the course of the series. I think the secondary characters would have been far more interesting if they weren't limited by the first-person point of view.While I did enjoy this book's fast-paced plot, I really hope the author hasn't completely abandoned her romance writing career. I'll read at least one more in this series to see if it's any better than Dark Fever. If not, I'll just have to wait and see if she returns to the romance genre.Bottom line: Great Sci-Fi book. Romance?...Not exactly"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didn't know it was a series, so it was quite a shock to be left in the middle of everything...no answers to all the questions the book laid out. I was not a happy reader."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Be prepared - this is the first in a 5 book series. I thought it lacked the spark and sparkle of previous books. This book struck me as much more paranormal than historical fun. It left way too many things up in the air - like basic character development. We still know next to nothing about one of the main characters - something that left me feeling jipped and flat. I felt like someone had grabbed the book out of my hands when I was only halfway through reading it and refused to give it back. When I read these, I'll wait until they are all out in paperback."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was too much about the story and not enough about romance. I like romances in which the story is a reason for the characters to be together. The thing that makes a great romantic story is the moments that the characters come together. I want to like the female and fall in love with the male. I did like the female but the male was one dimensional. I don't even know if I liked him or not. I guess it does not matter since this was not a romance. Since it was not a romance it should have been in the pure sci-fi section. At least then I would not expect romance. But usually most stories have some romance. See Knootz's Lightning. It is a horror/action book but the root of the story is a romance.I did however like the fight scene near the end. You could feel what she was thinking and it was an emotional experience. I love it when the females in sci-fi books discover powers and abilities beyond expected. However, the sex scenes would have been my worst nightmare instead of the fantasy that I expected.The main reason that I would not have bought this book was because it did not wrap up the story. I do not like series as a rule, but I can tolerate them if each book can stand on its own. Had I known that it was worse than a series: that it just stopped the way that Lord of the Ring did, I would have never read it. At least there was a reason for Lord of the Ring doing that. This writer must have felt that she was out of ideas and wanted to drag this on.However, I do still like this writer and hope that she will not drag the same story line out for five books. I never want to see the same character as lead character in more than one book except maybe the rare horror book such as Anne Rice. In a romance I only want to see that character fall in love once and only want to see him or her as supporting characters if they show up in another story line."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"First disappointment came when I realized by page three the book was going to be in the first person with only one perspective. Personally, find this style not conducive to the romantic genre... which should have clued me in because it wasn't a romance book at all. It is a \\"who-done-it\\" and not a very good one at that. I know this book is part of larger storyline within a series, but I still think each book within a series should be able to stand on its own... and this one doesn't."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked up this book looking for something that wasn't there at all. I thought this would be an interesting combination of two of my favorite genres, fantasy and romance. At no time at all did the main character have any sort of relations with any other character...not even a true friendship. The story was just okay. I have read books written for teenagers which had more depth and were more interesting than this book. I will never read one of her 'so-called' romances again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"No offense, but this book was not interesting at all. I started reading diligently for the first 70 pages, but then it started getting really boring. I skimmed through and found only a dumb blond (who becomes a sexaholic whenever that other fae thing shows up) running around with some guy name Jericho (which reminds me of a bad reality show). Yeah, they're searching for some book.great. But that's about all I got from it. It's not so much there's no romance because I do read genres other than romance, but it just doesn't give her books about the Fae (such as Adam Black) any justice. It's blah. But, I love Love love her other books because at least the ongoing story of abhoeal and the unseelie made sense. Now I'm all thrown off and confused. PLEASE STOP USING BLOND CHARACTERS ITS GETTING OLLLLLLLLLDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"While I was browsing around at the library, I noticed that this book had an, ahem, interesting cover and the summary seemed interesting too, so I decided to check it out. How glad I am that I just got it from the library and didn't buy it.Instead of being a romance like the cover suggested, this book is more like an adventure/mystery book. An extremely bad adventure/mystery book. It's about the heroine trying to find out who killed her sister, but I couldn't bother caring, as I found her completely boring. The book gets so wrapped up in its fae plot that I found it didn't develop her at all and left a big cliffhanger ending. Even worse, this book didn't even contain what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I was offered the chance to review DARKFEVER, I immediately accepted. I've heard so many good things about this series. I've heard it straddles urban fantasy and paranormal romance. I've heard it features a strong and likable protagonist as well as a rich world full of mythological beings, yet set in present-day Ireland. All of which things served to pique my interest. This was my first Karen Marie Moning book and I had high hopes for it as it is the first in a series of four books so far. The fifth and next installment--Shadowfever--will be published early next year. As a longtime series reader, I like coming into an already established set every now and again. It goes a little ways toward balancing out all the others you've got lined up and are waiting impatiently for.MacKayla \\"Mac\\" Lane is Southern belle through and through. Born and bred in Georgia, she and her big sister Alina followed their mother's proper example. But while Alina was always the studious straight laced daughter, Mac was the laid back one. Dropping out of college after a couple of semesters, she takes a job tending bar in a local pub and working on her tan in the off hours. Then the world comes crashing down around her. Her sister Alina is murdered while on study abroad in Dublin. And it isn't your run-of-the-mill mugging gone wrong. Alina's body was literally torn apart and the Dublin police have all but closed the case for lack of evidence. Sick of watching her parents sink further and further into depression and grief, Mac hops a plane to Ireland determined to make the police see reason and reopen her sister's case until the culprit is caught and brought to justice. Just before her death, Alina left a hysterical and cryptic message on Mac's phone and it is that fragment of a clue that pushes Mac deeper into the Dublin underground than she thought possible. And it is there that she discovers the fairy tales she read as a child--the things that go bump in the night--aren't so made up after all.Essentially, DARKFEVER reads like Sookie Stackhouse-lite. Mac is blond and beautiful like Sookie. She likes nice things and she's smarter than people take her for. But she doesn't possess quite the depth of the telepathic barmaid from Bon Temps. I wanted to like her, but her cluelessness and lack of spark began to wear on me after awhile. I appreciated the Dublin setting with the rain and the fog, the endless pubs and the warm, cozy bookstores popping up out of nowhere. But the world itself never leaped off the page at me. Similarly, the Celtic mythology and the various factions of fae are right up my alley, but . . . I don't know. Some vibrant element was missing and my interest palled and eventually stalled out. The glossed over writing and characterization left me with only vague impressions of who, what, and where. The dark and deceptive Jericho Barrons who Mac encounters shortly after arriving in Dublin, and with whom she is repeatedly thrown together to find the object her sister was looking for, clearly works for many readers. But I found him unlikable and callous, any redeeming qualities failing to materialize in time for my affections to be engaged. I think I would have appreciated a little more backbone and a little less pink lip gloss from Mac and a little less chauvinistic manhandling and a little more complexity from Jericho. Or at least a stronger connection between the two to keep me going. I like that there is no precipitous romance in this first book, but as these two are the pillars on which the book rests, I needed to at least believe in some reason why they would be friends. And I just didn't. Overall, I finished DARKFEVER lukewarm at best and, with so many options out there, I will not be continuing on with the series.Reading Order: DARKFEVER,Bloodfever,Faefever,Dreamfever, andShadowfever"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What started as a story that could have been a mildy entertaining read, turned out to be a dissapointment bordering on the insulting.For all the research the author must have done in order to give decent descriptions of places in Dublin and use of the Irish language, she completely lost me at her first dialogue of the main character with an Irish character. Irish people do not speak like that. I quote:\\"Evenin' t'ye, m'dear,\\" the desk clerk said cheerfully. (wait for it...wait for it....) \\"Opin you 'ave reserves, a'sure ye'll be needin' 'em such a foine night th'season.\\"If you can't do an accent right, don't do it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am a huge fan KMM. I have read all of her books, and this series, with this particular style of writing is definitely not her best. The story premise has a lot of potential (that's why I just bought the second book), but the writing does not compare with her earlier Highlander series. I know, because I have just started to re-read the first one, Beyond a Highland Mist. That writing was captivating and beautifully done. This style is difficult keep interested in. The main character is positively annoying and grated on my nerves. If it wasn't for the basic story line of good and evil Fae, and the very interesting and sexy character of Jericho Barrons, I think I would have simply abandoned this book long before I finished it. It was definitely a challenge to finish, But since I did see it through, and the next one is a continuation of the cliffhanger, I've decided to hang in there and read the second one. KMM if you are reading this, please, please, please write the next one- Fae Fever-in the style that you truly excel in. Go back to your original writing.. George, from Dead Like Me does not work well in this kind of story."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this book because I heard it's similar to Richelle Mead's Dark Swan series. I really didn't like this book....Mac (the main character) is incredibly annoying and not relatable at all. She is this superficial blonde valley girl who is obsessed with pink and she finds herself in Ireland trying to solve the murder of her sister. This girl is a total failure in life but thinks she is smart enough to solve a murder? Seriously COME ON...And the book leaves you with a cliffhanger and lot of questions. So basically you feel like you just wasted couple of hours reading a book only to find yourself frustrated.So why 3 stars? Well after reading the other reviews and because I'm weak for cliffhangers...I read the next book and thankfully Mac grows up more and then I ended up reading the 3rd book and that was the turning point. This series becomes highly addictive after the 3rd book and you will fall in love with it by the end.So if you are going to read this book...just be prepared to not like it and then make sure you keep reading till the 3rd book because its almost worth it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is book 1 of a 5 book series with cool covers. The book is written from the first, historical point of view of a shallow and annoying 22 year old pretty blonde girl (as we are repeatedly reminded). Everytime something exciting happens, the author writes, \\"Looking back now, I don't know why I walked down that dark alley\\", or \\"Later on, I would understand the meaning of that\\"...So there's little excitement because there's all this commentary from the future.So a 22 year old shallow blonde girl goes to Ireland to investigate her sister's murder, knows no one, heeds no advice, and only gets involved in dark, dangerous things. She sees the hideous Unseelie (which I felt bad about, as I am a Merry Gentry fan), and the one Seelie prince who makes her take her clothes off and play with herself in public, she's so aroused by him.The heroine was incredibly annoying. Unlike the heroines of Charlaine Harris and MaryJanice Davidson's books (who are also young and blonde and pretty), this heroine has absolutely no charm. She comes off as spoiled, self-absorbed, rude and annoying.The hero, Barrons, is mean and dark. They have no chemistry. She's an annoying thorn, and he keeps her as a tool to find precious items.The plot is pretty good, a bit scary for a paranormal book, but not that well written (as the heroine, the hero, and the odd scenes with the Seelie prince keep on interfering with my enjoyment of the story).I will not be buying anymore of this series. Maybe the author made the heroine so annoying to contrast her with her later, more experienced and wise self, but after hundreds of pages of toughing it out, I've had enough of the heroine's first person, historical commentary."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It isn't often you read something that surprises you. I didn't want to like the main heroine because personality types like her's often annoy me like crazy. The girl is vain, more interested in her wardrobe than the reality of the world, and gets a wake up call. Throughout the whole series, not just this book, you see this girl transform from mundane to extraordinary in unexpected and surprising ways. I won't bother summing up the book or recapping the highlights because others have already done so. But I truthfully have to say I love it when an author doesn't baby their pet characters. These characters are beautifully flawed. They are so much so (flawed that is) that they become real to me. There hasn't been a book five in a series I've anticipated more than I have the last one in this series coming out the 18th of Jan. It's on pre-order and I never do that.Read this series. It's fabulous. In fact, I only read it because it was on so many top fantasy lists on this site. In fact its on a lot of all time favorites lists everywhere. I see why now after reading all four.

Moning obviously wrote book one about a young woman having to grow up fast. She's a completely different person in book two. Don't lose faith in her, she grows a lot and it takes her a while to learn about this world.As for Jericho, he's the most intriguing character, I want more scenes with him! There's obviously some kind of history with him and V'lane. I wasn't sure whether to like V'lane or not, or even what his story was about. Guess I'll find out in future books! :)I'd like to add that it is refreshing to read a book that doesn't need a hookup or a happy ending/relationship/marriage."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this book! I'm almost embarassed that I got it for free, because it is definately worth [...] bucks. The heroine Mackayla reminds me of buffy the vampire slayer without the corny valley girl slang. The anti-hero hero Jerrico is smokin hot! yeah, He might be an ass, but he's there for Mac when she needs him the most. Run don't walk to get this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I think I've read all of Moning's books, so I was excited to read this book, even though she said it is not a romance. It definitely is NOT a romance, but it sure does sizzle. Mac (main character) tells her story in past tense and she is reliving it for us. If you like Karen Marie Moning's books for their wit and imagery, you will like this book... just don't expect romance (at least not in this part of the series)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"You know what it is like to be so captivated by a book and the characters in it that when the book ends you are sad that there aren't anymore chapters? That is how I felt after reading this book. The author has a magical writing style that draws you in so subtley that within a few pages you are completely invested into what is happening. I tore through the pages so quickly that I was surprised that I had reached the end!I literally did not want to put the book down, so I flipped back through the pages trying to \\"re-live\\" some of the events. What I found on my second read through was a new appreciation for just how sublte this author is. She tossed away foreshadowing bits of information that I completely missed on my race to finish - and discovering them made me LOL!I have recommended this book to friends and family, both male and female, of ages from teen to retired. They have all loved it as much as I have and eagerly await the next installment in the series. Now I recommend to you, read the first chapter and see for yourself just how enthralling this author is! Happy reading =)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I started Darkfever, it was something different for KMM and something different for myself. Wow, I'm so glad that I decided to read it because Darkfever is the first book in the most compelling and enthralling series I've ever read!I don't get the MacKayla hate, she's a 20something year old girl who prior to her sister dying didn't have a care in the world, I know people like her! It's great watching the evolution of MacKayla Lane in the hands of such a talented story teller.If you haven't read Darkfever yet now is the perfect time to start! All five books in the Fever series are out so there is no wait time between books. Turn off your phone, computer and tv and jump into KMM's Fever World. It will take you on an incredible ride!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've heard more than one person say they can tell whether they will like a book if it hooks them from the beginning. I can tell you that if I subscribed to that notion, I would have missed out on one of the best series I've ever read. \\"Darkfever\\" didn't hook me from the start. In fact, I thought about putting it down a couple of times at the beginning. The story is about a 22 year-old blonde Georgia peach, who lives with her mom and dad. She likes pink and happy music. She grates on me. But having read the entire book and those after it, I see that we had to meet Mac when she is this way. We had to see who she WAS before we can truly appreciate the metamorphosis she undergoes.Mac's sister, Alina, was an exchange student in Ireland, when she was brutally killed. The police give up on her case quickly, prompting Mac to fly across the ocean. She only intends to push the cops to keep investigating. But she is drawn into the intrigue that was responsible for her sister's death. Mac's only clue about what happened to Alina is a voicemail she left hours before she died. She tells Mac that she has to find the Sinsar Dubh... and that sets Mac on a quest to find out what that is and how to find it.On the streets of Ireland, Mac begins to see things she can't believe are real... hideous monsters in the guise of human beings. And one night she finds herself in an abandoned neighborhood, surrounded by a sense of dread. She barely makes it out, to a well-lit bookstore, called Barrons Books & Baubles. The man inside, Jericho Barrons, is a sexy, enigmatic man who is larger than life and somewhat foreboding. When she asks him about the Sinsar Dubh, which turns out to be a powerful book, it sets off a series of interactions that lead them into a partnership. Barrons explains to Mac that she is a Sidhe-Seer... someone who can see the Fae and sense their sacred objects, the book being one of them. Barrons has been looking for the book too, for reasons he doesn't explain. They team up to find it.Barrons is very hard to read. Mac's descriptions of him show they are clearly attracted to each other. But there is something about him that is not entirely human. He's somehow more. He's also very tight-lipped about who/what he is and what his ultimate plans are. There is way too much going on to plot it all out, but I can say Mac learns things about herself that change her entire view of her life; she learns what her sister was doing in Ireland and who she was doing it with; and she learns that all Fae do not wear the face of a monster.This is not a romance, despite Karen Marie Moning's great work with her Highlander books. There is no sex to be found. But you could definitely make a case that there is something brewing between Barrons and Mac. Their interactions are complex and confusing (to Mac and to the readers.) And they become even more so as the books progress.It took me awhile to get into this book. But as the series continues... you fall deeper and deeper into this dark world. The most important thing I can tell you is this: if you plan to read this series, do not begin without having all 5 books in front of you. Start with Darkfever and read them one after another. Each book ends with a cliffhanger, and you'll kick yourself if you don't have the next book ready and waiting. The wait betweenDreamfever: The Fever SeriesandShadowfevernearly killed me.4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was very entertaining and creates a wonderful fae world within our world. I was surprised this was in the romance section, because though there are very sexually charged moments, this came off more as a mystery/supernatural novel about a girl looking for her sister's supernatural killer. That being said, I still enjoyed it and was turning the page to see what she was going to come across next."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"With only months to go until the 5th and final book in the Fever Series is released, I've had to look back over the progression of MacKayla Lane. While she starts out as pretty and pink and so very naive, she is no longer that way by even book 3 (FaeFever). Some will go from the highlander series expecting Mac to be similar to Gwen, Chloe, Gabby, or any of the other Highlander Heroine's. Mac ends up as so much more, having to accept a reality beyond what even those other Heroines had to accept (and two of them are married to time traveling Druids). There is not just one Hero in Mac's world. There is dark and brooding Barrons; the ever presumptuous Fae V'layne, and a few others along the way. This is not a romance, anyone looking for it to be one will be sorely disappointed.Even Karen herself was worried about writing Mac's story when she saw pretty pink Mac. But after knowing Black Mac, the journey has so been worthwhile.Karen makes Mac's journey memorable, and the supporting cast will keep you on your toes wondering what their hidden agendas are and what's going on behind the scenes that we don't see. This set will not be for everyone, but don't be so quick to judge the whole set on the way Mac is presented in DarkFever. If you do, you're missing out on a hellofa story."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"** spoiler alert **Sometimes when I do some research on a series before I invest myself in it, I form an idea of what I think the book will be like. Based on the descriptions and some of the comments on Goodreads, I was expecting the typical urban fantasy heroine and a brooding, mysterious guy wearing a duster. I fought reading this series for awhile. I didn't think it would interest me and I would be bored, but feel obligated to plow through all the books b/c I had to know how it ends. I also held off on starting the series until the final book came out b/c I absolutely despise cliffhanger endings just as much as I do love triangles. So a few chapters in, I realized I incorrectly judged this book based on a few one paragraph summaries.I like Mac. She's normal, relatable and wants to pee in her pants at the thought of \\"saving the world.\\" I like that realism in an unreal world. Quote: \\"It was one heck of a tall order for a short-order bartender. I would have snorted if I hadn't been on the uncomfortable verge of peeing my pants with fear for the past half hour.\\" The book is a little dark, but not oppressively so. Barrons is almost unlikeable, but I won't write him off just yet. After all, he DID paint her nails at the end of the book. I gave it a 3.5 because some parts dragged for me. Again, it's the whole world/character building handicap of book ones. Anyways, I like the series enough to be excited about reading book 2."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Someone recommended this to me, but it was just really slow. And considering how upset Mac was I thought it was odd that I couldn't feel any of her upset. I dont know. Maybe it was me. It seemed like it should have been a good story, but I just didnt connect."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I want to start off with the positives since if affected my rating of the book more: First off, the storyline was amazing. It was incredibly interesting and I didn't find a single dull moment. Second, the creatures. Moning's sidhe-seers and fae are so unique from any other book I've read. It was refreshing and a lot of fun to experience something new. Lastly, the world Moning created. I could picture everything and that is really important to immersing yourself in a book. Honestly, I would read the whole series just to experience the world in these books.On the other hand I have two major complaints; I didn't like either of the main characters and the way the book was written irritated me. To start off, let me just say that I feel Mac will eventually grow on me but I was expecting a hugely different person when I began reading. I expecting a kick-butt chick who'd be witty and humorous (yeah, yeah ie any heroine from other urban fantasy books). Mac... isn't really any of these things. Things meant to be funny just seemed whiny. I'm completely okay with her incompetence, I think it's fun to see her grow but even at the end of the book she's willing to give up. Next up, Barrons. What an jerk! I don't get anyone's attraction to him at this point. Okay, so he was marginally likable by the end of the book but I can't forget all of the nasty things he's done leading up to that. Am I just spoiled because I've read so many books that have insanely amazing male leads? I'm not asking for perfection, I'd just like one or two redeeming qualities. And now for the styling of the book: I don't like having the narrator spoil the end of the book for me or really any other parts of the books. Mac was constantly telling us \\"I didn't know it then but...\\" and fill in some major plot point there that ruins a scene several chapters later.All that said, I did enjoy the book. It didn't live up to my expectations but I will continue reading the series because it is still worth it. I hope Mac and Barrons at least become less of a problem for me, I really want to like them."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Confession: I only read this book because it was FREE. I had never read anything from or about this author before. It suckered me right in and left me on a cliffhanger. Great marketing scheme. I had to have the rest of the series - only it wasn't completed. So I purchased them a little at a time and just \\"shelved\\" them. I'm just not one of those that can wait for the next book when a book ends (or should I say NOT ends) on a cliffhanger. When the final book was released, I started by rereading this book. The main character is annoying. The rest of the characters are mysteriously aggravating as well. It was like watching the 1st season of Lost, I had more questions than answers. Thankfully this series eventually did wrap up the questions. With twists and turns the whole way. I liked that I wasn't able to figure things out before I was supposed to. I liked not knowing the good guys from the bad. I only gave it 4 stars because the books must be read in order and you have to read the whole series to completion. This book should have been called: Darkfever (Fever Series, PART 1)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I\`ll admit I was sucked into the Fever world and have read the first four books. Barrons is somone a really wanted to learn more about, he was just written as such a mystery. I couldn't get past my dislike for Mac she had long blond hair, perfectly tan legs she loved so show off, and apparently has a job and went to college but lives at home. She searches for who is responsible for killing her sister and heads to Dublin. Ends up getting abused by Barons then abused some more by V'Lane and these men are potential love interests. I loved the book store Barrons owns and the decription of it. The book is set up for you must read book 2 to get any answers and even then after book 2 you get more questions. Some love this, I enjoyed it a little but got frustrated. I'm sure lots of fans would disagree with me and everyones entitled to their own opinion, but beware if you start this series you'll need to read the rest of the series to get any closure and mostly the other books in the fever series gave me a headache. I really regret being sucked in to the this series and won't go for anything else written by this author."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Well I got it just because everyone was talking about it, and I enjoyed it (I dare say)!I'm not head over heals with excitement but it was really captivating.Barrons has me wondering (allot of thing all the same time) what he is, what he is after....and so on.About Mac I can say that I loved her disbelief, another world opens up and she can't handle it at all!!! I'm really not fond of characters which take the entire nasty-tricky little vampire-faery-otherworldly thing too smoothly.Just hope that the romance heats up a little bit and thank god that this series is already over because I am not good at waiting."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"i was slightly disappointed, after reading about the book and several of the reviews here on amazon and on goodreads i was just expecting a little more. don't get my wrong, i did like the book, it was entertaining enough and it was a quick read but it just wasn't quite as captivating as i had hoped. some of it just felt a little tired or overdone. i also was rather disappointed by the main character, i spent quite a good deal of the book either flat out not liking her or just being annoyed by her and i also did not have the fascination w/jericho that i think i was supposed to or that a lot of other women did who left reviews. he was definitely too annoyingly characterized for me. i'll most likely still get the 2nd book in the series but i'm not ordering it right away like i had assumed i would be after finishing this one. i'll get it eventually but i don't feel a great need to continue the story right away. maybe book 2 will change that once i read it or maybe i'll decide not to keep going, who knows. i would still recommend the book to anyone who likes this kind of story just with the note not to expect too much from it, it was a good book, just not great."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"To be honest I thought this book started out a little slow but the story was interesting enough that I kept reading. Books 1 and 2 in the Fever series do a lot of building up for the explosive action of the next 3 books. Definitely keep reading! by the time I was halfway through the 3rd I couldn't read fast enough and literally dove right into book 4 the second I finished reading the 3rd. Mac's whirlwind adventure is an adrenaline rush of danger, magic, and dark romance."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've had this on my to-read list for quite awhile. But, other books kept jumping out at me. I'm glad I finally picked it up. It's a very interesting start to a series I think I will really enjoy.If it weren't for the sexual aspect of this book, it could be borderline YA. MacKayla is only 24, and still has some late teen tendencies. She's young, naive, and somewhat unfocused. She's content to go through life for the moment, although you get the feeling she's on the brink of being forced to grow up. And then here sister is murdered, and she feels like she's the only one who can solve the case. It's amazing how fast she recognizes her own shortcomings in actually accomplishing this task. It's also amazing how fast she gets in over her head. But, I liked her. She had a mouth, without being vulgar. And she knew what she wanted.The world of the Fae is different in this one. It's much more dark and gruesome. Mainly because the few books I have read, don't focus so much on the Unseelie. Vlane was interesting. His story line alone is what pushed this book into adult paranormal (if not down right erotica for his short appearances in this book). Maybe that's what made me think we would eventually get some release for the obvious sexual tension between Mac and Jericho (not to mention the cover of the book).But, why everything was there for a great book, it just felt a little slow to me. And there was just something missing (I can't put my finger on it). I'm greatly intrigued though and will definitely continue the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I liked the Fae element of the book, & Jericho is an intriguing character. Ms. Moning seems to be a talented writer. (This is the 1st book of hers I've read.) However, having such a ditzy, below-average intelligence main character & then peppering the book with SAT/ACT-level vocabulary just made the whole thing just not quite work. I will likely give 1 more of the series a try, mainly because Jericho is such a compelling character. I hope Mac develops into a more believable character - fitted to her &#34;calling&#34; - as the series continues."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Maybe it is just me but I found the constant flashforward lines supremely annoying and they seemed to occur every few pages. You know, lines like &#34;I didnt know it at the time but it would turn out I would regret that move&#34; or&#34;little did I know then just how wrong I was&#34; or &#34;..and that would be the last normal night of my life&#34;. Ugh already, we get it! Interesting world and creatures and I want to know what happens next but not sure I could read another couple of these....."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ok, first I really love her Highlander books but I knew from reviews not to expect anything like that with this one. This book was OK, I really wished she had not written it in 1st person but it was not a total let down. The different Unseelie creatures are interesting and I do love Barrons. For the most part I skimmed the book and focused on the times when Barrons was present. I'm hoping that the next book is better and I can't help but wish for a little sexual interaction between Barrons and Mac in the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Im not happy with the way it leaves off but it is definately worth reading. Anything she writes is worth reading & I can't wait to buy the sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading the first book in KMM's new series. I have read her other series but I think this one will be far superior!! I love that it's written in first person and Mac is great! I love the creation of a whole different and very intriguing new world! I read all over the board and especially like the thriller genre! This book has all the aspects of a great read. I like the clever, witty banter between the main characters! My only regret is that Book 2 is not here yet because I know that there is more in store for them along with some hot romance!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love Karen Moning. I've read the entire Highlander series about three times. The character development, the plots, the romance, the uniqueness of all her Highlander books drew me in from the very beginning. Not so much Darkfever. It took me over a week to finish it which is rare, I usually finish her books in a day, two at the most. There was virtually zero character development, unless referring to an \\"unseelie\\" and then there is all kinds of details, which I could care less really, what the Gray Man actually does and looks like. I disliked the fact this book was billed as romance. I dislike the fact that we are supposed to believe a girl in throes of grief for her murdered sister had enough forethought to pack her girly nailpolish and adorable, \\"pretty\\" silver and gold sandals and cute little matching twin sets and skirts. What.Ever. I can suspend reality only so much, and this book truly tested my limits. What really disturbed me was the gratuitous sex scenes that bordered on rape that were thrown in strictly because it's expected. I hope this Darkfever series is on the fast track so she can get to writing her outstanding Highlander novels once again. So many wonderful romance writers have jumped ship and left historicals and romance novels behind to pursue other genres. It's a shame Karen has done the same."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It seems that all of my authors in the \\"got to buy immediately\\" category have been failing me on their most recent efforts. KMM, unfortunately, has joined this ever growing list.The \\"first person\\" style doesn't bother me too much so I can't blame my criticism re Darkfever on this issue. This title could have been condensed to a couple of chapters prefacing this tangent to KMM's series. In reading Darkfever, I did something I would never have thought possible with a KMM book. I skimmed, skipped and eventually yawned my way to the end. How sad!This is, I believe, the third of my usual standby, favorite authors I have done this with."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I had never read a romance novel in my life until this past summer when we were on vacation and I'd forgotten to bring a book. My wife handed me her just finished copy of The Immortal Highlander and I was hooked. Though I didn't make it through the entire series, hard as it is to admit, I did go on to enjoy the adventures of Drustan, Daegus and Cian. Unfortunately, I can't recommend Darkfever. I was so bored and disinterested in the lead characters that even if they ever do evolve, I won't care. I don't plan to read anything else in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After waiting so very long for Ms. Moning's book, I was extremely disappointed. I found myself skipping pages looking for something as exciting as her Highlander series.There was no development of sexual tension or romance between the heroine and the hero. In order for the author to sell future books inthis new series the reader would have to be sold on this first one which I found to be very disappointing."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I couldn't even get into it, I quit by the second chapter. This book was in a list that was recommended for readers who liked Twilight and the Sookie Stackhouse series, but I did not enjoy this one. To each his own, I suppose."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I hate ot say this, cause I love Moning's work, but the way she wrote this, well....I stopped reading after the first chapter. I tried continuing it, but by the second, I couldn't take it. The way main character talked drove me nuts! I missed the confident and sassy heroines. This almost seemed like she was trying just to get the interest of the new generation. Don't think I'll be continuing this series.Hopefully she'll go back to writing about Highlanders and time travel once she's finished this."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is the first book in the five book Fever series by Moning. The fifth book \\"Shadowfever (Mackayla Lane)\\" is scheduled to release in January of 2011. I enjoyed this first book in the series, although you can tell the purpose of this book is mainly to introduce us to Mac and the world she's been thrust in to.MacKayla Lane, Mac to her friends, is your typical southern belle Barbie-doll type. She loves shopping, scoping out hot guys, and dressing in pink. Then she finds out that her sister, who is studying abroad in Dublin, has been brutally murdered. With the Dublin police poised to set aside the case for lack of evidence, Mac decides to travel out to Dublin and do some investigating of her own. She finds out that she barely knew what her sister was really up to in Dublin; her sister had gotten involved something dark and deadly. Now Mac is being drawn into the darkness too. Mac finds out she is a Null, a very rare type of Fae Seer....and unfortunately Fae don't like Nulls. Now with most of paranormal Dublin out to kill her Mac will need the assistance of the dark and dangerous Jericho Barrons if she is going to survive long enough to hunt down her sister's killer. So good-bye pink high heels and hello black sneakers...Mac's got some Fae to kill.If you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer you will enjoy this book. It really has that same type of vibe going on; pretty blond fashion obsessed girl finds out that she is destined to fight evil dark bad things. Mac comes off as a bit ditsy, fluffy, and naive in the beginning on the book; but as the story continues we start to see a tough core of bravery and stubbornness. Barron is everything you could hope for in a hero; tough, complex, mysterious, seriously bad-ass, and of course gorgeous.Moning does a great job of writing a well-rounded novel. The surrounding descriptions are very good, so you can easily picture the surroundings. The characters are complex and interesting, with many shades of grey to their personalities. The action scenes are well done too. Of course, time is taken to describe Mac's colorful outfits, which soothes the fashionista in me. The world-building is creative, fantastic, and very engaging. There is definitely some dark humor throughout the book, which lightens things up and keeps them from getting too dark.The story was hard to put down and made for a quick read. There is a lot of mystery to be solved and this mystery really keeps you turning pages. This book does wrap up the main storyline of Mac finding her sister's killer, but it doesn't resolve it. In fact you are left with a pretty big cliffhanger. I think if I had read this book when it was first released I would be pissed at how the story ends. Luckily I have the next three books already, so I don't have to wait to continue the story. My recommendation would be to buy the second book with the first one so that you don't have to wait to find out what happens.I was a bit leery about reading a series of books written by a prominent romance author. I shouldn't have worried though...this book is not a romance it is a great dark urban fantasy. All in all it is a pretty dark story with lots of creepy gross evil Fae. It is definitely a read for a mature audience; there are a couple almost rape scenes and some sexual situations as well as quite a bit of swearing.Overall I thought this was a strong urban fantasy and I really enjoyed it. It didn't absolutely blow me away, like Ilona Andrew'sMagic Bites (Kate Daniels, Book 1)series did or Faith Hunter'sSkinwalker (Jane Yellowrock, Book 1)series did, but it was engaging and interesting. This book was very much an introduction book and I have a feeling that the story will grow in complexity and interest with the next book in the series,Bloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I nearly didn't finish this book, but worked through it because a friend had recommended it highly. I am SO GLAD I did. Our protagonist comes off as immensely shallow, self-centered, whiny, and unlikable, and it nearly ruined it for me. But, for those of you who are thinking of stopping- don't! Keep reading! Not only does MacKayla have an \\"awakening\\" of sorts in this book, but we get introduced to one of the most intriguing characters I've ever read about- Jericho Barrons. And, oh, is JZB worth it.This first in series sets us up well for the rest of the books, introduces our important characters, and shoves us face-first into the world of the Fae. It also sets so many of us up for the Jericho vs. V'Lane debates and even gave me a chuckle with the various OPI nail colors (some of which I own!) that Mac talks about throughout the book. My review is probably a bit tainted because I've read and adored the rest of the series, but I encourage you to pick it up and follow through- the book is great and the rest are even better."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am no expert on urban fantasy and will not waste any time on analyzing the quality of writing of this genre book, I am just going to say that Darkfever's standard mix of ass-kicking heroine/amusing cast of secondary characters/lore/mystery/paranormal hunks worked for me.MacKayla Lane is a 22-year old blonde southern belle/bartender/part-time student who peacefully lives with her parents in a small Georgia town. Mac's life is turned upside down when she learns her older sister Alina is brutally murdered in Dublin, Ireland. The search for the murderer is fruitless and after uncovering Alina's last cryptic voice message, Mac decides to go to Ireland and try to push the murder investigation in the right direction. In Dublin MacKayla immediately finds herself thrown into a world of Faery and learns she has a powerful connection to this world...The first thing that drew me to this book was the narrator - MacKayla. My last couple of attempts to explore the genre of urban fantasy were unsuccessful mainly because I couldn't stomach the protagonists. After enduring wimpy and boring Mercy Thompson (Moon Called) and perpetually gloomy and defiant Kate Daniels (Magic Bites), reading MacKayla's \\"voice\\" was a relief. She is not particularly smart or strong, but there is a certain lightness about her, and the fact that Mac is not traumatized by some past events is a breath of fresh air too. So many UF heroines, almost as a rule, are some kind of recovering victims. Luckily, Mac isn't one of them.The lore and the setting are enjoyable too. Karen Marie Moning builds her fairy world on Irish lore and I think succeeds in it. Her fae are interesting, with their various abilities to feed on humans' beauty, to make their unwitting victims sexually aroused, etc.What might turn off some readers is:1) This book doesn't have a conclusive ending. Darkfever is simply a first chapter in Moning's 5-part story whose major conflict will be resolved in the last book - Shadowfever - out December 2010. Only a few story threads are wrapped up in this installment.2) Lack of romance. It doesn't mean there are no hotties to swoon over however (mysterious Jericho Barrons and ruthless Fae prince Vlane are both irresistibly alluring), but at this point Mac is with neither of these guys.Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It was fast-paced, filled with entertaining characters and interesting lore. I will definitely read at least the next book in the series - Bloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I adore some nice, juicy urban fantasy here and there, Kim Harrison being my absolute favorite, so this was a pleasant way to spend my day, despite some bumps in the road it was a pleasant journey, one that I'm really looking forward to revisiting in the next four books. The story revolves around MacKayla Lane who is happily enjoying the summer and it's warm rays, lounging by the pool, listening to her ipod and not having a worry in the world, all that ends when the news of her sister's death shudders everyone's peace. Alina has been murdered in Ireland where she was studying, and Mac is obsessed with her last phone call, where she leaves her a distressing message that hooks Mac into her sisters mysterious world on the other side of the globe. So the young MacKayla flies to Ireland, she brings her charm and wit and a sense of humor and total disregard for safety with her, her lack of belief in the realm of magic puts her on a dangerous new path, one that will change her life forever. The clues to her sister's death are nothing like she has ever seen before. Her entanglement with Jericho Barrons turns her life upside down, basically ending her past habits that are no longer safe or acceptable. Together they steal some rare artifacts and make more enemies than imaginable. Mac's life wasn't all filled with magic, and battles, she went to cafes, had tea and coffee, downloaded the latest itunes and enjoyed a warm evening here and there. It added warmth and a glow to the character, making me a bigger fan, Mac was on a journey after an object that her sister died for, a dark mysterious book that had all the bad guys in the area sharpening their teeth and claws for. It was fun watching this total girl run around with a mysterious man who was on a mission to find the book for his personal library.The constant reference to \\"dark, carnal heat\\" that the few male creatures possessed in this book was a bit annoying and cheesy, too much life a romance novel for the fuzzy place in some female's heart. I appreciate the sensual tension in books as much as anyone else but this was really a bit silly, I wish it was a bit harder and less romance novel like, but overall I had a blast reading it and I can't wait to read the next few books, I all ready have the second and third and I'm anticipating diving back into Karen Moning's enticing world of fast cars, two faced men and fun old artifacts that can do some serious damage. This world she created seems broad, I'm happy that there will be five books total to this series, when something is good we want more right, so why are people complaining that they have to read on is beyond me. I'm enjoying this ride no matter where it takes me, after all I'm the guest in the authors head, the least I can do is sit back and let her tell the story.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read all 4 books in this series, and can absolutely swear to you that you won't be dissapointed!

Otherwise I probably wouldn't have read it. Urban Fantasy is not really my favorite genre. Also, somehow I've managed not to read any of Moning's books. So given all that, Darkfever was a wonderful surprise. The story sucked me right in and was a quick, fun, interesting read. The young (only 22), humorous, and determined heroine, Mac journeys into the dangerous and bewildering world of Fae who are starting to take over Dublin. In an effort to discover who murdered her much loved sister, Mac teams up with the mysterious, not very nice but full of valuable information (which he may or may not share with the poor girl) Jericho Barrons. Mac struggles with whether she can trust Jericho who doesn't go out of his way to reassure her. Nonetheless, he is her best bet for survival and finding her sister's murderer. Meanwhile, Mac's newly discovered psychic skills are extremely useful to Jericho.Moning does a great job of creating the creepy, frightening Fae and the powers they have over humans. Mac is a well-rounded character who comes into her own under enormous pressure and danger. Jericho is an intriguing hero who keeps Mac and the reader guessing as far as his motivations, ambitions and abilities.I have only one quibble. I started to get annoyed by the frequent portentous comments such as \\"I didn't realize then but...\\" \\"I later came to see...\\" \\"If only I had know how true his warning was.\\" But the ominous references to future events also fit in the 1st person narrative and the unfolding story, so it really is a small quibble.All in all, this free 1st book has drawn me into the series as well as introduced me to a talented author to read. I give it a solid 4 or even 4 1/2 stars for being such an absorbing read"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"it was the first timei read a book from this author and i found tha it was extremely good"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this book.

Great alpha men - heros or villians? Not always sure what side they are on. I am fascinated with this series and I am waiting on the edge of my seat for the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book - I read it in two evenings, and I love a book I can't put down. I'm not going to go into much more detail because I'd only be repeating what many others have said well.My only complaint is the handful of instances in which one of the main characters (Barrows, an uber-masculine, demi-god-type man) - occasionally talks like the main character (a modern-day, Southern belle). I'm sorry, but I can't see Barrows in all his manly glory saying, \\"I could lie to you a million ways to Sunday.\\" or \\"...and would have continued swimmingly without you.\\" (page 302) It just seems a little amateurish to make slips like that and not catch them before publishing.That being said, I give it 4 stars because I like the plot, the characters and imaginative concepts. I have hope that the writing will mature as I read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"For those of you starting out in this series, keep reading. I admit I was not too impressed with the first book. But I found it entertaining enough to continue reading. The second book gets better. The third even better. Fortunately, I had all five books to read in a row, so the cliffhangers were not problem for me to absorb. In fact, I was pleased to end a volume wanting more. The fifth and last book is by far the best - you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"DarkfeverBy Karen Marie MorningRating: a strong PG-13Spoiler Alert: a little, but no detailsCoffee Bean Rating: 4.5/5 (I really want to give it a 5!)Finished a fun, fast, and exciting book. Darkfever by Karen Marie Morning. A friend of mine gave it (along with the 2nd and 3rd in the series) to me a LONG time ago, but I never got around to reading it until now. I picked it up and finished it in a few days (which is impressive for me right now since it's 350 pages and I really had to look under couch cushions and behind doors to find time to read it). I read the last page today, halfway through my lunch and was very upset to find that the remaining 10 or so pages were just flyleafs (or is it like the leaves on a tree and is \`flyleaves'?) and other \\"non-Mac related\\" writings. I plan on zipping home and promptly grabbing the next one off my shelf and starting that one. I have a strong feeling that I'll be starting the third one by Monday. Some books just do that to me (City of Bones series, Sookie Stackhouse, Hunger Games, and Fever series just to name a few).Onto the review!MacKayla (Mac for short) Lane just found out that her sister, while studying abroad in Ireland, has been murdered in a cruel and horrible way. Against her parents' pleas, she quits college (she's 22) and goes to Ireland and demand that the police reopen her sister's case and solve the murder. And if they don't, then by golly, she's gonna do it for them (and without breaking one of her perfectly pink nails). She ends up getting a disturbing and cryptic message from her sister via voicemail just hours before she was killed. Trying to seek answers to the clues she was given, she asks the wrong man for help about a book, Jericho Barrons. Turns out, he's looking for it too, and doesn't think she should be.Well, that just causes Mac to dig in her heels and try harder (like she says, \`pride is her special little problem'). Things happen and cause Mac and Barrons to partner up, although reluctantly. There's so much tension and unacknowledged attraction between them that neither of them sees, or at least will admit to. But I saw it!! And I was soooo hoping that something would happen between them. I knew they were destined for each other the moment they met (but I'm not going to tell you what happens. But I will say this, I am both pleased and very, very not-pleased with how Morning grants my wish).While trying to track down her sister's killer and find the book that will help her do it, Mac is plunged into a world she had no idea existed with fae, and vampires and all manner of creepers in the shadows. All with a man she still knows nothing about or what his true intentions are. With her and with the book.Morning tells the story from Mac's pov and does it with sass and humor that made me instantly connect and fall in love with our heroine. Morning is witty and funny, created multiple forms and types of tension with masterful skill that had me turning the page under my desk at work (just kidding, of course. Or am I? Mwahaha). A warning in advance: I looked on the spine of the book to find out what genre it was and read, Romance. Hmmm...while there were scenes not intended for the faint at heart (which may or may not include me) this was by no means a typical \\"romance/bodice ripper\\" type book. But, I'll admit here and now, I was rooting the entire way through the book for Barrons and Mac to kiss. :)[...]"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Great start for the series. I am looking forward to the sequels. Moning spins a nice tale - a little slow in the beginning, but then she is building characters. Greast Read!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I started with Darkfever and was addicted to the whole series by the end of the first chapter. I was fortunate enough to start the first book just as the last one,Shadowfever, was being released, because there were a TON of cliffhangers that just get more intense towards the end. This review is really more about the series, and less about this one book, because I don't think you'll be able to stop once you've started.MacKayla Lane starts off as an average, slightly-spoiled, but very likable young woman. Through the series, she goes through enormous trials and meets new and fascinating characters that fall in every space between the measures of good and evil. Her partner in crime (literally), Jericho Barrons, tends to remain in Mac's mistrust throughout most of the series, and shows his loyalty in strange and unconventional ways that attract the reader enough (against all reason, sometimes) to WANT to trust him, too. Much of the story revolves around this constant back-and-forth in their intriguing relationship, made even more volatile with the addition of V'lane, a Fae who also finds Mac attractive and useful to his cause.The rest of the plot finds Mac struggling to find out 1) who killed her sister, 2) who she is, and who she is becoming, 3) the history behind The Book that Barrons and V'lane are chasing for very different reasons. (A note: I'm always intrigued when the author creates unique and complex mythology within his/her own story.) Moning's skill in pulling all of these elements together in such a balanced and fascinating way is truly astounding, especially considering the level of darkness that runs throughout the series - just the right mix of Eros and Thanatos, as Moning might say.Now that I've finished the books, they are in a coveted spot on my bookshelf and in danger of being reread so often the bindings could become highly creased."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It's been a while since a book hooked me on the first page, and this one sure did! This story is wonderful. I won't go into the plot because you can read that in the book's description. I'll just say that I fell in love with the characters, the plot, everything. And even though I was not prepared for the \\"steamier\\" scenes, they were exciting, not trashy. I look forward to reading the entire series and moving on to more Karen Moning books. I am very impressed with this series and author."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"A friend bought me this book over a year ago and the cover art never really spoke to me. Well I just had surgery and was ready to start a new series while recoving. I started the book yesterday and finished it this afternoon! A great read! Took me a few chapters to become fully invested but once the main character, Mac, starting embracing her power I was smitten with the story, mesmerized by the characters, and on the edge of my seat to see what happens next! I've just ordered the remaining in the series and cant wait til it ships here!! Highly recommended for those who love a good butt kicking fantasy with weird twists and brief indulgences of the erotic type ;)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I usually make a habit of reading at least three bad reviews, and three good, and decide then if I should read the book or not.I'm really, REALLY, glad I bought and read this book. This whole series in fact.I'm not into spoilers, or quoting lines from the story, so I will leave it at this: It is more than a revenge story, and it's not at all a romance, although there are tons of situations and opportunities in which the write could have taken it in that direciton. It doesn't drop you into the middle of a fictional state of mankind, and doesn't broadside you so much that you feel there's too many details coming from too many angles. It starts out normal enough, and slowly (not too slowly) builds up and eases you into the world of Karen Marie Monings making. And that world is fabulous! Hair-raising and scary while simultaneously being humourus and attractive.I highly recommend this book, this series, to anyone. It's just a great escape =)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I got to check out this series when this book was free for the Kindle for a little while. The first book was engaging enough to keep me going, and each book got better. This is not like her Highlander series, which is basically a series of free-standing romance novels. It's much more urban fantasy, with a first-person point of view, and one long, complicated story told throughout the 5 books. The characters are interesting and complex. The themes are powerful. You get to watch Mac grow and evolve, from a shallow, spoiled 20-something, into a powerful woman. I loved this series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What I Loved: This is going to sound odd but this book was nothing like I expected. The story is interestingly twisty and while I could understand what was going on, I never could get ahead of the story. I really enjoyed that aspect of not knowing was coming. Mac is a strong female lead but not overbearingly so. She makes mistakes, she is scared, and she seems very much like a 22 yr old thrown into a situation that she had very little control over. At first when she was described as a 22 yr old barbie looking type of gal, I was set to hate her. By midway through the book, I was rooting for her.What I Liked: Mac and Jericho's very complicated sarcastic relationship. Jericho is still a character that I am warming up too as I can't quite figure out exactly how he fits in with everything. I don't know if I trust him or not. That being said he was great to read. Vlane wasn't in the story enough but his effect on Mac was astonishing *blush*.Complaints: None that I won't address in the Audio ReviewAudio specific review: The narrator took some getting used too. She made Mac sound older and Jericho sound very grouchy. As I got used to her reading though, I noticed that the pacing was fantastic and the nuances were dead on. So stick with it past the first couple of chapters, you will get used to the voice and tone she uses.Why I gave it a 4: I would listen/read this book again. This is a great launch to the series and can't wait to read the next one.Who I would recommend it too: This is an Urban Fantasy novel through and through. There isn't an HEA but you kind of get the idea that someone that has been introduced might be her HEA. I think PNR readers will like it too because of the paranormal aspect.[...]"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I saw this book was free so I downloaded it and started to read. I am the type of reader who will determine if I will finish the book in the first chapter or two. This book had me from the start. I read the first book in a day or two and bought the second read it in equal time and then the third. I was like a junkie who couldn't get my fix fast enough. I think for the week I was preoccupied with reading these books that my husband thought he was a bachelor. When I finished the 3rd book in the series I went to the author's website to see when the next installment was coming out. I ACTUALLY had to wait a month for the latest release to come out and it killed me!!!!! I ate that book up in world record pace. So now I am having withdrawls because the last installment won't come out for another year!!!Of course this type of story is not everyone's cup of tea, but for me I am a big FAN of the FEVER series!

And Darkfever sure did it for me - I ended up buying the next three in the series, and can't wait for the fifth and last book. I enjoyed the characters, the story line and the fact that it wasn't quite as stereotypical (girl meets boy, falls in love, falls in bed) as most plot lines go or the cover would have you believe.Darkfever is enjoyable, well written and got me hooked on a new author."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I came to this series via KMM's time travel romances and wasn't quite sure what to expect from this new series. I thoroughly enjoyed this first book and can't wait to move on to the second. I liked how she ties in some of the Fae elements (the Hallows for one) that we learned about in her Highlander series. Makes it interesting for those of us that have read all of her books!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The plot is discussed thoroughly in other reviews so I won't plow that same ground again. First the good: I really liked the world she creates, and I find her version of the fae interesting. I also liked the Irish setting and the idea that certain neighborhoods seem to drop off the map and be forgotten when infected by the baddies. There is not much romance in this book, although foreshadowing suggests there may be more in subsequent books.I had several suspension-of-disbelief problems with the book. I found the heroine too shallow, dumb and weak to really respect and could not really believe that she could hold her own with the antagonists. I thought she should have easily solved some of the problems that confronted her but which left her completely stumped. Also, I didn't find the male anti-hero budding love interest to be very believable. He seemed unnecessarily mysterious. And in any case, since he needed her help in a big way, she could easily have demanded more information from him. Maybe it's not fair to complain about suspension-of-disbelief issues in a supernatural thriller, but it did dampen my enjoyment.Despite these flaws, I did enjoy the book and I'm going to read the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"not usually a reader of this genre yet it involved me immediately and engrossed me entirely."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It surpirsed me how good this was.

She's got the perfect parents, the perfect sister, the perfect life - and as you'll hear OFTEN - the perfect plethora of pastels and pinks in wardrobe, accessories, and nail polish. Then comes the phone call that utterly destroys that pretty, magnolia-scented bubble. In the aftermath of her sister's brutal slaying, MacKayla (Mac) embarks on a quest for vengeance and justice, determination and steely grief her constant companions...well, those and all the ultra-hip and heavy-on-the-pink accessories she can drag along with her.God, she's annoying. I mean seriously, thoroughly, bang-my-head-against-the-wall-at-her-insipidness annoying. With an almost pathological need to explain every wardrobe choice (not to mention how great she thinks she looks in each and every one) and all the waxing philosophic on the names of nail polish colors, Mac is the single most superficial, shallow, inane, and self-absorbed princess I've ever read as a lead character.Trust me, that alone would usually be enough to completely strip me of any desire to continue this book, let alone get invested in the series, and yes - that's not the only fly in the ointment that is Darkfever - but there IS a lot I liked here (just about everything NOT MacKayla), and it's enough to make me stick with the five-book Fever series despite a lead character who has this to say: \\"I've always liked museums. I should probably pretend it's because I'm so erudite and scholarly and love to learn, but the truth is I just love shiny, pretty things...\\"Yes, that sound you're hearing is my head impacting the wall. Again. Though admittedly, points to the twit for stellar vocabulary. And that's actually when I started to notice things beyond my annoyance - the first being, in Mac's defense, she's led a VERY sheltered life - and we're only STARTING to find out how, why, and that there really is a reason for that through this first book. And in truth, she's naive, she believes in happy endings and DOESN'T believe in things that go bump in the night (or better yet, Things That Can Eat You), and she's FAR too interested in gauzy pastels for me to EVER think her normal, yet she's NOT stupid.Ignorant of the full scope and breadth of just how bad her life's gone to the dogs (or Sidhe in this case), but not stupid. And as this book is told from her point of view, looking back at the happenstances of a year ago, the reader knows almost immediately that what Mac has had to become (I'm assuming we'll see that development continue through the series) resembles not at all what she is as she first steps foot in Ireland to find out who killed her sister. The way it's done is a device I don't particularly enjoy reading - too much foreshadowing and endless comments about what's GOING to happen and not enough seeing it unfold AS it's happening - but the world that's being created by the author and the characters that are introduced around Mac are intriguing to say the very least. There is nice depth in the world building, and the magical mythos of Irish history is itself almost tertiary character that adds a unique flavor and tone. I just really wish Mac had been toned down (A LOT) after the author impressed on us (see also: beat us over the head again and again) that she would mature and get with the program eventually. It would've made it a better read without losing the point.I'll stick this series out, I think, because I've just got to find out what Barrons really is and I'm very interested to see what V'Lane's got up his...er...sleeve. This particular installment in the series gets a 3.5 from me for that very reason."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"DarkFever is a really great read. This book was so well written that I read it in only one weekend, and it was so difficult to put down. I kept wanting to know what Mac was going to do next. It was a free kindle download that was a great read. I am now hooked on the series.Dark Fever is about Mackayla \\"Mac\\" whose sister is murdered while attending school in Ireland. Mac listens to a message that her sister leaves for her four hours before she dies. In the message Mac must find an important book. Mac leaves for Ireland and begins to uncover a whole new world that she did not know exists prior to leaving her small Georgia town of Ashford.The writer really does a great job describing the characters and pulling the storyline together. I didn't experience one dull moment while reading this book. It seems like the writer really enjoyed telling this story."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane lives a good life in a small town, like an oridanry woman, or so she believes. When her older sister is murdered in Dublin without a single clue to her death other then a cryptic message she leaves on MacKayla's phone before she dies, Mac is forced to travel to Ireland in hopes of finding her sister's killer.Where has this book been up to this point of my life?! I have heard so much good about it, that I finally had to cave in. I ended up chewing the book up everytime I opened it's pages. I love paranormal, but this, this was a different kind of paranormal and it's story line and take on the Fae world is a refreshing breath of air.Okay, I will admit. I was not really attached to MacKayla, honestly she was a little too barbie for me, too colorful. She did grow slightly on me through the book, because she kind of grows and progresses, but she is not my most favorite character. The thing that I did like about her, that despite I had to read about nail polish, and rainbowed colored clothes that she wears - she stuck to her guts and to what she believed. Granted, jumping into things had gotten her in trouble a couple of times but here is where Barrons comes in.I loved Barrons, I think he is the only character that made me keep reading this book. Aside from the fact that I found the story line and the concept absolutely fantastic. His dark and mysterious and finds himself basically babysitting MacKayla while she is on the rampage in Dublin because at first she has a hard time believing Barrons about what she is, and who the unseelie are - and well, the fact that they could kill her. Literally, there were times in the book where she had me cringing my teeth grumbling 'stupid'.Oh and then there is Vlane, an alpha Fae who makes sex addictive to female human's that had found his way into MacKayla's life as well as she journey's head first blinded into the unknown. In order to discover the secrets of her life and a mysterious book that everyone wants their hands on.

I thought it sounded really interesting but it kept getting pushed to the back corner, then last week I decided it was time to read it for the Dark Fantasy shelf in the bingo game I'm part of. It was so much better than I expected I wish I'd started the series all those years ago because now I'm hooked and can't wait to read the rest of them. I really liked Mac as a character she's just so sweet and innocent not you're typical kick ass-heroine but she has so much potential to grow as a character which I really like. I found Mac easy to relate to, her character reminds me of a girl next door type, she's pretty but she's not a stuck up girl which I really liked makes her more real. I found the book very well written, the characters are well developed, and the story flows smoothly. I really liked the concept of the story, the whole world creation is great and it's a action packed story that I had a hard time putting down I just really loved Mac as a character."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The writing in these books rivals literary fiction, but it's fantasy so all the better.

Her pretty world fell apart and what remained of her little happy family was left devastated after learning of her unexplainable gruesome death.

This was something new and she wasn't just going to cry over everything and give up hope like her parents had.The police refused to follow up on a cold case with not a single lead - the message gave them nothing to work on so it was deemed insufficient - leaving Mac even more frustrated. It wasn't long after weird stuff began happening; she begins to see grotesque monsters, her first was sucking the vitality and beauty of a woman oblivious to the decaying hideous monstrosity, she's now seeing things no one else could and was quickly coming to the conclusion that she was going insane. Oh, she'd be wishing she was.After she got lost in some wasteland part of the city, where the shadows aren't what they seem to be, she stumbled her way with relief to \\"Barrons Books and Baubles\\" a bookstore that was run by the mysterious, off the charts handsome (as I like to think) and lethal Jericho Barrons who enlightened Mac about the secret world unseen by mundane humans and all the creepy crawlies that live amongst them beneath the glamour they cast to blend in. She also learned that she was a Sidhe-seer, a person that fae magic can't work on, able to see past their disguises. Mac and Jericho did not get off to a peachy start but they'd be needing each other soon enough and they didn't have to like it.Jericho is also searching for this book Alina had mentioned, the Sinsar Dubh, a long lost powerful relic of the dark fae, the Unseelies, along with everyone else even the supposedly good fae, the Seelies. This book holds immense power so it's a no brainer why anyone wouldn't want it.I don't want to give away anything else but let me tell you that it was a heck of a ride. I read this book in less than a day if you add up all the hours. I like the writing style, it was engaging, to me it conveying Mac's thoughts, feelings and reactions clearly and I certainly approved of the little touches that made her sound like an actual person. The characters are interesting enough and I find Moning's world very intriguing though probably as I had found Kate Daniels', but it was worth the read. While blazing through, I felt the darkness oozing out from the streets of Dublin through the pages (or in my case my computer screen) and into me and I just love it when a book affects me so much that I feel apart of it's cast of characters, like I'm wading through the stream of emotions that our protagonist is splashing through.Speaking of whom, I've read reviews describing Mac as being spoiled, whiny, stubborn and unpractical. Well, she is all girly girly and into pink so much that normally would force me into a major gagging session and before picking up Darkfever I was expecting some nausea knowing that I'll be walking around in her head. Fortunately for both Mac and I, I'm open minded. I wouldn't be all kinds of harsh on her if I were you. She grew up in a safe environment, she was naturally drawn to things pretty and shiny. The fact that she's blond might get people to think that Mac's just another \\"dumb blond\\", she is who she is and that's that. What she is is a good person who needs a reality check. But then again, we sure as hell can still judge a person but that is unwise especially when we don't know them.Mac gradually develops into a more ... what to say ... street-minded/street-wise person, she even contrasted herself in the latter portion of the book. Actually I'm quite glad she even cared to juxtapose at all. It shows me that she's aware of her metamorphosis, one that she was forced by circumstance to partake in. Though I do wish she'd shut up about what her favourite nail polish is and to complete it was her narrative of what she wore. Oh, the pwetty (misspelled intentionally) things! Meh. Thankfully, she eased up on that as her character progressed, Mac understands the necessity of her choice in apparel but she doesn't appreciate this change because it doesn't reflect who she is. She doesn't want to be someone she's not and I give her respect points for that. Mac herself is changing so naturally her previous preferences will also evolve. I will inform you that she's still into pink.Oh, how I would just love to gush about the strikingly stunning beautiful Jericho Barrons, but I won't because I'll just embarrass myself and people possibly will come to think that I'm a middle aged housewife wishing to be swept away by an unnaturally handsome, non-existent Irishman (no offense to you married middle-aged housewives). I concede that the latter part might be true. If my father comes across this review, I've said enough for him to review the books I buy. That would be a dark day if he discovered certain books. Ahem.Mac calls him Barrons throughout this book and this might be due to her reflexive dislike to the man and probably he has this aura of dangerousness about him, I wouldn't be too hasty to be on a first name basis with a guy I don't like at all too, nor one that I'm not sure who's entirely human. Yes, if you Darkfever it seems hard to believe Jericho ( as I prefer to call him) is 100% human, actually I don't think he's human at all.I think this is long enough of a review and I hope it's done its part to encourage you to get yourself a copy and sample it with a relish. To finish off I'd like to say it's nice to see Mac's development in this first book of the series and not till one or two books later. Jericho is still a mystery so as a rule he's still where we found him; undecipherable - for now, that is. I enjoyed their banter and the way they react to each other. Mac didn't instantly fall heads over pink heals over him like many heroine do but she's attracted to him, to her mild annoyance, and he didn't pursue her attention ... well not in a man-meets-sexy-lady kind of way, it's refreshing. I liked the little snippets of wise words Mac shared. Really, she isn't just a pretty face with a sunny personality.Get it. Read it. Get hooked. Don't misjudge blonds."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was a little worried when I read such phrases as TMI and NOT! Luckily, this made more sense the further I read. Once I finished this first installment in the series, I was hooked. Thank goodness the series is finished, as I would be really upset to be left hanging!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just read the Highlander and Fever series, and I should tell you that if you are new to Ms. Moning as an author, you should go back and read the Highlander series and then the Fever series as there are elements in the Highlander series and makes the Fever series easier to understand (I think).All of her books are awesome, I love the characters! The storylines are great, the steamy sex scenes are better than any of the wanna be Grey series books (in my humble opinion). More relasitc for us ladies who like normal romantic and loving sexual encounters, not \\"let me hurt you\\" kind of stuff.Anyway, love these books and my favs are the Highlander series. The Fever series is very good too, but I like that the Higlander series can stand alone (don't have to wait for a sequal) yet brings characters back from book to book and you can find out what's happened to them later on in thier lives.You will love these books! Warning though - there are some pretty steamy secitons. :-)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a very intriguing dark fantasy. I normally don't like books written in first person and I tend to dislike a series that is based on the same character. I was at first very doubtful about this book due to comments by reviewers regarding Mac and her being a girlie girl that likes the word \\"pretty\\" too much, links pink too much and sounds/seems like an immature teenager. On the contrary, Mac may have started out that way, but only in the very beginning. As soon as she finds out about her sister's death, Mac slowly changes from that naive, immature girl. Her character develops in slow degrees and I really have to give kudos to the author, I found Mac's reactions to what she finds in Dublin is very realistic.The book is a great introduction to this series and the characters of the story. Like many other fans, I love Barron's character and cannot wait to see how his relationship develops with Mac. V'lane is really a secondary character in this book, although there's somewhat of a lust triangle between the Mac, Barrons and V'lane. He is no where near as interesting or mysterious as Barrons' character. Their chemistry and tension is amazing from the very beginning. I love their interactions.The pacing, world building and writing are very good. There's plenty of action and plenty of things going on.This is my first KMM book and she does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I wasn't sure about this series because I don't read very many books that deal directly with mythical creatures that are not also paranormal. This was a rather fun, if a tiny bit dark in some places, read and I think people who already love this genre would do well to read this book. I know I'm going to read the whole series definitely after having read this book. The only thing I didn't like about it was not a part of the book itself exactly. The formatting of this book doesn't have the chapter demarcations at the bottom of the Kindle screen as I would have preferred. I already bought the second book in the series and I'm glad to say that it does include them. The characters in this book are very intense, but still believeable, aside from the literal impossibilities, but that adds to the fun. I could say this book is about having new experiences, but also about learning to watch what you do when confronted with that new experience and finding help when it's required. I won't bore you with a plot summary as other reviewers are fond of doing that. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is into this genre. I've seen the ratings list of the numbers of people who gave this book which numbers of stars, but I don't agree that it is worth less than 5 for what it is now. I don't think this book tries to be anything other than what it is, an adventure full of fun with a bit of excitement and learning along the way."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I usually don't read romance novels in the paranormal/fantasy genre, but this had had some good reviews and I caught it on sale really cheap. It was not what I was expecting. It was much much more. Awesome characters, excellent writing, intrigue, mysteries, murder and lots of sexual tension!!!! Rarely have I read a novel where I just HAD to go get the next one in the series (not since Harry Potter) immediately. This had me hooked good."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Refreshingly Intriguing!I'm dedicating this review to my daughter Heather, she loves this series and has been waiting for me to read this series since 2010. I can't believe I waited this long to read this first book. You were right my lovely daughter, I did enjoy this book. LOLWow! Totally not what I was expecting in a paranormal book. With great insight to the Fae World between the Seelie and the UnSeelie, the reader learns of the evil that exist between the two courts.To me it seemed the UnSeelie Court is the worst due to the horrifying creatures associated with it, I think I prefer the Seelie court with the beautiful and sexy Seelie like V'Lane that get you all turned on that you have your clothes off before you know it and so wanton for a good banging that you'd probably screw anything in sight (there is mild erotica due to nature of sexual description Mac experienced 2 flames out of 5 flames) - LOL verses being with an UnSeelie like the Grey man that glamours his true hideous form and sucks your essence and beauty that eventually kills you.I didn't know what to think of Mac (Sidhee Seer) in the beginning mainly because she is so young like in her early 20's and very immature but by the end of the book after going through all the hell I saw her maturity grow and began to respect her as she sought revenge for her sister and was kick ass in the ending.Now when it came to Jerico Barrons (?), what an ass! However, I kind of warmed up to him in the end when he saved Mac's life. I still cant wait to find out what he really is though. I like the connection that he and Mac have started and you can tell that even though they find each other a nuisance that they are really attracted to each other and I hope that their relationship builds into something more romantic.The ending left me hanging with many questions and now I have to read the second book so for readers out there, this is not a stand alone book. My questions are, did the Lord Master really kill Mac's sister, will Mac & Barrons find the Sinsar Dubh, and will there be romance in this book?So thank you my sweet daughter for getting me to read this wonderful book, now I'm off to read Bloodfever because of the new addiction.Great Read! Recommend for paranormal lovers of the fae."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Do not pick up a KMM book unless you have time to sit. Every single one of them is a page turner and this one is no exception. Mac and Barons are so real. Dublin comes alive. You will see her monsters in your dreams. Sleep with a light on!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Interesting read. It started slow, but it had enough mystery to keep me reading.Warning, there might be some spoilers!My god, the heroine was soooo annoying, more times than not, I wanted to strangle her. She was 22 but I can't help but imagine her as a 16 year old, with a pigtails, with lollipop in her mouth, wearing pink clothes, with pink nails and toenails. Stroking her hair \\"oh, they are so shiny and so beautiful, and feels so silky, and I just love my 'juicy purse, and my favorite color is pink'\\" I sh** you not, that's what she Said! I never wanted to strangle someone as much as I wanted to strangle her.I could not understand why author would choose such a shallow and superficial character for the book. At that moment I was seriously considering putting the book down, because she annoyed me more time than not. Until...Until she met Jericho Barron. He brought a nice balance to the story. I was glad to find out that Barron and I were on the same page when it came to certain things, he did the strangling for me (literally :)). I like the fact that I never knew where I had him. Was he a good guy or a bad guy? I'm still not sure, but it's ok. I'm hoping to find out in the nex book.I like the fact that the book wasn't predictable. The author dropped few hints along the way, you could guess that there is more to the words that were spoken and you still couldn't put the finger on it what it was. Like every time Mac asked him a question about who he was, he would answer, but his answers just raised more question and made me more suspicious.As the story progressed I was happy to se Mac grow out of the \\"I-love-pink, unicorns and rainbows\\" personality. I guess she realized that when the sh** hits the fan, pink toenails can only take you so far :). I actually started to like her towards the end.My only problem was the lack of romance, I would have loved to see some. Her constantly... Uhm... Masturbating in public didn't do it for me :). I also didn't like the way she quoted her mother, it sounded a bit immature.All and all, it was a good book and I will be reading the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"You need to read all five books together. It's one long story with cliffhanger endings at the end of each book. There are slow parts and repetition in the last three books, but it's still an entertaining story.I can't believe how many times I made notes of interesting conversations, ideas, and things that made me chuckle. I loved the scene where Mac and Barrons had an angry conversation with their eyes (page 230). What I liked best about the book was the relationship. They didn't like each other but they had something the other needed which forced them to be together. I enjoyed watching them keep secrets and lie to each other. I frequently don't like lying when it doesn't fit the character. Here it fits and is entertaining. There is no romance or sex in this book (other than two brief scenes - not with Barrons). Don't read this if you're looking for romance, but there is some romance in the last two books. Read this if you want a good suspense story with great relationship tension.I like the idea that Mac is a contemporary woman from a small town in Georgia. She travels to Ireland and finds inhuman creatures who glamour themselves to appear human. They kill and hurt humans. Mac can see through their glamour. She can see their true form. I enjoyed identifying with Mac. I like the contemporary-here-today-among-us element.READERS WHO DID NOT LIKE THIS:I noticed several reviewers did not like the heroine and claimed she was stupid. I'm quick to anger when a smart heroine does something stupid to move the plot. But I did not see that here. Mac is not doing the smartest and most logical things, but I felt her thinking fit her character. I see her as Reese Witherspoon in the movie Legally Blonde. She's the Barbie doll type, into clothes and fashion. She lives with her parents, works part-time as a bartender, enjoys an easy-lazy-no-stress life, and she's happy. She never needed to be smart or fight. Now she is thrown into a world of death and survival. Her initial reaction is to not accept what she is seeing. She becomes smart and strong in later books. Her changes are a good part of the story.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:I was unhappy with the author's first two books in the Highlander series. One main character hurt and rejected the other throughout the book with inaccurate assumptions, lying, and stupidity. They weren't good stories - for me. I decided not to read any more of this author. Then a Goodreads friend talked me into trying the Fever series. (Thank you Madame X!!!!)UNDESIRABLE THINGS FOR ME THAT ARE OK IN THIS SERIES:I'm intrigued that several things are going against it, but I still liked it. 1. I prefer third person; this is first person. 2. Urban fantasy is not my first choice genre. 3. Cliffhanger endings at the end of each book. 4. The author changed! I didn't think an author could change so much. This feels like a different author from the Highlander series.DATA:Narrative mode: 1st person Mac. Story length: 347 pages. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: moderate/strong. Number of sex scenes: 2 . Setting: current day Georgia and Ireland. Copyright: 2006. Genre: urban fantasy.THE SERIES:The five books in order are Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever, and Shadowfever. Book 6 is Iced. It starts a new series with Dani as the heroine."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am not writing much!

You have dicovered it, you have found the perfect combination of human emotions, mystery and urban fantasy blanded mixture.

First time I read a book focused solely on fairies.I couldn't put it down and I loved Mac regardless of her bimbo apareance.So I think it's safe to say this first installment is just an introduction to the series. We really don't know what's going on. We just know Mac's sister was killed and she wants to find out the person responsible for it.In the quest she learns that fairies exist and she encounters a mysterious man who ends up helping her, well they end up helping each other.This man is Jericho, and holy cow! He is hot! Like super hot! In a sort of black dagger brotherhood, immortals after dark, kind of way. I just can't get over how hot he is. And even though we didn't learn much about him I am totally hooked.At the end of the book she finally finds the missing piece to solve the mystery but it slipped away. Now we also know there is so much more than just the murder of her sister and fairies. Theres also a doomsday in the midst.Now, I want to go back to Jericho. Why did he send hot glances her way? Why did he kiss her at the end? And why, oh why, did he paint her nails? That was totally adorable.I want more Jericho Barrons please!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"While not as fascinating as her Highlander Books I still enjoyed reading Darkfever and think the next book will be even better because the ground work has been lain and Mac should begin to evolve and get over her girlie girlie ways since she now understands there are things that go bump in the night and monsters do exist and they will kill you if given the opportunity.Barrons didn't appeal to me at all for the biggest part of the book. I actually fingered him to be an ass and full of himself but towards the end I began to realize this was just what Mac needed him to be because she was so soft and feminine and surely going to get herself killed before she ever realized what was going on. In short she was naive and child-like. He had to harden her up.Still bit confused on the bookstore clerk, Fiona. Is she one of Barrons lovers or just a dear friend? At some points she acted sort of jealous towards Mac and then in the next instance she was worried over her safety?"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didnt think i would like the main character, and thats still out. but shes starting to get interesting. im not much of a pink fan anyways, lol. hopefully this will stay a good series! on to the next one!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love this series.

This book/series is SO MUCH MORE. Others have touched on plot, characters, etc, so I won't go over that again.I'm gonna be honest and say I didn't really enjoy the Highlander romance books Moning wrote. They are typical romance, if you are into that, which I am not.But I think Moning found her stride when she made the Fever world. Stepping out of the romance-box, she has created an entire fantasy world within reality--for adults!! I personally enjoy many of the fantasy-type books (that suggest hidden aspects in reality, such as super-natural creatures, the world of Fairy, hidden powers, etc)that are written for young adults. Moning has managed to create such a world while avoiding being cheesy or totally unbelievable.I greatly enjoy the tension/relationship between MacKayla and Barrons, and her interaction with other characters. Her personal journey and growth are believable. There is just the right amount of romantic sub-plot and no cringe-worthy sex scenes found in most novels that fall into the romance genre. I have read this series 4 times, and will probably re-read it every year. I look forward to more books set in this world.Overall, I think with this series, Moning's genius began to flex, and she did an amazing job creating a world that I am always sad to leave at the end of the books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Greatest series ever, can't say that enough!

However, if I never read another word penned by this author, I do not feel my life will be the less for it. Indeed, I believe this novel could be inflicted upon people as a form of punishment. The narrator/\\"heroine\\" is superficial , both in development and personality; if anyone can actually relate to her, I would immediately end that friendship based on their lack of substance.

It was funny in spots and It was well written."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"moning is known as a romance author, and that's part of the reason I put this book off, though it was a freebie amazon kindle promo - I had to be in the mood for something a little trashy. this, however, was completely not that book: sex in this world can be deadly, and there's no quick flirtation before the tumble in the sheets for this girl.MacKayla is a green-off-the-turnip-truck southern belle, with no more pressing concern than what shade of pink she's going to do her nails. she gets the phone call that her studying-abroad sister has been killed, and ultimately heads to Dublin herself when she thinks the police have closed the case too soon. Mac stumbles into the horrific world of the fae - inhuman predatory monsters - when she discovers she's one of the (un)lucky few that can see through their glamour to the true evil beneath.what's good about this book is simultaneously what's bad about this book. the heroine is, quite literally, TSTL (that's \\"too stupid to live\\" for those of you unfamiliar with standard paranormal romance tropes): she blunders in way over her head several times, necessitating rescue in one manner or another, and hearing her prattle on about revlon iceberrry pink polish became annoying quickly. that being said, it was refreshing to have a main character that was an actual real person, not an instant super-badass, not someone who blithely accepts a whole new supernatural world in an eyeblink. all of the main characters are complexly flawed, leaving no one obvious to root for as the knight in shining armor, but leaving everything intriguingly mysterious. it doesn't end with a cliffhanger, though none of the major plot points are tied up.in short, the whole book feels like an extended prologue to the series. it's written in a future-tense first person, as though Mac is reading you her journal a year or two after the fact, giving you glimpses into the stronger, harder woman she will become. as long as that promise of character development comes through, and this intro remains the weakest in the series, the rest will be well worth getting into."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Don't let the 4 stars fool you...I am addicted to this series like a good drug.

It is written like he is an oral storyteller and is so engrossing as to make it difficult to put down. I originally thought due to the title that I would just read it aloud to my boys but I found when they had fallen asleep I couldn't stop and have since read this book at least three times and bought a used copy for all my nieces and nephews. The history is very one sided and from an Englishman's point of view he has a poor opinion of his royals with the Great Alfred being the first and last king of any esteem. His descriptions of the wars with the thousands of dead contrast sharply with the \\"clean\\" wars of today. Fields with thousands lying slaughtered is incomprehensible. Life was so cheap then at least as described by Dickens. This is such an engrossing history but with so much strong opinion it certainly wouldn't pass muster in todays historical circles which is part of why it is so fun and dare I say naughty to read.

This masterpiece shows how the gender relations between female slaves and their white masters have often subverted the values of a hypocritical and conservative society, allowing the changing of status of black women, among which the most famous one was certainly Chica da Silva, a former slave who began to live among the members of the limited gold-mining elite after becoming the concubine of a portuguese official.

Software Engineering Institute)","review":"Tony Geraghty is uniquely well-placed to write this history, whose fine and precise balance surpasses the best Fairbairn-Sykes has to offer. No one can ever legitimately accuse Geraghty of favouritism in this fight, since he despises all three sides equally and with a perfect hate.A British Airbrone Vet born in England of Roman Catholic Irish immigrant parents, Geraghty was personally decorated by American General Norman Schwarzkopf. While reporting from Ulster, he had the distinction of being assaulted twice in one afternoon, first by Paisleyite irresponsibles, then by Rampart-like RUC uniforms. He was also arrested at gunpoint for curfew violations at the Falls, and interrogated at gunpoint by the PIRA. In 1998, the British Ministry of Defence's &quot;Admiral's Gestapo&quot; Inquisitioned him over this very book. There is one other important qualification not presently mentioned. In the late 1970's, Geraghty was nearly murdered by British mercenaries headed towards Angola, after he had taken the trouble to help them find replacements in the UK. One of these mercs had been dishonourably discharged from the Paras for running guns to Loyalist paramilitaries.Geraghty exposes Eddie Fitzgerald, O'Neill's Fenians, Wolf Tone Loc, Casement, Pearse and Connolly as embittered, vindictive idle RIF'd has-beens, salon-dwelling poseurs, and otherwise pathetic losers-without-a-clue. His linking of pre-1922 history with the current Troubles is the one weakness of the book. Before 1922, Ireland was genuinely occupied by England/Britain, and the majority of the population did suffer bona fide repression at the hands of various English/British organisms and persons. After 1922, however, Ireland was as free as America and Rhodesia, and chose to become a sectarian theocracy in the manner of Iran and Afghanistan. The majority in Ulster elected to retain their British identity, and the Williamite guarantee of freedom of worship, known to Americans as the First Amendment.This detail, however, pales in comparison to Geraghty's comprehensive and morally unassailable unmasking of the Sinn Fein/PIRA mafia as, in the words of Roman Catholic Priest Father Dennis Faul, &quot;a crazy outfit&quot; that &quot;should be disbanded.&quot; He shows how virtually the entirety of Irish Catholic identity is defined as the negation of being &quot;not British.&quot; He exposes how violence in Ireland, instead of being a means to justify an end, is rather an end in and of itself, as reflected in 1960's IRA capo Cathal Goulding's whining that Irish Americans would not send him money unless violence was involved. Similarly, he points out how the Republican murder machine operates unencumbered by Good Friday.Geraghty also goes out of his way to remember the Catholic victims of Nationalist terrorism: Bob Nairac; thirty-seven year old Jean McConville, mother of ten, abducted and &quot;disappeared&quot; because she gave comfort to a wounded British soldier; nineteen year old Marta from the Bogside, tarred and feathered for dating British soldiers; and Angela Gallagher killed by IRA gunfire. These unknown victims are like Canada's massacred Donnelly family. You never hear word one about them from Peter King, Bruce Morrison, Martin Galvin, the Kennedys, William Donohue's &quot;Catholic&quot; League, the denizens of the New York &quot;Irish Echo&quot; and &quot;Irish Voice&quot;, and all the other stateside Fenian agitators and marks. In contrast to all these false prophets, Tony Geraghty, by keeping alive the memory of the innocents, acts in the true spirit of Catholicism, the message of love Jesus gave to his disciples and to mankind.As well, Geraghty graphically illustrates how the Irish War has effectively turned Britain into a police state that allows intrusive government surveillance and other encroachments on freedom which &quot;cannot be uninvented.&quot; This situation frighteningly parallels that proposed by too many American Congressmen and Senators after the Oklahoma City Bombing. Geraghty's section on Brian Nelson brings up a question raised by Carsten Stroud in &quot;Deadly Force&quot; and by Roger Charles and J.D. Cash's article on Peter Langan; who is worse, the people under surveillance, or the snitches paid to rat them out?Forget the drivel by academics, defrocked reporters and other wannabe writers cashing in on the Troubles to pad their retirement accounts. With Jack Holland and Susan Phoenix's &quot;Phoenix Policing the Shadows&quot;, Tony Geraghty's &quot;The Irish War&quot; is all you ever need buy and read on this subject."},{"Title":"Issues in tool acquisition (Technical report. Carnegie Mellon University. Software Engineering Institute)","review":"Tony Geraghty has done a spectacular job of recounting the Troubles. He is objective and lays the blame of the conflict at the doorsteps of all of the belligerent's, the UDA, the British government, and the IRA. If I can find any fault with the author it is that he dramatically overestimated the IRA's ability in the late 60's and early 70's to subvert the civil rights movement. His most intelligent insight about the Troubles was that the British government failed to create and implement policies which would undercut the underlying cause that fueled the insurgency, discrimination against Catholics, and thus were left to fight a war that one SAS veteran described as 'a war without a strategy run with some times brilliant tactics'."},{"Title":"Living Philosophies","review":"One problem of our age is our perpetual worship of youth, innovation, and newness.

Chess) that would have been really sad if that happened but at least he lived. The story really was great. Loved how descriptive it was.Our most favorite character was Chess, We both thought Uncle Boone Was a stupid person that is not very nice and makes a lot of mistakes. We thought that Amber was kind of snobby; we though that Charlotte was a really nice.Two boys, twins I might add, well one of them dies and the other one lives and after that Christmas when he died they never celebrated Christmas again well while Arty the other twin that lived he was shopping on his b-day when he ran into someone that looked a lot like him he wondered who is he?

The boys' names are Chess and Artemus. Chess ends up with the Holidays and Artemus ends up with Chess' uncle Boone Folsom. The Holidays think Chess is Artemus but he keeps telling them he is Chess. So Chess takes Artemus' place in school and in a play he was going to perform. Well, Chess was trying to get cloths and he stole Artemus' cloths. So the holidays get Chess out of the hospital and give him a birthday present. Chess gets involved in all the things that Artemus was suppose to do, and his uncle finds out that Chess is not with him, so he pretends that he is going to take Artemus back to is home and was really going to kill him. Artemus gets away and goes to the nearest police station and realizes that he is in lass Vegas. Artemus gets home by hopping on the back of a truck and goes straight to salt lake after he calls his home at the police station, and they say that all there children are accounted for. Chess tries to run away from the play and go to the house where Boone is waiting. He gets there and Boone has Artemus captive. Chess goes to school and tries to go to his \\"friends\\" class and they all call him Artemus but his real name his Chess or Lawrence Folsom. Artemus' family that Chess is with is Amber (sister) Jordan and Charlotte (parents) Holiday.I liked this book because it is interesting how two people could switch places like they did in this story. The reason I like this story is because at the beginning I like how Boone and Chess get money because they are poor. Boone gets a ring and goes into the park and says he lost it to every one he meets Chess gets the ring and tells someone what he found and they give him the money for the ring usually about $100. It's interesting how Boone can tell it isn't Chess and Mrs. Holiday can't tell it isn't Artemus. I like how Chess has fun with the Holidays. I also like how Artemus is so determined to get home. I like the book because Chess gets a family and comes to love the Holidays. I like how Artemus rides in the back of two trucks to get home. I like how Chess puts a pizza up to his face to make it look like a mask. I like how Mr. Holiday remembers eight year ago when his son disappears and her remembers it."},{"Title":"A Return to Christmas","review":"A Return to ChristmasThe return Christmas is a great book; not the most action packed but has a great moral.

Chess, learning the meaning of family and Artemus learning that he needed to change his selfish ways.Anyway this is a great book written by one of my favorite authors with his awesome books and tapes of tennis-shoes among the Nephites series with one of the best lessons to teach that we need to take more time in life to understand other people and what they go through so we don't judge them"},{"Title":"A Return to Christmas","review":"Return to ChristmasReturn to Christmas is a great book, it is about two boys named Chess, and Artemus.

While Boone is looking for Chess he finds Artemus on the ground and thinks he is Chess so he takes him to Las Vegas. And that is when their lives changed.This book is great! This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a great book to read during the holidays. It really gets you thinking about your family and what Christmas really means. It makes you think of what you would do if you were separated from your family. Would you be like Artemus and try to find your way home? Or would you be like Chess and pretend to be someone you are not. I really suggest that you read this book, especially during the holidays."},{"Title":"A Return to Christmas","review":"It all started in the store where artemus was shopping.

But there is a nother part to the story the real Holiday kid switched with the fake one so they had to live each other's lives. So I think this book has to be my favorite but don't take my opinion make your own. It also talks about how they found there son. But it can be sad at times well that's what I think.If you like Christmas books as much as I do then read A RETERN TO CHRISTMAS I love this book. And it's funny and sad at the same time but it can get confusing at times. And it kind of jumps from one story to the other but it kind of cool that way.

He slipped of his jeans, and put a pair of khakis on. He left the stall to show his mom the khakis. He saw a boy on the other side of the room who looked similar to him but he ignored it.Chess looked around for something to steal and he say a boy across the store who looked like him he decided to check it out. He found something to steal, a pair of pants! He saw Artemous step out of the stall. He stepped in and put on the new jeans. Just as he put them on Artemous spotted him!The chase was on! Artemous ran as fast as he could, trying to catch the boy that stole his pants. They ran out of the store into the parking lot, Artemous was wearing the khakis that still had the tags attached.

Or maybe it would be more accurate if I said that reading this book made me filled to the brim with ideas. After reading a couple of chapters I got paper and pen, started the over at the beginning and began jotting down every idea generated while reading. I filled pages with notes on things I want to put in my business plan, marketing plan or implement once the company is up and running.I think that Martha Stewart has a bit of an abrasive personality and her \\"tone\\" comes across loud and clear in this book (lots of stories about how she cleverly overcame obstacles in her business career or the high standards she sets for her company that come across at best like being lectured to by your parents and self-aggrandizing at worst) but if you look past that there is a WEALTH of information here. This book is inspiring, thought-provoking and idea-generating. Maybe a lot of it comes from what is between the lines, but it is there nonetheless. I have to say that my husband also read it and didn't like it, but in listening to him I think that it is because all he heard was the \\"I am so wonderful and clever\\" tone in Martha's stories about her company. To be honest I think Martha herself is probably mystified by what it is about her that turns so many people off, but if you just read to glean something from her incredible business savvy, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"The title says it all.

Her tips are current and presented in a clear, concise & logical - albeit dry - manner. She toots her own horn a bit - but let's face it, she's earned it! It isn't that she comes across arrogant, maybe more of an unapologetic confidence; which, again, she has more than earned. Her confidence and unwavering belief in herself has made her the billionaire head of a media empire. It is refreshing to hear her discuss her failures & difficulties along the way to building her MSLO brand. This is a woman who started with a seed of an idea & confidently & methodically moved forward, undaunted by the hard work required & the road blocks encountered. Unlike many business books out there she doesn't tout a get rich quick while working from the Caribbean model. She presents a research, learn, work hard, invest in yourself & your business platform.

Stewart, with her unabashed perfectionism, is a polarizing personality. We have seen Martha at her best, from her breathtaking rise as an overnight billionaire when her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999, to her pitiful fall from grace when she was convicted of insider trading in 2004. However it cannot be denied that Martha's commitment to educating her many acolytes on the art of fine living, and her considerable business acumen, are impressive.'The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success As You Start,' Build, or Manage a Business, is a book Martha began working on while serving her sentence at Alderson, the federal prison camp in West Virginia. \\"There, amidst a thousand or so women, were hundreds of young, middle-aged, and older women who had dreams of starting a business when they were released,\\" Martha writes. \\"Many of them came to me to express their passion, their hopes, and their ideas. They were like the myriad people who write to me with their ideas, seeking guidance, advice, and a road map to a successful business.\\" (xi) These women reminded Martha of the countless fans who would send her letters looking for guidance on how to get a business of their own off the ground. It was for them that Martha penned 'The Martha Rules.'GOLDEN EGG: What's passion got to do with it?\\"Without passion, work is just work, a chore. Without passion, quality, the cornerstone of all businesses, is simply about minimum standards.\\" 'The Martha Rules,' pg. 2Martha subscribes to the notion that passion is the key ingredient to a successful business venture, so it's no surprise that the first of Martha's ten rules is indeed passion. Martha Stewart has built her entire multimedia empire around her passion for fine living, and her desire to bring the very best to her consumers; whether we're talking about a recipe for the perfect chocolate chip cookie, or finding a shade of paint colour that will look as good during the morning sun as it does by candlelight during an intimate dinner party for six (more on that later).In the early 1980s, Martha Stewart was a successful caterer in Westport, Connecticut who decided to publish a book; a book that would go on spawn a new genre on living graciously. Martha Stewart Entertaining was the beginning of her spectacular multimedia empire that would grow to include not only books but also magazine publications, TV programs, a newspaper column, a radio show, and a line of products from scissors to sofas, all emblazoned with the Martha Stewart seal of approval denoting its promise of the finest quality.This billion dollar business all began with passion. Without passion, she argues, work becomes a chore -- like doing laundry; a task few of us complete with much relish. Without a focus on passion, your work (whatever it may be) will become something that must merely be completed. It won't ever be realized to the full of your potential.GEM #1 Write the book you want to read\\"There were plenty of doubters. There had never been a book like it, some publishers complained. (Exactly, I said.)\\" --'The Martha Rules,' pg. 10In 1982 Martha Stewart, an unknown caterer from Westport, Connecticut, wrote Entertaining and revolutionized the world of cookbooks, becoming the leading authority on fine living. To call Entertaining merely a cookbook is reductive; it's a book on the fine art of living with good food as its nucleus. Not only did Entertaining give you menus based on the type of party you are hosting, but it offered tips on d&eacute;cor and hints to make the occasion run as smoothly as possible, something other books had failed to do.With Entertaining Martha Stewart wrote the book she wanted to read. To Martha Stewart's mind Entertaining filled a void; it was a book the likes of which hadn't been seen before. That was the point. She was told it wouldn't succeed, but succeed it did. While the book inspired some derision among pessimistic critics, the public ate it up, and it has become the most successful cookbook (although it wasn't really a cookbook) after Julia Child and Simone Beck's Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Entertaining actually inspired a new genre of books on the fine art of living, and countless copycats have hit the shelves since.In Martha Stewart's case she literally did write the book she wanted to read, but this GEM is analogous for all entrepreneurs who see an opportunity to fill any void. She cites Bette Nesmith Graham as an example. Bette, a secretary, invented Liquid Paper after wasting too much time fixing mistakes on her electric typewriter. It not only made work for Bette more efficient, but became a viable business, all because she filled a void.We have a choice when we see a void -- we can complain about it, or we can fill it.GEM #2 Necessity is the mother of re-invention\\"You should never accept what is offered to you if you feel it can be improved.\\"The Martha Rules, pg. 27For Martha Stewart, a subpar product shouldn't be unconsciously gobbled up by the consumer: we should perfect it where we see an opportunity to do so. When Martha was looking for the right shade of paint, she was \\"frustrated\\" to find colours that were unappealing and not at all what she wanted. So what did she do? Rather than settling for the least offensive shade, she created exactly the colours she wanted. She took her cue from nature (for example the pale blue and green of her Araucana hens' eggs) and with that Martha Stewart Paint, a palette of harmonious colours, was born. Today my bedroom is painted in one of her soft greens.Even the design of Bette Nasmith Graham's Liquid Paper has been improved upon. Instead of waiting for the toxically odourous product to dry on a crusty lump on our page before we can correct our mistake, we now have Correction Tape, which smells great and adheres to the page instantly. There are innumerable such examples, but the important thing to note is that there are more waiting to be revised to make our daily lives more efficient, or in Martha's example, or aesthetically pleasing.Martha's rocket to fame and fortune is due as much to her desire to improve things as it is to creating things. Not all of us can create something out of thin air, but I do believe it's possible for all of us to look for ways to make improvements.Easily digested, The Martha Rules is the perfect book for novice entrepreneurs, or those who need a reminder of why they began their business in the first place. One more point before I end this summary: Martha says that being successful in business is more than just showing up and completing a task. \\"It requires eyes in the back of one's head; constant learning; curiosity; unflagging energy; good health, or at least a strong constitution that will ward of illnesses; and even the strength and desire to put up with sleep deprivation and long hours of intense concentration.\\" (xiii) With passion and dedication, success is attainable. In fact, \\"It's a good thing\\"."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"I know this book was published some time ago so I don't know how relevant a review is, but here I go.This book is largly a vanity piece. Martha praises herself, her projects, and her orginization edlessly. She waxes on about her accomplishments and those of her associates for most of the book, but never discusses her failure or the real challenges she faced starting out.(unless you consider one burnt pigeon pie(which the reader assumes she brings up only to drop the \\"my good friend Pual Newman\\" line over and over). She also discusses her legal issues at some length, but I find this not very useful for most entrepreneurs as by then she was well established, and had a board of directors to navigate her.I did, however find that about 30 to 40% of this book held some solid, practical advice, particularly sections on connecting with your customer and portraying yourself as an expert. She's taken a philisophical aproach to business here, more than say, a nuts and bolts how to. I recommend this book for a)anyone starting out in business, with little idea of how businesses work, and B) diehard Martha fans. But don't expect a personal memoir. Martha stewart is successful for many reasons, her tenacity, relentlessness, ambition, work ethic, but above all, I believe, her ability to promote, and the martha rules is no exception. It is just one more arm in the multi-tenticaled entity that is martha stewart living."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"This is in no way an academic business book, but that's not what it purports to be. The chapter titles are her 10 Rules and they're all pretty much common sense. Her personal examples illustrate how these Rules are used to make decisions -- especially in a start up business. The big take away is when you see how she applied these common-sense rules and how they're manifested in her corporation.Martha Stewart has been successful. She's overcome adversity, dealt with it, and used it to her advantage. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia was able to continue in her absence because she built the businesses in a manner consistent with her 10 Rules.Sometimes I think her personal examples come across as boasting, but as Sparky Anderson (I believe) said,\\"It ain't bragging if you can do it.\\" And obviously, the book is read because Martha Stewart wrote it, and she's done it.I realized the value of paying attention to her philosophy when she wrote early in the book: \\"I did not start an omnimedia company in my kitchen at Turkey Hill; I started a catering company.\\" And then near the end she summarizes how the elements were combined \\"To build a brand\\" and not just to own a business.\\" Keep this theme in mind when you read this book."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"There's nothing amazing or breakthrough about the Martha Rules...except that you won't find this advice put together in just this way. For instance, Martha Stewart emphasizes the importance of identifying a target market that will buy what you offer. She talks about geographic mismatches: pick a location where your product will be welcomed.Sounds obvious? Maybe. But I've met dozens of wannabe Internet marketers who chose products and services that won't work on the web. And I know many coaches who cheerfully advise their clients, \\"If you dream it you can do it.\\" Or even, \\"If you have an idea, there must be a market.\\"Martha has made a career out of understanding her market. She has astounded publishers and investors who underestimated her broad appeal to women. At least one biographer has disparaged her affiliation with K-Market, but Martha understands those shoppers. Another Barnard College alum, Joan Rivers, wrote in her own biography something to the effect that, \\"If you appeal to the masses you dine with the classes. And if you reach for the classes you dine with the masses.\\" Martha could say the same.On page 26, Martha writes, \\"Out of frustration often comes a good idea.\\" She's echoing ideas from Marsha Sinetar and James Judson - and she's right. Often the best way to create a good business idea is to recognize that you can't find something you'd be happy to pay for.The section on idea size - too big or too small - makes sense too. It happens all the time. Why not start a pet-sitting business, I'll suggest. And a client begins to dream big. \\"Maybe an upscale service for wealthy pet owners. In a great neighborhood across town. And boarding services with luxury touches.\\" Never mind that she's renting a studio apartment and needs to start a small business on a tight budget.And finally you have to recognize that creativity may not always be an asset. You have a juice store, Martha suggests. Employees have to follow a formula, exactly. No room for independence.You'll find these ideas elsewhere but they're worth hearing again. Sure, she uses examples from her own business. But let's face it: readers buy the book to get glimpses of the author. She doesn't shy away from mention of her prison time at Alderson. I believe she handled the whole messy situation with grace. And for those who dismiss her as a \\"convicted felon,\\" the label of \\"felon\\" and the determination of \\"convicted\\" often depend on being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Martha's not warm and fuzzy...but not many billionaires are.But for Martha Stewart fans, the Martha Rules offers insights into the woman as well as the business."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"No matter what you may think of her personally, you cannot deny that Martha Stewart knows how to succeed in the business world. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia continues to grow and to create new products to meet consumer needs. These days, the format may be a printed magazine, a television show, or a Sirius radio broadcast -- whatever it takes to get the message across. Who else, then, could be better suited for providing tips for budding entrepreneurs than Martha Stewart? In this book, she outlines her 10 business rules -- guidelines for the newbies, reminders for those of us who have been around a while. She says this book grew out of her prison experience, as other inmates approached her with questions about starting their own businesses. Her rules cover the basics of any business venture: being passionate, coming up with the Big Idea, hiring good people to work with you, doing quality work, taking risks and not chances, etc. She uses examples from her own beginnings and from those of other individuals as well. The result is indeed an introduction that could inspire anyone to start a new company and have an inkling of how to go about it. (I wouldn't rely just on this book for all the answers, though; that's why I gave it four stars.)While \\"The Martha Rules\\" is a promotion for entrepreneurialism, the book also includes insights into Martha's past and into her daily life. It's therefore a good autobiographical introduction for anyone wanting to know more about Ms. Stewart and how she got to where she is today. Readers get the impression that spending five months away from the business was simply one more challenge that Martha not only met, but took on and surmounted. How much more inspirational can a person be?"},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"Martha's passion really comes through in this book, and it's a very good read. It's inspiring for those who have ever dreamed of owning their own business or starting something new. The thing that surprised me the most was that I could see myself in her writing, and I could picture myself in a lot of the scenarios Martha chose. I've always been a fan of Martha, but found her in the past to be very woman-oriented and a lot of her shows/books to be primarily for women. This book is unique in that it is for everyone... male and female, young and old alike. If you want to be the best you can be, want to dream about new beginnings and want the inspiration and clues about where to begin, this is a perfect book for you. I couldn't put the book down after I started reading it. Martha's knowledge and ideas have been put to great use here."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"Its been several months since I read Martha Rules but I decided to write a review today because I just finished Lloyd Allen's book Being Martha and his book reminded me that Martha Stewart did in fact utilize the 10 essentials for achieving success in her amazing climb from home based caterer to expert on all things domestic to media star to media mogul. Martha Stewart had the complete package, passion for what she did, the big idea, the courage to jump in, perseverence, et al. The Martha Rules is a quick read. It cleanly and crisply uses the experiences of successful people, including herself, to illustrate each of the 10 essentials. She only needed her own career to be inspiring and convincing."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"I'm not particularly a fan of Martha's style, but I have tremendous admiration for the empire she's built through sheer vision and hard work. She's one brilliant, driven woman and this book gives great insight into how she's accomplished so much.This book is a great read for someone thinking of starting up a business -- or those who have already done so. Martha is very direct and serious about how you must focus your energy into your business plan and execution. She lays out very good ground rules for cutting the fat out of your initial dream and targeting concepts which will work.I love how throughout the book Martha emphasizes the need for sensible passion (my term, not hers). You have to love what you're doing, but you can't let your emotions overrule your business requirements.This really is a terrific book and I'm putting some of the concepts to use in my own small software business."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"The Martha Rules - Random House Audio (2005)Like her or not, she is victorious over life and circumstances. I spent several weeks listening to The Martha Rules on audio, and it has boosted my business life greatly. During the time I reviewed the book, I had to make an easy decision for a hard situation, and I credit much to The Martha Rules.Martha's clear voice and well-enunciated words encourages you to contemplate the chapters she perfectly crafted (which is her style). The chapters touch upon: passion; defining a big idea by looking closely with a telescope or wide-angle lens (easy for me to identify with this, owning Photography-by-james.com); teach and learn; grow your business; quality (signature of her brand); team building; making hard decisions; understanding the difference between risk vs chance; making it beautiful (another signature of her brand). I consider this book an exceptional investment in the business that is YOU."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"I simply loved Martha Stewart's latest book. I felt that she covered many of the basics that so many entrepreneurial types of business people might possibly overlook. She is driven by achieving perfection and has gathered the best of the very best people in her search to achieve that in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. She has given much credit to the people who have helped her on her own particular journey and when it was time for them to leave and to follow their own star, she wished them well. But she has also had some who have stayed with her for years along with many who were not a good fit. She covers much of the successes and pitfalls of business and the people who have worked with and for her.I loved the stories of some of the people she has had the pleasure of meeting and the successful businesses they have built. She told of the fresh approach many people have given to their inspirations that have evolved into beautiful businesses you want to go and visit just because they are so very appealing in their nature.She freely admits her mistakes and what she has learned from those stumbling blocks. She covered many of those times without dwelling on them. A mistake is only worthwhile and necessary if we learn from it ...or are able to make lemonade from Lemons. She has done this beautifully.From discovering your own particular passion to what is needed to launching your business to the very power of excellence, I found the book to be very worthwhile reading. It did take me three days to read it, but that was only because I wanted to digest what I had read. It is the kind of book that one wants to read again and underline certain passages....or even print them out and post it on the bathroom mirror where one can be reminded again and again. It is easy to read and to understand. Martha, again, has gotten down to the nuts and bolts of a project and made it understandable and appealing to most of us. Whether you are looking at Cottage Industry, a nice boutique, a unique business or even a very large business, this book should appeal to anyone wanting to follow their dream of a successful enterprise. This book is \\"Must Have.\\""},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"I have always admired Martha Stewart. We are the same age. I know what was expected of girls when we were growing up. So maybe everyone doesn't love her. So what? Her business acumen is inspiring, as well as her life story.It was so interesting to hear her story of her experience in prison and the women she met there, and that this book grew out of the questions they asked her.Her points are strong and are common sense. There is no nonsense here. I am also reading &lt;A href=\\"http://www.internetmillionairesecrets.com\\">\\"Internet Riches\\"&lt;/a> by Scott Fox, a new book about striking out for yourself and finding your niche by building an internet business. As I read the book I keep thinking about \\"The Rules\\": be frugal, trust yourself, pay attention to the details. The one reinforces the other. Martha gives you the big picture and \\"Internet Riches\\" is an excellent step-by-step quide on how to put her rules into practice for your own enrichment. Both books are great!&lt;A href=\\"http://www.internetmillionairesecrets.com\\">"},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"Martha is great. In this book, she explains what is required to achieve success. I was struck in the section about passion. Recently, one of my employees kept giving me lip service but her actions did not match her words. I realized that she didn't have passion for her job. When people love what they do, they find ways to be successful. Sometimes people make mistakes, and if Martha has made some, it simply shows us that successful people are human. I recommend this book to mentor anyone who wants to achieve outstanding success. I also recommend Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self to discover how to master any feeling and make the most of any circumstance. Read them both and you will be where you most want to be."},{"Title":"The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Build, or Manage a Business","review":"No matter what you think about Martha Stewart, you cannot argue with her business success.

This book reads like an abbridged version of any qualitative text on running a business - lots of have a big idea, listen to your customers, and hire good people. (As opposed to what?) The only part left out was watch out for the Feds.This book is a definite look into a company founded on ideas, and the packaging of ideas. Forget about exectution and learning much about execution. As Martha explained they leave all those details up to their partners. After reading the rules, I think Martha left out the biggest rule of all - constantly hawk your products like you are P.T.

I don't care about the convicted-felon part -- and I think she handles that honestly and gracefully in this book -- but there is so much more that I'd like to know about her career, and I wish she'd gone into more detail.

She starts out the Introduction with entering prison and finding that a lot of inmates wanted to start their own businesses when they got out. She started sketching out this book then gave a lecture, in prison, on how to start a business.In this book she lays out ten rules that are almost motherhood and apple pie common sense, but sometimes difficult to follow. I run my own business, not even close to being as successful as hers, but it suits me. Like her, I tried several things before this, I learned from each. My business is different. I don't want to work all the time, I want to be able to shut it down and go travelling for a month. I don't want employees, it's just me.As such, perhaps her comment on the kinds of people to hire might not make sense. But I do hire people, accountants, lawyers, whatever. I find myself thinking that perhaps she should have hired better attorneys, criminal specialists (like OJ did) rather than using someone she knew from the business world. I don't know that that was her problem, but I've read that. Like I said, following all her runes is sometimes difficult.Highly recommended for someone thinking of starting a business.

Thank you, Martha, for sharing your wealth of business start-up wisdom!"},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"As an adult Aspie, I found Osborne's portrayal of Asperger's Syndrome to be tedious and tendentious. Even though the condition may be somewhat amorphous, there is a clear distinction between Aspies and non-Aspies. The otherness is what defines Asperger's Syndrome. Osborne attempts to raise the question regarding our very conception of normalcy and the long running theme of the book is the idea that perhaps everyone is on the spectrum in some way or another. That is, despite all its weirdness, there is nothing all that abnormal about Asperger's Syndrome. The message is hopeful in that it opens the gates to social acceptance, but I do think that he tends to underplay the severe problems that autistic individuals have in integrating into society.However often it gets told, the story of the Aspie getting humiliated and then fired from a job, drifting downwards as he claws at any available opportunity, getting fired again, and again, before finally reaching a dead end, is perhaps THE story about Asperger's Syndrome. Geniuses have always been exceptions. Whilst it is heartwarming to think that men like Glenn Gould and Thomas Jefferson may have been autistic too, such trivia provides only a false sense of comfort to the 99.999% of Aspies who do not possess those extreme talents. What hope is there for the Aspie who does not possess the savant like skills in music? How many of us will ever turn out to be like Einstein?Parts of the book had been published in the New York Times Magazine and as befits anything that is published in that august newspaper, the writing is of a high standard. However, Osborne writes as a man who is a professional writer. It is apparent that he has honed his craft and has learned how to reach for the metaphors and the similes. But the style feels a little too commercial, and the words often a little contrived.Of the many and growing publications on Asperger's Syndrome, I would say that \\"American Normal\\" is perhaps one of the better offerings. Books written by Aspies tend to be wooden and excessively direct. Books written by parents of Aspies are usually too homely and thoughtlessly hopeful. Books written by the researchers are typically too specialized to be of any use to the lay reader. While I do sincerely believe that \\"American Normal\\" fails to shed any real insight into the lives and tribulations of an Aspie, it is useful for those who are beginning to apprehend the mysteries of the autistic mind. One should probably not be too critical of those who write of enigmas."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"While I was reading American Normal, I kept asking myself, why is he writing this book. Someone finally asks the author the same question, and his answer is, &quot;I don't know.&quot; I have a theory. Osborne started out to write a book showing that AS is an imaginary problem coined to put labels on eccentrics. When halfway through the book his research shows him that it's quite a lot more than that, in fact a real syndrome completely different from just &quot;a little eccentricity&quot;, he is lost. He no longer knows why he is writing. He keeps mentioning drugs. There are no drugs in the treatment of AS itself. He keeps metioning psychiatrists. It's a neurological disorder, not a psychiatric disorder. He meets, casually, a few Aspies, and suddenly he's an expert. This book mostly made me angry, as it would anyone who knows someone with AS. He seems often to think the whole this is a joke. After all, he's eccentric, and he doesn't have it... Worst book I've read on autism yet. Pity"},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"I think Osborne made a strategic error in the way he wrote this book. I believe his intent was to identify and empathize with those who suffer from Asperger's Syndrome. To this end he showed us how he, a \\"neurotypical,\\" does things that might be considered Aspergerish, such as giving in to an obsessive need to circle lamp posts or to watch every episode of the Japanese TV show \\"Iron Chef\\" or to only feel comfortable at Red Roof Inns, etc. In his interviews with Aspies he took a sometimes playful tone, and in his retrospective of people who may (or may not) have had AS, he emphasized the eccentric nature of their lives, not their suffering. The effect of this approach on Aspies themselves was to make them feel that he was trivializing AS. Some even felt he was making fun of them.Furthermore, in his effort to suggest that AS can be seen as an alternative approach to life (or at least an attempt at one) he ran into those who want to make it clear that Asperger's is a neurological disease and that most (if not all) who suffer from it are not curious \\"little professors.\\" They and their friends and relatives (and the therapeutic community administering to them) do not want to read anything that in any way might mislead the general public into thinking that Aspies are just weird eccentrics.In other words, he missed the psychology of the larger AS community. People who are distinct minorities in a larger community, as Aspies are, and who feel discriminated against because they are different (and the larger society surely does discriminate against them)--such people are not likely to welcome a satirical or playful approach to their situation. They tend to be serious and understandably intolerant of anything that might threaten their dignity. And they are right in feeling this way because throughout human history it is only one step from making fun of people to ostracizing them.Also one gets the sense that more than anything Osborne was satisfying his curiosity. He became the journalist who travels around interviewing AS people to find out what they are like. He reported what he saw and heard. For readers who know little or nothing about AS, this approach has its merit. For those who have AS or are friends or relatives of people with AS, this approach is not only not interesting, it is of little value.The AS people also feel that such an approach does not best serve the general public. What they want are books that inform the larger community about AS in a factual manner complete with an understanding of the problems that Aspies have to deal with vis-a-vis governmental bureaucracies, school administrators, daily life, etc. They are not going to be pleased with a book about AS that is largely an entertainment. Osborne missed all of this. I am sure he was absolutely shocked and dismayed at the reception his book received from the AS community.On a more positive note, like me say that Osborne is a very good writer. He worked hard to make his book accessible to the reader, and, yes, entertaining and very readable. He balanced the interviews with Aspies with information about historical figures like famed pianist Glenn Gould and our second president Thomas Jefferson and others who might have suffered from AS. He did this in an attempt to give as broad a picture as possible. He even compares AS to other neurological diseases such as latah and koro in an attempt to show how such disorders are affected by cultural norms in different countries.What I think Osborne was trying to do is follow the ideas of Dr. Mel Levine, Professor of Pediatrics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, whom he quotes as saying that \\"American psychiatry embodies a deeply pessimistic, gloomily simplistic view of the world\\" and is \\"Unable to conceive of a healthy eccentricity...\\" And so it resorts to \\"reductionist labeling.\\" In particular, the Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders is replete with \\"dubious disorders\\" which \\"children are shoehorned into.\\" (pp. xiv-xv)He further observes (still relying on Levine) that \\"the codes [from DSM-IV] are quick and convenient, especially for the purposes of filling out insurance forms and getting reimbursed, but they bear little relation to the complexity of people's lives.\\" In other words, the whole idea of syndromes as defined by the DSM-IV is a convenience for the administrating and \\"therapeutic\\" community, and not for the patients or those with neurological differences.In the long run I think we are going to find that Osborne is on the side of the angels, and that his approach which emphasizes the similarities between those with AS and those they label \\"neurotypical\\" is better than an approach that stigmatizes people whose behavior is different.Don't misunderstand me, please. I have seen people with autism and other mental disorders and they are very real and in some cases terribly disabling. However, I think whenever possible we ought to tolerate individual differences and not put depreciating labels on them.Finally Osborne asks the telling question, \\"What would it mean to 'cure' a personality disorder?\\" \\"We might ask whether a personality disorder should be cured at all...Do we even really know what a personality is in the first place, and by what impertinence do we affect to lay down its laws?\\" (p. 185) The truth is in most cases we don't understand either the etiology of these so-called disorders or have any idea of what we can or should do about them. In some cases we might ask should we \\"fix\\" the individual or the society?I think Osborne has made some important points here, and that an open-minded reading of his book would reveal the author as a person who has thought long and hard on the subject of AS and one who appreciates individual differences."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"I agree with many of the reviewers who have expressed their thoughts below. Lawrence Osbourne is a brilliant writer and I totally enjoyed reading this book. Like other reviewers, I often wondered if the book was really just an excuse for a rather self indulgent exploration of his own Aspie symptoms, but I was willing to put that aside and enjoy his wonderful, descriptive prose and his engaging profiles of son many unique and gifted individuals.I picked up the book because as the mother of an Aspie (and yes, I have a lot of the traits myself), I have always wondered if autism might represent the next step in the evolution of our minds. As we move into this computerized age, so many of our guides seem to be imbued with noticible Aspie traits - I've even heard that everyone in Silicon Valley for example is somewhere \\"on the spectrum\\".I appreciated Osborne's humourous but respectful portrayal of Asperger's Syndrome and as I finished the book I felt more positive than I have in a while about my son's future and the incredible potential that he has."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"This book seems to reduce Asperger's syndrome to a bunck of quirks oddities and compulsions. As a parent of a child with Asperger's, I worry that this book could create a dangerous misunderstanding of a very serious condition."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"This book is not meant as a thorough investigation of autism, including different treatment methods and exploration of what may or may not cause it. Instead it takes a rather idiosyncratic approach to the disease, exploring mostly people who have Asperger's Disorder, a &quot;less severe&quot; form of the disease. I mean less severe as in being more able to &quot;pass&quot; for normal. People with Asperger's generally have high IQs and excellent verbal skills. Well, some do and some don't.If there's anything this book shows, is that the line between Asperger's and normal is fluid. The author interviews many families whose children have the disease (or are believed to have it). Although at times, he does seem to imply that people with Aspergers are just harmless eccentrics, I don't think he is actually trying to make a case that Asperger's doesn't exist. But with the kind of approach the book takes it is hard to tell.What is enjoyable is the subjects themselves, some of whom seem too impaired for everyday living, and others who that isn't true of at all. It is also interesting to see how the parents cope with their Asperger's child, many of whom here seemed to have learned to take the behavior in stride. Look for clinical information elsewhere."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"I am a professional psychologist and also the mother of a 19-year-old son with Asperger's Syndrome. I found the interviews in this book with individuals diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome interesting, which is why I gave it two stars. However, the book is ultimately infuriating because I can't figure out what the author's ultimate point about Asperger's is. He seems to say: (1) this is a real disorder; (2) it is a neurological disorder; (3) these people are really just harmless eccentrics; (3) the disorder exists partly, and maybe primarily, because of American notions of what is and isn't normal. Interestingly, those he interviews or discusses who fit closest to his view of harmless eccentrics who should be left alone, such as pianist Glenn Gould, are those with either remarkable and marketable talents or independent incomes. Those who would have to cope with life unbuffered by either talent or income fare much less well."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"Excellent book that really puts things in perspective. It makes the reader realize that just because one has certain strange qualities that are \\"out of the norm,\\" does not mean they have a disorder. The pharmaceutical companies capitalize on illnesses and we need a more objective perspective.I do not believe that anyone should make light of real illnesses. Asperger's is an illness. People with Asperger's have trouble in many areas of their lives. But we must also realize that not everyone who has certain traits should jump to the conclusion that they have a disease. We need to be aware that our society may be the cause of many symptoms people seem to be experiencing, such as isolation, loneliness, not fitting in... The cause of some of these feelings may not necessarily lie in any illness, but in the way we are socialized. People today seem to be more isolated. They don't know their neighbors, they are fake at work, they smile when they feel sad because it is not acceptable to show any \\"negative\\" feelings. The focus has become on work, money, achievements, and less on friendships and community. All of this, no doubt, contributes to an increase in people feeling like outsiders in their own lives. So we need to distinguish a real illness from a cultural \\"illness\\" and not jump to quick conclusions. I did enjoy this book and it is well written and shows the other side of these \\"symptoms.\\""},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"One of the syndromes medical students learn about is Medical Student's Disease: one thinks one has the particular malady being taught about. Symptoms are diverse, as all of us have some sort of ache or pain now and then; and certainly all of us have mental symptoms, too, whether these be just ups and downs, occasionally hearing ourselves being called when no one is calling, obsessive interest in an oddity that turns into a hobby, bursts of energy or self-esteem, and so on. Lawrence Osborne has taken on the task of reporting about Asperger Syndrome in _American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome_ (Copernicus Books) and has filled it with his own symptoms tending toward the condition: he is fixated on the television program _Iron Chef_, for instance, and he is fond of lingering in airports, and as a child he was nuts about playing the lute. He is willing to call these &quot;Aspergerish&quot; (and he has met people with the diagnosis that share this sort of trait), but he wisely withholds the diagnosis from himself. He gets along far too well; like so many other diagnoses, Asperger's can't apply if one is unimpaired socially or occupationally, and Osborne shows he can get along socially even with some very peculiar people, and he can write with wonderful clarity and vigor. His book goes a long way to illustrating the condition, even if the illness, and the philosophy behind diagnosing it, remain largely unexplained.The illness is specific, with a definition of check-off symptoms in psychiatry's standard diagnostic manual. It is probably a high-functioning form of autism, but not as crippling. People with Asperger's are often highly intelligent, and although they are frequently preoccupied with one area of restricted interest in which they have sometimes astounding intellectual capacity, they can blend into society with bumbling facility. However, they can't do things that the rest of us take for granted, like looking at a human face and knowing what emotions are being shown. Osborne gets to interview or research patients who have, for instance, memorized all of _Babylon 5_, or every fact about hotels in their state, or about vacuum cleaners. It might be that Thomas Jefferson had the illness, and maybe Albert Einstein and B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k. The main Asperger poster boy is the famous pianist Glenn Gould, who gets a chapter here. Gould certainly had the concentration on a limited sphere of interest; his recordings, especially of Bach, are among the most famous of any classical records. Gould displayed (or perhaps harnessed) the social inability of Asperger patients in an unusual way; retiring from the concert hall, he tirelessly argued for the virtues of electronically recorded performances.This is not a book of firsthand experience with the illness, although Osborne wisely lets us in on enough of his own idiosyncrasies to show how close to normal Asperger people are. And it is not a book by a medical expert or specialist. Osborne is simply a curious person and a gifted writer who had an opportunity to investigate something that took his fancy, an interesting illness, and was able to interview some interesting people who suffer, or who thrive, from it. (One of them told him, &quot;Normalcy is highly overrated, you know.&quot;) _American Normal_ is mostly his personal observations, and it is very entertaining, as well as sympathetic and informative."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"Though this definitely isn't an advice book for parents of children with Aspergers, I loved it anyway. Lawrence Osborne writes beautifully, and the book really shows you what the lives of adult Aspergers sufferers are like. It IS a mostly sad story. Maybe he's a little short on therapeutic sympathy, but he's an incredibly observant and witty writer. I keep thinking about the lives of the kids and especially the adults who appear in the book."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"This is a look at Asperger's from a different angle. If you know someone with the syndrome you'll find it helpful for understanding them. As the parent of a child with Asperger's I found it insightful, enjoyable, even amusing. It was interesting to see how others cope with this, and gave me lots to think about. We've chosen a different route for our child than the intensive therapy and medication regimes that are popular today. This book addressed the issue in a unique way that I found very helpful.There are plenty of books available that give advice on treating Asperger's. Osborne writes about what it's like to actually live with it in a society that isn't always kind to those who are different."},{"Title":"American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome","review":"I really mean NO STARS but that is not an option. As not a parent of a child with Aspergers but a person with professional experience with kids who have it, I was shocked to find this book having so many factual errors. Osborne's barely veiled contempt for these peoples families shocked me, too. Who would think that in this day and age a discredited, dangerous fraud like Bruno Bettelheim would have such an equally misguided \\"heir?\\" There might be lots of diagnoses people with common sense could question (such as: compulsive shopping) . . . . but if you ever knew someone with AS and saw the endless challenges and the pain and the stress and the heartache AS brings, you would never doubt that this is \\"real.\\" Osborne just doesn't \\"get it.\\" ...."},{"Title":"Snowfall (The Snowfall Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this novel. On one hand, it has a pretty neat premise: The impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy with Jupiter in 1994 perturbed that planet's orbit imperceptibly, yet just enough to cause gradual climatic change on Earth, and hundreds of years later we are in the grip of a new Ice Age. Cool idea! Yet I'm troubled by the fact that such climate change would necessarily result in the catastrophic setback of science and culture depicted in this book. If the climate change had been accompanied by, for instance, a few good meteor impacts, the tribal existence of the book's protagonists would have been far more plausible. Too many questions are left unanswered here, and \\"Snowfall\\" is left begging for a sequel.That having been said, I still found this novel quite entertaining. I've always been a sucker for post-apocalyptic sci-fi, although there is precious little sci-fi here. Instead Mitchell Smith has painted a rich picture of a tribal community that calls itself the Trappers, living a tooth-and-nail existence just below the Wall Of Ice that engulfed Canada and the northern half of the United States. Having been forced off their land by tribes that have in turn been forced off THEIR land, the remnants of the Trappers must move south to warmer climes and strange human cultures. There are some memorable, well-drawn characters in this tale, most notably Catania, the tribe's doctor and preserver of ancient medical knowledge. Tribal warfare, sickness and death are portrayed unflinchingly here. The book is divided into short, easily digested chapters, each beginning with an excerpt from Catania's journal. Definitely worth a look if you like books of this genre."},{"Title":"Snowfall (The Snowfall Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Thanks to Amazon.com I found yet another author that I never heard of but writes a novel that sounded very interesting to me. If you like novels in the grand tradition of William Sarabande's FIRST AMERICANS series, or like post-holocaust adventure stories - then this one's for you!Mitchell Smith's SNOWFALL is a well told tale of an Earth that has gone through another ice age and has taken civilization away, leaving cities such as Chicago, with snowdrifts as high as the tallest skyscrapers. It is never told what exactly happened to the earth, but it is told and hinted to a long, long, time ago as the story is taking place.The story opens with a band known as the Trappers, a small collection of families that united and hunt the frozen tundra of what once was Colorado,I think. Their only link to the past is old journals and books that have been re-copied over and over thru time and they call copybooks.The first chapter starts right off with the hunters of the band getting food for their camp when they are attacked by Cree. The Cree are the modern-day equivalent of indians, but most of their bloodline are white, they have just taken to the old indian ways of survival. As the story goes on, the trappers are being forced out of their hunting grounds and being pushed south, along with all the other tribes from the north, like a dominoe effect. Fighting to keep their land, the trapper's, along with an outcast that comes back named Jack, a losing fight ensues and most of the trappers are decimated and Jack finds himself a leader of a band on the run. The band's head doctor of the tribe is a clorful woman named Catania. Catania is much more than a doctor as the reader finds out as the story unfolds. I thought that this book would not have much action and adventure that I'm partial too, but it had it plenty enough along with lots of interesting characters to keep you glued to each page.The adventures and tragedies that befall the running band of trappers as they flee ever southward is an enjoyable read as the reader see's the changes in the land and it's peoples as the trappers go deeper south. The ending is not what I expected, but it was good nonetheless. It read like an epic movie. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Snowfall (The Snowfall Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Set in the future after the next ice age has destroyed most of civilization, this is a story about Dr. Catania Olsen a member of the Trappers tribe, a group by people living in the North at the edge of the glacial wall. Enough time has passed so that most knowledge has been lost. Civilization is still on the fall. It is a brutal time and life is very hard. Catania's tribe is attacked and forced to move.The tribe meets the Garden people, which live in the forest. There Catania meets the rather extreme one-eyed doctor. Catania must tread carefully with the half-mad woman.I enjoyed this story. It is creative and well thought out. We are not presented a world where humanity bravely steps up to and overcomes a challenge, but where it descends back into darkness and merely strives for survival.An interesting story."},{"Title":"Snowfall (The Snowfall Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In 1998, humanity learned a cold hard lesson about the interrelationship of the solar system. Comets and fragments hammered Jupiter causing a minute, seemingly statistically insignificant shift in the giant planet's orbit. Insignificant to Jupiter turns out to be colossal to Earth as that almost undetectable shift over two hundred years later has caused a monstrous new ice age on the earth.This wall of ice is so big that almost all of Chicago is buried under it and so wide the North America continent is divided in two. Clans barter, fight, and compete for supremacy in a harsh land. For instance, the Trappers are hunters with some knowledge of the past eke a living in the frozen Colorado Mountains. When barbaric invaders from the north attack, the Trappers flee led by Jack Monroe and Dr. Catania Olsen to the south. They seek peace and domestic tranquilly, but only find a vast wasteland of savageness. Still they keep searching for a better life.SNOWFALL is a great apocalypse tale that uses a real solar event to cause an incredible catastrophe on earth that leads to a deep tale of future survival. The story line is very exciting, as the action never slows down yet readers care about the Trappers, especially the lead duo, whose struggles seem so real. Fans of future dark global calamities will want to revise their short term reading plan by placing Mitchell Smith's tremendous thriller at the top of the to read immediately food chain.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Snowfall (The Snowfall Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A wonderful concept, discussing the possible world after a new Ice Age, is ruined by poor characters.The only character I DIDN'T find myself hating ends up...well, spoilers and all that so never mind.In any case, the vision is quite intriguing, but I found the execution severely lacking and it made for an un-enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Snowfall (The Snowfall Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When the price for the Kindle Edition is more than 3 times the cost of mass paperback, the publishers need to rethink their strategy.

You can see that in all gritty realism in this book.I got it two years ago and read a bit of it and then quit reading it for a while. It sort of grossed me out to tell the truth. The author made no bones about describing bodily functions and the like. I liked the general premise of the book, though and I only have about a page left to read. I'm not sure I will continue with the series, because I read an awful lot and the competition for my attention is pretty fierce.If you like Sci-Fi, this may not be for you. The action and entire story takes place after the fall of western civilization and there are very few references to any Sci-Fi subject manner. This reads more like a western novel, I imagine."},{"Title":"Snowfall (The Snowfall Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Having just now finished reading the book and having scanned reviews ranging from one star to five stars, I feel like I have to weigh in emphatically on the side of those who love this book. If you take what this book is and don't try to compare it to the hordes of nuclear war/EMP/comet crashing post apocalyptic books, this stands on its own as a unique and highly engaging far future story in a world where cities and cars and modern civilization is a distant memory handed down through hand-copied versions of books from the distant past.Whether the Jupiter reference on the opening quote page is actually the cause of the new ice age that is the backdrop for this book is of no relevance, and reviewers who are looking for hard sci-fi may not like it, but its just not meant to be a fact-based future but a \\"might-be\\" future of hard living in a sparsely populated future where summer is measured in weeks and a mile high glacier stretches right across what was the US lifetimes ago.What Mitchell has done so well is create a whole vernacular and way of life that relates to things we take for granted in almost a religious and mystical way. Phrases and idioms that we use every day are, to them, all learned from the hard earned \\"copy-books\\" that they trade for and value dearly.I won't recount the story (we all hate spoilers), but having read many fantasy books as well as all the standard post apocalyptic literature from On the Beach to Alas, Babylon to Swan's Song to The Stand, this book was refreshing in that it doesn't rehash the same themes of struggle just after the attack or just after the comet hits or just after the virus strikes. This is the far future, survival in a world that, in its own way, is just being born. What is fascinating here is that their way of life only resembles our way of life in a superficial way, and it feels authentic within the world that the author has created. The lives they live are not like our in many ways at all, and the social fabric, social norms and lifestyle of Snowfall's characters will at turns shock you and then ultimately intrigue you.It is true that there is abundant violence and sexual language, however I think it fits within the books world view. This is a true post apocalyptic book that will give you not only a great read but will also make you laugh at the way these future inhabitants try to understand how we lived our lives without any frame of reference.

I really thought it was a kind of pulp post apocalyptic thing, but I usually like that so I got it. It was far deeper and intricate than I anticipated.

You know, when you see three periods strung together... Once in a while, such a device can add tension, etc. etc. But when you use them (and I'm not joking here) every third or fourth sentence, it quite rudely interrupts the flow of the story. But wait!

Don't miss this one, its definately a keeper!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"Everything was going perfect for Lucky Santangelo in spite of turning the big 40. However, her run of good luck abruptly ends when a carjacker kills the wife of her half-brother.

Her goddaughter Brigette Stanislopoulos has been raped and fed heroin by her disgusting spouse. As she adds these two situations for super clean up, Lucky must deal with Alex Woods of the DANGEROUS KISS, who wants back into her life.The Lucky Santangelo tales are all entertaining fun and fluff that turn into a fast reading experience. The fifth entry DANGEROUS KISS is fast-paced, filled with humor, sex, and death. Lucky remains an enjoyable lead character and the returning cast members continue to augment the story line. Jackie Collins provides her fans with a pleasurable tale and anyone who scorns this novel without reading it will miss a fun time."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"I read all the other books! And this book is the best one. Lucky's life just keep getting more and more intriguing. I just couldn't put it down. I got the book on a Friday and Finished it Saturday Morning. There were parts of the book were I was breathing hard. I cried and I cussed. I am telling you if you are into the Lucky series then run don't walk to the nearest store and pick up this book. Damn it was good."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"I would like you all to know that Jackie will be planning to release in the future. She is in the process of writin Lethal Seduction a follow up novel to the L.A. Connections series. After that, she will write Hollywood Wives: the New Breed."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"As always, Jackie Collins has done a great job in writing a fast paced novel. The &quot;Lucky&quot; Books seem to be her best and this is no exception. Great characters all around too. For those who have not read any of her earlier &quot;Lucky&quot; books, fear not. This book has hints of previously introduced characters so you will not feel lost and confused reading about them. You can easily go back to her other &quot;Lucky&quot; books and see what you had missed!A quick synopsis: Lucky Santangelo, now married to Lennie Golden, writer and director, is now herself working in the movie biz. As she deals with this part of her life, another part starts to fall apart when a family member is gunned down in cold blood and it starts to affect her marraige to Lennie.The characters in this book are well developed and I find that I care about each one of them. We root for Lucky as she tries to find the killers and as always there is that happy ending! You wont' be disappointed with DANGEROUS KISS."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"Jackie Collins does it again! I just finished reading this book yesterday.I've read all Jackie's books and the ones about Lucky are always the BEST. Gino (Lucky's Father) is still alive and going strong at 87. I like the way she gives you little hints thruout the book to remind you of past characters that delt with previous Lucky books. I know she bases her characters on real Hollywood people as a few readers of this book have mentioned. Venus as Madonna, Lina as Naomi Campbell? Anything is possible. I guess I never took the time to figure out exactly who it was she was writing about.Too busy digesting every word. Jackie could go so much farther writing about Lucky. Bobby (her son with second husband Dimitri is 15 now) and Gino and Maria, (named after her parents) children with her present husband #3 Lenny. A new generation of Santangelo's to write about. Gino and Maria as teenagers would be wonderful. Does anyone know anything about the next book - Lethal Seduction? Does Jackie have a fan club? My only complaint is having to wait so long for the next Jackie book to come out. If your a Jackie Collins fan, don't wait for the paperback to come out - get this book TODAY!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"A typical Jackie Collins book, excellent, great read, and hard to put down.

In fact, they have all paled next to &quot;Revenge&quot;. I knew this one would kick butt, and it does! I CANNOT put it down, since I started reading it yesterday. It just keeps getting better and better. It's so fun to read about continuing characters like Jack Nicholson and Madon--oops! I mean Charlie Dollar and Venus. (even though I can't stand Madonna, Venus is much more likeable than she is). Now the new characters, such as Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks-oops, I mean Lina and DiDi are entertaining too (though so far nothing's been able to top the last one where the German Victoria's Secret Model turns out to really be a man!)

I've gotta say, the Lucky books have been highly enjoyable. You'll never be bored reading about her and the people in her orbit.Hang in there, things start out a bit slow, establishing character and whatnot, but once the plots pick up motion it's hard to stop reading. All the storylines were compelling; my favourite had to be Brigette and her monster of a husband, now this is a guy it's easy to hate. A wife-beating Eurotrash sleazeball, how charming.The relationship drama between Lucky and Lennie, I saw that coming in the previous book, still I was all \\"oh damn you are in trouble boy, you just lost your wife\\" when the reveal happened. Most times when I see it coming I yawn and say \\"whatever\\". Collins does not do \\"whatever\\" books, this is true.

Too much hype for not a really great story.It was so predictable we all knew were the author was going. I love all her books but I was disapointed in this one."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"This book lacked heart. There were too many things going on throughout the entire story. Collins jumped ahead by months leaving you to wonder and wanting to see how things evolved. Because most of the characters were well defined in earlier books you had a great understanding of their personalities, but the new characters were vague and I missed getting into the old characters. I am a huge Lucky and Gino fan and missed not seeing their usual antics. Lucky fans will enjoy this book (of course) but the heart and that feeling of not being able to put it down will be lost. Hopefully the next book will concentrate on smaller, more intimate story lines about the Santangelo family."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"DANGEROUS KISS will not dissapoint!

That's why I was hoping for this to be the best Lucky novel, and Lucky could end at her best. Unfortunately, this one almost makes Chances look better!This is &quot;A Lucky Santangelo Novel&quot;, yet Lucky only plays a secondary part. Lucky's persona we all knew and loved in her prior adventures is much more passive, which is a major letdown. Another thing that I must say is that most of the characters crossing over from other Lucky novels serve no point in the novel, and you almost want to yell at the book, wondering why they are wasting pages.Lucky has been a lot of fun, but I think it is time to leave her be, and move on to bigger and better things."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"In 1999 Jackie Collins release \\"Dangerous Kiss\\", a blockbuster book that featured her most popular character Lucky Santangelo who appeared in four previous novels by the talented and famous writer.

This book is not as good as the earlier novels, but carries on Lucky's very interesting life well. There are twists that you may not expect, but are inevitable...My only criticism of Ms Collins would be that she should get these books checked for mistakes more thoroughly.. and I do not mean spelling mistakes - I have read the Santangelo novels at least 10 times each and there are many mistakes such as ages, things that have supposed to have happened in earlier books that have not actually happened etc. I still enjoy these books immensely - but I think that Ms Collins' publishers would have picked these little mistakes up..All in all the book is great.. very Jackie Collins and still &quot;unputdownable&quot;!!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"I too had a hard time putting this book down.

For other Jackie fans - you should read a older title of hers called Lovers &amp; Gamblers I just read it last month and was riveted. She is my absolute favorite author and I cannot wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"I was originally planning to buy this book, but the price stopped me. Now, I can see Amazon has cut their prices for this latest work by Jackie C., and I don't blame them! In a word, it was &quot;nyeeeeh ...&quot;Don't get me wrong; Lucky is the woman! But, I believe Jackie was trying a bit too hard with this one. You know, the perpetual cute-as-buttons-but-take-no-prisoners children; the last-minute malcontent, malevolent thugs that buy the farm in the end; the usual European creep-on-an-ego-trip-but-too-insecure-to-speak-his-actual-plans-of-thievery to a wealthy heiress (I'm referring to Count Carlo Viterri Vitti); the consistant, loyal, pining away in the wings housekeeper with the neverending devastating secret to tell her employer as far as her illegitimate kid is concerned; the press; the stars; the glitz; and the models. It's all the same throughout all her recent works.Overall, this was a pale version of Lady Boss, Thrill!, and Revenge: Lucky's Vendetta. Lucky showed she held her own in all situations, and I liked the personal side of her illustrated in this novel this time. But I got the sense that there isn't any more she can write about about Lucky without getting in a stereotypical rut with the Santangelo lady with cojones like galvanized iron.And I was glad that the cursing and sex wasn't as rampant as it was in her previous novels; I appreciated that a lot.I am looking forward to Lethal Seduction. Should Ms. Collins happen to read these Amazon reviews, I hope she takes this suggestion: As creative with words as you are, you can write a novel in ways that don't have to utilize very graphic descriptions of sex or use of the f, gd, a-hole, s or mf words. (Hey! Prudes like me like quality reading, too!)This wasn't her best work, and I'm glad I waited for the book to be available in the library. If I'd bought it, I'd've been a very unhappy camper indeed!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"Not as good as &quot;Revenge&quot;, but very close (and that's saying a lot). The wait for the next Lucky book was worth it! I could NOT put this down.I walked down the street reading it (not very smart) because I had to keep reading! The characters are great, both old and new.Nicholson--uh, Charlie Dollar is up to his old tricks. Lucky is as kick-butt as ever. Collins brings in some very nasty new villians, who I really hated and wanted to see come to horrible ends (especially Carlo, an insane, possesive, abusive evil pr*** who gets Bridgette, Lucky's goddaughter, hooked on heroin to control her) and one of them came to exactly the end I was hoping for (I won't tell you which one). I didn't find Lina all that sympathetic of a character (maybe because I can't stand Naomi Campbell) but she did get more likeable, and she was very entertaining. I probably found Irena, a russian housekeeper with a dark past, the most likeable, and felt the sorriest for her. When you finally find out how her horrible daughter Mila was conceived, it's 100% pure Jackie Collins all the way. The scene is over-the-top, yet still beleivable (and sad).Here's a little tip for gossip-hounds like me who love to read her Hollywood novels and try to figure out who each character is based on. OK, if you read the tabloids it's pretty obvious sometimes, but sometimes it takes you a little longer. Usually what she'll do is have the character in a room or at a party and the celebrity that Collin's character is based on will walk in. Usually another character will say something like, &quot;Oooo, look! (insert celebrity here) just walked in!&quot; and the character who is based on that celebrity will get irritated. She's gotten a little less subtle about it as the years go by--the characters will have rhyming names with the celebrity they are based on, or very similar ones. Either way, it's a blast.This is one book thast's worth not waiting for the paperback. Pick it up if you're a fan--you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Dangerous Kiss: A Lucky Santangelo Novel","review":"Jackie Collins has done it again. This book kept me on the edge the whole time.

This book, however, does a little bit to discourage that notion.For one thing, I like the Detectives better than the Chipmunks. Nokuru, Suoh, and Akira are not half as annoying as their furry counterparts, and they don't sing. Actually, the list could go on.Anyway, the art in this (like in all CLAMP works) is top-notch, cream-of-the-crop, absolutely perfect. The story is cute (unbelievable at some parts, kinda goofy at others), and the characters are likable (most of them).Here's a quick rundown of the plot of this first book. Akira Ijuyin works as the youngest member of the Student Council and Detectives at Clamp School. By night he is the master thief 20 faces, who steals strange things at the whim of a pair of crimelords--his beautiful young mothers! Yes, he has two mothers. Don't ask me, I'm still trying to figure that one out. Anyway, while hiding from the cops, he meets a pretty kindergartener named Utako. He carries on a secret friendship with her by sneaking into her room to visit her every week.The second book will explore the depths of the relationship as they grow older.This book is not to be missed, Clamp fan or not!"},{"Title":"Man of Many Faces, Book 1","review":"Akira seems like your normal 4th grader. He goes to school, participates on the student council and cooks breakfast for his moms every morning. But he really is the mysterious 20 Faces, a \\"gentleman thief\\" who steals whatever his parents ask him to. One night while hiding from the police he meets a young girl who instantly falls in love with him. But can a thief really find true love?CLAMP has a wonderful knack for coming up with unique stories, and this is no exception. The characters are very memorable and the art is beautiful. However, it lacks some of the reality and depth of their better works, making this seem weak compared to their other books. A good read, but if you are looking for something exciting I would try Cardcaptor Sakura."},{"Title":"Man of Many Faces, Book 1","review":"This series is only two volumes long, and as would be imagined with a series that short, it's not exactly filled with a lot of deep story lines.

It's a fun and quick read for a rainy day and a reminder for all of us who are now all grown-up about the ups and downs of first loves and growing up...plus some random thefts and outrageous balls thrown in just for the fun of it. Just a sweet little light-hearted romp."},{"Title":"Man of Many Faces, Book 1","review":"Some of the stuff Clamp does is just wonderful, and some of it not so much. This falls into the latter category.Females are always portrayed in this book as needing a male - the mothers have their son do all the work AND have him steel for him. The kindergarten aged girl in the book is obsessed with having a boyfriend and settles on a thief (who's a forth grader). The females are clingy, whiny, and useless.The males aren't any better. They do whatever they are told, coddle the females, and all but one don't seem to have any moral backbone. The one teenager who says that steeling is wrong is portrayed as a food obsessed bizarre person.The artwork seems very juvenile to me. It's not even close to the beauty in XXXholic. It's the kind of artwork I'd expect from a late seventies animae (think Voltron).All in all I'd skip these books and go for something with more plot and more depth like Angelic Layer."},{"Title":"Practical Intranet Security: Overiew of the State of the Art and Available Technologies","review":"Practical Intranet Security is a clear and concise book that covers the range of today's authentication and authorization technologies.

The focus is on the human relationships within the family, magnificently and movingly described; but the novel's edge comes from the constant intrusion of grim outside reality, the tormented history of Poland between the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the second-world-war Nazi storming of the Warsaw Ghetto. Counterpoint between inner and outer reality, between public and private life, between flesh and spirit, makes this book not just another family saga but a statement about Jewish (and non-Jewish) humanity at large. In that, &quot;The Family Muskat&quot; is characteristic of Singer's work - it is his universality, not his particularity, which makes him one of the most respected writers in modern times."},{"Title":"The Family Moskat","review":"A powerful tale of a Jewish family over several genrations ending with the German army at the gates of warsaw and the destruction of the vibrant Jewish communities in Warsaw close at hand.An in depths description of the life of the Jews in Poland over the last century writen in a highly realistic unsentimental style but with a certain affection on the part of the author. Better than any history textbook."},{"Title":"The Family Moskat","review":"Back in the 70s I read whatever was available by Singer. This was one of the first, and my favorite. I love long, involved stories with lots of characters. I don't remember much about any of his stories because it's been over 20 years since I read them, but I remember my impressions. I prefer all his stories that take place in Poland over those that are set in US. The textures are different. I found the North American based tales to be somewhat interesting, but the characters were less appealing. I think his feel for the European context was stronger in him, and was conveyed with more warmth than the American contexts."},{"Title":"The Family Moskat","review":"As strange as it sounds, there is a parallel between The Family Moskat and Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude. Both start from a semi-mythic past where the family patriarch is larger than life, and then slowly spiral towards an ending in time where historical and psychological decay in the family and in society devolve into a nasty and brutish finale to the family line.And in both, the overarching movement of history serves to eventually crush the life out of the family, despite secular individual eruptions of creativity, wealth, or love. For Marquez, history is driven by the crushing oppression of poverty and the unjust Latin American social structure. For Singer, history is driven by the crushing oppression of European anti-Semitism.Believe me, Singer is not the writer that Marquez is--the narrative arc bogs down in parts, and he does not use magical realism to inflate his characters, as Marquez does. Singer's people remain much flatter and closer to life. They are common people, ones we can imagine meeting on the street, perhaps getting pinned in a corner at a party by one, or maybe brushing by them in a store.But in some ways this makes The Family Moskat even more harrowing. For we know from the beginning that Polish Jewry in the early 1900's was doomed to be destroyed in the Holocaust--we already know the end with a dread certainty. Yet in this book we watch each character struggle for individual freedom, we cheer for them to succeed and rue their human failures, despite the fact that it all has to end in a pogrom or a gas chamber.Singer shows us the full range of means Jews used to try to deny the chains of anti-Semitism that constrained their lives. There are Chasidim who fervently believe that the Messiah is coming any minute, and other Chasids who dervishly dance the Messiah home. Mystics lose themselves in the Kabbalah, if religious, or in seances, if agnostic. There are those who try to deny reality by living in the fleshly moment of sex and food, and those who live to accumulate wealth. Some run to America, and others to Palestine, and there are even those who convert to Christianity.Communists, socialists, capitalists, the devout, converts, agnostics, atheists, scholars, debauchers--all have one thing in common; they are Jewish, and so are hated by all non-Jews around them. No matter how they try, they are defined by their birth and circumscribed and twisted by its mark. And eventually, they all will die in a chamber where the gas does not make discriminations between an agnostic Jew, a converted Jew, and a Chasid.For American Jews, it is easy to forget that anti-Semitism has been a form of oppression as deep and destructive as that of the poor in Latin America. I am certain that Singer did not mean for this when he wrote The Family Moskat in the near aftermath of the Holocaust--it seems more a reverie for a lost world--yet this book is a potent reminder to never forget the dynamic of oppression and hatred that made the Holocaust not only possible, but desired by so many Europeans. It is a reminder that only a generation ago Jews shared the same oppression that others now face, so that perhaps for once someone can help the oppression end short of genocide."},{"Title":"The Family Moskat","review":"By any standard, the word sweeping well suits Singer's novel \\"The Family Moskat.\\" The novel spreads over almost a century of transformative history, ending at the outbreak of World War II, which will see before its end the entire civilization represented transformed into nothing but ash. Yet in the fashion of Tolstoy, Singer does not allow the great events he illustrates - WWI, the birth of modern Poland, the destruction of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, the 1917 Revolution, the rise of Zionism - to consume the story he tells, instead using it as a canvas on which he brings his characters to life.His diverse cast is also linked through their ties of either blood or marriage to Mashulam Moskat, the patriarch of the family of the novel's title. A wealthy Jew with many children, Singer uses his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to move over every crevice of Jewish life in Poland, from those who emigrated to America or Palestine, to the Hasidim of the small towns, to the urban intellectuals and merchants. In every case he paints a portrait at once sensitive yet real. Indeed, much of the criticism of this work has come from those who found Singer's portrayal, with its often flawed characters, as \\"too real.\\" Yet Singer was a man seeking to offer later generations a window into a world that vanished in his lifetime in a flash of gas and violence; who can blame him for wishing to make it as true to life as he was able?I must also mention that this FSG edition is truly beautiful, complete with a useful family tree that can help the reader navigate the maze of relationships in the Byzantine Moskat clan."},{"Title":"The Family Moskat","review":"I moved to this book just after finishing a fast-paced historical novel (\\"Pompeii\\" by Robert Harris), and had to change gears before I could begin to really enjoy this. It isn't the type of novel where a lot \\"happens\\"--but it is a beautifully nuanced portrayal of life in a particular community--eastern European Jewish, early 20th century--and even more, of universally human life. The characters interact in believable ways, the descriptions are deep without being stultifying, and I was left deeply satisfied."},{"Title":"The Family Moskat","review":"Diverse boeken van IB Singer heb ik jaren geleden gelezen, op &eacute;&eacute;n of andere wijze is me toen De familie Moskat ontschoten. Singer schreef dit joodse familie epos direct na de Tweede Wereldoorlog om de weggevaagde joodse gemeenschap in Polen te schetsen. Alle schakeringen, van de godsdienst, politiek, grote gezinnen, ontwikkelingen in werk, kleding, woonplaats en opvattingen, maar vooral de pendule tussen assimiliatie en vasthouden aan de eigen traditie. Wat maakt iemand jood(s)? Wat laat je als pater familias Mesjulam Moskat achter als je sterft? Wat breng je in als buitenstaander (Asa Hesjel)? Wat brengen Spinoza en Herzl aan de 'moderne jood'? Wat is het nut van een filosofie die netjes Het laboratorium van geluk heet, maar volgens de feitelijke hoofdpersoon in het boek, Asa Hesjel, neerkomt op 'meer bed, minder kinderen'? Wat is liefde als je polygaam, zelfs nymfomaan bent, en hoe rijm je dat met je godsdienst? Het boek beschrijft de decennia v&oacute;&oacute;r de Tweede Wereldoorlog en Hitlers bombardementen van Warschau, de komst van concentratiekampen en de naderende vernietiging van het joodse ras. Het laat ongeveinsd de antisemitische wortels in de Poolse samenleving, maar ook de ambivalente levenswijze van de joden in dit land zien. En waar bijvoorbeeld de sluwe Koppel dacht in Amerika veilig te zijn, komt hij uiteindelijk toch in Polen te overlijden, evenmin als Hadassa (Griekse naam: Esther) ondanks haar meelijwekkend verhaal ontkomt aan het noodlot. De tientallen kinderen, verhalen en intriges komen in een seidermaaltijd vlak voor het begin van de oorlog weer bij elkaar, maar de verlossing is anders dan verwacht. Beklememnd eindigt het boek met de constatering 'De dood is de Messias. Dat is de eigenlijke waarheid.\\" Niet voor niets heeft Singer de Nobelprijs voor de literatuur!"},{"Title":"The Family Moskat","review":"A great book. Starts like a traditional 19th Century novel, and you think it will be about a doomed loveaffair, or a young man's progress, or whatever.

Very informative and interesting, tho."},{"Title":"The Family Moskat","review":"The story takes place in the first half of the 20th century, a bad time to be a Polish Jew. We know that the Nazis are right around the corner. This is not a story of Nazis, though. It's about the very active but painfully confused lives of Jews caught in between traditionalism and the modern world. Warsaw is as lively as New York's Lower East Side when it was throbbing with the vitality of Jewish immigrants. The main character of this book, Asa, is a young man whose grandfather was a revered rabbi, but who doesn't really believe in anything himself. His personal life is shattered, not only by traditionalism, but by his own modern faults. It's a good book but it's something of a train wreck, which is why I don't give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Expectant & First Year Father (New Father Series)","review":"My husband is not the reading type, but when he specifically requested something to help prepare him for our first child & answer all his questions, I got him this set.

So while all of his animal friends nestled into their beds, he played in the snow. But it was a lonely business, entertaining himself; and besides, he was hungry and cold. After his sleepy friends rebuffed him, Groundhog decided to declare an early Spring so that everyone would wake up and eat. The animals were initially happy about the announcement -- until snow began to fall and the calendar revealed the date to be January 2nd, not February 2nd. His friends wanted to punish Groundhog, but he had finally returned to his burrow and was fast asleep. When he woke up a month later, he saw a strange shadow and thought there would still be six more weeks of Winter. Little did he know that his friends had tricked him by painting the shadow on the ground. They enjoyed the early Spring days while Groundhog went back to sleep.This mildly amusing story is accompanied by realistic and playful illustrations. Seasonal banners that extend across some double-pages add to young reader interest and keep the storyline moving. See Judy Cox's \\"Go to Sleep, Groundhog,\\" for a similar but different treatment."},{"Title":"Groundhog Stays Up Late","review":"Groundhog adores running around and playing with his friends. So when winter comes, he decides that he won't be hibernating this year. His friends warn him that he'll only end up feeling cold and hungry, but Groundhog refuses to listen. Unfortunately, Groundhog soon finds that refusing to hibernate has only left him feeling lonely, as all of his friends have decided to take part in \\"the long nap.\\" So Groundhog comes up with a wonderful idea, that will trick his friends, and give him something to do...he decides to announce that Spring has come early! But when his friends discover the truth, they decide to play a little trick on Groundhog. One that he'll never forget.It is so rare to find children's books about Groundhog Day, so I was ecstatic when I stumbled upon Margery Cuyler's GROUNDHOG STAYS UP LATE. Groundhog is an adorable character who never learns his lesson, while his friends are little tricksters themselves, who love to take part in a good joke every now and then. The delightful story, accompanied by Jean Cassels gorgeous illustrations, will leave young readers enthralled with the story for hours, and parents may find it a challenge to pry it out of their little hands.

Maybe that wasn't too good an idea. What do you think happens? You'll giggle when you find out.This is a really cute tale showing that if you play a trick on someone you can expect to get it back many times over. and also gives children the story of Groundhog Day. The illustrations are bright and cheery and flow nicely with the story.This is sure to entertain your child."},{"Title":"Flowers of the Field","review":"If you love stories set in a historical background with fictional characters - you'll love this. It's the story of three very different women from different backgrounds during the First World War. The writing is so eloquent and descriptive that I was living the book as I read it. I could sense the horror of the trenches, smell the awful trench smells, feel sadness, happiness, desolation, all sorts of emotions that the characters were expressing. The flow of narration kept me hooked until the very last page. Sarah Harrison has created unforgettable characters, so much so that at the end of the book I wanted to know what happened to them next. Fortunately, Sarah wrote a sequel &quot;A Flower That's Free&quot; (just as good). I first read &quot;The Flowers of the Field&quot; after graduating High school in 1980 and have read it numerous times over the years. The story still makes me cry in the same places and gasp at the graphic depictions of what WW1 was like for those fighting it.

Daniel Shea's book is excellent. It is well written, comprehensive, and has a depth of field I've found in no other book. While it may not give you the step-by-step approach to campaigning, it does provide the necessary foundation for understanding the process and getting to a win. What a resource.Shea's accounts of statewide campaigns are extraordinarily helpful in illustrating specific aspects of a campaign and his understanding and explanation of electoral targeting is excellent. Electoral targeting and precinct analysis may be one of the most important things a candidate can do to win an election and yet is the most difficult for some to understand. However, Daniel Shea is able to explain it in simple, understandable ways so the reader can apply it.Whether you're interested in running for office or simply want a better understanding of how the process works, I would recommend this book. Easily five stars. I only wish I'd written it."},{"Title":"Campaign Craft: The Strategies, Tactics, and Art of Political Campaign Management (Praeger Series in Political Communication)","review":"As someone who has spent their entire professional life in politics, this book did not break any new ground. However, as someone who now teaches democracy in the former Soviet Union, I do like to read these types of books to order my normally scattered thoughts and be able to communicate ideas more effectively.Shea's update of his orginal 1996 text is a very competent overview of most aspects of modern campaigning and is highly recommended for anyone working in the business or anyone who just wants to know how modern campaigns function. The book is highly modular, you can read various sections independently of each other. Shea pays close attention to research - a topic often given short shrift in many campaigns but deadly necessary in developing strategy. He covers well opposition research, precinct targeting by electoral history and polling (including the differences between different types of polls and why the ballot test is not necessarily the most useful. Something I can't get the Azeris to understand!!!)Shea and Burton also explain the various aspects of paid and earned media strategy, including the use of \\"new\\" media. (I'm not sold on the use of the Net to move message, but it does have excellent fieldwork potential.) Their sections on fundraising and fieldwork are a bit skimpy, but certainly enlightening to people unfamiliar with the campaign operation.All in all, Campaign Craft is a solid workhorse of a book, dutifully explaining in good detail the various aspects of a modern political operation. It's well recommended to anyone looking for an overview of the biz."},{"Title":"Campaign Craft: The Strategies, Tactics, and Art of Political Campaign Management (Praeger Series in Political Communication)","review":"Shea has written a solid book on campaign management. This is a big book that contains a lot of information on major subject areas. Fundraising, organization, free and paid media, candidates are all covered.Shea gives many of his subject areas a historical perspective. For novices, they will learn that many of the practices decried by today's reformers were practiced by our founders and their successors (Washington purchased hard cider for voters to aid in his election to the House of Burgesses; Van Buren accelerated the use of hard hitting media)Those interested in applying the arts of campaign management will find the book well organized and thoroughly descriptive of the various aspects of the modern camapaign. It does tend to focus on larger campaigns, so those running for local office will have to understand that topics like television advertising and massive fundraising are not applicable to their races. Still, the book presents a good and thorough description of today's campaign practices.I'm teaching a course in elective politics at the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Center of Government. This is one of the required reading books for the course and is also used by some other teachers in the field at colleges and universities around the country."},{"Title":"Campaign Craft: The Strategies, Tactics, and Art of Political Campaign Management (Praeger Series in Political Communication)","review":"Shea definatly puts the science into political science. I found the book went further than most in analyzing most aspects of campaigning. I've read all the books from Robert Thomas, Gary Bosley, Catherine Shaw, Ireland and Nash, and now Shea.I think Shea has the better book, but all should be read and read again, for I have found useful information in all of them. Three days before 9/11 I entered the race for my City Council. Totally unprepared and overwhelmed I bowed out before the election. I'll be trying again for a seat on my city council in the next off year election cycle and I found the chapters on prior electoral targeting very helpful. Both the book and my volunteer work in other races have taught me a valuable lesson.Most important, have the support of your family, then begin early (in my case two years), do your homework, and cultivate relationships with movers and shakers. No book can ever replace the real world experience of working for a candidate or party, but Shea, more than others has provided me the rough framework for a realistic and successful attempt at public office."},{"Title":"Campaign Craft: The Strategies, Tactics, and Art of Political Campaign Management (Praeger Series in Political Communication)","review":"This book is one of the first books I reccomend whenever anyone asks me for a primer on political campaign strategy.

Note: It was written in the 1800s !!"},{"Title":"In Tune With the Infinite","review":"Written more than a century ago, this classic work inspired a generation, selling more than two million copies worldwide and is still in print today. I first read 'In Tune with the Infinite' over thirty years ago and have never ceased recommending it to all those who are genuinely seeking answers to Life's problems.Ralph Waldo Trine presents the eternal Spiritual and material truths of Life in a clear and simple manner which all can understand. It requires no great intellect or education to apply the very simple laws which he so beautifully reveals in this inspired book. In the degree that we do so we will change sadness into joy, failure into success and weakness into power.Although some may claim that Trine was a pioneer of 'New Thought' and 'New Age' teaching, there is nothing in this book that was not known and taught thousands of years ago. We hear the same truths from the immortal lips of inspired teachers like Jesus, Buddha and Krishna. What Trine has done is to make these truths accessible to all in simple words that even a child can understand. This is no accident; for the truth is always simple if we are simple enough to recognise it when it is presented to us. Sadly, many desire 'mystery, glamour and complexity. Such 'clever dicks' will turn away from the simplicity of this book in disgust.But the simple in mind and heart will immediately recognise that this book bears the unmistakeable stamp of truth. It will remind them in no uncertain manner that the keys to health, happiness and success are to be found within us.As Trine says in his Prelude:\\"THE optimist is right. The pessimist is right. The one differs from the other as the light from the dark. Yet both are right. Each is right from their own particular point of view, and this point of view is the determining factor in the life of each. It determines as to whether it is a life of power or of impotence, of peace or of pain, of success or of failure.\\"How true this is! Do we not all know people whose 'glass is always half-empty' - who fear the worst and anticipate disaster and disappointment at every turn? And it is not true that such so often live lives of sorrow, confusion, ill-health and failure?In Tune with the Infinite has never been more relevant or needed. We live in perplexing times when fear and hatred stalk the earth, wars without end rage across the globe and economic catastrophy stares us in the face. Is it any wonder that confusion, uncertainty and fear grip the hearts and sear the minds of so many in every land?But it needn't be like this. In us lies the power to change our own individual lives for the better. And in the degree that we do this we shall change the lives of others around us and the world in general. This is the SIMPLE way to bring peace and light into this sorely-troubled world. It needs no great intelligence or great effort to do so. All it requires is an understanding of the REAL LAWS which govern life and a WILLINGNESS to put them into practise in our own daily lives. This is the SIMPLE message which Ralph Waldo Trine gave the world over 100 years ago.If that message finds an echo in your heart you may be sure that this book will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"In Tune With the Infinite","review":"We create our own Reality, and with the clearness of the New Thought Movement, Ralph Waldo Trine tells how in a very straight forward and clear manner.

If your aspirations are very limited then there are other books that can get you there quicker, but if your aspirations are greater and are willing to improve over years this is where you should start IMO.I started with the Mel Bay Modern Guitar Method Series but switched over to this series when I had almost finished Book 1 - glad I did even though I lost a little time catching up with the techniques only covered in the Mastering The Guitar, such as fingerstyle, hammer ons and slides.Get the spiral bound addition which lays open nicely on a music stand and is easy to leaf through.

But I've reviewed this based on what it can do for your music rading. I'm a guitar teacher and I found I could never get anyone started or enthused by using this book - too much standard notation, and no current chart songs. But what it does do it does well - teaches students to read standard notation - at which most guitarists are terrible. As the teacher I have to write other contemporary material to help students through all these traditional tunes and cheesy melodies - but that's a copyright problem for the publisher that will never be resolved. That's a role a good teacher can fill. If you're learning on your own you'll have to take what's in the book and start writing your own new melodies from the tunes you really like - but that's not a bad thing - it will reinforce what your leaning in this beek.Bottom line - if you want to learn standard notation, here's the first of a series of 5 books to develop your reading.

Declan was torn away physically when he was taken away from Ireland. His wrists were torn from the cruelties of the metallic handcuffs, just as his mind was torn from the separation, the loss, and the sudden gain of a new family. They say that if a starving man eats a meal after not eating in days, he will die. I believe that almost the same thing happened to Declan when he came to Otter Harbor. He was overcome with the love they granted him. But he was not going to except their \\" Snotty English Charity\\" and perhaps because of this he would die of loneliness. After moving to Otter Harbor, Declan slowly but surely began to meliorate. Yet buried deep inside of himself he was torn. In a way no one could explain. He was lost inside of himself trying to find his family and friends, the way things were before their deaths. Alas, they were torn so far apart. There would be no chance of finding them. Heaven and earth are too very different places. To move on would be hard, to stay in place would be to difficult. To go behind, into the past, impossible.

The book was easy to read, among other things because of the annotations an the easy English language that the author used.But the book is written with typical clich&eacute;s, a bit like a feri-tale or a Hollywood film. The plot and especially the end was very simple to guess. While reading the book, I knew that Declan will stay in Canada. But If had written the book, I would not haven done it that way, because it's absolutely not Declan's character. His most important aim is to take revenge for the death of his family. And the fact that his father was killed by his own people changes his opinion about him and the Protestants, but I can't imagine that Declan changes completely after he knows that. His stay in Canada is not convincible for me. So the plot was too superficial and especially in the last chapters, you get the impression that Heneghan wants to finish the book; lots of events, but with no explanations.Further more this kind of story does not please me. A point is missing, perhaps a love story or something like that. The whole book is about nature, a nice family and a boy who is so bitter, but in spite of, he finds a wonderful family.

It is written very emotional and sometimes even deeply moving. For example chapter sixteen; there is described the last time Declan sees his mother and sister alive. This is so sad and honestly goes to heart.In contrast to this lovely written chapter, the reader also gets to know cruelty.The religious war in Northern Ireland is approached to the reader. So you get to know another view over the fights than from the news. But besides all these awful things happening, nevertheless it is understandable why Declan wants to return. He hates his new family, has no friends and is treated worse at school. In addition to that he misses his family and wants to fight the \\"dirty Prots\\" (Protestants).But there is a process noticeable. Declan changes during his time in Canada, but in spite of that till the end of the novel he has to think of going back to Northern Ireland.But I myself can't understand the end! For me it is too trashy. There is no introduction to this end, it comes really suddenly and abruptly. It seems, that James Heneghan absolutely wanted to have a happy end.I read this book because it was one theme in my English-profile course at 11th grade.

His mother and sister died in a bomb attack which was organised by the Brits. Left alone and filled with wrath and anger, Declan joins the terror group \\"Holy Terrors\\". There youngsters learn to build bombs and plan attacks against the British army. However, he shell be brought to his uncle who lives in Canada. Declan tries to refuse because he thinks his uncle Matthew is a coward and a traitor of the country because of immigrating to British Columbia. After a lot of attempts to escape, police manages to take him into his uncle's custody.Although, his aunt, uncle and the both adopted kids Ana and Thomas are very friendly and caring, Declan still has the wish to return. First a bargain makes him remain: If he stays until after Christmas and joins school, Matthew won't stop Declan leaving and pays his journey home.But whilst time passes, Declan starts to accept Ana and Thomas as a real brother and sister. He is departed between the family feelings and the so-called \\"fixer's world\\", as he calls his new home.The book \\"Torn Away\\" has its focus on the Northern Irish conflicts between Protestants and Catholics. The main reasons of fighting with each other are shown very clearly in this book. It recovers the means which the IRA uses to damage or kill their enemies, the Brits. I like the representation of the strong will-power which is in the Catholic and Protestant mind in order to get through their aim for their country. However, the realisation of the difficult topic about the young terrorist Declan isn't so convincing. At the beginning of the story, the rough reality is shown clearly. But the more Declan is \\"caught\\" by the family's generosity and kindness, the more the ending is absolutely clear. To put it in a nutshell: The character of the almost innocent family is too unrealistic and invisible to regard the story as a realistic happening within a Catholic boy's life.So, thank you James Heneghan, but the moral of \\"Torn Away\\" is clear: Violence is never a solution!"},{"Title":"Torn Away","review":"This book is about a thirteen-year-old boy, called Declan, who is torn away from Northern Ireland to Canada, to his uncle.

The poor boy with no family has to go to Canada. Then there is his new family who loves him so much but he doesn't like them. But fortunately after a while he does so.

He is forced to go to Canada although he doesn't want. In British Columbia he learns to enjoy his life which is full of nature experiences and without crime and civil wars like in Belfast.I liked the book very much because it combines an interesting story with a politcal background. It shows two different worlds on earth, the world in British Columbia which is full of peacefulness, silence and great nature and the world in Belfast where bomb attacks, explosions and wars rule.In the book you can follow Declan how he is developping from a child to a teenager and even to an adult although he is only 13 years old.

Declan is forced by his uncle Matthew to move to Canada with him after Declan's whole family got killed in Northern Ireland.James Heneghan's book is about growing up and changing. Changing ones mind and changing ones attitude. While the book goes on Declan changes his attitude about Canada and his family living there. He also changes his mind about Northern Ireland. He changes his mind towards all the fighting and killing going on over there.The author let's his main character Declan discovers Canada's beautiful countryside, which the author impressively describes. He names the countryside as one reason for Declan's change. But I think that Declan changes too much. Although he gets a second chance in his life which he uses it well. Declan was eager to go home to Northern Ireland from the very first step he took to Canada. He wanted to go home from the very first moment he met his new family. He also tried to escape once, although it failed. And when he finally gets a real and serious chance to go home to Northern Ireland he does not take it. He does not use his chance; his uncle Matthew is willing to pay Declan's way home, that was part of a deal the two of them had. So Declan wants to go home, but when he sits on the airplane, with a ticket in his hands ready to go home, he decides that he wants to stay in Canada. He runs off the airplane to his family in Canada.That is the only thing I do not like about the whole book, the ending. I admit that this was a very good decision for a 13-year-old, but still it is too much of a clichee. This little boy from Northern Ireland changes his mind about everything in his entire life within only a few months about 180 degrees.Besides the ending I liked the book. It is easy to understand and it is a well-written closer look at the lives of children in Northern Ireland, at least partly.

Declan is torn between two worlds:on the one hand violence,death,revenge and cruelty in Northern Ireland and on the other hand the peaceful Canadian countryside symbolizing the love of his family.The development that he has to go through impressed me very much: at the beginning he felt so contemptuous, full of hate and revenge and after a while he began to identify with his relatives and their way of living.

The idea of being &quot;healed&quot; by some elements of nature in the Pacific Northwest is pleasing and very believable, esp. for someone who knows this part of the world.

I never read one of his books either until one day I was forced to do so by my Profil-cours teacher. The story is about a young boy only 13 years old. He has to leave his homecountry Northern Ireland and has to live with his relatives in Canada. But first of all the police need to catch him which is hard to do because Declan (that's the boys name) is smart . Never the less they catch him and bring him to his uncle Matthew . Full of ideologies of the \\"Holy Terrors\\" the terrorist group he joined he has just one wish: to go back.You will learn about the struggle the juventile has with himself and how his emotional world will be turned upside down. The book is written in a very emotional way so a useful advise is to have a pack of tissue lying beside you while reading. I would have like it if the author had written more about the relaionship between Ana and Declan. Actually I don't believe they 're just good \\"friends\\". Both are in their adolescence and both are teenagers with a surplus of hormones. An other thing I didn'tlike so much was the fact the book ends. It should be continued .But still it has it good sides . It is very impressive how Heneghan describes the landscape of Canada .

Because of this the stubborn youngster wants to take revenge to the murderers, who according to his opinion are the Protestants. Declan's aim isinterrupted by a flight to Canada where his relatives live. The young boy is forced to leave his native land and to go unwillingly to Canada but his stay there makes him experience another side of life. Declan is not faced with the cruelty of Belfast anymore. The peaceful life in Canada and its beautiful countryside are absolutely new to him. Nevertheless Declan has serious problems in joining his \\"new\\" family and he refuses to stay in Canada with all means. Even his attempt to escape by boat fails. Desperately he agrees to a deal, to stay in Otter Harbour (Canada) until Christmas and to go to school. But soon he makes new friends and gets used to the life there.Now Declan is really torn between staying in Canada and going back to Belfast.This book was my first English one and I must admit that I liked it much. The realistic description of the boy's mood and his trades of character are very well done. Personally I was really able to participate in his feelings and to follow his thoughts. But his stubborn and one-sided point of view on things was sometimes a bitannoying for me. Overall it's worth reading this book. From the beginning up to the end it is full of tension, especially the beginning, the flight of Declan, is very impressive.

You are also confronted with a topic that doesn't often appear in the latest news : the lengthy Troubles between Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland.The plot's course is rather unexpected since the boy's mind and his attitude towards other people change step by step. That's what I really liked about the book.Although some happenings and developments aren't really realistic , reading wasn't boring or difficult.And because of the constant development there is a lot of tension , I wasn't able to guess the ending until the last page.

The Survey Service allowed their space personnel leave to marry and to produce children. After several years, the marriage was break-bonded and the couple went their own ways. Any children from the marriage were raised in a Service creche.In this novel, Diskan Fentress was raised in the Service creche on Nyborg. Unlike his fellows, Diskan was oversized and clumsy. Under direct or hostile supervision, he was even more clumsy. His superiors deemed him suitable only for the most degrading forms of manual labor.Then Renfry Fentress returns from presumed death to find his son. His ship had been holed by a meteor and left drifting. Another scout from an unknown spacefaring species had rescued Renfry and took him back to Vaanchard. There he had married a Vaan woman and became stepfather of her two children, Rika and Drustans.Since they could not have children of their own, Renfry searched for his children from previous service marriages and found Diskan. Before his long absence, Renfry had earned an impressive reputation as a First-In Scout. Obviously Diskan was not going to follow in his father's footsteps, so Renfry took him to a new home on Vaanchard.The Vaans are a refined and sensitive culture. They do not issue rude remarks as had some of his crechemates. But they do consider him crude and inept. Diskan just doesn't fit in here anymore than he did at the creche.One day Diskan finds himself in his father's study and decides to flee the planet. He takes a trip tape from a rack and heads for the spaceport. There he steals a smaller ship, inserts the tape, and goes into stasis for the remainder of the trip. However, the ship awakens him for an emergency landing.During the landing on Mimir, a drive tube blows and the ship rolls across the terrain, finally coming to rest in a muddy bog. While the ship sinks into the mud, Diskan is ejected and reaches safety. Yet all emergency equipment and supplies go down with the ship.In this story, Diskan barely survives the first night. Still, the natives detect his presence and converge on his position. One makes initial contact, leaving the carcass of a small, big-eared animal with him for food. Then the native saves him from a menacing predator.Later, Diskan has strange dreams of walking through sweet scented water while accompanied by frolicking animals. He is surrounded by shadows that seem friendly. He senses a feeling of great expectation around him.Diskan finds signs of other offworlders on the planet, including a survival shelter with labels in several languages other than Basic. Later, he discovers a Zacathan and human from a stranded archaeological expedition. Then a Jack ship lands to search for treasure. Some of the crew start looking for the archaeologists.This story deals with the mindset of outsiders. Diskan differs from his fellows in body and mind. He doesn't seem to fit in any of the conventional roles. On Mimir, however, he finds acceptance and even some delight in his mental skills.This tale is similar in several respects toDread Companion. In both stories, the protagonists are raised in a service creche and are unsuited to their expected vocations. However, Diskan is even less suitable than Kilda in his initial environment. This outsider theme runs through many of the author's works.Highly recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of alien civilizations, telepathic animals, and a persevering youngster.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The X factor","review":"At this point in Norton's Council / Confederation universe, the job of discovering and exploring new planets - that of the First-In Scouts - is pretty much a closed occupation. Scouts make contract marriages with suitable women, which end after the birth of a child or upon the Scout's departure for his next assignment, and any children of the union - nearly always sons - go to the nearest Scout creche to become the next generation.But what happens when the child of such a union isn't suited to the life of a Scout?Diskan Fentress was rejected as mentally unsuitable for Scout training; his size and great strength mark him as a throwback. Since his mother's death in childbirth and his father's disappearance in space left him in state custody, he wound up assigned to manual labor - until the day Renfry Fentress reappeared. Renfry had found a new civilization, and even a wife among his adopted people - but knowing that they could not have children, he sought out his son.But Diskan, despite - or because of - the endless patience, charm, and tact of his father's adopted people, is utterly alone among strangers, marked by clumsiness, his great size and strength, and inability to express himself. Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider will appreciate how his isolation is drawn here - and will understand why he gives in to temptation.Fleeing from an embarrassing scene of (accidentally) shattered artwork, Diskan hides in Renfry's study - and steals a voyage tape for Mimir, a world marked as only partially explored and having some mystery about it. His journey in a stolen spaceship brings him into contact with a Zacathan archeologist, the Guild, and the ruins of an alien civilization. Or are they really ruins - could Mimir still be inhabited?The saurian Zacathans, historians of the galaxy, are mentioned throughout the books set in this universe, but this is one of their (to date) few appearances as actual characters. The Guild - the criminal underworld - appears in many books, as do many Forerunner civilizations. If you're interested in books wherein the Guild plays a major role, try _The Zero Stone_ or _Forerunner Foray_. For another story of someone rejected from Scout training, try _Dread Companion_ (the daughter of a Scout, rejected for reasons different from Diskan's)."},{"Title":"The X factor","review":"When I was forty I wrote Andre Norton a letter in which I thanked her for everything that her books at taught me when I was growing up. Her stories about outsiders who succeed by finding the right path for the right person, something that out of step adolescents need to hear. Ms. Norton graciously responded with a letter I cherish nearly a decade later-- actually it's professionally framed and hanging in my office.This was one of the books I was thinking about when I wrote her. The hero has great physical strength, but feels as though he lacks the mental swiftness and physical grace to fit into the world of his father. He flees using a stolen travel tape and ends up on Mimir where he must find the courage and wits to survive and foil a villainous plot.On one level a simple adventure story, on another a story that most adolescents, who can't seem to fit in their changing bodies, can identify with. This Norton's juvenile stories at their best."},{"Title":"The X factor","review":"This book combines some of the great SF/Fantasy themes in a way that works and flows. It is the Norton that I would most frequently check out of the library to re-read as a young adult. Some of the mental images I developed in reading this story, can still bubble up in my memory today. The sense of alienation - of not belonging - felt by the main character echoes the feelings of all unpopular-due-to-nerdiness kids - many of whom were SF fans in the making. That alone should explain part of its appeal.We also get -*a cold wintry planet with a Forerunner-like mystery*one of the friendliest and most interesting of Norton's Zacathan characters [a wise, peaceful lizard-evolved race (in sharp contrast to most authors' intelligent-lizards-are-savage depictions (although see Norton's *Eye of the Monster*)]*a hidden, &quot;furry&quot; race*Norton's trademarked handling of telepathy, with her concept since copied by many other authors*and a plot that , while a classic hero's journey, has many particular 'vignettes' that have also been copied since - including by Norton herself - but rarely as well done.All in all, my sentimental favorite of early Nortons, and still fondly remembered.-Brooks A Rowlett"},{"Title":"The X factor","review":"The X-factorBy Andre Norton1965Disksan Fentress was a mutant.

At the time Toronto was arguably the dullest place in the country. I had little money & I knew almost no one, but I might have amused myself cheaply just walking around in the footsteps of literary greats. Fortunately things improved and I stayed for 34 years.Unfortunately, I didn't discover Mr Gatenby's book until my last year in Toronto when I was too ill to get about on any of the 62 walks laid out by the author. Nevertheless, as I toured from my sofa, I was surprised at what a hotbed of culture Toronto has been throughout its 200 year history. Hardly any street in the City has not been trodden upon by literati, both home-grown & international.Not merely a guidebook of who-slept-where, the closely-printed pages of this hefty tome are crammed with a wealth of biographical and historical information, supplemented with maps, clippings and period photos of people who visited, lived, loved, wrote, prospered or got into trouble in Toronto. Some examples:Opening at random to page 27, I find a short but poignant bio of Clara Morris, one of the great 19th century stage personages, who was born near the intersection of Richmond and Sherbourne Streets.On page 279 a newspaper clipping shows Irish playwright Brendan Behan handcuffed to a policeman after his arrest for assault and public disturbance, prior to his enforced residence at a drying-out facility at 1437 Queen Street West.An apartment building at 35 Walmer Road has been home variously to Giller Prize winner M G Vassanji, poet Mary di Michele, & novelist Neil Bassoondath.Also making an appearance are the likes of Oscar Wilde, Ernest Hemingway, Richard Rohmer, Margaret Atwood, Charles Dickens, Lawren Harris and Mazo de la Roche plus innumerable other less familiar names.No educated Torontonian should be without \\"Toronto A Literary Guide\\". You could plan many an entertaining little tour for yourself - in your own neighbourhood or farther afield -- & get some exercise at the same time. If the book is too cumbersome to lug around on a casual walk I suggest photocopying the particular pages you want to use.Although I have no plans ever to return to Toronto I find the book a vastly entertaining and useful reference. For instance, I was reading a Willa Cather novel & the bio info mentioned that Cather spent time in Toronto. I got out my copy of \\"Toronto A Literary Guide\\" and looked up Cather in the index. Sure enough, there is half a page about her staying in Toronto in 1919-1920 with an old friend Isabelle McClung. Isabelle lived on the west side of Bay Street, south of Breadalbane (south of Wellesley) at 38 St Vincent Street, a street later absorbed by Bay Street.If St Vincent sounds vaguely familiar to some readers it is because a few doors away in 1894-- at #16 St Vincent -- serial killer Henry Holmes briefly resided (& buried 2 victims beneath the house) - see my review of \\"The Devil in the White City\\". (Holmes is not mentioned in \\"Toronto A Literary Guide\\" - I did check -- just an odd coincidence that I was reading about both Cather & Holmes).A few contemporary location shots would have been helpful in the book, but I won't carp about it. We owe Mr Gatenby a big enough debt as it is for this wonderful compilation."},{"Title":"Perjuries of the Heart","review":"\\"IF YOU COOPERATE WITH THE MEDIA, WE WILL DESTROY YOU\\" that is the message Bill Clinton sent to his most beloved girlfriend (friend from high school) Dolly Kyle Browning in 1992.Dolly was not planning to go to the media, but that was the message that Bill delivered to her via her OWN BROTHER.

Framed by Will's train ride when he is drafted for WWII, it tells the stories of his Jewish family.Without rubbing your face in it, Will Eisner repeatedly shows you prejudices he encountered while growing up and while listening to his parents talk about their lives. There's a natural emphasis on anti-Semitism but other attitudes (anti-Catholic, &quot;those German Jews are so stuck up&quot;, etc.) are also shown.All that aside, it was also a fascinating story and showed something about what life was like from the late 19th century to 1942 - a year when neither of my parents had yet been born.I would recommend this book to those who like graphic novels, anyone who liked Maus, and anyone who likes the oral history of Studs Terkel. Also, I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in European and American politics of the first half of this century - for a viewpoint ! that doesn't often make it into history textbooks."},{"Title":"To the Heart of the Storm (Will Eisner Library)","review":"Will Eisner tells a thinly veiled autobiographical tale of the anti-Semitic attitudes that lurked in the U.S. even as America headed off to war against the Nazis in Europe. (Though it's never stated in this book, the only *official* aid the U.S. gave German Jews was to let about a thousand immigrate here during the war. Everything else came afterward.)Through the eyes of a son headed to war, we see his upbringing in various New York neighborhoods, and his parents' struggles to make ends meet in an economy where, even more than today, ethnicity could mean the difference between success and failure. His parents' tales show that things have been even worse in the past, though; from an uncle on his mother's side who changed his religion and cut himself off from the family to get into medical school, to his father's encounters in pre-WWI Vienna with a pro-Nazi artist.Maybe the most compelling and heartbreaking thread, however, is the relationship between Willie and his best friend, Duke. From a backyard fight, through a building project, and then a meeting as adults, we see the harsh reality of how things so often work out, but also the hope for what can be... and why an artist, just starting in his career, might make the decision to not fight his draft notice and risk losing it all.Brilliant stuff that warms the heart even as it sometimes hits like a knife in the back. Eisner is at his best here in art, in writing, and in storytelling."},{"Title":"To the Heart of the Storm (Will Eisner Library)","review":"Eisner presents broad, varied, and highly personal view of the American Jewish experience. It has to be varied since there is no one experience. Each differs from all the others, and each contains many parts at odds with each other.This time, Eisner starts his story on a troop train, one leg of the trip towards the storm of WWII. One character sits silently, gazing out the window. Although he never speaks or even moves, his story plays out as fragments of memory, triggered by each tenement, housewife, or children's game seen through the window.As such, there's no one linear thread of narrative. Parts take place before immigration from Europe, or the Depression, or the book's 1940s here-and-now. Fragments come from adult life, a child's experience, or an adolescent's ventures into friendship and love. Some parts represent the shared experience of any immigrant, balancing an insular \\"our kind\\" mentality against melding into the larger culture. Others display the range of distinctly Jewish experience, with features as subtle as a kind of anti-Semitism directed against one Jewish group by another.Eisner's graphic novels have led pictorial story-telling out of the \\"just comics\\" phase and into real literature. His somewhat cartoony visual style might look unsophisticated to today's media-soaked eye. If any other author tried it, the graphic style wouldn't do much for me. The story is what matters in Eisner's work. It's the kind of fiction that doesn't need to be literally true in its facts to be deeply, personally, and sometimes brutally honest.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"PricewaterhouseCoopers' Guide to the 2005 Tax Rules: Includes the Latest Income Tax Numbers","review":"Why I gave it three stars:This book is excellent if you are a financial/advisor/accountant/tax person or like me getting ready for the CPA exam and preparing to attend a Masters in Taxation.

After all, the world of wildlife photography was male-dominated. Therefore, Emma decided she would do what no other photographer had been able to do before. She was going to capture the &quot;Beast of Bodmin Moor&quot; on film and prove that the legendary black leopard was REAL!Seth Trevelyan used to be a road racer. Due to a major accident during a race, that career was over. Now he was a motorcycle designer. His best design of all time was almost completed. Only a bit of fine tuning was left. Then he came across lovely Emma whose automobile had died and left her stranded with an injured ankle. Seth got her settled in Trevelyan House where Mrs. Evans, the housekeeper, and he tended her. Upon learning her profession, Seth knew that he would have to keep a very close eye on Emma. If she really was after the black leopard, then it was up to him to make her believe it did not exist. However, she could also be a corporate spy sent to photograph his latest design.***** This entire novel is set in Cornwall with the heroine being half American and half Cornish. Fans of the legends about King Arthur will especially adore this story. Trevelyan House is set near the Dozmary Pool, where the Lady of the Lake received Excalibur from Sir Bedwyr, just before Arthur died. Excellent tale that I highly recommend! *****"},{"Title":"The Prophetic Parables of Matthew Thirteen","review":"Arthur Pink had, as another reviewer described, a \\"staggering\\" insight into Yahweh's word.

What you learn in each path fits in nicely with the other ones and they never contradict. To learn all the backstory and solve all the puzzles requires several tries, you don't get to learn everything by taking one path. The choices are also pretty nice, if a bit easy; the right course of action is usually fairly obvious, though sometimes the bold, foolhardy course is the right one.This book also has a nice atmosphere, but how could it not? Archaelogists, a gang of burglars, an international terrorist group, a Chinese smuggler and his family, a mysterious tribe of Native Americans, and a ghost ship. That's what you call a cast.I only have two gripes. While it is possible to find the Star of Asia, the most massive emerald ever found, you don't get to keep it; you turn it over to someone else.

Organized by dynasty, each chapter gives a few text pages covering basics in garment style, hairstyle and make up, and footwear for that dynasty.

Most of the garments are rendered in a 2-dimensional layout, with either paintings or statuary from the period as primary documentation. I found the appendixes in the back to be most useful, showing the evolution of body and sleeve style through progressive dynasties. A few examples of accessories are shown.

I originally bought this book, based on the Amazon reviews, for my son...soon to turn 20. We are a Jewish family and recently observant. Our son, however, is attracted to Eastern Spiritual philosophies and practices so I thought this might provide a bridge to the wealth of Jewish spiritual teaching and what currently interests him. I confess, that I too was attracted to Bhuddism as a young adult and read avidly on the subject but never took it up as a formal practice.I am familiar with the many original Chasidic tales and Talmudic amd Midrashic sources for the one page teaching vignettes used by the author to illustrate his spiritual \\"points\\". Many of these are mangled, distorted, and inverted..ultimately bearing little of their original and profound meaning. In fact, a few are twisted into outright nonsense....what I would call \\"feel good\\" quasi \\"new age\\" gobbledygook.Although I am not a trained Zen practitioner, I doubt if there is any worthwhile \\"Zen\\" in this book. There is some undoubtedly adulterated Judaism. while the title is catchy I\\"ve come to think that maybe it's an oxymoron to mix spiritual teaching metaphors in this way. It only detracts from the beauty of each tradition, which stands in it's own right. Is there a \\"Zen Christianity\\" around somewhere?I don't criticize the Rabbi for making a well intentioned attempt at fusing traditions. However, either it can't work...or he needs to rethink it's presentation. IN the meatime, for $25 you can buy a lot more bang for your buck."},{"Title":"Zen Judaism: Teaching Tales by a Kabbalistic Rabbi","review":"This is a book of tales with spiritual meaning that doesn't try to be spiritual and erudite; it simply tells simple stories of simple lives. Some of the tales have Asian roots such as the tale of the Samuria warrior who asks a master about heaven and hell. Some are traditional elaborations on Biblical texts such as the adjective used to describe Moses. Some are humorous expansions of Biblical texts such as why Adam and Eve were not made until the sixth day. Several are stories relating to understanding between Jews, Christians and Muslims. Some are traditional Hasidic tales. Some may even be actual experiences of the author.All the stories are told clearly and directly - nothing to come between the reader and the story.

Maybe that's it Colonel. Maybe none of this is real. We're all in hell&quot;I cannot rate this book without talking about the brilliance of the whole series. Cornwell takes you from your reading room, and teleports you back to a simpler time. And you find out that it's not so simple. Set against the backdrop of the Eastern Theatre in the American Civil War, he portrays the massive carnage and greatest bravery in minute detail. You actually hear the cannons, and smell the rotting flesh of the wounded. Yet, the main plot does not take place amongst the gunfire outside. But, rather, within. It is a story of a soul, and his struggle with God, man, who he is, and what he stands for. Amidst the shouting, crying, blasting, and dieing...is a poor heart, searching for peace. I found Cornwell's protrayal of Nate Starbuck to be no less than perfect. I found myself rooting, questioning, hoping, and praying for this fictional character. For, I saw myself in Nate. The same questions, fears, and desires. When done, I walked away from this story with a different outlook on life, liberty, and what's truly important. As will you."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"As the summer of 1862 passes, the Yankees once again maneuver and reinforce for a massive Virginia offensive they can never quite manage to begin. The Rebels repulse one attempt at Cedar Mountain. Lee, now in field command, sends Stonewall Jackson on a daring long march into the Yankees' rear, striking towards Manassas where the war's first big battle was fought. The Rebels are already hungry, ragged and ill-equipped, and as Jackson's probe develops, they barely have enough ammunition to fight. The two armies' maneuvering in Northern Virginia continues to take its toll on the countryside.Nathaniel Starbuck is now a captain, uneasily under the command of his nemesis Washington Faulconer, who conspires to get rid of him. Unknown to Starbuck, his estranged father, Northern abolitionist preacher Elial Starbuck, is visiting the opposing lines, where he is constantly assured a decisive Union victory. Adam Faulconer now has joined a Union cavalry detachment composed entirely of pro-Union Southerners, whose knowledge of the Virginia countryside can help them raid behind enemy lines like the Rebels' Jeb Stuart. They make a bold move on the Faulconer Brigade. The eccentric Stonewall Jackson, who seems to confide only in God and Lee, inspires his men to go beyond themselves as \\"foot cavalry\\" to fight a force vastly superior in numbers and equipment.In this third installment in the series, the action is located almost entirely in the field, without the Richmond scenes, intelligence intrigues and romantic complications of the earlier books. Cornwell does a fine job bringing Jackson's character to life; his battle scenes are, as always, vivid; and he imbues the reader with the ethoi that pervaded each side. The Union's inability to bring its well-supplied and numerically superior forces to bear is increasing frustration on its side, as McClellan's ponderous landing southeast of Richmond has come to nothing in the Peninsular Campaign, and the now equally ponderous repositioning back towards Manassas is under way. The Rebels, meanwhile, already feel the pinch of hunger and see they can only hang on through audacity, courage and luck. I can't think of any more enjoyable way to learn about the Civil War."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"As a US History teacher, I am always looking for fiction that is historically accurate and yet exciting to read. The Starbuck series does that and \\"Battle Flag\\" is the best of the series.Dr. Robert Massey"},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"I continue to read and enjoy Cornwell's Civil War series. I do however, have problems with these books in two areas: 1) the same themes recur to the point of monotony; and 2) Cornwell is not all that competent historically.With respect to the latter, he makes several errors in _Battle Flag_. These seem not so much due to ignorance, carelessness, or convenience, as to a desire by Cornwell to re-characterize history to fit his own prejudices.For example, he attributes to Jackson an active role in troop management during the battles at Cedar Mountain and Second Manassas. The truth is quite the opposite; Jackson remained largely passive during both of those battles. That was one of his few notable weak points during the entire campaign.Cornwell's treatment here is odd, in that he supposedly based the historical portions of this novel largely on John Hennessy's fine history, _Return to Bull Run_, which details Jackson's passivity during those battles at some length, calling his performance &quot;mediocre&quot;.If a bit of gratuitous generosity on Jackson's behalf can be excused, the unnecessary swipe Cornwell takes at Longstreet in the Historical Notes section is not so easily forgiven. Cornwell makes the statement that &quot;Lee's victory might have been more complete had Longstreet attacked [sooner].&quot; Hennessy explicitly expresses the opposite opinion: Longstreet and Lee independently choose the exact same moment for the attack, and it was at that precise moment when the Union forces were at their most vulnerable.Cornwell is, in essence, another Jackson/Lee groupie who thinks all faults belong to Longstreet -- and he's willing to re-write history in order to advance his prejuduces. Stuff like that is fine for arguing about over beers, but it's dishonest.Corwell's books are fun to read though."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"This series is just getting better and better.

As with previous installments, the entire book is devoted to a short period in Civil War history. This time it's the few weeks leading up to and including the 2nd Battle of Bull Run. The battle descriptions are vivid and at times horrid. There are also interesting character developments, which can't really be described without becoming a spoiler. I recommend reading the series in order to get the best effect, but each book stands alone.My complaint about the first two books was a lack of any cohesive explanation for why the son of an ardent Northern abolitionist would elect to join the Southern Cause. This time around the author seems to have given up trying to concoct a believable explanation and started turning Starbuck into a Southern boy, which is even more annoying and unbelievable.

I ordered it a couple weeks ago from amazon along with the new WWII novel THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and have to say that the new writer, Rustad, won that round hands down. But I still have the highest espect for Bernard Cornwell's work. I guess one can;t produce a winner every time."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"Dashing, one-dimensional, yet able to survive war AND a dysfunctional family, Starbuck guides us through the civil war. The action is gripping, fast and frequent (okay, even well written at times); however, it isn't enough to offset wooden characters and dialogue. The history and facts seem accurate and real; but the story is mind-candy. One is reminded of a TV-movie like &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; in which the character's superficial romances and personal tragedies serve as a rest stop between &quot;Important Events.&quot; I nominate Chuck Norris for the TV-movie version of this book and series. A &quot;4&quot; for historical accuracy and above average action."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"I only give one star to this book for its very dramatic, realistic, and wonderfully written battle scenes. In all four books of the Starbuck Chronicles, Cornwell offers these great scenes to the reader that cannot be found in any other Civil War Novel. In this alone do I wish that the Starbuck Chronicles continue (for the last book stops short of the battle of Fredricksburg &lt;sic>).However, the plots, characters, and historical value are not to be desired by a serious reader of historical fiction. First of all in the battle scenes Starbuck, an officer is seen fighting among his men with a musket and without rank insignia on his collar. There is no proof that an officer would behave this way except in one or two instances when an officer would pick up a rifle on the field. I believe that Cornwell was trying to make the Starbuck and Confederate officer figure look more edgy and above military tradition and ritual. However, this is not from historical fact.Also Cornwell does little to give the reader understanding of what Starbuck and indeed all the South is fighting for. The cause is always victory, victory, victory. For what though? For the northerners in the book, however he delicately outlines the cause of freeing the slave. In fact, in one scene, Starbuck asks his free black friend, Lucifer, why he wants to fight the \\"people who want to free him.\\" However, this too is historically inaccurate. Not only was all the Starbuck Chronicles based before the Emancipation Proclamation was issued but also even after it was issued, the primary cause of the Union soldier was to keep the Southern states in the Union. Historical data reflects that very few Northerners favored the destruction of slavery. When the Civil War ended, 19 of 24 Northern states did not allow blacks to vote. Nowhere did they serve on juries before 1860. However, as wonderful as Cornwell wanted to paint the Northerners, he could now leave out the fact that General Pope of the Union army issued an order that would not hold Northern soldiers accountable for sacking and destroying Southern homes and raping their women. So to disguise this black moment in Northern history, Cornwell uses Billy Blythe, a native of the South wearing blue to do all this dirty work promoted by General Pope. It is sad that the only way for Cornwell to show Northern brutality against Southern citizens was to use a Southern man wearing the blue coat.For all the good in these chronicles I am saddened that it stenches of the same politically correct and fairy tail lies that have ruined North and South and other wise good Civil War fiction."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"As I said to my father when we were discussing the Starbuck series, &quot;Ah well, at least we can rely on Bernard to give us a good battle&quot;.The Starbuck books are good, and had anyone else's name appeared on the cover they might even qualify for an excellent rating. But they're not worthy of Bernard Cornwell. The problem really is Nate, the lead character. Or maybe it's with me and my dear old dad: neither of us can get a handle on him. Nate Starbuck's a ditherer who is also a fine leader. He's certainly confused morally. His position as a Northerner in the Southern armies wasn't all that unique as to raise as much rancour as it does...Not the best book Cornwell's written, by a long chalk. There are only two bright spots: the battle scenes, which are vintage Cornwell; and I love the appearance of Sharpe's son. I'd love to know a lot more about his adventures!No - give the American Civil War / Starbuck series the elbow, and write to Bernard Cornwell asking for more Sharpe.Or pretend to yourself that someone else wrote the book... You'll enjoy it a lot more."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"I read the four current Starbucks Chronicles in just two weeks. Being a Civil War buff, I greatly admire his work. It's just like reading Sharpe, except it takes place a couple generations later, and on the other side of the pond. They now have a villain, Billy Blythe. He is remarkably similar to Sergeant Hakeswill (of the Sharpe series) in nearly every aspect. As the book progressed, I wanted him to get killed. He'll provide much enjoyment for readers.The only thing I'd change is having Starbuck fight for the Union. After all, they won at the end. I'm just wondering how Cornwell will get Starbuck through Appomattox."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"Cornwell's terribly disappointing Civil War series (Rebel, Copperhead) here continues the trials and triumphs of Nathaniel Starbuck, Northerner turned Confederate rebel. The story here concerns Nate's rise in the ranks, along with the stunning transformation of the drunkard Col. Swindon, while his old best friend Adam finds refuge in a Yankee cavalry unit. The battle sequences-most notably Cedar Mountain and the second Manassas-are typical Cornwell, blood, guts, smoke, terror, and mayhem everywhere. But ultimately the series falls flat because the characters aren't very compelling, and thus we don't really care about them. Some readers seem to find Starbuck a wonderful creation, a troubled soul, struggling with his Northern heritage, God, morality, and soforth. I personally don't get it, Starbuck is a spoiled teenager turned soldier mostly as an act of reflexive rebellion against his father, and there's little to recommend him as a hero-he's certainly no Sharpe.Another problem is that characters from previous books seem to wax and wane to the point of inconsistency. For example, Nate's archnemesis, Gen. Faulconer all but disappears from this book, as does Nate's Sgt. Harper substitute Sgt. Treadwell, not to mention any of the ladies who figured so prominently in the two previous books. Meanwhile, Nate's father gets a much more prominent role, and new characters are introduced, like the black servant Lucifer, and the nasty Billy Blythe, who is a virtual reincarnation of Sgt. Obediah Hakeswill from Cornwell's Sharpe series. One the whole Cornwell's writing is just a bit sloppier and more careless in this series. For example, in all three books he's had Starbuck spy a young soldier in battle reloading an unfired rifle and stop him, giving him a dead soldier's rifle instead. I mean... come on!In any event, the series is far below Cornwell's Sharpe series, but I suppose I'll keep reading just to see if it improves."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"Battle Flag, the third book in Bernard Cornwell's Starbuck Chronicles, is an absolutely splendid blend of fictional characters and history.

Cornwell manages to create suspense and great battle scenes as usual. He also finds a few great historical details to give a real period flavor to his descriptions. The way that the fog of war and the shock of violence are portrayed are stock Cornwell and they still always hit home.One of the uneven things about this series is that the character development is slightly uneven, on the other hand the characters are all interesting and have very realistic elements.Highly recommended for Cornwell fans and Civil War buffs.

Stupid commanding officers to concerned with their authority, evil soldiers who believe war is an excuse to rape, pillage and plunder. Starbuck is the commander of the Legion, but his authority is tenuous. The battle itself is well written and I enjoyed it. I found the introduction of Starbuck's father intriguing considering in many ways he is the catalyst in the series. Once again I don;t really care for the Adam Falcouner story, although at least he is showing more guts instead of the previous books. One issue I had with this story is that Cornwell does seem to be unfair to Longstreet. Longstreet was held up before Manassas by Union cavalry under Buford, the same man who would later hold the high ground at Gettysburg. Most historians concur that the exact moment that Longstreet struck the Union flank was the most crucial moment to attack so I believe that Cornwell gives him a bit of a short shaft."},{"Title":"Battle Flag: Starbuck Chronicles, Vol. 3","review":"The 3rd installment of the Starbuck Chronicles continues to follow the experiences of Nathaniel Starbuck and in my opinion is an entertaining read.I love to read fictional history and I love to read Bernard Cornwell. His stories contain excellent battle descriptions and loveable (and dislikeable) characters.If you are a fan of historical fiction, I wholeheartedly recommend most-anything by Cornwell. Battle Flag probably could have been better, but it kept my attention, it entertained me, and even taught me."},{"Title":"The Workbasket & Home Arts Magazine March 1985","review":"I've been looking for this crochet book for years and was so excited to find it!

The writers briefly touch all the bases with the information provided. Get this book and the one by Bey Logan and you'll have a nice overall view of this cinema.Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Hong Kong Babylon: An Insider's Guide to the Hollywood of the East","review":"Unfortunately, Fred Dannen's interviews are much too short so if you're looking for an in-depth look into the Hong Kong film business this isn't it. However, the book has a substantial section summarizing/commenting on hundreds of films and they are wonderfully written by Barry Long, a true connossieur of Hong Kong cinema."},{"Title":"Hong Kong Babylon: An Insider's Guide to the Hollywood of the East","review":"As some of the other reviews here suggest, this is a bit of a cut and paste job-- Dannen's New Yorker piece on the triads thrown together with reviews and lists compiled by others. But the field has been so spottily documented to date that the serious info and critical context provided here is of real value, even if, as is suggested in one of the reviews above, &quot;Sex and Zen and a Bullet in the Head&quot; is probably a better choice for the fan who just wants to know what cool movies to rent. I would also recommend a British book which should be available here, &quot;Hong Kong Action Cinema&quot; by Bey Logan."},{"Title":"Hong Kong Babylon: An Insider's Guide to the Hollywood of the East","review":"This book could have been so much more that what it is. The author had interviews with many of the top stars and directors in Hong Kong Cinema, and yet the interviews of such notables as Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat, Jackie Chan, and Michelle Yeoh are barely a page-and-a-half. While it does provide some wonderful information, the bulk of the book is plot summaries and reviews; while the summaries might be helpful, I think most people would have been more interested in what the people involved in the business have to say. Ultimately, my main take on this book is that it was a squaundered oppurtunity for the author to have access to so many well known stars only to reduce them to 5 or 6 comments in a book of this size. Magazine interviews are longer than the interviews found in this book. It's worth reading, but just speaking for myself, it was little more than a tease."},{"Title":"Hong Kong Babylon: An Insider's Guide to the Hollywood of the East","review":"Considering the lack of any information on the film-making industry outside of Hollywood; this book does fill a needed space. Most libraries would do well to include it in their collection despite the cheap adhesive binding and the high risk of damage to the book(ie pages and pictures being razored out). The opening article gives an interesting yet way-too-short overview on the industry and the individual interviews should have been better planned. The synopsis of individual films is handy because most of the video packaging for these films is not very informative or not in english. Other popular video guides do not often include Hong Kong films unless the films have reached a certain cult status (examples: The Killer, A Better Tomorrow) The critic section is a waste of space. More should have been spent on the history of the industry than on the opinions of little known critics."},{"Title":"Hong Kong Babylon: An Insider's Guide to the Hollywood of the East","review":"Another case study straight from the old adage, 'Don't judge a book by its cover.'With a twinge of trepidation, I selected Amazon's cheapest paperback offering of the out-of-print title I was seeking, available for under $2, plus shipping. The book arrived on time (5 days, shipped by ground US Mail), and the book arrived in 'like new' condition, as promised. No surprises, no hitches, no fine print -- just the uncommon pleasure of receiving a good deal without strings attached.I'm completely satisfied with the purchase, and will continue selecting the most economical alternative, though with a tad bit less skepticism going forward."},{"Title":"Hong Kong Babylon: An Insider's Guide to the Hollywood of the East","review":"Beware this book! Given the success of Dannen's uncompromising 'Hit Men' and the promise of his previously published piece on HK cinema, one would expect 'Babylon' to provide a comprehensive, perhaps even a definitive, examination of the subject at hand. Alas, this 400+ page tome consists, substantively speaking, in very little more than that piece, which can be read for free on the Net! After the initial 54 pages, the volume degenerates into an unbearably tedious crop of lists; capsule profiles of HK film figures, endless filmographies, plot summaries, and a recommended viewing guide, most of which have been presented elsewhere in much more entertaining and engrossing fashion. As to the opinions of 'a round table of twelve diverse and exceptional critics' - who cares? The films are made to be seen, not to be endlessly pontificated upon. As a reference guide for the timid, I suppose the book has some dry value; given the 'insider's' promise of Dannen's earlier writing on the subject, this project is a lazy buzzkill, reading like a means of making a quick buck without pursuing new material or expending additional effort. Avoid, avoid."},{"Title":"The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy (World Bank Policy Research Reports)","review":"This book explores the causes for the extraordinary growth experienced by a few Asian countries in the pre-1997 crisis era. It describes, in great detail, the policies adopted in each country that are believed to have spurred such development; to its credit (being a World Bank book), it even suggests that some unorthodox policies may have been beneficial, even though it does suggest that these benefits are not there to be reaped again by a country trying to emulate them. One of the main arguments is also that income distribution improvements have been a common experience across these countries, which is a topic not often discussed in development economics.There are, however, some obvious fallacies in this book. Having been written pre-1997 crisis, it does highlight the strenght of the banking system in many of these countries; these banking systems were later to be blamed for much of the pain in the 1997 crisis.I find this book fascinating, not as a source of development ideas (those can be found elsewhere), but due to the historical context in which it was written (praising economies that were about to collapse). Of course, these economies are still better off that most developing countries, so I do not believe that they are mistaken in many points, but there are certain contradictions that arose with the crisis that make it worth reading this book to determine what is good advice and what is hot air."},{"Title":"The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy (World Bank Policy Research Reports)","review":"Good overview explaining the policies behind East Asia's phenominal economic success. Should be read by all students of economic development. However, the book is very weak when it comes to discussing the area's merchantalist policies. Reading this one would think they did not exist and have played no role (good or bad) in these nations' development."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Vatican","review":"With all the books out there that make a buck by slamming the church, this one is actually ridiculous. The author is no Dan Brown by a long shot. Save your money, nothing new here at all. Pure trash"},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"is the only way I can describe how I felt looking at the images in this beautiful book. God bless the men who made the ultimate sacrifice for others. This book is a breathtaking memoir on their heroism. Hopefully we will never forget"},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"On October 19, 2001, my wife and I walked more than 50 blocks from downtown to mid-town Manhattan, stopping at each fire station along the way.Every stop had its own story to tell, without the need for eloquent prose or a \\"tour guide\\" leading the way, stating the obvious.Images of lost firefighters and burning candles were out front, with hand-scrawled tributes plastered on every available space, written by heart-broken individuals from throughout the country, and NOT just from New York.Of all books attempting to capture the flavor of a well-done tribute to ANY cause or group of individuals (in this case, the Fire Department of New York, now world-renown as FDNY), \\"Brotherhood\\" succeeds wonderfully in a way that SHOULD seem obvious to most, but apparently not, especially when compared to countless other \\"rush to market\\" though \\"well-intentioned\\" tributes of similar bent.\\"Brotherhood\\" follows a perfect, \\"by-the-dots\\" formula that all pure \\"tributes\\" should follow, at least in terms of composition and design. And that is, use minimal text and heart-wrenching images that speak a thousand words.Too often, creative teams associated with such efforts go overboard by stating the obvious, manipulating viewer or reader emotions unnecessarily with narration, captions or adjective-filled text to articulate the intangible. The result is a product, however well-intentioned, that is undercut by an over-zealousness to stamp into words, a generic and universal feeling when none are required.The cumulative effect of image after image -- of empty fire stations, burning candles, faces of those lost, notes written by children, flowers of every hue, empty boots marked by their owners -- is ultimately equal parts devastating and uplifting, without a trace of maudlin excess. Its understated presentation proves to be the best thing going for it.More than any other symbol, the fire stations of New York City offer the greatest lasting visible personification of courage, its inhabitants giving no thought of what the word itself means other than something that others (you and I) have attached to that innate sense of mission that seems to course through every firefighter's veins.With introductions by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (the only other major volume blessed with the Mayor's words is \\"One Nation,\\" by the editors of Life Magazine, which by itself should be enough endorsement), Fire Commissioner Thomas Van Essen and Pulitzer-prize winning author Frank McCourt -- and supplemented by wonderful text absent of cheap sentiment by Tony Hendra -- \\"Brotherhood\\" offers a stark blend of prose and spectacular images that enable the reader to conjure his or her own personal set of emotions, without being sledge-hammered into being told how to feel.As a writer who prefers a mix of substance and tribute over tribute alone, I have surveyed more than 25 products associated with 9/11, and have learned AGAIN to never to judge a book by its cover or by liner notes alone.To date, \\"Brotherhood\\" is one of only a small group of 9/11-related products that truly deserve to be on your permanent shelf, and one of only two pure \\"tribute books\\" worthy enough to be labeled, \\"keepers.\\"The other volumes, all available ...include: \\"September 11: A Testimony (by Reuters; the second worthy \\"pure\\" tribute available), the aforementioned, \\"One Nation (by the editors of Life Magazine),\\" \\"September 11, 2001: A Record of Tragedy, Heroism, and Hope (by the editors of New York Magazine)\\" and \\"The World Trade Center (by Bill Harris).\\"Save your money to buy these volumes -- and consider the rest as no more than heartfelt souvenirs and memorials -- worthy of browsing, but not buying."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"I purchased this book for my Firefighter husband. I know that, as a firefighter, he felt particularly helpless when this tragedy struck New York, and our country. I feel a great sense of pride in my husband's choice of occupation, and even more so that he is a Volunteer Firefighter. This book is a very moving tribute all of those (not just firefighters) that gave their lives on September 11th. The images contained are extraordinary, and all of us in the family that paged through it became very emotional when we read it. There are very few words, aside from the text written by the Mayor and Mr. McCourt, but the images leave very little need for them. And even more moving is the list of lost souls on the bottom of each page, which I felt assigned a lot more of a personal touch to this tragedy than just knowing the mere numbers of those lost while doing their jobs that day.I do in fact feel that 'Brotherhood' is a perfect title, because as anyone affiliated with rescue services can tell you, it is a large family. We ALL felt a great sense of loss that day, I think this book is the very LEAST we can do."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"As you are reading though the tribute to the fallen, you see thenamesof each of the lost Firefighters scrolled across the bottom of the pages.

Yet i am most moved by the names of those precious and brave firefighters name across the pages from the front cover to the back cover."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"&quot;The Brotherhood&quot; is a spectacular and moving tribute to all of New Yorks Bravest. It is tearfully moving yet not in the least bit over done or surupy. The Photography is absolutely first rate and truely captures the heart and soul of the FDNY and the sense of loss that all NY feels for the men and women of the New York City Fire Dept.I have not read Frank McCourt's books, but after reading his moving salute to the firemen of New York City I can easly understand why many consider him to be among the greatest living and active writers today. His two pages of writting alone are worth the price of this book. Wether you wish to buy this book simply because you wish to help the families of those killed or because of it's potential historical value or perhaps because you are a fire fighter or fire buff you won't be disappoited by this wonderful tribute/book. A definite buy."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"Brotherhood is a moving pictorial of the FDNY. The pictures are moving and haunting at the same time. I would highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"This is a powerfully moving book. Pay attention to the names along the bottom, for they are the fallen. This book, with few words does not need them to get the message out. A picture is worth a thousand words, and some of the pictures are very moving indeed. You see the stations, of the fallen, and see the moving tributes, and the US Flags at half staff. You see what is like at the stations, on the inside of the house, and the emptyness that was left behind. You see the living, and the pain with in their eyes, and much sadness. Then there is the Fallen themselves, and you are able to see all of the FDNY who where killed on that fateful day. Then there is the Grief, and on how they delt with it in the days afterward, and moving tributes from children. On the back, is the Firemans Prayer.This is not a happy book, but a solemn tribute to those who died. It is a reverent, and loving tribute, and may bring tears to your eyes, but it is well worth it, so we can remeber them though the Brotherhood."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"I saw the book at the fire house and started looking for it right away.

There are few pictures of Ground Zero, which I thought was good. It's nice the author focused on the people and staion houses that make up FDNY, instead of the usual 9/11 books with pictures of the debris field at the Trade Center. Across the bottom of every page are the names of those who gave their lives in a valiant effort to save others. Photos of the shrines created in front of the fire houses serve to uplift rather than cause sadness. Instead of being depressing and dreary, this book drew out the pride I feel to be one of the members of this family-- the fire service. The books tell the story of not only the FDNY, but the city they protect and serve every day... and the pride those citizens feel in their fire department. This is one book about 9/11 everyone should read."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"I was moved to tears reading this, not only having witnessed the 9-11 atrocities firsthand but as a widow I know the pain suffered by the widows of those brave firemen that perished that day.

It has wonderful illustrations and deserves a place on your book shelf"},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"Frank McCourt's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; was a tremendous inside look at a childhood filled with tragedy and its overcoming, in this book he chronicles the greatest single tragedy in the FDNY's history - 343 firemen killed in the line-of-duty during the attacks on New York's World Trade Centers.The prose is poetic and the pictures are poignant. It is a well crafted tribute to all those who made sacrifices on that day and during the grim days directly after 9/11/01.I've been a NYC firefighter for over sixteen years (I work in the South Bronx) and the Fire Department is indeed and hopefully always will be a BROTHERHOOD. Firemen routinely refer to each other as &quot;Brothers,&quot; as in &quot;brother firemen.&quot; If that offends some people that offense is misplaced. There are currently less than thirty active female firefighters in the 10,000 member FDNY. There were no women who responded to the World Trade Centers on the eleventh. That's why there were no female firefighters among the 343 killed...and thank God.The Fire Service is not a job conducive to the vast majority of women. The job is not just filthy, brutal and dangerous, but given the wide gap in upper body strength between men and women, only a handful of women are up to the rigors of the job. Those women who do get into the FDNY must be prepared to join the &quot;Brotherhood.&quot;Still, the point is that the title here is entirely appropriate, especially in light of those who made the supreme sacrifice that day. This is an excellent book and one well worth reading, especially for those who didn't get a first-hand look at Ground Zero."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"No other words can describe this pictoral. It is just amazing."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"Regrettably, this is yet another book published to aid the victims of the 9/11 tragedy in New York City. Yet it is a poignant, occasionally inspirational, look at the lives of New York City firemen from the engine and ladder companies that lost many of their brothers on September 11th. I strongly commend the book's editors for assembling a superb team of photographers and for soliciting excellent introductory essays from both the Honorable Rudolph Giuliani, the outgoing mayor of New York City, and memoirist Frank McCourt. Frank writes some of his finest lyrical prose saluting New York City's Bravest as ordinary, unsung heroes. Anyone interested in acquiring a splendid coffee table book on New York City firemen, helping the victims of 9/11/01, or both, should certainly purchase this book."},{"Title":"Brotherhood","review":"I get so sick of women who complain about men and dislike men!

Only a woman would suggest that its mistitled just because its called &quot;BROTHERhood&quot; men are entitled to a book like this. Men are usually only denigrated in books,at least those written by women,so its time we had books like this that celebrate men. God knows we celebrate females enough in todays world at the total exclusion of men. So its utterly rediculous to malign this book just because it seems to exclude female firefighters,which I\`m sure was unintentional on the part of the writers.Besides how many times are men excluded,or even ignored or denigrated in books and the media.No,this book is not mistitled,but the one-star reviewer from washington,dc is certainly misguided.

I meandered through bookstores looking for a book that would capture all the emotions I felt on Sept 11. In the end, I was always drawn back to this book but did not purchase it at first because I could not read through it without becoming overwhelmed with emotions. If a picture tells a thousand words then this book will leave you speechless.I have purchased just three books on Sept 11, 2001 and this, by far is the most moving tribute to the brave men who gave their lives in the hopes of saving others. The names scrolled along the bottom of the pages create a constant reminder of the heros who stared death in the face and forged ahead. The pictures are tasteful and center on the brotherhood that was so mortally wounded on that fateful day, rather than on the actual photo's of the event.

I've had to call publishers before and none of them had the respect and reverence these people did for the heroes represented within Brotherhood's covers.

This volume of photographs eloquently memorializes the lost by recording the images of the firehouses from which they served their community. The images, taken not long after 9/11, show the firehouses bedecked by mounds of flowers, photos of the lost, images of the things they left behind and banners proclaiming to never forget.Even without the sense of loss, the book would have been fascinating. The firehouses are in all shapes, sizes and ages, from tiny, one-engine 19th-century brick filigreed music boxes to post-modern buildings that could be anything -- college student center, post office or shopping center. But the reminders of that day of darkness are what give the images an emotional punch -- oversized American flags fluttering in afternoon breezes; the list of names snaking across the bottom of the pages; the empty boots and racks of empty coats that grimly recall our minds to those who will no longer return.\\"Brothers\\" contains some text -- short and eloquent testimonials written by former Mayor Giuliani, novelist Frank McCourt, satirist Tony Hendra and others. But these are deliberately placed second to the images that remind us of the brave men who face fire every day, advancing into an elemental reality that our very nature prompts us to flee, men who on an obscenely-blue-skied day in 2001, courageously entered towers from which they would never return.A beautiful, near-wordless and moving elegy to the human American spirit that no enemy can destroy."},{"Title":"Holy Bible: Spirit Filled Life Bible for Students, New King James Version (Bible Nkjv)","review":"Out of all the bibles I have ever tried to read and understand, this one takes the cake.

How wrong could I be! \`Illustrated\` was certainly the description for Dr Schaadt\`s enlightening book. Suddenly a light went on and after reading at least a half dozen books, including old standards like Doctors in Blue, at last, I have found one that you don\`t have to be a surgeon or a statistician to understand. The writing is lucid, the drawings fascenating and one can view the photographs without the use of a microscope. Unlike the photos in other Civil War medicine books they actually show the instruments almost lifesize. It gives a real feel as to how it must have been to actually hold what must have appeared to the patients as instruments of torture. Questions I have often asked after reading other books have here been answered and answered so simply. For the reader merely interested in this aspect of the Civil War or for the serious Civil War student I would highly recommend Dr Schaadt\`s book over all others currently available. His great respect for the surgeons who risked their lives and their health is evident on every page, and I challenge any reader not to share that respect by the time they have reached the final page. Indeed in the prologue we learn of a civil war surgeon who died on the battlefield at Shiloh while tending the wounded. At the back of the book we read that the author is practising Emergency Medicine in Illinois, it is not difficult therefore to imagine Dr Schaadt himself wearing the insignia of an army surgeon and saving lives on a 19th Century battlefield. Well done. I only hope this book gets the readership it deserves."},{"Title":"Civil War Medicine: An Illustrated History","review":"Schaadt provides the reader with a great introduction into the field of medicine during the Civil War years.

Unfortunately, although you cannot tell from the book's listing or even from its front cover, the book concerns British titles only. It will tell you quite precisely how one ought to address the wife of an Irish chieftain or the grandchild of a marquess (I kid you not), but does not suggest how one addresses a professor at a community college, a Muslim cleric, or the President of the United States. With regard to religious titles in religions other than Christianity and Judaism, the book simply observes, &quot;Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and adherents of other religions have a variety of religious and cultural organisations which have different hierarchies. It is recommended that an approach be made to places of worship or to cultural centres to ascertain the modes deemed most appropriate for individual priests, ministers and officials.&quot; For the President, it does note that &quot;the US president . . . should be addressed as Mr President and on envelopes as the President of the United States of America&quot;--a lot less information than the reader gets on the preceding page for addressing an assistant chief constable of a non-metropolitan police force.This book is also utterly impersonal. The publisher's address appears on the copyright page, but otherwise there is not a single human or institutional author whose name appears as responsible for its content. The book nowhere suggests where a curious reader may turn for more information. And, while the cover proudly identifies this version as the &quot;Twentieth edition,&quot; and the copyright page lists editions going back to 1918, the text is utterly devoid of accumulated anecdotes, tradition, or humor.No doubt this book is competent in its own milieu. For American culture, however, I recommend sticking with Emily Post."},{"Title":"North (Faber paperbacks)","review":"These poems connect the twenty first century reader with the Celtic past of Ireland, in a unique way: through the experience of the marauding Vikings.

Definately recommended!"},{"Title":"Truth","review":"This well argued book describes an interesting and counter-intuitive theory about the nature of truth. Horwich develops a 'minimal theory of truth' in which truth is not some weighty metaphysical entity but rather captured by simple statements like snow is white if and only if snow is white. Horwich argues that these simple equivalence relations capture all the crucial features of truth and how truth is used. This theory is essentially a descriptive account along the lines of a scientific theory. A possible analogy would be the use in Newtonian dynamics of concepts like mass. Like a concept such as mass, truth is an important property of propositions as a device to describe crucial features of the propositions but has little independent value when attempts are made to detach it form the items it is used to describe. For Horwich, truth is essentially a brute aspect of the world.Much of this book is a fairly technical discussion of a number of challenges to the minimalist account and associated issues. Written for others in the field of epistemology, a good knowledge of the prior literature and formal logic is really needed to follow all the argument. Horwich is a good enough writer, however, that his text gives a good idea of his arguments.As Horwich points out, this view has considerable implications for many areas of philosophy."},{"Title":"Composition: Models and Exercises 7","review":"Part of the California State Series, with orange fire and dusky pink covers.

It is a book well worth reading...but it is also missing something.I found Perpetua's Passion to be very well written and apparently well researched. Joyce E. Salisbury adeptly explores and explains the Roman and Carthaginian culture that Perpetua lived in. Mrs. Salisbury also seamlessly weaves into this tapestry a compelling picture of the Christian Church during the time of these events.The book is based off of the diary that Perpetua kept during her captivity. Mrs. Salisbury explains the significance of Perpetua's actions in light of the culture of her day. She then shows the influence of Perpetua's story on the later Church.All of this is very commendable. I was most impressed by the scholarship and insight of this book. Yet a question forms within me when I contemplate this book:So what? Where is the heart in this book? There is nothing in this book which says anything about how these events speak to the soul of people today. Maybe I missed it...What happened to Perpetua was more than a clinical historical event that affected the people immediately around her and eventually helped form certain patterns of thought within the Church. It was much more. It was a mortal being making an eternal statement. It was a moment in time where the Christian truth that there is more than this life was given a full embodiment in the actions of a young woman--A young woman who had every reason to live, yet for her, to die was gain. It was a moment of ultimate surrender, and at the same time, one of ultimate victory. The blood of the Martyrs is the seed of the Church!In the end, in spite of my objection, I recommend this book. It is insightful and instructive. However, don't just read this book with your head. Approach this one with your heart and your soul."},{"Title":"Perpetua's Passion: The Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman","review":"A scholarly look at the prison diary of St.Perpetua who was thrown to the beasts and finally killed with a sword for her faith.The author gives both Christian,Carthage and Roman background of the times and lets the martyr speak for herself."},{"Title":"Perpetua's Passion: The Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman","review":"In Perpetua's Passion, Salisbury has served two different communities very well---those interested in early Christianity, and those interested in the history of women. She deftly creates a sociology of life in a group of early Christian martyrs, and does so in a way that makes very clear family relations, gender roles, and the strength of Vibia Perpetua herself. I have used this book when teaching a course on ancient &amp; medieval women (and will do so again), and found that it worked very well. Students found it readable and useful and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Perpetua's Passion: The Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman","review":"I found 'Perpetua's Passion really interesting, getting an interesting picture of Roman Society and attitudes. I finished the book wondering if the author, had some type of axe to grind in this society. I thought she tried to dismiss any notion that Pepetua and the other martyrs might have been truly holy or had any divine access to God. She was always giving another reason for what happened as though nothing spiritual was taking place."},{"Title":"Perpetua's Passion: The Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman","review":"Though this book is, on the whole, a useful one, it doesn't take a glimpse at the author's bio to quickly realize she is no classicist. How else can one explain two elementary errors back-to-back which, even to this amateur Roman historian, are as prominent as two sore thumbs?On page 36 (Chapter 2, &quot;The City&quot; subsection) the author asserts Polybius &quot;wrote circa 200 B.C.&quot; Why? Because those who claim he was BORN at that time are only making &quot;scholarly estimates&quot; (according to my &quot;Polybius on Roman Imperialism&quot;)? Or because Salisbury breezily, and in this case incorrectly, assumed that Polybius was a contemporary of the events he most famously chronicled (an assumption that fails to hold for most Roman historical sources; cf. Suetonius, Tacitus)?Similarly, a mere three paragraphs down, Salisbury claims Hannibal &quot;crossed the Alps with his elephants and succeeded in laying siege to the city of Rome itself.&quot; I'd be prompted to ask &quot;Why?&quot; again if in this case the real reason weren't so blatant: Salisbury fliply read a history of the 2nd Punic War and just assumed that at the high-tide of his success Hannibal must have laid siege &quot;to the city of Rome itself&quot;. This assertion is no more true than the Polybius one. In &quot;Warfare in Antiquity&quot; by Hans Delbruck (just one source where this can be found), the author states that Hannibal was so aware of his deficiencies in manpower and siege equipment that he knew &quot;despite the greatest victories, he would not be capable of besieging and capturing Rome itself&quot; (Chapter II).I may seem to nitpick, but the errors I cited above are fundamental and have no place in a scholarly work, even if they are somewhat tangential to the book's main topic.

He became a reverend, but left the church when his research into Christianity revealed the conventional story of Christian origins as taught by all Christian churches was untenable.In 1824 Taylor moved to London and founded the Christian Evidence Society. The society published a brief manifesto stating their four grand propositions: \\"1) That the scriptures of the New Testament, were not written by the persons whose names they bear. 2) That they did not appear in the times to which they refer. 3) That the persons, of whom they treat, never existed. 4) That the events which they relate, never happened.\\"In 1828 Robert Taylor was sentenced to Oakham Gaol (jail) for one year for blasphemy and for \\"a conspiracy to overthrow the Christian Religion.\\" In Oakham Gaol Taylor wrote his SYNTAGMA, being a vindication of his manifesto wherein he presents all the evidence supporting his four grand propositions, and wherein he replies to the myriad of attacks by the Rev. Dr. John Pye Smith. The book is eloquently written, and the information it contains is as relevant today as it was two centuries ago.After writing SYNTAGMA, Taylor went on to write \\"The DIEGESIS; Being A Discovery of the Origin, Evidences, and Early History of Christianity, Never Yet Before or Elsewhere So Fully and Faithfully Set Forth.\\" This masterpiece of Comparative Religion was so far ahead of its time that it's still a useful reference today. It's an historical showing that the Christian religion did not originate according to the narrative of the gospels, but was more ancient. It's a wonderful read, eloquently written, containing vast amounts of scholarly research. I highly recommend it.Upon release from Oakham Gaol Taylor secured a location and began preaching sermons every Sunday explaining the astronomical foundation of numerous stories in the Bible. These 48 eloquent sermons are preserved in the two volume set THE DEVIL'S PULPIT (Volume 1 is available from Amazon.

Can not ask for more than that."},{"Title":"Megatrends - Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives","review":"This book clearly deserves more than five stars for its power and effectiveness in identifying, explaining, and projecting many important trends in American society over the last 18 years.I first read this book when it was published in 1982, and decided to reread it recently to understand more about the methods used by testing them with 20-20 hindsight.The book built from the principle that the &quot;most reliable way to anticipate the future is by understanding the present.&quot; Although the book relies a lot on that method (by examining current beginnings that could turn into mighty rivers), its real power comes from the long-term perspective of how an information society will be different from the prior industrial one.The trends identified were:(1) Becoming an information society after having been an industrial one(2) From technology being forced into use, to technology being pulled into use where it is appealing to people(3) From a predominantly national economy to one in the global marketplace(4) From short term to long term perspectives(5) From centralization to decentralization(6) From getting help through institutions like government to self-help(7) From representative to participative democracy(8) From hierarchies to networking(9) From a northeastern bias to a southwestern one(10) From seeing things as &quot;either/or&quot; to having more choices.The detail behind each of the trends is often more rewarding than the overall trend itself. You get specific examples that excite your imagination. &quot;On the producer side [of multiple choices], it means there can be a market for just about anything.&quot;Even if you read this book back in the 1980s, I suggest that you take another look at it now to reinforce your understanding of the fundamental trends that will continue to be important for decades to come. That's because &quot;we are living in the time of parenthesis, the time between eras.&quot; &quot;We are clinging to the known past in fear of the unknown future.&quot; &quot;The computer will smash the pyramid [at the center of how everything is organized].&quot;After you have finished considering or reconsidering this book, I suggest that you think about where your life may be out of alignment with these trends.

He helps one to see the big picture both chronologically and globally. Take for example his opening observation that &quot;While America's new information economy is our most important megatrend, it is only part of the puzzle.&quot; He logically argues that &quot;collectively what is going on locally is what is going on in America.&quot; The five bellwether states, which set the trends for the rest of the couutry are idenified as; California, Florida, Washington, Colorado, and Connecticut.A strong case is made in the second chapter for &quot;high touch&quot; (i.e., human involvement) to remain a vital component of the high tech age.In the third chapter, the global economy is described. The airplane and satellite communication are identified as the technologies that caused the transition from a national to a global economy.Although an international, global economy exists, surprisingly at the same time decentralization is occurring. He explains in chapter 5 why.In the following chapter he similarly explains how people are becoming increasinly proactive in their individual futures, and not rely on institutional help.The proactive theme is carried a step further in chapter seven.Chapter 8 discusses the phenomenon of networking.Right up to the end of his book, he makes a solid case for the trends he describes. This is a well-written book, researched so that its essential theme remains accurate although a lot has changed since it originally was published."},{"Title":"Megatrends - Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives","review":"This book was published in 1982. It stresses the motion from national to global economy, from either/ or kinds of choice to multiplicity of choices, from an industrial to an information society, from Technology dictating to us to our demanding what we want from it. These trends do seem to have played a part in the last quarter century.But if I think back upon the past twenty- five years it seems to me that they are very far indeed from 'covering it all'. Consider the fantastic development of the Internet which has totally transformed the way we learn about the world. True, the book talks about moving towards an Information society but this Daniel Bell and other sociologists made clear many years before-and no one , as I understand it, conceived how the Internet has developed.Consider other developments of this time, including the political ones, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rise of the US as single superpower, and then the Terror of 9/11 and the coming into being of a Fundamental Radical Islam that threatens Western society as a whole. Others foresaw in the eighties a return to religion , but I don't think anyone could have imagined anything as disastrous as this worldwide terror campaign against the West.I could go on. I do not want to fault the book which makes valuable points. I just believe it presents only a very small part of the picture, and the trends which have been most consequential over the past quarter century."},{"Title":"Megatrends - Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives","review":"I was in college when this book came out. Having come from a part of the country that was heavily manufacturing-based, I was seriously interested when I heard a group of students and profs talking about how this book stated that manufacturing was going to be a thing of the past in the US and that the economy would become service-based.I was even more surprised when the group came to the conclusion that this was a good thing because service-based jobs are cleaner and more admirable than manufacturing jobs. They decided that the sooner the messy factory jobs could be shipped out of the country, the stronger our economy and nation would be.Later, many of these people grew up to be the business leaders of the 80s, 90s and today. They along with many others who fell for the predictions made by Naisbitt, converted U.S. business to a global economy, forced manufacturing jobs away from trained American workers, caused a myriad of crashes in Eastern local economies and congradulated themselves on a job well-done. Afterall, they maintain high company profits with little effort by exploiting desperate workers in Third World places. Who cared about what was happening under the surface in American businesses...the leaders were getting big bucks to be ahead of the trends and to screw American workers out of decent-paying jobs with benefits.I don't think this book predicted the trends as much as it got business leaders to believe in those trends and make them happen. Which is how we have arrived at a time in history where we have lost the idea that GNP should be based on real products and have been deluded by the notion that financial \\"products\\" are better than real products, and that low paying service jobs are better than manufacturing jobs, and big bonuses for employees who watch their companies crash and burn are normal and desirable. Heck, even education and healthcare are unimportant as long as Wall Street is up, right?Now we can't even make the weapons we need to defend our country. We have outsourced our guns, bombs, planes, vehicles and other defense needs. If those countries choose to withhold those items, will we even be able to defend ourselves? Isn't it possible that those countries could use the threat of withholding defense equipment to force us to do things that aren't in the best interest of the American people?Maybe this book just gave greedy people an excuse to indulge their own greediness. Maybe it was the impetus to improve conditions in economically disadvantaged areas overseas. Maybe if I had never heard so many business leaders talk about how they had to be ahead of the curve on Naisbitt's predictions about a global economy, I would feel this book is more of a prediction and less of a driving force.For instance, I love Future Shock. I think it's spot on with its thesis that the world is changing at an increasingly accelerating pace and that those who refuse to change will be unable to function in the present and the future. I just don't think it drove those changes to the point that Megatrends did.There's a fine line between identifying trends and making bad things happen because of them, I guess. I think if American business leaders had been more worried about keeping American productive and less worried about being behind the trends, the US would be in a different situation right now."},{"Title":"Megatrends - Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives","review":"The central point I recall in this book, which I do not see reflected in my quick scan of these reviews, is that the megatrends cited are DIALECTECAL forces, NOT trends from one direction to another. For example, AS globalization increases and intensifies, SO DOES localization. AS high tech gains ascendency, SO DOES \\"high touch.\\" The author(s) did not advocate any particular outcome, to the best of my memory; he/they pointed out dynamic tendencies to become aware of and to attend to.In that light, such \\"predictions\\" as are implicit in the megatrends cited do seem often to have played out: The attacks of 9/11 can arguably be seen as a highly localized action in response to the trend of globalization, as well as to the leading role played therein by US political, economic, and business interests and the resulting domestic and international policies. The existence of highly-effective, decentralized networks, such as Al Quaeda, enabling highly localized action in support of a major global trend and disperse organization (i.e., the global spread of fundamentalist Islam) can be seen in some ways as a synthesis of the dichotomous, simultaneous forces of globalization and localization.Likewise, as technological development accelerates and permeates human cultures, the value of individually hand-crafted items rises. The interest in owning hand-made items, and in making things with one's own hands, increases in parallel. As one indicator of this trend playing out, consider the proliferation of magazines and in-person gatherings on these two groups of subjects. Consider also the increasing interest in antique and alternative processes of photographic printing, developing alongside the proliferation of digital cameras; and the apparently accelerating trend of custom-built and \\"modded\\" computers--an example of getting very high-touch with high-tech devices. (William Gibson--in _Idoru_, I think it was--took this last notion to an extreme, positing a company called Sandbenders, one of whose very high-end, custom-fabricated computers consisted of a completely flexible leather bag, ornamented with a turquoise-and-coral clasp.)Finally, the rapidly emerging interest in 3D printing and personal manufacturing can usefully be considered as a synthesis of THREE megatrends: the global/local, high-tech/high-touch, and manufacturing/information dichotomies (as well as a twist on Alvin Toffler's prediction of the rise of the \\"prosumer,\\" and [quite curiously] on Karl Marx's prediction that the workers would eventually own the means of production).All in all, my memory of this book is that it describes waves to be surfed, not which shore to head for. The author(s) can hardly be held responsible for advocacy, and far less so for driving the changes occurring in the intervening years.Having now read some of these reviews, and written this one based on long-ago memory, I plan to re-read _Megatrends_, myself, and re-evaluate its insights and implications. I strongly recommend your doing so, as well, if you have an interest in thriving through the changes facing us all.Other futurist authors very worthy of your consideration: Alvin Toffler; F.M.

I think the author made a great effort (and did lots of research) to discover the 10 trends. The factual basis of the book is great (though in some chapters you might want to skim the many statistics given), but when the author inserts (mostly implicitly) his opinions, it leaves something to be desired. Most of the trends are not all that long term--if they were, they'd have to account for the cyclic nature of human endeavors which is only slightly mentioned in the book. Still, it's an interesting read even today--decades after its publication."},{"Title":"Megatrends - Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives","review":"Someone put this old book out on their stoop for someone to take and I thought it would be interesting to see how wrong this prognosticator would be, just like they all are.

This revelation helped me to understand the illusion of big business and politics. The reality is small businesses produce more money, jobs, and innovation. Likewise, state governments have more power to solve social problems, more independence from federal powers, and more autonomy to create distinction and enact laws. The federal system has become somewhat obsolete. Centralized structures are crumbling: politics, business, and culture. Look at what is happening: Cultures are returning to tribes, local religious organization are the largest sources of charity and welfare; people are supporting state and local governments as representative's individual interest; more individuals support the rise of voluntarism; and cultures are expressing distinction by geographically difference. Look at the deception of the media spin leading us to believe that Federal spending is unlimited, national energy policies are all encompassing, and war is necessary. The truth is decentralized energy systems are the new hot technology, federal spending is causing big businesses to hold $900 billion in reserve with apprehension, the imposition of force tax by the Iraq war was unwanted and Iraq has returned no longer term benefit in oil supplies. A war with Iran is unlikely because the US can not afford an oil resource war with Iran and Iran has no capability to fight a superpower nation.The national welfare state has failed. Social Security will be depleted by 2018 and begin borrow money from the treasury to make payments, the liquidity trap that banks are now falling into in Europe. 20 million people unemployment have depleted state funds dry, raised foreclosure rates, and burden local religious groups for charitable aid. The National Health care system has been sued by many state governments as illegal. States governments are stronger. They are challenge federal land management of state assets. The return to \\"Great Depression Economics\\" is a centralizing event where citizens look to the federal government for jobs, welfare aid, and debt relief. The federal government seems to be strong because its rhetoric is war and social welfare as national issues, a desperate act.American culture is decentralizing. Americans are spreading from large cities to small cities and rural communities. As people decentralize they diversify. Geography is a way to diversify. The growth of decentralization parallels the decline of industrialization. The American industrial machine was America's greatest centralizing force: labor, material, and capital. Agriculture started the movement towards decentralization. Decentralization is extending everywhere in America. Local medical organizations are getting better as a result of decentralization. Unions are become smaller as decentralization spreads. We have not great captains of industry or great leaders in art, academia, or politics.The number of people voting for the president and congress continues to decline. Congress is becoming an obsolete organization and their growing staff running errands for constituents and special interest groups.States are showing a new assertiveness: a) states are structurally and procedurally stronger b) states have upgraded tax systems and modernized legislatures c) State representatives are more spirited and better qualified d) state leverage their power to levy income and sales tax e) state surplus have decreased as federal aid has decreased f) most states have a balanced budget law g) energy producing states often have large surplus funds h) most governors think the country is too diversified for a centralized government control and states are better able to serve the people i) state right emerge most readily over issues of energy and environment."},{"Title":"Megatrends - Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives","review":"Read this book in 1984 and was not impressed with it back then. Naisbitt failed to convey or foresee the profound effect technology has had on our everyday lives. The impact has been profound and life altering.

Amazingly, Naisbitt is still selling books of prognostication.

Layo as a young apprentice, already has strong skills and a great love for the craft of her mother, pottery. She is quickly coming to the age where she will be betrothed and as tribal custom dictates, she will take on the trade of her husbands' clan. Through her attempt to reject the man who has been chosen as her future husband, Layo learns about family love, tradition, and unity. The writing is clear, although readers have to pay close attention to the names of characters. The characters have the traditional Yoruba names derived from relationships, i.e. \\"Mother of...\\" \\"Wife of ...\\" and \\"Son of...\\" Some of the characters are not as fully developed as they could be, but the story with its romance and mystery is enjoyable and informative. The strength of this book is the descriptive detail of the family structure, deep respect for crafts and crafts people, religious belief, complex system of slavery, and customs and traditions strictly followed by the Yoruba of Africa. This book is a useful addition where historical fiction from Africa is needed, such as the California seventh grade world history curriculum."},{"Title":"The African Mask","review":"The book The African Mask by Janet E. Rupert is an excellent book. It is a very cordial and calm book, but at the same time it is very stimulating and mysterious. The book also talks a lot about the African culture. The African Mask is about a young girl named Layo, who has the wonderful talent of molding beautiful pots with clay. Layo's talent is very prized where she comes from and is forbidden for children like her to know how to make such a beautiful thing. When Layo's grandmother comes to town from Ife, Layo wants to go back to Ife with her, to help her grandmother make pots in Ife. Will she get to go? Read the outstanding book The African Mask and find out.I would recommend this book because the reader can learn a lot about another culture. The African Mask takes place in Africa so the reader will learn about the African culture. Some of the things the learns in the book is how African women spend their every day lives, cooking, molding pots, cleaning, fetching water, and finding a good husband are all talked about in the book. Another reason why I would recommend this book is because the events in the book are very thrilling and exiting. For example, Layo and her friends go to spy on a boy, but they have to be very quiet and try not to get caught, that whole part is very nerve racking and electrifying because the reader is waiting to see if they get caught or not. This book will fill the reader with excitement and suspense when reading about Layo and the adventures she has.One reason why I wouldn't recommend this book is because in the beginning of the book it's pretty hard to get into and hard to keep reading. For example the beginning just talks about Layo doing housework and other chores and that was really boring to read about. Although this one fluke that makes the book a bit harder to get into, once the reader keeps reading they won't want to put it down. This is a thrilling story that gives the reader great information on the African culture."},{"Title":"The African Mask","review":"Layo is a young African girl who has a great talent in pottery. Like her grandmother, she wants to spend her life creating pottery that her people are known for, but the decision is not hers to make. When her parents let her travel to the city to be with her grandmother, she realizes that she is being sent to meet the man who will be chosen as her husband. She now is facing a future in which there is no room for her pottery dream. This story shares in great detail the African culture and history. Young people are able to learn what life was like many hundreds of years ago in Africa. The book expresses the value of being true to one's talents and oneself. It also teaches young people to follow their dreams and to never give up. The African Mask sends a powerful message about life and how our attitudes can make a difference in the direction that our lives move. The book teaches us the importance of believing in oneself and with the right attitude, one will prosper."},{"Title":"The African Mask","review":"The African Mask was a story full with an intricate plot. The plot of the story is magical, casting a spell on the reader to read more and more. However, although the plot maybe magical, the way the author doesn't have describe the characters and just provieds a list of characters in the beginning, so if you don't know a character you can just refer to the list. Also, I think the author's transitioning was really bad. At first I'm reading about a character, then suddenly the character dissapears from the story! However, although the transitioning and details may be lacking, however the plot is magical."},{"Title":"The Swallow's Nest: A Feminine Reading of the Psalms","review":"Have you ever wanted to pray using the Psalms--but found that their language assumes a male reader?Let's face it, from Psalm 1, verse 1 --\\"Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked\\"--they seem to be male-oriented.This book is widely used by thousands of Roman Catholic nuns as well as by laywomen, including evangelicals,more liberal Protestants, and Catholics--any woman of faith who wants to pray the Psalms from the heart and finds it easier to do so in a more feminine context.The author is an ordained Presbyterian pastor who grew up in the Christian Reformed Church, which does not ordain women. She has close ties with Dominican sisters and others.Her version of Psalm 1, verse one, reads, \\"Blessed is the woman who ignores the advice of the wicked....\\" She calls her book \\"A Feminine Reading of the Psalms\\"--not a translation.For each psalm she provides a one-sentence possible context to relate to our lives today. For example, she says for Psalm 141, \\"This might be the prayer of an inner-city girl struggling to resist the pressure to join a gang of drug dealers.\\" With some context, it is easier to respond to a psalm that speaks about enemies or great suffering.Marty Rienstra takes all 150 Psalms and divides up them up to be read 3-4 per day, in a cycle of four weeks per month, to be started again each month. Each day of the week has a theme--Sunday,\\"worshipping God our Savior\\"; Monday, \\"hoping in God our future\\"; Tuesday, \\"seeking God's wisdom\\"; Wednesday, \\"trusting in God our refuge\\"; Thursday \\"crying out to God for justice\\"; Friday, \\"confession and lamentation before God,\\" and Saturday, \\"praising God the Creator.\\"She lays out the psalms for each day in three groups as a morning prayer time, midday prayer time, and evening prayer time. Each has an opening, hymn, suggested reading, short prayer, and benediction along with a psalm or two.She also provides prayers and quotations from great women and men in church history, such as Hildegard of Bingen and Julian of Norwich.I have been praying with this book since it came out in 1992, and I bought one for each of my daughters and many other friends. I know you will like it too..."},{"Title":"The Swallow's Nest: A Feminine Reading of the Psalms","review":"As an expectant mother, I found it very comforting.

Tracking Apollo to the Moon is that book. It not only gives you insight into how those signals travelled across the 240,000 mile vastness of space but an appreciation for the efforts not only of those in the United States but in Australia and other countries as well.

Enjoyable to read and a must have if you are a collector of Apollo/Gemini/Mercury literature.For fun, although not tied to this book, get the movie, \\"The Dish\\"."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"This edition reprints astronaut quotations in purplish color throughout. It is a weird choice, since the only other books I know of that do that are Bibles with the words of Christ highlighted in red letters. The color is hard to read. Aside from that, this book is about what you'd expect. It was written by an Australian, and so everything is slightly skewed toward the Australian involvement, which seems unimportant in the grand scheme of things if you ask me. I loved the movie The Dish about the Australian tracking station, but I can't seem to stir up any more interest in the subject. At least the film was comical and quite aware of its peripheral status--the book has no such perspective. See the movie The Dish and buy another book--either Chaiken's or the new one by Reynolds."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"I've been researching and writing about spaceflight history since the early 1960's and have amassed a library on the subject of several hundred books. I do not know Hamish Lindsay personally, so I can be objective in my review, but when I was told about a book he'd written as someone involved in tracking the Apollo flights from Australia I thought it might have been interesting but probably overly technical. The reality is that this is a brilliant book, and both the author and publishers have combined to bring us one of the best and most vividly illustrated stories ever of the space era I grew up in. The text is divided into engrossing vignettes detailing all of the manned spaceflights as well as many of the more spectacular robotic missions, and Hamish is an extraordinarily good story-teller. The fact that it is told from an Australian viewpoint is refreshingly novel, but this should not deter overseas readers - rather, it will intrigue them. I found many excellent stories and quotes new to me in the text, and it is certainly an exciting new reference book that I will refer to often. Many Apollo-era astronauts have contributed their memories to the book, and the glowing introduction by Chris Kraft is essential reading before embarking on the text. It is obvious that Hamish sought to use many photos never seen before in his book (quite a number in brilliant colour), and these are used to wonderful effect. On first reading I could only find three very minor errors, and one of these is a typo, so there has certainly been some meticulous research,writing, and editorial work done before publication. In essence, I am truly overwhelmed by the work and love that has gone into this book, and both the author and publishers deserve credit for a truly magnificent job. It will become a classic among space books."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"Hamish Lindsay has accomplished what few other manned space program writers have; he has captured the excitement of the Apollo Program from the viewpoint of a participant, has led into it with an historical perspective of man's quest for the stars, and has sprinkled it with historical data, photographs and cartoons which results in an outstanding record of not only what happened during Apollo, but why.I believe this book will be for future generations THE authorative record of one of mankind's greatest achievements."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"I had the privilege of meeting Hamish today at a book signing, and though I know a fair bit about space exploration, and I've read just about every book on the US and Soviet space projects, today I felt closer than ever before to the men who made this great adventure possible. Hamish, in a few words, made clear to me the incredible difficulties of controlling spacecraft and retrieving information from a vast distance. The environment is absolutely unforgiving and there are no second chances. The planning and the execution have to be perfect.The book itself is astounding. It is far more image-rich than any of the recent memoirs and histories, with photographs, maps, diagrams, cartoons, paintings on every page, rather than a few black and white shots grouped in the middle. The images themselves are chosen with care and matched to the text - I was impressed with two of the earliest photographs of the Lunar Module, almost lost against the immensity of the lunar landscape, a reminder of just how fragile and precious was this little bubble of Earth.Sometimes it seems as if I've read the same story of Apollo many times over from slightly different viewpoints, with just a few little nuggets of &quot;newness&quot; to savour. With this book, Hamish has given us a whole new perspective on the adventure, and I've got to say that he has also given this reader a feeling of excitement and enthusiasm that is hard to gain from the more buttoned-down writings of the US astronauts, flight controllers and engineers.It might be a cliche, but this book puts you there. You are with the astronauts as they gaze up at that black sky stretching on forever, floating in space between Earth and Moon on a spacewalk, with the controllers at moments of extreme tension, and sitting beside the communications specialists as they juggle radio frequencies to retrieve faint radio signals from unimaginable distances.Forget science fiction, forget Apollo 13, forget The Dish. This is the real thing, told with a real sense of wonder by someone who knows his stuff and wants to share his feelings, his knowledge with you. If you care about space travel, about the greatest adventure of all time, this book belongs on your bookshelf, on your bedside table, in your hands. It's a thriller."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"This book is both a superb introduction to the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo/Skylab programs and a valuable addition to the collection of any space enthusiast. It contains a few errors, but none of any consequence.Lindsay's discussion of such episodes as the Gemini VIII emergency, the Apollo 11 launch, and the Apollo 13 accident are among the best I have ever read. Importantly, the book tells the story from the perspective of the Australians who built and operated the various tracking/communications stations that supported the missions. Their stories help us understand the dedication and resourcefulness of the people, worldwide, who made the moon landings possible. Hamish Lindsay was one of those people and, in part, the joy of his book is the feeling one gets for how justifiably proud the Apollo veterans are of their contributions."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"This book would be a great introduction for anyone who hasn't read any previous biographies/details of the Apollo or NASA histories. However for those who have, the book may turn out to be a real disappointment. I'm Australian and was looking forward to a detailed Aussie perspective on the spaceflight industry, but this seems to me to be too brief. Only glimpses are shown of the development of Honeysuckle Creek/Carnarvon tracking stations etc, which may please international readers but not this Aussie!The book seems to be trying to gain an international audience by overviewing the entire NASA spaceflight chronology, but after a few chapters some of the quotes and phraseology started to appear disturbingly familiar. Why do I get the impression the author has read every other book on the subject and just cut and pasted from each of them? The reference to Al Shepard as 'Smiling Al'/'Icy Commander' will be VERY familiar to some, and is only one example of a number of apparent ... which start to annoy after a while and eventually to the point where I gave up reading. (And why the strange purple print?)There are also some inaccuracies in the text which point to the author not having done original research, but these are not major, only adding to my irritation.It's not really revelatory except in some brief instances, and won't contain much you haven't read before if you are a space buff. The book is rather shallow and as a previous reviewer found, does not take a definite perspective, which I found a big letdown. I felt it tried too hard to be all things to everyone, and would have been better to have concentrated on a particular aspect such as the birth of the Australian spaceflight industry with an analysis of the attendant federal/state politicking and development of local spaceflight industry, and appealed to a niche market instead of trying to capitalise on the mainstream space market.However a good read if you are starting out in spaceflight history, and there are some very nice colour plates."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"I was looking forward to this one and was somewhat disappointed. It's a straightforward telling of the history of manned space flight, exceeding Chaikin's From the Earth to the Moon in only a few respects, specifically the coverage of Skylab and in its behind-the-scenes addressing of the ground system and tracking station issues associated with each mission.There are some unnerving inaccuracies, though, the most glaring of which is misquoting some of Grissom's last words before the Apollo 1 fire. (He said, &quot;How can we get a man to the moon when we can't even talk between two buildings?&quot; not &quot;How do you expect to get us to the Moon if you people can't even hook us up with a ground station?&quot; As always, the glitches seem minor but reduce confidence in everything else.On the other hand, the book is copiously illustrated with diagrams and color pictures, which are interspersed with the text rather than, as is usually the case, confined to their own separate section.I was also pleased to see quotes from two of my former coworkers at Goddard, Bob Stanley and Robert Burns, in a section talking about setting up the tracking stations for Apollo, an effort they were closely involved with."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"The title of this book is somewhat misleading leading the reader to believe that is it only about the Apollo tracking program. Instead it is a brilliant history of the manned space program from 1957 until 1975 as well as the author's experiences working for one of the Australian tracking stations used by NASA for their manned space flights. The author has used his own inside knowledge as well as that of his colleagues and the books on Apollo that have profilated in later years. Many of the pictures have not been seen before which is unusual as the same old pictures are used in every book. I recommend this book to any space buff and to anyone who wants to learn about an era that will never happen again."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"This is a fantastic history of the American space program up to the end of the ASTP program, with some coverage of important Soviet missions/developments during the time period. It covers all the missions in detail and has heaps of photos. Despite the title, the tracking material is less than five percent of the book but it is very interesting because it is one area that is not covered in other histories. The author uses lots of quotes from astronauts, and others, making you feel as if you are really there. All in all, this is the best overall history of the early space program on the market; quite an achievement considering all the other books out there."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"A beautifully written and very readable story of the time that the whole world looked up, and some of the men and women in a country town in Western Australia who made it happen."},{"Title":"Tracking Apollo to the Moon","review":"\\"Tracking Apollo to the Moon\\" arrived today.

Now we use the Five Steps all the time, and other moms are amazed to see how it almost eliminates power struggles. This is an excellent counterpoint to people like James Dobson who believe that refusal to obey immediately in a toddler should be answered with spanking. There is another way, and while Grace Based Discipline is gentle and non-punitive, it is also very effective and not at all permissive.

Who does that? She's a mom and has a degree (MA Theological Studies), so no need to go any further than that. Second, she does make some good points and dates herself with the issues she brings up as supporting evidence for her opinions, but overall, the exegesis used is weak and skewed. Her arguments are flawed and need much improvement. Her tools for dealing with children are helpful and are the positive point of the book.I appreciate the female voice in the Biblical Parenting arena and I hope that more will come forward, but hopefully none with an agenda that was all too clearly feminist (more balance and sticking to the topic instead of getting side tracked by the mainly male voices that speak out on parenting). Use a modern, more scholarly, translation of the Bible and come to your exegesis with a preset agenda, but allow the Bible to speak to you without forcing it to say what you want it to say (anyone can make their viewpoint &#34;biblical&#34; if they try hard enough!)."},{"Title":"Biblical Parenting","review":"I have read this book cover to cover three seperate times and while I find it quite an intersting approach to parenting, I find some of the advice given to be contrary to Biblical fact.I do not think that by applying these techniqes and principles one can effectively discipline children.

There is a middle ground, it is scriptural.

As it was, we struggled like most young parents and kept receiving conflicting guidance depending on who we spoke with.The Bible is very clear when it instructs women to teach women regarding loving their husbands and children, and even though there are many practical and valuable lessons to be learned from Proverbs...it is important to keep things in perspective as to who is instructing and who is receiving instruction. Without the clarification provided by Pastor Lutton concerning &quot;The Rod&quot; and other seemingly punitive verses it would be easy to use the wrong methods in child raising, much to your sorrow.This book should be in every home where children (or grandchildren) are being raised.

I need to get off my butt and parent my child, and Pastor Lutton gives many tools to help me address various situations, and more importantly, to help my child succeed. Repeatedly saying 'no, no' with no follow up action is permissive parenting. Repeatedly spanking or punishing for every infraction is lazy parenting. Getting up and redirecting my child is not -- it is proactive parenting.

Spence comes off as a weak-willed, essentially selfish man who never apologized to his wife for his infidelity, never truly tried to take responsibility and make amends, and spent much of the book aloof and irritable (supposedly because of his great guilt). Jackie was never sympathetic and the close relationship was one of her taking and Maggie giving--and Jackie then took some more by sleeping with her brother-in-law and bearing a son. The ending consisted of Jackie having her son, denying that son his father and the father the choice of claiming his son, Jackie acquiring a great new husband, and Maggie having to suck it up and forgive everyone. In the end, the adult characters agree to lie to all three children by concealing the baby boy's father. So, the two girls never get their brother, the father doesn't get his son, Maggie will continue having to suffer, and Jackie is the big winner--she's forgiven, gets the baby she's wanted for years, and a physician as a husband! Very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Day By Day (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"Every now and again I read a book whose characters make my skin crawl. Such is the case with the characters of Spence and Jackie in this particular book by Sandra Steffan. I loved Maggie and her two daughters and I enjoyed the developing story about her recovery following the devastating auto accident and the resulting coma. However, while Ms. Steffan tried her best to make Spence and Jackie sympathetic characters and while she stressed how much the two of them loved Maggie and how they betrayed her just because they were so unhappy (awwww), I could just imagine that if these were real characters the two of them would be on the Jerry Springer Show whining about how they didn't mean to hurt Maggie and how their sexual encounter \\"just happened.\\" The reason for their encounter was that they both thought Maggie was near death and would probably die the next day when she was removed from life support. I had always thought the expression that a man or woman was with someone else before the spouse's \\"body was cold\\" was just an expression. How confusing it must have been for them when Maggie didn't die.The excuse that Spence was asleep and was dreaming so he thought Jackie was Maggie was not very credible because he and Jackie were talking about Maggie just before their encounter. Also, when Jackie told Maggie that Spence was dreaming, she never did answer when Maggie asked her, \\"And what about you? Were you dreaming too?\\" I believe that if I returned from a hospital after being told that my husband would be removed from life support the next day, I would not be doing any strange things in my sleep that night because I don't believe I would be doing much sleeping.To add insult to injury, Ms. Steffan decided Jackie would get pregnant as a result of her brief encounter with her sister's husband and when she gives birth, the child is the son he has always wanted. Family events in that household must be a riot as Maggie constantly has her nose rubbed in her husband's infidelity every time she sees the \\"nephew\\" who is also her husband's son. I couldn't quite grasp why everyone's future unhappiness should be Maggie's fault if she couldn't forgive her husband and her sister. Surely, that responsibility rested with the two who cheated. When Maggie couldn't bring herself to sleep with Ivan in retaliation, I was hoping she would at least make Spence think she had done so.While Ms. Steffan was apparently trying to show how much Jackie loved her sister, when Jackie thought of Maggie as \\"Saint Maggie\\" it seemed to me that showed the contempt and derision she actually felt toward Maggie. I keep almost every book I purchase but I did not enjoy reading about a man who would cheat on his wife with his wife's sister and I did not enjoy reading about a woman who would sleep with her sister's husband. This is one book I will not be keeping."},{"Title":"Day By Day (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"Five StarsEdgy, thought-provoking.

Spence and Jackie did do the deed but it truly wasn't an affair. Maybe a one night stand but possibly not even that. It was two people reaching out in their shared grief. Something that only people who have experienced can truly understand. It's almost a reaffirmation of sharing the joy of bring alive!No he didn't apologize. He did try to though. But sometimes apologizing really isn't enough. I felt that both Spence and Jackie had to live with their hidden sin and guilt for so long until it was brought to light in all of it's ugly glory.Maggie wouldn't have been able to accept a hastily worded apology. She needed to work through a lot of things to get to forgiveness. That is a daily chore, forgiveness. It's not easy and I'm sorry is NEVER enough.I found some of the lines early on in the story very telling. How Maggie tells Spence that only someone she truly loves can hurt her or not wanting to waste so much energy to hurt someone that she loved. That was why it hurt so much and that is why she was divided in her feelings. If it had been anyone else I believe it would have been different. But since it was two of the people she loved best it hurt so much more and was harder to deal with."},{"Title":"Day By Day (Zebra Contemporary Romance)","review":"Sandra Steffen has become a recent favorite author.

This is one of the more notable ones, if rather obscure.&quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane&quot; has been out of print for a long time, and the movie it was later made into, &quot;The Ninth Configuration,&quot; while celebrated, is decidedly in the cult category. But the recent release of a &quot;Ninth Configuration&quot; DVD seems to have stirred up a little more excitement, judging from the reaction it is getting on this website, and maybe more people will be moved, as I was, to special order the novel it all sprang from.Whether or not it's worth it is another question. &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; is my all-time favorite film, and even I had a tough time reading &quot;Twinkle.&quot; Not because it's not good, or packed with the same philosophically probing, gut-wrenchingly hilarious dialogue that makes the film so special. But it's a choppy narrative, lacking the sense of mood and character that enriches the movie. I've only read one other William Peter Blatty book, &quot;Demons Five, Exorcists Nothing,&quot; which was terrible, so maybe he's the rare storyteller who works better on screen than on the page. But I'd rather view this as an interesting rough draft of the project that would become a true classic in its film version.&quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane,&quot; published in 1966, may be one of the first novels to ever explore the theme of madness in the time of the Vietnam War. Blatty doesn't make the connection until the novel is more than half over, and it's not one he leans on too strongly (he would in the movie), but he certainly was onto something there, and should get points for that alone.Otherwise, the book works for me mostly in the form of showing the many paths Blatty's imagination was taking as he thought through the story. There are some striking variations in the story we have here versus what we see in &quot;The Ninth Configuration.&quot; The central character, Col. Kane, is more active and vocal a presence in the book, and you really can appreciate what Blatty (and actor Stacy Keach) did with the character onscreen to make him more of an enigma. Same with Dr. Fell, who was played so well by Ed Flanders in the film, but is bland and off-putting in the novel. He has little to do with Kane in the book, and would be improved upon vastly on film.The dialogue is loopier at times, and not always in a good way, but there are some recognizable passages for fans of the movie.&quot;If God exists, he is a fink.&quot;&quot;A fink?&quot;&quot;Or a foot. An omnipresent, omnipotent Foot! Do you think that is blasphemous?&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Kane. &quot;I do.&quot;&quot;I believe I capitalized the 'F'.&quot;That one got me laughing out loud, as did some other lines rewritten or excised in the film.The concerns of the book, as with the film, is the existence or non-existence of God and the problem of evil in the world. There are some odd detours, though. The old house being used by the military to house lunatic veterans once belonged to a Bela Legosi-type movie actor, not the aristocrat mentioned in the movie, and there's a subplot involving the actor's legacy in a secret part of the estate. There's also some business involving a cost-conscious senator which seems to belong in a New Yorker cartoon. More to the point of the story that survives in &quot;The Ninth Configuration,&quot; some of the asylum patients seem to have swapped identities.I liked reading this book, and recommend it to others who love the film, even though they may find it as inchoate and choked with bad comic rimshots as I did. Blatty uses adverbs too much, and words like &quot;scruted,&quot; but his gift for witty dialogue is evident. There are also sections where he works in some ideas left out of the movie which I found rather moving, and deepened my appreciation for what he was after.&quot;We're all miscast - one way or another,&quot; Kane says at one point. &quot;Being born into this world: that's the ultimate miscasting.&quot;This is a bit of a miscasting job, too, since it only came alive in screen form, but because it gave life to a great movie, I have to feel some gratitude. Life can be a brutal voyage, but having fellow passengers like Mr. Blatty makes for a more endurable ride."},{"Title":"Twinkle, twinkle, \\"Killer\\" Kane!","review":"Your review gives the impression that \\"Twinkle, Twinkle Killer Kane\\" was written after \\"The Exorcist\\", which is not the case. \\"Twinkle\\" was published in 1966, and \\"The Exorcist\\" in 1971.

In between the tales from each successive time period in history is enlightening commentary, usually an historical overview of the period written by the editor. These commentaries help give a unity to this work. But this is not simply a bad guys vs. good guys book. Nabokov's stories reflect the complexity involved among Native Americans who frequently disagreed with each other about what would be the best path to trod for all concerned; and they also tell the stories of proud peoples who continued to survive and carry on.

What sets this book above the rest, however, is that it doesn't just cover the time periods that are shown in most Native American histories, which would either be ancient pre-European times, or the famous era of the Indians' destruction and valiant efforts to maintain the old ways of life. This book also covers those areas, as it should, but continues into the modern reservation days, and even captures the thoughts of recent activists on the future of Native Americans.

While Peter Singer's ANIMAL LIBERATION first awoke my consciousness to the tragedy of the manner in which humans have regarded and treated animals, I found the philosophical underpinnings of his work (a form of utilitarianism) troublesome (for reasons I won't go into here). On the other hand, I found Tom Regan's THE CASE FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS, to be far too Kantian. Midgley discusses a wide-ranging group of philosophers, but doesn't overly attach herself to any particular moral philosophy. As a result, she is less doctrinaire than any of the other major writers on the topic. The book reeks of common sense, in the way that the English so often seem to have mastered. Just a wonderful, unjustly neglected book."},{"Title":"Animals and Why They Matter","review":"Mary Midgley examines the general principles that ought to guide our attitude to animals. Midgley quotes a large number of philosophers who in the past have philosophized about animals. Some of them have considered the question of what obligations, if any, we have towards animals. Their answers have depended both on what they take an animal to be and on what they consider to be the cause, the nature and the range of obligations. Descartes, for example, considered that, because animals lacked souls and, more importantly, reasoning faculties, they are mere machines. Even in Descartes' day, such a conclusion must have seemed very odd to anyone who had much to do with animals: for even if one agreed that they did lack souls and reasoning faculties, any farmer or hunter could have told Descartes that relationships with animals are radically different from relationships with machines. But even writers of our own time, while not thinking of animals as machines, still deny them the capacity of thought: R.G.Frey because thought requires language and animals cannot speak; Stuart Hampshire because in the absence of language they cannot have concepts. Yet the simplest observations of how animals communicate with each other and even with humans would seem to suggest that thought, concepts and reasoning do not depend totally on a human language.Behaviourists go even further: we cannot even be sure that animals have feelings. The denial of thought and feelings to animals serve to erect such a strong barrier between the human and the animal species that we can exclude the animal species from the obligations we feel towards our fellow human beings. One of the most striking part of Midgley's book is her demonstration how easily past generations were able to overlook even other humans as belonging to a group towards which they had obligations. Thus the Athenians, who prided themselves on civic equality, and the Americans who proclaimed that all men were created equal, simply assumed that slaves did not count as humans: indeed Aristotle described slaves as being merely \\"living instruments\\". The Chartists demanded universal suffrage for men, but either did not even think of extending that demand to women or, if they did, found some rationalization for excluding them. The excluded groups were, in Midgley's words, consigned to the outer darkness, beyond the outer periphery of a group towards the members of which certain obligations were recognized. In the 20th century, denials of full membership of the group and the discrimination which this entails have been condemned under the name of various kinds of \\"-isms\\": racism for denying membership to other races, sexism for denying it to women, ageism for denying it to the old - and now speciesism for denying it to animals. Midgley's book is a sign that the time has come to widen the periphery of our obligations to include animals.Midgley admits that it is natural to be more concerned with those who are closest to us, and she has a diagram of concentric circles to illustrate that we are concerned most immediately with our family, then with our tribe, then with our nation, then with our species, and only then with non-human species. We often treat appallingly badly and cast into the \\"outer darkness\\" human groups that are outside the smaller circles; but any ethically sensitive person has to condemn such behaviour: charity, as the proverb has it, begins at home, but it ought not to stop there. This is the principle that should also apply when we consider the outer circle of the non-human species.Midgley's tone is always moderate and she never takes up the position of radical or extreme zoophiles who would want us to give to all animals exactly the same rights as we give to humans. She accepts that there must be some priority of considerations and that there can be situations where it is reasonable for us to put the interests of humans before those of animals, though she says that such cases are much fewer than is often supposed. They would include, for example, dealing with locusts and other pests. She does not go into specific details about killing animals for food; but one can deduce from her text that she would accept that Eskimoes cannot be vegetarians and are therefore justified to kill for food, and that she does not condemn pastoral societies who treat their animals well prior to slaughtering them. On the other hand she clearly abhors stuffing geese to produce pat&eacute; de foie gras. She states the general principle that great suffering inflicted on animals on the outer periphery ought to weigh against the minor advantage that this might bring to those within the inner circles.One would like to think that at the end of her examination, Midgley had arrived at positions which most sensitive people would have reached without all that philosophizing, guided merely by their humanity and common sense. Most of them would understand instinctively why animals matter; but unfortunately many people give this understanding such a low priority that as citizens they do not do enough to take on the vested interests and those who are too apathetic to care very much. Perhaps this well-written and wise little book would stir them into action."},{"Title":"Animals and Why They Matter","review":"Robert Moore above says it all, but I just wanted to add that this is one of the best philosophy books I've ever read.

The philosophy of the writer Midgley is very very sharp and although it's common sense in some cases, Midgley has extraordinary common sense.While the French are fruit loops and the Americans dry as dust in philosophy, Midgley operates out of a witty but kind, sharp but not prickly, Britishness, that is too often as Moore put it, unjustly neglected.If you're tired of stupid Deleuze and mindless Foucault, as well as erudite but incomprehensible Peirce, open up Midgley. Midgley, Midgley, Midgley!I've read three of her books in a row, and this one is by far the best. Midgley is right on the money in every sentence throughout this book.Bravura performance without a trace of Deleuzian diva-dom.Somehow she gets you to see that animals aren't that different from us (at least among the social species of animal such as cats and dogs and simians) and she also provides us with a primer of philosophers on animal and women's rights in tight little nuggets that are highly condensed and yet insatiably readable. This is the book for anyone interested in teaching a course on animal rights. Nothing else will do."},{"Title":"Animals and Why They Matter","review":"...in the sense that it is a deeply thoughtful meditation on our relationship to animals. Other reviews have said it all.

Its honest and unpretentious approach deserves a wide readership."},{"Title":"Animals and Why They Matter","review":"Animals are living, breathing, feeling, living, loving, soul-filled children of God, just as much as we human animals are.Further, Animals can (and do) speak, only we ignorant human animals are too stupid to take the time to listen.We human animals are legends in our own minds.Animals deserve the same love, respect, compassion, and consideration that we afford to anyone else.Animals have souls....... eternal souls.To think otherwise is to be ignorant, arrogant, speciesist and one other thing: Wrong.I highly recommend the book \\"The Souls of Animals\\".It is much better than this book, and the author is much more enlightened than this one is, with all due respect.Adopt a Cat or a Dog at your local shelter, bond with your new best friend,...... watch, listen and learn from them, and find out what true love and true evolution is all about.\\"Man has alot to learn from the higher Animals\\"-Mark Twain"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"The Third VictimThe story line, the tragedy, is compelling. A shooting at a school for K-8. That upset me because it is such a horrific crime. So, personally, I didn't like this tale from the beginning because it made me uncomfortable. Ms. Gardner does a good job of weaving a story. However, there are some obvious clues early on as to what really happened and who is responsible for the crime.A small town is ripped apart by the shooting. The police force is small and inexperienced. County and State cops and an FBI profiler are brought in. Only two of these characters are explored, which is okay because the book is so busy and long already.State cop, Abe Sanders, is an ass. In his mind he is superior. His mind is very narrow, however, and he won't consider any other possibilities once he decides who is responsible for this heinous crime. Like I said, there are obvious clues a smart, trained detective should have picked up on.FBI Profiler Pierce Quincy is a decent character. I look forward to reading more about him in future books from Ms. Gardner. He's flawed, aging, and has baggage. He's also a very stand-up guy.Rainie Conner, the primary cop in this tale, has had a very difficult life. She's coped with a lot of issues and hidden a lot of others. At times I find her irritating because she knows what she should do, repeatedly, and chooses to do the opposite, repeatedly. It wears a little thin--even taking her background into consideration. Her story is not finished either and I'm hopeful she'll become a character who is likeable and does more than hurt the people around her.There were some loose ends left dangling, but all in all, THE THIRD VICTIM is worth reading.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Lisa Gardner does it again. One of the few authors out there that can consistently turn out grab-you-by-the-throat thrillers.In a small town of Oregan, a horrific school shooting takes place, leaving several dead, including a well loved teacher and 2 young girls. When the smoke settles, the mass murderer left holding the smoking gun is 13 year old Danny. Danny is the son of Sheriff O'Grady. Witnesses reported seeing a man dressed in black, roaming the halls of the school shortly before the shooting began. Did Danny have an accomplice? Is he just a pawn in a much larger game? Was it a random act of violence or were the victims hand picked?Ms. Gardner answers these questions and much more in this taut thriller. What I enjoyed the most about this book was there were so many things taking place at the same time. The author keeps the storytelling tight and close to her chest, revealing bits and pieces at a pace that has the reader scrambling to turn the pages in a hope to discover what is truly going on.The only complaint I have is the ending. The author seemed to want to wrap things up and have a great ending, but I felt it didn't make sense. The herione, in the end, is handled in a way that shouldn't have happened. If I explain it in any more detail, I will ruin the story for you, so I will just stop with that. The book is overall a great read and is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I love the way Lisa Garndner writes and her stories, this book was no exception. It is a very fast paced story and a great read."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Miss gardner introduces Rainie Conner, a small town dedicated police woman and Special Agent Quincy in a blockbuster novel.That the subject was so contemporary, a school shooting; made it all the more interesting because it addressed the problems of our world today.The characters are very well portrayed and carry the reader through the full range of emotions. The 'shooter' is a young boy and also the son of one of Rainie's best friends. Or is he innocent?There is no mish-mash of plot here. Everything is laid on the line and straight-forward. And because of this fact, the pace never slackens, but spirals us down avenues from which there is no return.The interplay of Rainie and Quincy is done suberbly and the 'teaser' for Gardner's next novel promises us yet another visit from these two taut and compelling characters.The disaster that hits this small town is beyond comprehension, but we all know too well that school shootings with innocent children being slaughtered along with their teachers is becoming an all-too-common headline.The devastation that turns this peaceful, trusting community into a mass of pain and terror - and the fact that one of their own is responsible propels the reader on a mind-bending, emotionally heart-wrenching journey.You will not regret picking up this novel - but then your problem will be putting it down.There is nothing I do not like about this writer.

Rainie doesn't suspect everything is as it appears to be, and with the help of FBI agent Pierce Quincy, they try to find the truth about the shooting that leaves 3 dead and a town torn apart.I did not want to put this book down.

Her books are UP-ALL-NIGHTERS complete with interesting characters, suspenseful plots, and loads of thrills. If you have not discovered this author yet, do yourself a favor and READ her, she is THAT good!Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Lisa Gardner draws very interesting characters, but there are a lot of holes in her plot. The biggest hole: she doesn't say how the killer, who is obsessed with Rainie Conner, comes by his knowledge of Rainie's deepest, darkest secrets. He just happens to know the truth behind what everyone else has only speculated about for fourteen years. And the action is unevenly paced, ending almost abruptly. I found this book at a used-book sale and bought it because it started out very well, with characters and dialogue that got me involved right away. But even the most fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue in the world cannot compensate for the lack of a consistent and airtight plot."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I've read several books by Lisa Gardner and although there are some occasional plot flaws, she never fails to deliver a good story. When the villain was finally revealed, I was pretty surprised as I had not been thinking in that direction. The cross country diversion reminded me of another Lisa Gardner book, \\"The Next Accident\\" featuring the same characters. That duplicate scenario was kind of unsatisfying. While it is true that much of the book dealt with reflecting on past trangressions of the characters, there was plenty of action and investigation to keep things moving. In conclusion, 'The Third Victim' is interesting reading and worth a look. Lisa Gardner delivers again."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Deputy Lorraine Connor responds to a schoolyard shooting in her small Oregon community, discovering that the shooter is the son of the town sheriff. The violence has left 2 children and one teacher dead. But a visit by renowned FBI profiler Pierce Quincy reveals something far more sinister.As the two investigate the supposed isolated incident, they discover that Danny was befriended on the internet and that he might have been recruited to do the act by the perfect serial killer - one who leaves no clues that the crimes were committed by one person. Of course Danny is not talking, so they are not able to ascertain if the theory has merit. And his family is keeping quiet at advice of counsel. The town thinks that he will walk - as Lorraine did when she was accused of murdering her mother, and the evidence just upped and disappeared. Quincy tries to help Lorraine with her own personal demons.Gardner does a good job presenting a tragedy which has become all to familiar in our society, bringing a new spin on it with the criminal solicitation element. I liked delving deeper into the character of Pierce Quincy, who was a minor character in Gardner's first two novels, but Lorraine tended to grate on my nerves. While Gardner was trying to portray her as gutsy, she came across as an annoying bully instead (and continues the same behavior in the next novel). Bravo for not going for the Hollywood ending - it made the story more realistic."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"School shootings committed by kids, usually teenagers, are truly sad affairs. These tragedies always invite exhaustive examination of the shooter's family, school life, interpersonal dealings, psychological development and state, etc. Where is the breakdown? But what if an adult manipulated a student to commit the shootings? That is what the author suggests could happen in this gripping story.Rainie Conner, a native of Bakersville, OR, and a deputy sheriff, is stunned to discover Sheriff Shep O'Grady's son, Danny, with two firearms in his hands and one teacher and two students dead when responding to a shots-fired call at the local K-8 school. Rainie's job immediately becomes more difficult when the townspeople remember that Rainie escaped prosecution in the gruesome murder of her mother some fourteen years prior despite a preponderance of evidence pointing to her guilt. Rainie needs all the help that she can get. Fortunately a FBI special agent Pierce Quincy, a person who has spent considerable time exploring school shootings, becomes aware of the case and offers his assistance.Rainie and Quincy immediately click and slowly start peeling off the layers of mystery. The story is well constructed, moves quickly, and interleaves any number of aspects of the various characters lives, both past and present. The discerning reader might question Rainie's fortuitous access to Danny in a juvenile detention facility. The characters are well explored and the psychology that might lead to this type of violence is looked at. This author's work compares quite favorably with the work of others working in this genre."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Bakersville, Oregon is the setting for Lisa Gardner's novel, &quot;The Third Victim&quot;. Bakersville is a small, sleepy town where nothing much happens and where everyone knows everyone else's business. Police Officer Lorraine Conner, known as Rainie, has a history in Bakersville. Everyone knows that fourteen years ago, Rainie's alcholic mother, who abused Rainie and who was openly promiscuous, was brutally murdered. Townfolk still speculate as to whether Rainie killed her mother, and Rainie has learned to live with the rumors.Bakersville's peace is shattered when three people, a teacher and two students, are gunned down in the town's elementary school. More shocking, the killer appears to be Danny O'Grady, the thirteen-year-old son of Bakersville's sheriff, Shep O'Grady. Shep had taught Danny a great deal about guns, and apparently, Danny had put this knowledge to use when killing his victims.Rainie is the primary officer investigating the case and she has conflicting loyalties. She is devoted to Shep, and she would like to help his son, but she is also a peace officer who is sworn to uphold the law. Rainie's life is complicated when federal and state officers get involved in her case. She is romantically attracted to FBI agent Pierce Quincy, a profiler who is assigned to the case. Quincy is a recurring character in Gardner's books.In &quot;The Other Victim,&quot; Gardner tackles some interesting subjects well. She explores the phenomenon of school shootings, including why they occur and what might be done to prevent them in the future. She also deals ably with the subjects of child abuse, marital discord and children's phobias. Rainie is an excellent protagonist, strong yet vulnerable, and her romance with Quincy is engrossing. Most of the characters, including the sheriff and his wife, and the various police officers assigned to the case, are well drawn.The problem with the book is the perpetrator. Gardener makes the murderer into an omniscient type who pulls the strings of all the characters throughout the book in a way that I found to be unbelievable. The character of the murderer does not ring true and I found the ending to be the weakest part of the book.However, Gardner's crisp dialogue and her excellent protagonist, Rainie Conner, keep the book moving at a brisk pace, and &quot;The Third Victim&quot; did hold my interest until the end. I recommend this novel for fans of psychological suspense."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"The Third Victim is definitely Gardner's finest work, with local police woman Raine working to solve the school shooting involving the police chief's son. Gardner's novels are well-researched, which adds to the realism. Add to that her fine writing skills and you have a top notch read on your hands. My only complaint was the 'surprise' twist about the heroine's past. Anyone familiar with Gardner's category roots will recognize that as a retread from Hiding Jessica. It really seemed superfluous and detracted from the mystery itself."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"A school shooting provides Rainie Conner with her first lead in a homicide investigation. Amid a tiresome pseudo-romance with FBI profiler Pierce Quincy, she tries to determine if the young killer acted alone, or whether he was manipulated from the sidelines by someone far more evil.\\"The Third Victim\\" actually starts off really well, with a gripping look into the aftermath of a horrific school shooting. And the youngster seemingly behind the carnage is none other than the son of the town's sheriff. But things quickly go downhill: we are soon introduced to stoic, personality-free Quincy, Rainie's Troubled Past takes up almost more plot time than the school shooting, and we spend time with a killer who is always present but never actually DOES anything. Since the book makes it clear early on that a psychopath has had something to do with the carnage, waiting endlessly for the book's characters to catch up and move the plot in a new, exciting direction does not a suspenseful thriller make. Add to that the constant confrontations that Rainie and Quincy have about her Troubled Past that all seem to end with her driving home and not actually resolving anything.To add insult to injury, I was astonished at how inept the wrap-up was. That's all it took to catch the killer? I can't actually describe how stupid it was without spoiling the book, but it made the previous leadenly-paced 300 pages utterly pointless. If somebody had decided to take that small action earlier, we wouldn't even have a book, folks. I'm also surprised that a \\"gifted\\" killer who'd escaped detection for years would be so sloppy. And what was with the young suspect giving up his secret at the drop of a hat when he'd remained silent the whole book? We're not even shown how Rainie accomplished this previously unachievable task.I'm glad I've read and highly enjoyed \\"The Killing Hour\\" because I know Gardner can write a great thriller. But this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I found this book frightning because being a high school student this could possibly happen at my school...

Warren series and \\"The Perfect Husband\\". I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, especially \\"The Perfect Husband\\" and couldn't wait to get this book, the next in the FBI Profiler series. What a disappointment. I had to force myself to finish it. There was way too much indepth info on why and how a kid becomes a school shooter and it was repeated over and over - different wording, different chapter - boring after the first time.Also, as much as I tried I didn't find Rainie, one of the main characters, likeble or believeable. Of course even with all the time spent on her and her history I didn't have a feel for who she is by the end.I haven't given up on Gardner but I'll read my Kindle sample and the reviews a little better before paying $7.99 for another."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"In Bakersville, Oregon, instead of himself, Sheriff Shep O'Grady surprisingly places Deputy Raine Connor in charge of the mass murder scene at the elementary school.

Much of the physical evidence is already damaged due to the chaos that occurred before Raine arrives on the scene, but more contamination follows. Raine arrests Danny on suspicion of murder. He confesses to the shootings. His father further contaminates the crime scene before Raine can get him to leave.The State sends Homicide Detective Abe Sanders, a methodical cop, to take charge of the case. FBI Special Agent Pierce Quincy leaves his dying daughter to also join the investigation. Quincy tells Raine he has some doubts about Danny being the killer because of the precise way the teacher was murdered. As the trio works together, a town wonders why a good little boy would do such a bad thing. Overwhelming evidence points towards the lad but some items lead to a more professional murderer yet no clear suspect surfaces.Though everyone struggles with the shock of school children murdering their peers in schoolhouses, this novel is a taut well-written thriller. The characters are well constructed so that readers can understand how they react to events during the murders and its aftermath. Still, this is a difficult topic to read a fictionalized account on true events such as what happened in Colombine. Still, as with the author's previous novels such as THE PERFECT HUSBAND and The Other Daughter, Lisa Gardner provides an exciting, non-stop thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what was going to happen next.

Well, I have and the &quot;real thing&quot; was a lot more gripping. I have also read all the real life followup stories on the Columbine school killings and it is very hard to top those in shattering impact. Gardner does a very good job with a very similar scenario in her novel. You will enjoy reading it but if you've read about Columbine thoroughly, you may find this fictional counterpart pales in comparison. The two main characters are a woman police officer in a small, peaceful town and the male FBI agent called in to help on the case. We actually join the police officer in the school after the shootings and while the killer may still be in the building. It is a very gripping opening. Once the police have a suspect, there are still troubling aspects to the case about whether there was one killer acting alone or more than one. How much the internet was used to set up the shootings must also be investigated. There is a bit of a romantic scenario that is developed between our two main characters but it is a smaller part of the story. I'd recommend this book as a good evening's entertainment. You will blast right through it as it is that kind of book."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Lisa Gardner has a semi-series of books that include Pierce Quincy, an FBI Profiler. In this book, which is the third, Quincy is called in on a school shooting. He is studying school shootings to help put together a profile for schools to use to help prevent such incidents. The largest issue with this shooting is that the sheriff's son apparently did shooting. Rainie Conner is a sheriff's deputy and is the lead investigator in the case. But Rainie and the sheriff have a history - back from when Rainie was in high school, and she was found over her mother's headless body covered in blood and brain matter.This story has a lot of twists and turns, and a lot of strong characters. I've grown fond of Quincy. Unfortunately I'd read The Next Accident and The Killing Hour before I'd read this, so I was aware of his future, which took some of the suspense out of The Third Victim.Here is the list of the series:The Perfect HusbandThe Other DaughterThe Third VictimThe Next AccidentThe Killing HourThese books are similar to many romantic suspense novels - Catherine Coulter's FBI series, Kay Hooper (without the woo-woo), Tess Gerritsen, Linda Howard - with possibly a higher level of violence.Overall, an interesting set of books."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I have come to appreciate the novels including Rainie Conner as a major character, and appreciate how this particular novel incorporates the secrets of her past as a part of both the solution to the current crime and in her ongoing friendship with FBI profiler Pierce Quincy. They make a good pair in creating a story.As with all Lisa Gardner novels (in my opinion), the characters are well drawn, the story is interesting, the solutions logical, and best of all the journey is filled with major twists and turns, and an intensity that keeps you from wanting to put it down.A very good read."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"THE THIRD VICTIM is one of bestselling author Lisa Gardner's early novels, and one in which long time characters Quinch and Rainie Connor meet. Quincy is an FBI profiler and Rainie is a police officer in the small Oregon town of Bakersville . As I followed them in later Gardner novels, I always pictured them as older, so it was fun to get a glimse of Quincy in his forties and Ranie at 31.The novel opens with a horrific event, a school shooting. Rainie is fifteen minutes away and drives like crazy to get there. Once on the scene, she sees bleeding, injured children. A national tragedy has come to their small town, just like Colombine. Gardner really evokes the horror of a shooting at a school, from the helplessness of all those involved to the fear of the parents, to the anger of the victims. Ranie is the officer put in charge of the case when Danny O'Grady is found in the school holding two guns. Danny is the 13 year old son of Shep, the chief of police and Rainie's mentor.Quincy comes to town because he's been investigating the cause of school shootings and what causes these kids to act out. While in town, he gets close to Rainie as they try and find out why Danny did what he did, and if he acted alone.The good: The third victim of the title refers to Ms. Avalon, a teacher at the school and a victim of the shooting. Was she a target? It was an really interesting premise. I don't want to give anything away, but the past of the villain of the novel is really interesting and probably should have gotten more attention in the novel.The not so good: So much of the middle focuses on the aftermath of the shooting. We read about the frustrations of the investigation, and the pain Shep O'Grady and his family are facing. While we are deep into the lives of the people in the novel, the actual progress on what really happened moved at a glacier pace.All of Gardner 's recent novels have been great, but her early ones have been hit or miss for me. I liked THE OTHER SISTER, while THE PERFECT HUSBAND and SURVIVOR'S CLUB had issues. This novel fits somewhere in the middle. I really liked the story, but it seemed slow at times."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I love the story. Loved the characters! So glad that Lorraine and Quincy will be back in other books! Thought the way Ms. Gardner gave all the back up information to the characters really lead to us knowing them better and understanding what they were thinking, and how they were thinking when events transpired.Enter Lorraine Conner, sheriff of a small town, where an unspeakable school shooting just occurred. And who stands in the school holding the smoking gun, none other than her boss Shepp's son. The story goes along and explores Rainey's background and things that happened to her, as well as, tells the story of her trying to figure out who in her small town is responsible for having Shepp's son shoot, a teacher and two classmates.I loved the chemistry between Rainey and Quincy and am excited to see how that develops in future books, and overall I was happy with the outcome of this book. Can't wait to read another.Ms. Gardner keeps you strapped in for the ride of your life, until your left wondering......about the Third Victim."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Make no mistake. Lisa Gardner can write. ALONE is a fine book, and Bobby Dodge is a great character. The DD Warren series suffers without him, in my opinion. THE THIRD VICTIM fires out of the gate with a shooting in small town Oregon elementary school. The first half of the book offers plenty of suspense, but sadly it slowly devolves into a slow, predictable procedural."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I stumbled upon this author and this book at the dollar rack at the discount book store and finished it in an afternoon.Great characters and writing style, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

I liked this book alot better then the 1st one. Gardner is really good at not giving anything away too early.

I plan on reading all of the books by Lisa Gardner."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"The book arrived as stated. It was used and thus it did have one page where there was part of the page missing...not enough to cause any major concerns. I was able to still understand what was happening despite part of the paragraph missing."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I really liked the story. There were editing issues that really got to me and made it difficult for me to read without it getting on my nerves. There were random words that would have unnecessary hyphens placed in them. They weren't even consistent. Sometimes 'Bakersville' was spelled as is, other times it was Ba-kersville or Bakers-ville. There were others, but that one occurred the most.Other than that it was a great story."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I'm reading this book in the aftermath of the Tucson shootings, January 2011, also carried out by a young disaffected man, although at this point no rational motive has been identified. As news reports of that horrific event continue to dominate the daily news, it occured to me how dated Gardner's book is, some ten years after she wrote it.Unfortunately, now, any of us who read news reports already know all the popular jargon and common psychological analysis of young people who pick up guns and shoot something up, schools or public events. Probably back in 2001, not much of this had occupied the public mind, and Gardner's book would have appeared insightful. Today, it's boring as hell -- all the discussion vis a vis why these things happen, who or what might be responsible, what society's reaction is and should be, have already been rehashed ad infinitum on the pages of every newspaper in the county. In reading the book, I skipped page after page of what was really a lecture on the topic, even though it was offered through staged discussions among and between the characters.If you're looking for a book on school shootings and the psychology thereof -- which I am definitely not, not now or indeed ever again -- I suggest \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" by Jodi Picault. I'm not much of a fan of Ms. Picault's -- if I want ghosts in my story, I far prefer the Stephen King variety -- but this one book of her is outstanding. By going back and forth in telling the story from the viewpoint of the parents, school administrators and various other characters, she offers a far more interesting and unique treatment of the subject."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I am sorry to say that I really did not enjoy this novel as much as I have enjoyed the other books by Lisa Gardner that I have read. Primarily, I did not think that the book ever got to the point, but was constantly being side-tracked by romance, the female detective's family history, the family history of Danny, etc. Also, I felt that the principle characters were left hanging, with no real conclusion being drawn as to what happens to them. I purchased this book on audio disc, and it did not live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"This my tenth book written by LG and most have been four or five stars. This novel has interesting characters that are well defined but there are some plot flaws and often I was left thinking, \\"How in the hell did she/he know that.\\" About half way in the book, I actually stopped reading and wondered how these arcane sub-plots could possibly be explained in relation to each other. The answer; suspension of disbelief in a big way. All that being said, LG told the story in such a way that I did not want to stop reading - I had to find out how it all ended - good or bad.If you want to know all about the history and background of school shootings here in the US and want to listen to characters being psychoanalyzed, then this might be the book for you.Oh, can you imagine a school shooting without even one big press conference?"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"The Third VictimThe story starts out interestingly enough and then it all falls apart as the plot unfolds. The Sheriff's son is involved in multiple murders at his school. The Sheriff is actively interfering with the investigation. The lead investigating officer is Rainey Conner. She works under the Sheriff. Conner has a long personal friendship with the Sheriff and enough personal baggage that normally would prevent her from ever being a cop in the first place. Holy comflict of interest Batman! State and Federal agents are called in but who is in charge, the admittedly unqualified, conflicted, unstable, Rainey Conner! Oh Please!!! If you removed the unqualified cop, had a realistic chain of command with the investigators,and put the Sheriff in jail for interfering this might be a good read.My suspension of disbelief button was pushed too many times on this one."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"This is an entertaining thriller that kept me turning the pages. I have read a number of books by this author, and I have yet to be disappointed. Her characters are reasonably interesting, and the plot is well-thought out. Those who like easy reading suspense will definitely enjoy this author's books.The plot centers around a school shooting that divides the small town of Bakersfield, Oregon. Three people were killed, two of them children. The townspeople are demanding justice. After all, a young boy has confessed to the shooting. It seems, however, that the evidence indicates that he may not have acted alone.Officer Rainie Conner is the lead investigator in the shooting, but there are those in the town that feel that her past is impacting on her investigation, as controversy is brewing over her involvement. FBI profiler, Pierce Quincy, assists Officer Conner with the investigation, as he, too, is convinced that there is more to the shooting that meets the eye. They both want to see justice done and begin a deadly cat and mouse game with a shadowy character that lurks in the background and may, in fact, be the mastermind of all that has happened.Those who enjoy the works of Mary Higgins Clark, Carlene Thompson, and Tami Hoag will be sure to enjoy this book, as will all those who enjoy suspense thrillers with a lot of twists and turns."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I didn't like this book for several reasons. The school shooting theme is very disturbing to me and I honestly don't think that the author did a good job exploring or explaining that issue. Another reason I didn't like the book was because the Rainie character was severely irritating. I'm so sick of the \\"macho\\" woman in these suspense thrillers. Rainie needs to grow up and get over herself. Lastly, the villain in this book didn't make any sense. His motives and reasoning were stupid. This book had potential, but fell flat."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"All of her stories grab me from page one and this novel was no exception.

Some I liked more than others, but none of them bored me senseless like this one.There's so much information in this novel about school yard mass murders that just doesn't move the story along. It reads like a textbook. Gardner did her research then regurgitated it into this novel. She could have taken half of what's printed out and still have told the same story.The main plot of the 13 yr old boy who takes guns to school to kill, and the sub plot of the small-town police officer who may or may not have killed her mother when she was a teen, are never fully resolved. She tells you who the bad guy is and leaves the rest up in the air. If she had cut out the boring stuff, she could have added a few chapters that fully flushed out the outcome of the main characters of the novel.I'm glad this wasn't my first Gardner novel, because I never would have read any of her other books.

After you read a gazillion mystery/thrillers you begin to recognize the signs....Don't get me wrong tho, this book was enjoyable, exciting, and I couldn't/wouldn't put it down until I was done.Is this a book I want back after I've lent it out? Yes.Will I read more by this author? Yes."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Although the story was well written and the plot is taken right off the front pages of today's newspapers &quot;School shootings - children killing their peers and teachers&quot;. I had a hard time with this novel, not because the story was slow paced (it wasn't) or uninteresting (it was) but because of the plot itself (the sadness and the pain). I can't say that I enjoyed it as I actually didn't (it hurts too much). The story did however open my eyes to some of the reasons behind these killings but I don't think we can ever actually understand the whys and we simply don't know how to stop the carnage.I truly liked Officer Lorraine Conner, FBI man, Pierce Quincy, as well as the other characters involved. Officer Lorraine Conner has a secret past which the entire town of suspects but their theories are completely off the mark. I felt the pain of families and the outrage which comes from losing a child in such a senseless fashion. Lisa Gardner is a very talented author and she impressed me to no end with &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot; but unfortunately &quot;Third Victim&quot; just didn't do anything for me aside from introducing victim &quot;Amanda Quincy&quot; in the next installation of &quot;The Next Accident&quot; which I am looking forward to. In my opinion &quot;The Third Victim&quot; is one novel you can definitely pass on but judge for yourself."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"An interesting start goes downhill very quickly. The female cop is of course ATTRACTIVE, single, fit as a fiddle and has the HORRIFIC MURDER OF HER MOTHER constantly on her mind. All main character cops in books these days have brutal memories of murdered members of their families. The murderer is also gives us his/her thoughts and SINGLES OUT THE ATTRACTIVE COP AS A FUTURE VICTIM. Cops and detectives are the prime intended victims of serial killers in today's mystery stories. Of course ATTRACTIVE FEMALE COPS ALWAYS MEET HUNKY, LEAN AND BEAUTIFULLY MUSCLED FBI, DETECTIVE, SPECIAL AGENT, or something, with his own HORRIFIC FAMILY DISASTER and FIGHTING/ROMANCE ENSUES. This plot is so shopworn, overused and boring that reading it becomes a chore....wait a minute, the chore is over...I'm a third of the way through and have stopped reading this book. This is the second book I've tried by this author and both have been graded D. Get original Ms. Gardner."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"Unlike some other reviewers who love everything, this book was NOT a hit for me. I've read Both of Ms. Gardners other books and enjoyed them but this one wasn't great.The suspense part was just ok, wondering who-done-it and especially why. Even the &quot;why&quot; part was a bit shaky. But the &quot;romance&quot; element was basically non-existant and pretty lame. Not the greatest ending I've ever read either (won't say more and ruin it for you). Better luck next time Ms. Gardner."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"How did the watcher know Rainie's secrets? Didn't anybody ever wonder what happened to the guy who killed her mother--he had a wife and child. Was he a local man? What did Rainie do with his body when she moved it? How did a man as young as Richard Mann supposedly know so much about what Rainie did? It seemed as if he knew what &quot;really happened&quot;, then somebody says that he thought she killed her mother and was disappointed that she didn't. This book didn't make a whole lot of sense. Halfway through it I remembered I had read The Other Daughter, and I didn't like that one either."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I really enjoyed her first book--The Perfect Husband--it had a great story, sexy, thrilling, fast paced. I thought with all the current dialogue about school shootings this would be a knock out book. The story was well developed and left a lot open for a sequel, but I wanted more from it. I ripped through it expecting something MORE to happen between the main characters, but I was left wanting more. Good commuting material for sure."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"As a mother it was difficult for me to make it through chapters one and two, they really aren't for the feeble hearted. But once you get past them you won't be able to put the book down. I thought Gardner's first book was the most rivetting, compelling, well-writen, intense, yet disturbing book I'd ever read. She topped it with this one. The plot is intense, rivetting, complex,disturbing, well-crafted, well-written and the ending is impossible to foresee. The characters are well-developed, interesting and unforgetable. You won't be able to put it down once you start reading it!"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"The least of the times you take a book is to learn something really important. You read a book to have a good time, because someone gave it to you or any other reason you like. But when you read a book and you understand why are the killings at schools. What are the kids' main problems. That the deans has their own life and own problems and those problems implicate the students, maybe before you send your kid into a new school you'll want to know the background of the teachers and deans.At the end you'll think about the life of the police, their problems and how they solve them, the end of the book is not a happy ending, but it deserves SIX stars."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"A mass shooting in a primary school brings terror to the peaceful community of Bakersville, Oregon. Thirteen year-old Danny O'Grady, son of the town sheriff, has confessed to murdering two young children and his computer teacher, but evidence points to another killer.Police Officer Rainie Connor, a lifelong resident of Bakersville, leads the homicide investigation, her first. She is a close family friend of the O'Grady's and has watched Danny grow up. Dealing with the boy's rage, which provoked the terrible tragedy, brings back excruciating memories from her past, and terrible secrets that she can never reveal.Supervisory Special Agent Pierce Quincy, of the FBI, (or SupSpag as Rainie calls him), is an expert profiler who comes to this town in turmoil to assist Rainie. What they discover together is absolutely chilling. It certainly makes for a non-stop read.I wouldn't ordinarily have chosen to read a book dealing with school shootings and mass murders, but this novel came highly recommended and I am glad I gave it a try. Lisa Gardner, like many Americans, has been extremely disturbed by the terrible shootings that have taken place in our schools. This novel is a result of her attempts to understand why these mass murders of young innocents occur, and what can be done to prevent them. The quality of psychological analyses and research that went into &quot;The Third Victim&quot; are impressive. Gardner's characters, especially Rainie, Quincy, young Danny and his family are well developed and realistic. I am impressed that Ms. Gardner did not demonize Danny or stereotype his parents, but instead wrote a compelling profile of a young man on the brink and a family in crisis.The novel is riveting - an excellent psychological thriller with an unexpected ending.JANA"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"School shootings are unfortunately happening with increasing frequency and in multiple parts of our country. This author has researched several shootings and has fashioned a fictional plot from her material. The storey has too many subplots, but the subject of children getting guns and going on shooting rampages is one that needs exploring. The lead detective, Rainie Conner, is young and inexperienced when she finds herself assigned to the shooting in her town just after it happened. It appears that Danny, the 13 year old son of the Police chief, is the shooter who has killed a teacher and two young elementary school girls. From newspaper reports of the case, guilt would seem to be obvious. HOWEVER, and this is what makes the book well worth reading, there is a manipulative psychopath on the loose who has been comunicating with Danny on the internet and has figured out all the buttons to push to accomplish his own agenda.The story line is a warning to parents with children who are not dealing with stress and pressure either at home or school or both and how to watch for the signs of unleased rage. Officer Rainie Conner, herself, a victim of an abusive past is working through her own problems and becomes part of the problem as well as the one who eventually solves the mystery. It was a good book and one that I am glad I read."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have to say that this was definetely a great book.

This is defintely a book to add to your collection of thrillers. The ending is such a shock, and it doesn't make you hate the book..it makes you want to read more books by this author..

I gobbled the book in a single night, and have to say that this is definitely of higher calibre writing than the other two.For one, the character depth of the heroine and the villain is much more complex: I was three-quarters of the way through the book and still unsure of who I could trust, who might be the killer, and why this was all happening. Starting with a contemporary ugly reality: the school-shooting slaying of two students and a teacher, this book takes off from there and continues with a semi-manic pace throughout.Gardner allows you into the mind of the killer without giving who the killer is away, which is a rewarding experience, but it is in Lorraine, a sherrif in the town where the shooting has happened, that the truly good writing occurs. A woman with a somewhat shady past of her own, this shooting may be about her in some way, and it's a great ride finding out just how.The only quibble I had with the book was the occasional plot wrinkle that made me blink in confusion. There were a few passages I had to read twice to understand - not many, mind you, maybe only twice, but it did call a minor break in my reading.Regardless of those minor stumbles, grab this book. It's a thriller perfect for those of us that like a healthy mix of mystery tossed in to our edge-of-seat-reading.'Nathan"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I had not read any of the reviews or blurbs about &quot;The Third Victim&quot; before I read the book. When I was reading it and realized it was about a school shooting, I almost put it down, feeling that we have had enough of this subject in the news, I didn't need to read it in ficton.I'm very glad I didn't leave it. &quot;The Third Victim&quot; is about so much more than 'another school shooting'. I promise you will never see the news in the same light again.Another surprise for me, was the author's reference back to &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot;. This is not a series book however, the reference is made and dropped. I was also surprised that I remembered the previous book so vividly after reading it more than four years ago. That alone is testament to Lisa Gardner's writing ability.&quot;The Third Victim&quot; is a well plotted mystery with characters who are flawed, but very real.

This book is a hard to put down thriller. I enjoyed the narrative and thought that all the characters were well developed.

I loved &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot; and &quot;The Other Daughter&quot; but this one was better. If you are a teacher or work for a school district, then you might find this book disturbing and offending since the big massacre takes place at the school. Rainie Connor, who is the small town'sherrif, is an amazingly developed character who does a fantastic job of discovering who the murderer is. If you like Tami Hoag, Iris Johansen, or Mary Higgins Clark, then you'll love Lisa Gardner."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"School killings are on the increase these days, but it is certainly not a subject one could say makes for &quot;enjoyable reading.&quot; This is a work of fiction, not a true story where the facts and real-life situations are beyond the author's control. Taking that into consideration there are an endless number of other plots the author could have developed; one based on a school killings was simply not my cup of tea. For that reason alone, I simply could not give the book higher than a three star rating.Much to the book's credit is a consistent writing style and a plot (whether you like it or not) filled with suspense. The characters of both FBI profiler Pierce Quincy and Officer Rainie Connor intrigue the reader and grab your attention from the start. From a psychological point of view and based on the information given, there was clearly some very accurate and in-deepth research work undertaken on the profiling of mass murderers during the writing of this book, and that is also worthy of merit.Overall, if you do not mind the subject matter, you will probably enjoy the book. It does have drama and action."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I have read three of Lisa's other books and this one didn't disappoint me at all.

And we all look around and think \\"it couldn't happen here.\\" In Lisa Gardner's latest, The Third Victim, the people of sleepy little Bakersville, Oregon are subjected to the unthinkable when a shooting occurs at their elementary school. Rainie Connor, local girl and police officer, becomes the primary investigator when the suspect in the shootings turns out to be the sheriff's son. Rainie, who is battling her own demons having been accused of shooting her alcoholic, abusive mother 14 years old, is torn between wanting to make sure justice is served and making sure an innocent boy isn't railroaded.

I was not disappointed. It had me on the edge of my seat from the very first chapter. I read The Third Victim in one seating, and immediately logged on to Amazon to buy all of her books. This book doesn't pull its punches, it has you gripped until the last page, and leaves you deflated when you've finished. Not for the faint hearted!"},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"A small, quiet town, Bakersville, Oregon takes care of their own. It's a small community where everyone knows everyone and looks out for each other. But this small town is about to be torn apart when a school shooting claims the lives of one popular teacher and two small girls. Lives are destroyed and Bakersville will never be the same again.Officer Rainie Connor receives the call to get to the school. She is made primary since the sheriff has two children at the school. When she arrives, she walks into mass chaos. Without experience in this kind of crime, she does the best she can gathering evidence. However, due to circumstance beyond her control, she inadvertently contaminates the crime scene. Into the scene enters Abe Sanders, an investigator for the state. Sanders is a perfectionist who thinks he has the case wrapped up regardless of what Rainie feels. The FBI enters the picture by sending Pierce Quincy. Quincy is a behavioral specialist who is running a study on school shootings. He quickly picks up thread that both Rainie and Abe have missed. Threads that show everything are not as it appears.Don't let the subject matter put you off this book. Yes, it is hard to read because it concerns school shootings. But the story is so much more than school shootings. Lisa Gardner has truly taken a plot and put so many twists and surprises in it that even the most hard core suspense reader will have trouble figuring out just exactly who is guilty, what is happening, and how it all connects. The characters are fully developed with complex characteristics. Ms. Gardner definitely did her homework on the subject matter and as a result has an extraordinary story that will keep you glued to the story line."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"If the Amazon Star System allowed the possibility, I'd give this one four and a half stars, rather than four. But it doesn't. So, rounding off, I've given it four.Let's get my very minor quibbles out of the way first: (1) There's no way a town small enough to need a law enforcement staff of only three people plus a volunteer is going to have a 'Dairy Queen.' They'd be 'lucky' to have a 'MacDonald's.' (2) The inhabitants of such a town would have to be insane to think they could hope to land a Wal-Mart. (3) There are no 'towering mountains' in the Oregon Coastal Range. I suppose an author from the east coast, which this one is, might be tricked into thinking that rolling foothills qualify as mountains, but they don't. (4) There is one small paragraph which violates the Point of View style set up in the rest of the book, and the exception is jarring, as it intrudes the book's 'omniscient' author into the mix-- always a big problem when editors don't catch it, which in this case they didn't.But that is the sum extent of my quibbles. Other than that, this is a very good example of the type of book it is: the formulaic thriller slash mystery. Great Literature it isn't, but it makes no pretense to be, so there's no need to mark it down any for failing to be so. It's even character-based as opposed to plot-driven, which automatically elevates it several notches above the mid-ranks of the genre.Lorraine Connor, a young deputy sheriff in a small coastal Oregon town who is tough but unsure of herself, and both vulnerable and quite capable of taking care of herself, is asked to be 'primary officer' at a bloody crime scene-- a school shooting in which two students and one teacher have been killed. The teacher-- the 3rd Victim of the title-- has been 'taken out' with a small caliber shot directly to the forhead, while the two students have been 'shot up' at much longer range. This discrepancy in methodology eventually causes the investigators to believe that there is more than one shooter involved. (A fact which the reader, but no one else, has been apprised of early on.)The suspense comes in the form of delays and dead-ends in the process of finding out who the 'other' shooter is. One perpetrator, a kid, has already been caught, and has confessed, but refuses to talk about the crime, and for good reason: the other criminal is a serial killer with the ethics of a boa constrictor who knows how to scare kids into refusing to talk, sometimes permanently.There are subplots galore: (1) Lorraine herself has something to hide concerning another shooting many years ago. Will she end up having to 'tell all' or won't she? (2) There's a nasty big-city investigator on scene, who is trying to undercut Lorraine and steal her case from her. Will he succeed? (3) A troubled FBI agent from Quantico finds Lorraine fascinating. Will they end up in bed? (4) One of the victims comes from a family with nasty secrets to hide. What lengths will other members of that family go to to 'protect' their past?One of the most refreshing things about this book is that nothing is predictable. Not one of these subplots ends up being resolved in the way you think it's going to be. I can't begin to tell you how relieved I was by that!I've avoided till now dealing with the true heart of the book, though, so the time has now come. On one level this books is 'mere' thriller, but on a deepler plane it's a fascinating glimpse into the world of disturbed psychology, particularly that of children. I'm not about to give anything away here, but just rest assured that this author has done tons of homework and has created characters who behave exactly the way that real people do. So much so that there is an air of realism to this fictional story that lifts it far beyond the bounds of most examples of its kind.I highly recommend The 3rd Victim."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"I ordered a set of my favorite author's books, and they came right away and in great condition.

Since it was all I had with me, I decided to try it. The action begins immediately and I was hooked immedaitely. The plot is fast paced and keeps you guessing. The characters' development is given to you at a slowerer pace, which makes for a nice mix. I found myself sitting in several parking lots delaying turning off the car until the end of a chapter.

Warren series. Actually, the only thing that left me slightly displeased was that I found D.D.Warren and Rainie Conner to be too alike. At times I felt as though I was reading the same character, and as I continue reading further into the series, I find that the two characters become more similar. I really like D.D. Warren, and I enjoy the back and forth that takes place between her and Bobby Dodge. If I had to pick one series to read, it wouldn't be this one, but it is still entertaining. Also, I've read all of Lisa Gardner's current books. I realize now, after reading some of her older books, that she's improved on her writing and story telling to such a degree that some of her older books don't quite have the same effect that her current books do. I really like Quincy. I think his character is rock solid, but Rainie Conner falls just a hair short, inmy humble opinion. Still, you cannot go wrong with Lisa Gardner.

I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"The book was described as in very good condition, and it was, with the exception of a cover tear at the spine. I don't remember how long it took to get to me, but seems like it was a short time."},{"Title":"The Third Victim","review":"The Third Victim begins strongly, with a riveting race to the scene of a school shooting. After that, however, this 300+ page novel plods ahead.Rainie Conner, a female police officer in Bakersfield, Oregon, must push back her own demons and move the case ahead against the son of a friend. Conner, who as a teenager found her mother's dead, dripping body in their living room, must somehow come to terms with this new bloody crime scene while reliving her past. And the real killer, as we're told even on the back of the cover, is out to get her.Rainie is a caricature -- 110 pounds of rage and savvy, keeping men at bay, keeping her emotions deep inside. Her dialogue is inane. Pierce Quincy, the FBI love interest, besides having a ridiculous name, is perfect -- perfect suits, perfect hair, perfect eyes. Shep O'Grady is Bakersfield's bumbling, drunk sheriff who knows the truth about what happened to Rainie's mother.Take a pass on this one. Other than in the first and the last few pages, there's little suspense. The Third Victim is part unthriller, part Harlequin unromance. Unlike in typical thrillers, there's nothing -- nothing! -- to keep you reading at the end of each chapter. The characters are empty, the dialogue will make you laugh out loud. I suggest that Lisa Gardner go read a few Hardy Boys novels if she wants to learn about pacing and suspense."},{"Title":"In Bed With Beauty: King Of Hearts (Silhouette Desire)","review":"Wooden characters, a carbon copy of dozens of other books with the hero afraid to trust, the sexy scenes read like failed and weak attempts at erotica. Hundreds of typos or missing words, and badlyconstructed sentences. This is an insult to intelligence romance readers and the editing at Harlequin was not good."},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"I admire Orrin Hatch, and was thrilled when I stumbled (literally) across this book during a Christmas shopping excursion. The most interesting parts were Orrin reflecting on his decision to run for Senate, and the process of that campaign. Also interesting was the Clarence Thomas confirmation and the resulting controversy. Far less interesting were his long tangents on the Labor bills and others that I'm too lazy to recall. I love politics, and enjoyed this book a decent amount... but I fail to see how anybody who isn't both a diehard conservative and a political junkie would be able to finish this book. It can be pretty tedious at times. That being said, Mr. Hatch is a great American and I salute him."},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"I found this book to be a complete and pleasant surprise. Contrary to what one might think, the book is actually an interesting, instructive, and revealing look at the political process. Senator Hatch makes legislating seem real and more thoughtful than one would ever guess from the evening news. I never thought I would read a book by Orrin Hatch and laugh out loud. I still don't agree with all of the positions he takes, but you do grasp that there are actual humans hiding behind their political stereotypes. It's a quick, easy, but surprisingly fun read."},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"What a book! This book is funny and captivating - A real page-turner. Hatch writes at a level that readers can enjoy. He assumes that you are a legislative novice and takes the time to explain the players and the environment in a non-dry fashion. He has a great sense of humor, shows wit and has a phenomenal storytelling manner. If I seem as though I am trumpeting this book, I am. I truly came away smiling and didn't feel as if conquering the next page was going to be an arduous task. This book is political, without being political. A Democrat can read the book just as joyfully as a Republican because Hatch is not pushing an agenda, unlike Goldberg's Biased, but rather is telling the reader the \\"how\\" of his career, and less of the \\"why you should be a republican.\\" --- All I can say is that I enjoyed it, and there is no reason you wouldn't also."},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"Multiple copies of this book were sent to the mountainous area of Pakistan where a devastating earthquake occurred several years ago. Our source could find no books in either Urdu or English which explained earthquake phenomena available in Pakistan. We sent copies of a few books found on Amazon.com for review by people in the area where schools were being rebuilt. The Pakistani villagers chose Milly Lee's Earthquake! as their first preference because they related to the poem that introduces the book. Like so many of the Islamic cultures in the Mid East and South Asia, poetry is appreciated by the common, even if illiterate, persons. The content is fine; we would have preferred to find a satisfactory book that discussed earthquakes in different parts of the world but, as we saw in this case, it was the effect on the people that mattered."},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"First things first....I am not an Orrin Hatch fan, I don't live in his state, and I have never really paid him much attention. Ultra-conservative friends of mine have always thought he was the greatest however. When I saw this book (75% off mind you) I couldn't resist seeing what he had to say.My wife and I began reading this book aloud to one another on a long cross country trip. Both of us are moderate conservatives and we wanted to see what the far right was thinking. On several occasions during this book we found ourselves pondering deep philosophical issues and wrestling with our emotions regarding a myriad of subjects (stem cell research is most vivid in my memory).Yes Senator Hatch does glance over some issues that were major black eyes to the GOP, instead opting for more words on democratic blunders (of course he would, as this is to be expected). In the end, I found myself unable to disagree with Senator Hatch's position on nearly all the issues he presents in the book -- something I know I will not be able to say after reading Clinton's book.In short, this is a very thought provoking book which is excellently written. Senator Hatch shows guts and a surprising sense of humor. If you want to take some time and learn about the inner working of government, this is a very readable, insightful book."},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"This insightful political memoir takes the reader through Senator Hatch's fascinating experiences in the Senate, ranging from the Clarence Thomas hearings, his run for the Presidency, and his unlikely friendship with Ted Kennedy. In a style refreshingly atypical of politicians, he does not present the material through rose-colored glasses. Rather, he is highly self-critical and addresses his mistakes head-on. In one particularly compelling chapter, he describes the vicious personal attacks he faced during the BCCI scandal. His description was written with such brutal honesty that I found myself feeling deeply saddened by the way he was treated. Overall, I think this book is a great read for anyone interested in a behind-the-scenes look at a legendary Washington power-broker."},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"When we think about Republicans and Democrats running our country it is easy to exchange barbs, call each other names and make fun of each other. What few bear in mind is we elect our political leadership to make thoughtful decisions for the good of the Republic. Sometime this means being yourself, using your own judgment and explaining why you work with each other for the good of America in the end.This is what The Honorable Senator Hatch has brought to Washington and America since 1976 and reveals in this new book. Senator Hatch provides many details in this book showing how Washington can work for the benefit of all citizens through the give and take of social justice on labor and civil rights.Senator Hatch is a devoted believer in the Pro-Life movement but he knew the benefits of stem cell research and help create a compromise for the good of all. He divulges the worst mistake he ever made in his political career was not voting for Martin Luther Kings' Holiday because he thought it costs too much. Now upon reflection he admits the benefits in the pride African-Americans now teach to other races about M.L.K. Holiday is worth the billion dollars it costs every time.The author is considered a Right Wing Republican but he has voted on finding the middle ground for many bills that often reflect his friendship with The Honorable Senator Ted Kennedy too. In the book he explains how Senator Kennedy has been persuasive on many occasions that actually made Senator Hatch change his opinion from his heart and using his head, not just for political advantages.I felt very comfortable after reading this book that our nation is in good hands with Public Servants like Senator Hatch and Kennedy. No matter what you think of them in public, how the media or political opponents have labeled them, I can assure you they truly try and make the best decisions for the American people and our institutions. He admits he often prays for guidance on voting for important legislation. It is a prime example how one can use his own religious values to increase secular goodwill without preaching or being intolerant to others.This is a great book on how to be a truly dedicated Public Servant serving the people and having to change your political views sometimes for the good of the senate and homeland.All readers will come away respecting this man from Pittsburgh even more based on what you read in the book. The book is full of revealing tidbits you seldom seen written about in public. I not only recommend this book but salute the senator for writing it is such a forthright and easy manner to read for all!"},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning a little about how Congress works. Not everyone who spends a lot of time reading about American politics will find this book very informative, but for someone casually interested or for a young adult, this will be an excellent read.Hatch describes how a Senator goes about passing or defeating legislation. Particularly interesting is his description of the defeat of labor law reform in 1977.Senator Hatch comes across as very reasonable throughout his book. His description of his friendship with Ted Kennedy is an excellent example of how and why professionals should be able to work together and even be friends even if they choose to disagree about topics they hold to be important.Fans of Clinton and opponents of some Republican nominees to the Supreme Court may find this book tiresome in parts. But a liberal who wishes to read the point of view of someone who disagrees on these issues will enjoy this book because of Hatch's reasonable, thoughtful approach. Conservatives will, of course, enjoy this book and may consider giving this book to as a gift to provide a good example to young adult readers.petervtamas@mail.com"},{"Title":"Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen-Senator","review":"Given the time this individual has served in the US Senate, I expected to come away with new insights into the legislative process, and other truths of governing from the perspective of a senior Senator. I was disappointed and now feel my expectations were much too high. This work was nothing more than an unworthy condensation of everything we've heard on \\"60 Minutes\\" or the national news every night for a number of years. No new insights, no memorable thoughts, no persuasive and careful analysis and certainly no powerful conclusions. Senator Hatch's discussion of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings seemed nothing less than self-aggrandizing. The Senator's unnecessary tirade against a disgraced former President was unnecessary and, I think, below the station of a true Statesman. Recommendation: If you must read, borrow a copy; otherwise, pass on this one."},{"Title":"Truck Stop (Author and Artist Series)","review":"This book truley captures the life of an averagetruck driver.

It's a bit dated for now (2009), but that's to be expected since the industry changes so quickly.Unfortunately, my only complaint is that I cannot use this a teaching tool for my niece and stepdaughter. They expressed a great deal of curiosity about the job and I purchased this to show them what it's like on the road.The author includes a shot of a driver area that has a full frontal nude poster of a woman on the wall.

It was written in 96 and that's generally OK. It has great basic info: history, blood groups, and a very interesting section on 'triggers for blood transfusion' that validate my belief that doctors overtransfuse.The chapter on Component therapy is a bit dated as random plts are not given in many places anymore due to the FDA requirements on bacterial testing making it almost impossible for hospitals to afford to implement, as well as the perception of safety in being exposed to fewer donors (6-12 randoms were pooled to make a unit to give to a patient).

Maybe more.In a later version, titled \\"The Caterpillar Story,\\" it has been offered in many editions & bindings."},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"This book is great for intermediate users of Maya, but if you're a beginner I suggest picking up Maya Fundamentals. This book does not cover learning the interface, but focuses on polygon, sub-division, nurbs modeling, character rigging, and animation. It is filled with full color images to help you along with the tutorials and explanations of the author. It even has a section on learning whats new with version 4.5 and takes you through the basics of creating your own animation. While it does have nice color pictures, I found some of them to be too small to clearly see what was going on. For example, in an earlier chapter focusing on sub-d modeling with edge extrusions, I found it hard to see what edges were supposed to be selected because of the small picture. Aside from that its a great book and well worth purchasing."},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"I thought this book was helpful. It is not for beginners, however. Not all of the tutorials give step by step instructions, instead, the book just tells you to make the model like the picture shown, you're on your own as to how to get the model to look like it.This book has fully colored pages throughout but some of the images are a little hard to read. One thing I found really useful was it's relatively detailed coverage of the various shader utilities (sampler info, set range, clamp... etc)The CD-Rom accompanying this book as some scene files, but the author does not provide a sample scene for every tutorial. Coverage of the Deep Paint 3D isn't all that detailed, but does give you an idea of how to use it in conjunction with Maya.Character animation coverage is very detailed, and on some levels, pretty steep. Overall a very good book, worth buying."},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"This book is in dire need of an editor, preferably one with Maya experience. While it is obvious that Mr. Choi posesses a vast knowledge of Maya, his skills at communicating this knowledge are severly lacking. Grammatical errors abound, and his prose is often repetitive and confusing, if not downright incomprehensible. Many of the images are utterly superfluous, and sometimes they even contradict the text. Also, on a number of occasions, the information given is just plain wrong. Going through the 800+ pages of this book was an utterly frustrating exercise, and as such, I have already advised several friends to stay away from this book."},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"THIS BOOK IS AMAZING!!!When I got this book, I spent the next two weeks almost all the time in front of my computer, creasing my Maya skills some big levels higher.You learn about everything important about Subdivision Surface modeling and texturing and get to know how to create some awesome character setup for high quality animations.The little Frog-Project part givesyou a good look at how to plan a short animation piece and how to get it completed in your computer."},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"This is definitely the best Maya character animation book I have ever read.

Its worth it. because you learn many different techniques and achieve what beyond your imaginations."},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"Maya Character animation is probably one of the best books I have seen so far dealing with character construction. While it is not for beginners, if you have a solid knowledge of Maya, the Maya tools and a general understanding of how it all works, this will take you to the next step in building your animations in a professional manner.I am an animation student at the Columbus College of Art and Design and this book has been a great help in reducing my character modeling time as well as showing me different ways to assign control surfaces so that my characters movements are easier to direct and look much more natural.Another good thing about this book is that it does deal with issues such as assigning textures to your characters and shows you multiple ways to reach the same goal so that you are able to work with the style that suits you the best.All in all, a definite must have in any serious animators' library and it should be put right next to the Maya 4.5 Bible"},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"This book is definetely the best maya book i have seen for people who already know the interface.You could not be wrong in calling it the maya bibleDefinetely worth purchasing and always having it near youHope they keep doing books like this oneit covers everything from modeling to shading networks to inside the networks -utility nodes :) -to fluid dynamics, very cool detailsand also beautiful color pages :)"},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"This is an excellent book in terms of content, but it is definitely not for beginners.

This is a definite must for anyone wanting to get into character animation. This is a must have."},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"I am relatively new to Maya, but i have been doing 3d modelling for quite some time using both 3dsmax and lightwave. I bought this as well as Maya 4.5 Fundamentals, and i found this to be a very nice combination for moving into maya territory. Choi's book is, if anything, a very thorough and in depth look at the uses of tools that arent given the time of day in other books, and the animation essays and tutorials are truly helpful, which is quite rare. However, as it has been said by others, the color illustrations, while nice, don't really serve their purpose in the modelling tutorials. For one they are extremely small. Selected edges and faces are almost impossible to see. What puzzles me a bit is that this book is made for intermediate users of Maya, and intermediate users should have their own methods firmly in place. I have to say that personally i find choi's modelling methods (making a profile outline polygon and extruding edges, working out-and-in using edge merging) rather unwieldy, and by far not the easiest way to do things. Also, he has rickety terminology, and it's sometimes hard to figure out what he means when he says &quot;polygon&quot;. Regardless, the animation related information is *very* interesting and thorough. I recommend it to users comfortable with modelling but unfamiliar with character animation"},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"This book is definately the best book that i've got from Jaejin Choi. He shows you how to model 3 different character in 3 different ways nurbs, sub-D, and poly. He goes beyond the step by step tutorials and shows you from the ground up, how to use other programs to texture your models. He shows you how to rig and animate your character successfully. Paint weights on your character, and techniques that makes it easier for you to animate and make your character to do whatever you want.This book offers the best to the beginner and also the advanced user because it explains it in a most easiest way for you to understand.

Get this book and you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Maya Character Animation","review":"MAYA Character Animation by Jae-jin Choi is a book that covers a huge amount of information and advanced techniques. This book is not a good choice if you're still a beginner but it's not so hard to understand either. It is exellent if your intermediate. It does have some good new tricks for advanced users.The book covers polygon, nurb and subD modelling although you should know about modelling a little bit before reading. It covers facial expressions, skin binding, *good* rigging, texturing, some rendering and of course animation. It has very valuable information scattered around on topics like fluids, fur, and new things on Maya 4.5 that of course persist on Maya 5. It even has a tutorial on Deep Paint 3D. Full color and filled with pictures that aid the text perfectly. You get to work with different characters and many settings.

Kimball wrote this book before becoming an apostle. This isn't true, for if I remember correctly, he was ordained as an apostle in 1943; this book was published in 1969, so on the contrary, he'd been an apostle for about 25 years (I may be slightly off on some of the dates since I'm reciting them from memory).However, it was still before he became President of the Church (1973), and anyone who teaches anything beyond the scope of the scriptures (with the exception of the President of the Church) is stating their opinion. So yes, some of what Elder Kimball wrote was his own opinion, but just because it's his opinion doesn't automatically make it wrong. As Paul wrote, \\"Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.\\"One important thing to note is that Elder Kimball doesn't take each sin and go through their respective processes of repentance and forgiveness immediately. Rather, he talks about one sin after another, explaining why they are sins, etc., before going in depth on how to become free from them. So if you feel overloaded with guilt upon reading, there's a good chance you're not seeing the end from the beginning. It is probably better to read this book topically rather than sequentially.The quotation on the possibility of death being a better fate than rape reminds me of one of the books of the Apocrypha, \\"The History of Susanna.\\" Anyone interested in this perspective on virtue over life could read this."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"The general theme of this book is that you are never worthy. You are never good enough. It is better to die than to have the appearance of sin. It is no wonder that where Mormon populations are highest (Utah, Idaho, Arizona) the use of anti-depressants is three times the national average. Read this book if you want to feel bad about yourself or if you feel the need for self flagellation. I found nothing uplifting in this book."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"This book states that it's better to die than survive a rape:\\"Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity. Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained. Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle.\\" (p.196)How much more twisted can it get?"},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"Kimball's book is all about inducing guilt in the reader. As noted in \\"The Subtle Power of Spritual Abuse\\" by Johnson & VanVonderen shaming is a type of spiritual abuse and Mormons are very good at that. All the following points as pointed out by the authors may be found in the way Mormon Leadership handle people or intimate the workings of God to people: \\"God rewards spritually with material goods\\", \\"You can never say no to those in religious authority\\", \\"The existance of trouble in your life indicates a lack of faith\\", and \\"everyone in the ministry is called by God, is appropriate, and must be trusted\\". Mormon religious leaders receive no training in counseling or psychology but yet are told that they can do it because they have been called by God. Without training it is very easy to slip into a mode of spiritual abuse. And this book does not help alleviate this but helps to foster it."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"There is much controversey surrounding the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Mormons). Whether you agree or disagree with the chruch and its teachings, this book is still a \\"Mormon Classic.\\" Not counting the standard works (The Bible, The Book of Mormon, The Doctrine and Covenants, The Pearl of Great Price) and books published by the church, I would count this as one of the top ten books from the Mormon literature.Spencer W Kimball was made the president of the Church in 1973. He wrote this book before he became the president of the church. He wrote it to an audience of Church members and non-members for three reasons (This is from the book's preface.)First, he felt a need for the book because of the many people he had worked with whose lives have many problems as a result of sin. His experiences provided a basis for such a book.Second, in his own words: \\"to make the joyous affirmation that man can be literally transformed by his own repentance and by God's gift of forgiveness.\\" (preface)Third, to provide those in leadership positions a resource to assist those who seek help with their repentance.It is assumed that the reader of this book has:1) Belief in a perfect loving God2) Belief in a premortal existence3) Belief in Jesus Christ and forgiveness through his meritsIf you don't believe (or can't pretend to believe) these things, this book might be a little muchThe book talks about sin, repentance, forgiveness and the power that Christ has to heal and forgive. In the preface he says, \\"Because men and women are human and normally carnally minded, and because to do evil is usually easier than to do right, and because \\"all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,\\" perhaps I have quoted far more scriptures on this subject of sexual sin than on any other.\\" It is true, this book does address sexual sins very directly. Perhaps it is because sins of this type are more sensitive and not talked about as openly as some others.The book might make you feel guilty as other reviewers have claimed. But, the goal of the book is not to create guilt as an end. The goal is to help others repent and find the happiness only available through the miracle of forgiveness. The book is very clear that repentance is not easy. It is very clear that the difficult path to forgiveness is worth it for the happiness in the end."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"This book tells you more about Mormon beliefs than any of the so-called scriptures Mormons sort of believe in. Here is a parable that should help people understand Mormonism as projected in this book.I give you a mortgage of $1,000/month. I also employ you and give you a $1,000/month salary. Recognizing your human frailties, i.e., the need for food and clothing, you can't quite make the full payment. You come on hands and knees and ask for forgiveness. I look down on you with pity, and agree to let you go by for another month, however I start charging you penalty and interest on your deficiency.After a while, you start getting really down on yourself, because you are continually in my debt, and you feel guilty because this human frailty of yours makes it so you can't meet your obligations to me. Once a week, I stand before you and others who owe me money and give you a pep talk about how to overcome your frailty. You start each week with a renewed commitment to overcome your human frailties, but by Tuesday morning, you've eaten again and bought some socks and shoes because of the frostbite is turning your toes black.Broken and demoralized, you get farther and farther in debt and continue to have people telling you how unworthy you are because you are so far in debt to me. Every once in a while, I throw you a bone or two and praise you for your efforts. However, you are now living in a dark and tired world of dependence.If this sort of existence appeals to you, I can give you a number to call for your free Book of Mormon and Mormon missionaries will personally deliver one. There are good things about Mormons and Mormonism, don't get me wrong. However, you will live a life of spiritual, physical and intellectual dependence to some myopic old men who practice therapy without a license or even a modicum of revelation.Spencer W. Kimball meant well. But he believed his own myths and wrote one of the most devestating books in religious history. This book has caused people to take their own lives out of despair and self-loathing.

Thanks to the authorfor putting forth this work of love."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"this book is the worst book i've ever had the misfortune of reading to conclusion. just plain awful.it's kind of surprising that the lds church still pushes this stuff. very outdated and extraordinarily bigoted approach to homosexuality--it argues that masturbation leads to homosexuality and, worse, that homosexuality leads to bestiality.the author's rantings, blatant contempt for sinners and \\"perverts\\" places him, stone held high, squarely among the pharisees who caught the adulteress in the act. and that's what's so troubling about this book. the author, for all his foaming calls for repentance, is very much the hypocrite.young couples are the avowed targets of his wrath. his theme constantly points them to settle for no less than absolute sexual abstinence and marriage in an lds temple, a goal for which he urges them to sacrifice all, with a stern warning not to expect leniency from the church's wrath, nor be bitter over it. yet in his own life, the author not only married outside the temple, but managed to get six months shaved off the standard one year probation as a result.if you come at this book from the perspective that lds prophets do no wrong, and you approach the reading as one willing to share in an extraordinarily harsh condemnation of your sinner neighbors, then you'll probably enjoy it. if you're honest with yourself and your own shortcomings, however, and believe in a merciful, gentle, loving god, stay away from this book."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"This book is beautifully written. By reading it you will understand how forgiving our Heavenly Father is and how to incorporate that same forgiveness into your own life.

It is well-written and well thought out. I have a doctoral degree from U.C. Berkeley and I think I am qualified to comment on the quality of most written materials.

It's an excellent book and a good resource for those studying and teaching the gospel."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"The message of this book is very plain and simple: let go of your pride, recognize your weaknesses, repent of your sins, and you will be happier. Spencer W. Kimball was a great man and Prophet of God who tackled a very difficult topic. Nobody likes hearing that they have sinned. But what this book points out is that most sin is made up of little things, adding up over time, slowly taking control of our lives until we cannot escape without recognizing what we have become, and changing how we live our lives. This book is not about guilt, and its not about arguing over worldly views of what is right and wrong. Its about humility and Christ-like love. Its a very moving and inspirational read, and I highly recommend it to LDS and non-LDS alike."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"I really doubt anyone but a Mormon would even bother to read this book, much less buy it.

Jesus died on the cross for man's salvation and no amount of &quot;good works&quot; is going to get you anywhere. Only Jesus Christ. Man cannot become a god as it very clearly says in the Bible. Besides, the author of this book is a total Mormon nutcase, he claimed to always having conversations with the dead Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, and he even wrote about his experiences traveling in the spiritual world among Joseph Smith and other dead Mormon prophets and leaders.

This book helped me be more sincere. Sincere repentance and in turn, full forgiveness, does mean turning away from our sins, and I think that is what President Kimball made very clear. It was an honest book about what it takes on our part to find peace and happiness from committing sins that bring the opposite, and the miracle of the mercy of Jesus Christ. It brings hope that we truly can find that happiness \\"though our sins be crimson red.\\" This book has definitely motivated me to be a better person, and to strive to develop Christ-like attributes that would improve my life and that of those I associate with.

As the title indicates this is a book on forgiveness. If someone feels worse for having read it the cause is not the message of the book. Rather they feel guilty because they recognize their own lack of moral strength and yet refuse to seek out forgiveness in their own lives. A mature attitude can find comfort and counsel in any work. Those who attempt to criticize this work are actualy criticizing themselves as ineffectual."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"If one still has a conscience then guilt is a natural occurrence and a blessing. We can run from it or relies that it is the Lords gentle or sometimes painful way of drawing us back to the fold. Nothing in this book is Kimble's, nor the Mormon Churches teachings, rather the teachings of Christ himself. Did he not say he could not look upon sin in least degree? When I first read this book, yes, it hurt allot. But I turned to the Lord as I learned and recognized in myself habits and weakness I knew was not in line with the Gospel. He is a loving God and he only wants us to \\"be ye perfect, even as my Father in Heaven is Perfect\\" Are those not His words??? Yah, it hurts a bit and perhaps allot, but It hurt Him more by far. I am so grateful for This book, it is not one to puff us up and sooth over our weakness, rather it digs deep to remove the roots of all evil.Not everyone can handle taking that close a look at their hearts, or want to admit they have sin."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"Ah yes, this is the book that every bishop in every Mormon office has hiding in his polished desk. Bishops give them out free to their \\"sinning\\" worshippers. Do you want to know what's REALLY in this book? A few good horror stories if you're ready for them!Here's a few, just for your sampling pleasure:1)SEX OUTSIDE the bounds of marriage is second only to murder in seriousness. That's right. Getting it on with your sweety is so terrible that the only sin greater is MURDER. I kid you not.2)MURDERERS are not sent to hell (what they call Outer Darkness.) They get to live in God's lowest kingdom. Seems like Saddam may even have a chance!3)IF YOU DENY that the Holy Spirit every touched you (a burning in the bosom or some personal revelation from the Spirit) since joining the Mormon Church, there is NO forgiveness for that and you will be sent to Hell. No amount of repentence can reverse this. By this logic, terrorists and other murderous tyrants have a better chance at being redeemed than a Mormon who says \\"I've never been touched by the spirit\\"!4)PRACTICING HOMOSEXUALITY is a sin, end of story. This sin is also \\"second only to murder.\\" However, if you're gay and you don't \\"do it\\" with others, then you're okay. In Heaven God will take away your gayness and perhaps everything that ever made you YOU in the first place.5)YOU MUST FORGIVE EVERYONE or you won't be forgiven. That's right! No matter what was done to you: kidnap, rape, holocaust, or some killer murdered your spouse/child/dog while you watched, you MUST FORGIVE THEM AND LOVE THEM or God won't forgive you! There's just no way around this one folks...in Heaven you have to love and forgive EVERY human being that ever was or else!6)MAKING OUT (French kissing) is a sin. What? You think I'm joking? The book condemns making out, necking, and squeezing your lovie's buns--or else!!!7)EVEN THINKING ABOUT SEX or noticing someone's shapely legs is a sin. That's because the Devil has convinced humans that it's alright to look at the beautiful human form. *I KID YOU NOT!!* It's in the book....don't buy it, borrow a copy from someone and check the index for anything relating to \\"sex\\" and \\"thought\\". You will be surprised at what you find!8)MARRIAGE IS MANDATORY! Oh, you thought marriage was a choice? HA HA HA HA HA HA are you in for a surprise! God commands that *all male members* must find a wife in this life, NO BUTTS ABOUT IT! Or else, he can't go to the highest level of Heaven. But what about the women?9)GOD'S MORE LENIENT WITH WOMEN in the marriage scene. If for any reason they don't find a hubby in this life, they can find one in the next life. Of course you do realize that most people in Heaven will be women and only a few men, which necessitates POLYGAMY IN HEAVEN. How comforting to know that single women can join the harem up above.10) AND FINALLY, THE BIG ONE OF THEM ALL: YOU MUST PAY TO ENTER HEAVEN. The book doesn't say that directly, but it DOES state that to get to Heaven, you must go to the Mormon Temple. To go to the Mormon Temple, you must pay a tithing of 10% of all your earnings for at least one year before entering. If you don't pay, YOU DON'T GO TO THE TEMPLE AND HENCE YOU DON'T GO TO HEAVEN.I'm being a bit comedic here, but in all seriousness the strange teachings of this church can potentially enslave people and cause them to go through horrible guilt trips about small things like masturbation or things that are none of their business like being gay. Being in this church is like being on a 100 calorie diet--you will starve emotionally, not to mention physically. Mormons leaders like to put strict rules upon their members, which they ALWAYS break, and is why every bishop has stacks of copies of this book ready to distribute to the unrepentant soul. If you feel iffy about this church, do yourself a favor search the net for \\"exmormon\\". You'll find plenty of forums packed with people recovering from Mormonism."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"I read this book when I was still a brainwashed member of the Mormon cult, most likely because my bishop at the time figured I wasn't righteous enough and needed further indoctrination. It's a good read if you are into having guilt and completely unrealistic ideas of sex heaped upon your head. Mr. Kimball was operating from a very narrow worldview, one in which it was seen as virtuous to have sex solely for the purpose of procreation, and in which any other sexual expression was a terrible sin and needed confessing not only to God but to a bishop or other representative of the church. This book, in my opinion, has been, and insofar as it is still in circulation and recommended reading for unsuspecting young Latter-Day Saints, still is responsible for the increased confusion, guilt and suffering of many a poor youngster in the faith trying to navigate his or her way through the already difficult period of transition into young adulthood. I hope and pray that this book dies an early death."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"I am an active LDS member.This book was written before Spencer W. Kimball became the President of the Church.This book has President Kimball's personal views and many of his opinions on sins of omissions, etc are not necessarily inline with LDS doctrines.If you are looking to better understand Christ and learn how to utilize His atonement in your life, I would suggest you pass this book for a much better LDS book called \\"Believing Christ\\" by Stephen Robinson. The views shared in this book are significantly more inline with the teachings of the LDS Church and will really help you feel the tenderness of the Savior's Atonement in your daily life."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"Glancing through the reviews of this book, it's apparent that this book has become polarizing in the Canon of Mormon religious texts. The main reason for the polarization is President Kimball's unfortunate words regarding homosexuals. However, that being said, \\"The Miracle of Forgiveness\\" is worth reading for it's other passages regarding the process of forgiveness and the atonement. Just read the book knowing that some of the points President Kimball makes are not the current views of the LDS Church."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"This is a frank discussion of sin especially sexual sin and the manner in which they ought to be repented. There are many like Laman and Lamuel who take the truth to be hard but this book is truth and it clearly outlines the path that must be taken. Sometimes we need frank gospel discussions that may not be pleasant and Kimball certainly offers that discussion in this book."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"The book was very inexpensive but in great condition and was sent to me quickly."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"Be Forewarned. This book is full of sex. Naughty sex too. If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey - check this book out. The author can't go more than two pages without mentioning sex - even when the chapter is about LYING. He's obsessed.The whole premise of the book is that you are a terrible person. And I don't care who YOU are - it covers that. You, no matter who - are such a Colossal screwup - that it would be a literal MIRACLE if anyone ever forgave you.Especially god.You see. God. Hates. Sin. And YOU are a sinner. And while the book doesn't come right out and say that GOD HATES YOU. Well, he hates pretty much everything you've done and think about. So....It might seem confusing, but I will walk you through it. God made you, in his image - but that image contains a disgusting, lazy, lying, gossiping, whore-mongering, faithless, useless sack of crap who loves Satan and \\"logic\\" more than you love Jesus Christ.And your goal is to take out all that yucky that god created you with so that you can be exactly like god. Yes, the book talks extensively about attaining godhood. That's the ultimate goal for human beings - is to become like god.\\"The natural man is an enemy of god,\\" is a Mormon scripture that is quoted occasionally in the book. It is your job overcome that \\"naturalness\\" in order to become Super-Natural as god is. And unfortunately for us mortals, sex is the most natural thing we can do. Unless, of course, it's homosexual sex which is a \\"sin against nature.\\" God, hates the natural man and the homosexual even though you'd think he'd appreciate the \\"unnaturalness\\" of it. But that would be you using your \\"crafty logic\\" you sinner. Trust me. Sex is exactly like Karate. We learn it so that we never use it except for when appropriate. In the bedroom with our lawful spouses.Just like Karate.In case you are a complete dullard, the book goes into graphic detail about sexual sins so that you have NO excuse before god that what you did felt good, brought you no shame or guilt, but will condemn you for eternity. The book is also VERY clear about the natural consequences of breaking god's moral code:\\"Among the most common sexual sins our young people commit are those of necking and petting. Not only do these improper relations often lead to fornication and abortions - both ugly sins - but in and of themselves the are pernicious evils, and it is often difficult for youth to distinguish where one ends and another begins.\\"If only I had heeded this counsel when I was a young youth. I can't recount how many times I was in the back seat of a car making out with some girl with \\"loose morals\\" when BAM!ABORTION!Like a thief in the night, abortion is skulking around every corner. Just waiting for you to let your guard down. And as youth - how can you tell? Did you simply make out with that lusty girl, or did you have an abortion?Same thing with the swirling vortex of evil that the author brings up that homosexuality will eventually lead to bestiality. The conviction of the author that once someone chooses to act on the temptation for same-sex sex that they can't help but seduce the family goat is so strong that I will defer to author's expertise.He is an expert as well. As I have previously stated, the book goes into graphic detail about sex almost every page. The author has thought about this subject and been involved with it a lot. However, not once does the author mention how amazing it is to have sweet, sweet, non-condemned marital relations with his wife. I guess it is implied at how often he talks about adultery, homosexuality, fornication, petting, that he loves the intimacy of HIS own wife MORE than he loves thinking about what everyone else is doing in the privacy of their own homes.Something else not mentioned very often or not at all in the book. Rape and pedophilia.Rape is discussed from the victim's point of view. Which, ACCORDING TO THE BOOK, you can only claim victimhood if you fought your hardest against the rapist - preferable to the point of death. Rapers are vaguely put in the same category as adulterers and given one sentence. Whereas pages and pages are devoted to people who think sexy thoughts, lie, murder, and don't treat their employees very well.And pedophiles aren't mentioned whatsoever.That MUST have been an editorial oversight. I mean, I can't really think of many things worse than rape and pedophilia. But to be fair, the book doesn't go into much detail about war crimes. However, I don't want to presume too much.Anyway, if you enjoy reading about sex and you're into humiliation - this book is FABULOUS.But don't let your children read it. It is not appropriate at all for children and would leave them emotionally scarred because they can't distinguish reality from fantasy.Which is what this book is all about. Fantasy."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"This is by far the most deplorable book i have ever read.

What you get out of this book will largely depend on where your heart is when you read it.The title of this book is \\"The Miracle of Forgiveness\\". That alone should tell you some of the topics the book is to cover: sin, repentance, and finally, forgiveness through Christ and His Atonement.Yes, this book spends a lot of time discussing sin and the various ways in which one may commit sin (although the discussion is by no means exhaustive). Much of it comes from the author's experience of many years as an ecclesiastical leader. Will this discussion make you feel guilty? Probably. It should. One of the aims of the book is to urge the reader to improve him or herself. Keep in mind, guilt isn't a bad thing. If you don't feel guilty about something you're not likely to change it. Will this discussion offend you? Possibly. If you're the sort that doesn't like to hear that what you're doing is wrong, then yes, you'll find parts of the book to be a hard read.The author of the book is LDS. As such, there is an LDS focus to the writing, but honest-hearted, non-LDS believers in Christ will also find the book to be of value. While there is extensive quoting of LDS scripture in addition to the Bible, and LDS-related experiences, the bottom line is universal to believers in Christ: sin (any sin) makes us unworthy to return to Heaven, and it is the miracle of Christ's Atonement that enables us to become clean and return.Read this book with a humble heart, and a desire to learn and improve yourself, and you'll discover many ways in which you need to improve yourself. You'll also have a better understanding of and appreciation for the Lord Jesus and what He has done for you.Read this book with a skeptical attitude, and you'll probably find plenty of things that offend you, and will dismiss the book, as other reviewers have done.Personally, I found the book to be of great benefit. Sure, it's not easy reading and feeling guilty because of what you read, but with a better understanding of what I am doing wrong, I'm in a better position to change and improve. That's why I read it in the first place."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"Because this book is a crime against humanity and he should have been tried for ever releasing it upon the world. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million or more people have suffered terribly as a result of being A) Human and B) manipulated or in some cases forced to read this pile of filth. Save yourself the 8-10 hours it takes to read it cover to cover and go to your nearest Mormon \\"priesthood\\" holder and ask them to punch you in the face several times. It will be less painful."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"This may be the most hateful book ever conceived, even more so because it purports to be a book about the tender love of God. In fact, it is one of the most useful tools I've seen for tearing down one's self esteem and beating one into submission to the Mormon church (and no, I don't mean humility to God, I mean submitting to the Mormon church).If you love your child, never let them read this book. If you want them to think that God doesn't love them, and that they're worthless unless they're spotless, then give them this book.I speak from experience, having read this book myself and having suffered through the mental trauma it induced. It is only since I've left the Mormon church that I can see it for what it is - the bitter ramblings of a hate-filled man who probably had some sexual deviancy of his own. Spencer W. Kimball, may you rot in the ground and may posterity forget that you ever were."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"In Kimball's book, everybody is evil, including the coffee drinker, but none more so than the homosexual. Kimball finds it regrettable that today's society is more tolerant towards homosexuals than in Old Testament times when homosexuals and other fornicators were stoned to death. No wonder gay mormons are driven to suicide, and not only gay mormons, but all mormons will inevitably fail to live up to Kimball's impossible moral standards (one possible reason people in Utah consume so much antidepressants). This book is guaranteed to cause lots of despair, hopelessnes and crushed self-esteem among many readers. It's just about the worst book you could give to someone who's struggling with any type of personal problem (statements like \\"one should give his or her life rather than to yield to loss of virtue\\" could even be interpreted as to encourage suicide, althouh that, too, is a sin as we learn in a later chapter). He also describes \\"sins against the Holy Ghost\\", which are unforgivable, even if repented.\\"The Miracle of Forgiveness\\" is an example of religious propaganda at its worst. It is designed to keep the flock in line by preventing critical thinking (which is denounced as the sin of rebellion) and demanding obedience to religious authorities (ie the LDS church leaders, including the author); even failure to pay tithes is a sin. The author also spends a lot of time complaining about the declining morals of modern society, where women wear shorts in public and work instead of being housewives and people play golf instead of observing the Sabbath. It's written with a holier-than-thou attitude and the author's contempt and dislike for humanity in general and \\"sexual deviants\\" in particular, is evident throughout the whole book. Kimball likes to give examples of people who have come to him seeking help and these meetings inevitably end with him giving them a condescending lecture about their moral failings. I knew the LDS church was strict but I didn't know they had the type of misantropic, cold-hearted, taliban mentality they must have to promote this fear-and hate-mongering book."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"This book is great great! I learned a lot. It teaches you about self examination and how to get through the forgiveness process."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"People who read this book should be aware that it does talk about some really sensitive topics such as the problems with fornication, adultery and other nasty sins.This book is about obtaining forgiveness and the need for the atonement. Yes the author does talk about very less savory topics but only to condone them and how to recover from a life of sin and obtain the blessings of being morally clean. I am a recovering pornography addict I do not deny it.My bishop urged me to read this book to understand the blessings of the atonement. I love this book. It talks about the true reason why christ came. All the other readers are trying to bash on this book and saying things that are simply not true. I love this book and I know that the principles taught in this book can bring hope,joy and peace to ones life. It certainly has helped me recover from the nasty things I have seen. It has brought peace and hope and joy to my life."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"There are a lot of good parts about this book (remember that he was a general authority, not an apostle, and not the prophet, when he wrote this), and some that aren't quite as good. I am just going to talk about one particular weak area of the book in this review. I note here that I am only responding to about a chapter and a half of this book.I have known quite a few homosexuals in the church, and some of them have ended up committing suicide, some have left the church, and some have devoted themselves to living a life of chastity alone, like a monk.The tone of the chapters that talk about homosexuality are just dripping with revulsion. He calls it, repeatedly, a 'crime against nature' and the 'sin next to murder'. In actuality, President Hinckley has made it clear that there is NOT a double standard, fornication is fornication, and adultery is adultery, whether it is hetero- or homo- sexual.In this book, the author claims that homosexuality arises from obsession with masturbation, then mutual masturbation, etc. I have known gay celibate members of the church who do not masturbate at all.He lambasts homosexuals who feel that it was not a choice they made, saying that we are created in the image of God, and that God is not gay, therefore it has to be a choice and they are thus evil liars (I was paraphrasing in saying 'evil liars' -- his word is 'pervert' (remember, he is describing people who are claiming that they did not choose to be gay here)). The logic here is very poor -- God is also not a paraplegic diabetic, but people can be through no choice of their own as well. I don't even understand why he bothers with that discussion. Whether a person becomes gay through genetics or bad parenting / environmental factors & whatever is completely irrelevant -- neither of these things constitutes an active choice. But even take the situation of bisexuals who have some measure of choice in things.... the only thing that matters is the choice to keep the commandments or not -- and that is what he should focus on here, not this bad logic and name calling.It is very disappointing to see a book that has such a good reputation have a tone of utter revulsion and derision in it towards homosexuals and even has a place in it where the author is calling all gay people who believe they didn't choose to be gay perverts (regardless of whether they are keeping the law of chastity or not).

This book is probably not for those who read for pleasure, but rather for the serious student of the gospel.There are those who have expressed dislike for this book. All I can say is that the book contains absolute truths which are declared boldly, without reservation or equivocation. There is no deceit in President Kimball's honesty and straightforwardness. He has labored to expose the true face of sin and its ugly consequences.

Those who condemn it in this review, have obviously never read it, as some of their criticisms focus on the messenger, not the message.

Such arrogance and condescension is apparently then also marks of being a \\"good Christian\\", if these negative reviews are to be believed.

It will be the most offensive &quot;nightmare&quot; to those who need it the most, and a reassurance to those who understand its message. It all depends on which side of the fence you happen to be on, the side of the Lord, or the side of the world.This book is a call of repentance from one of the LDS Church Prophets. It is a well timed message for our day and age. Even if you are not of the Mormon faith, its basic principals are soundly Christian. It encourages repentance, forgiveness and self-control.Who among us doesn't need repentance, forgiveness or self control?The teachings are very conservative in comparison to the modern day accepted morality, but then I don't remember the Lord putting a time limit on the Commandments, nor does it say, don't do this, unless you have a good reason to."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"For those that are suffering emotionally for any reason, Kimball gives encouragement and guidance in finding peace and healing through the atonement and teachings of Jesus Christ.We all make mistakes. Kimball acknowledges that. Some people make mistakes so huge that it seems impossible to them to have any peace or happiness thereafter. Happily, Kimball uses whole chapters to give hope & guidance about how to allow Christ to help. A major message of this book is that it is never too late for change, healing and peace."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"The last five chapters of this book concerning offering forgiveness to one who has hurt you can be of value. As long as the examples of shaming the \\"offender\\" are ignored. And as long as one understands that forgiving and forgetting entails anger and other \\"negative\\" emotions being felt, released, then naturally forgotten in the process of healing that occurs with healthy grieving. Forgiving and forgetting does not mean a lack of memory of the incident, or pretending it never happened.Since the life blood of addiction is secrets and shame. The information in this book can be used in creating fertile ground for sexual addiction, because of it's shaming tone. If I were the parent of a child struggling with \\"immorality\\" I would discourage that child from reading this book. And I would not recommend this book for a person not struggling with immorality simply because the shaming approach could encourage an unhealthy obsession with sexuality. I don't believe sexuality was ever meant to be given as much power to create fear as this book gives it. (for example, in our home we define \\"pornography\\" as ROADKILL. The dead form of something living, breathing, and beautiful. But, nothing to obsess over)."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"This book is inspirational! Spencer W. Kimball tells it like it is -- in a very biblical way. His approach to recognizing and dealing with mistakes is sorely needed into today's society. There isn't even a hint of moral relativism or spiritual dilution in his words. I for one am weary of the watered-down \\"feel good\\" philosophies one often finds occupying the bestsellers rack at the supermarket. Not everything one does is right! Christ taught that. It shouldn't be a shock to reasonable people that humans are imperfect. Sometimes we have to admit that we are wrongdoers and change. That's called repentance. Most Christians understand this. In fact, the changing of hearts is exactly why Christ had to suffer and die.I would guess that the bitter words of criticism aimed at this book were most likely born out of the rejection of the concept of personal accountability. Once one accepts the fact that one is more often an actor in this life than an unfortunate victim (or pre-programmed automaton) then one can make progress towards real peace and perfection. Thankfully, God is the ultimate judge of what lies within His childrens' hearts, not authors or reviewers. I applaud Amazon.com's generosity in allowing all voices to be heard. I would suggest to those reviewers (especially those who profess to be Christian) who seek to tear down others' beliefs to examine their motivations."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"It is unfortunate that this book is still in print. From the book itself:\\"Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle.\\"In the book, Kimball also sees \\"disobedience to husbands,\\" masturbation, and homosexuality on equal par with murder."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"The author says that the greatest sin is murder, and yet he devotes less than one page to discussing it. He then proceeds to devote three chapters in a row to sex sex sex. He devotes an entire chapter to teenage petting and necking. He says that homosexuals are no more than one per cent of the population, and yet devotes an entire chapter to them. He is very ignorant about the nature and causes of homosexuality. His attitude towards it is venomous. A homosexual should avoid that chapter as he would avoid a rattlesnake. But let us come to the main point. The Christian/Mormon concept of sin is a fake concept. There is no angry or forgiving God in the heavens who is watching your every move. The moral code was invented by men, not by divinities. You don't have to feel guilty or repent of anything within the context of religion. It is of course true that criminal behavior needs to be repented of, but only within a secular context. You may ask your victims to forgive you, but there is no God who has to forgive you for anything. Crime exists, but sin is a fake concept. Pardon me if I repeat myself, but this is the one essential point to understand. You don't have to ask for forgiveness from some imaginary deity who can neither save nor damn you. Thus the whole message of this horrible book is false, was false, and will forever be false. There is no pie in the sky waiting for you after the church has cleaned out your bank account."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"I'm told that this book have been revised after President Kimball died and that several of the more damaging ideas have been removed. I read the original version when I was 21. Rather than helping me progress on my path to godhood, this book had the opposite effect on me. Time and experience has helped me see this book in a different light. I believe this book is more about guilt and scare tactics than wound healing. I've heard the analogy that sin is like a cliff and forgiveness is a hospital at the bottom of the cliff. This book isn't a hospital. This book is a sign screaming about the dangers of the cliff and reiterates in so many ways that no one can survive the cliff or if they do they will never be the same again. The message is that life experiences will forever leave you bruised, damaged, and weak."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"I was a mormon for 39 years and this book helped me to finally see the light. The mormon perspective is one overwhelmingly fraught with fear. A person in fear needs to control others and will gladly use the tools of guilt and shame to achieve that end. If controlling yourself and others through guilt and shame is your style and mission, this will be a great book in justifying your beliefs. For those looking for answers that allow us real personal growth and change, this is book is a step in the wrong direction.I began reading this book because I was sincerely seeking help with the issue of forgiveness. I thought this book would give me some answers. What I got instead was nonsense finalizing (for me) in the section where The Woman caught in adultery is brought to Christ. You know the story.... Christ asks that those without sin cast the first stone and all the woman's accusers leave the scene, stones uncast. Christ then says to the woman, \\"Neither do I condemn thee, go thy way and sin no more.\\" At this point Mr. Kimball says, (and I'm paraphrasing since I do not have the book in front of me) \\"God had NOT forgiven the woman and he could NOT forgive her because she had not yet repented of her sins.\\" The utter absurdity of this statement caused me to throw this book away. Unforgiveness is a poison inside, eating up the person who holds it and often having no effect whatsoever on the \\"offender.\\" So I am to believe that a perfect God is sitting in heaven holding unforgiveness in his perfect heart for each and every sin that has not been properly repented of? Inconceivable to me."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"If you're humble and reading this book in order to change your life... this is the book for you.

I have verified this since I own both the hard-cover version and the eBook Kindle version. Some of the text in the Kindle eBook version simply did not make any sense (yes, I have great comprehension skills when reading), and so I said \\"HUH???\\" which caused me to look it up in the original book. Sure enough, the eBook is missing paragraphs. Truly only worthy of 1 star for the horrible mess in publishing the Kindle version.All in all, the Kindle version is still readable, but you may be confused in chapter 19 a bit (paragraphs missing!) This is minor... but annoying. Other paragraphs are also missing, but tolerable... and there are typo's throughout the Kindle version... but who cares? (I hate spelling police don't you?) Typos? Who Cares. Missing paragraphs? CARE!! Therefore I can only give it 3-stars."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"From reading the reviews I've seen, it's clear that the book is not being reviewed on its own terms. The following are axioms upon which the entire book must be read:1. God is perfect.2. Man is imperfect.3. Forgiveness (becoming perfect anyway) is possible and necessary to be with God eternally.4. It just requires a miracle of God.5. And that miracle happens only after we give it all we've got.If you have a problem with any of the above, you will have a major problem with this book, pure and simple. The whole idea of the book (look at the title) is that the task is too great for man alone, it is truly a miracle, but one we all can enjoy. To trivialize the task or to unduly dismiss its messenger is to trivialize the miracle.Most, if not all, of the negative reviews are a result of overestimating the level of evil God can tolerate in His presence (hint: it's zero) as well as underestimating the level of goodness man can attain with God's help (hint: it's infinite). To read it as what you alone have to do, you will certainly become depressed and discouraged, even defiant or rebellious.

Yes, the book does go into a lot of detail explaining the many ways we can be prideful and sinful, but that is not the main message of the book.The message of this book is that1) We are human and fallible, and can never be perfect.2) God made a way for us to be MADE perfect3) Jesus is that wayI came away from this book with an overwhelming sense and understanding of the role Jesus plays in the Plan of Salvation, and a more pure gratitude for the Atonement itself. I suppose, in a way, part of the aim of this book is make you understand how in need of the Atonement you really are, but I don't think this should be taken to mean you are the scum of the earth. If read with the proper humility and appreciation for God's Plan, this book should help you to understand the function of the Atonement in your own life more clearly than any sermon or lesson ever could.This book should not be read as a lesson in abasement, but rather should be read as a fount of knowledge and enlightenment on how to improve your personal relationship with Christ, and how to truly understand what the Atonement means for YOU."},{"Title":"The miracle of forgiveness","review":"If you are having struggles in life, this is a must read book.

Unlike other Mormon books, this is not an exposition on Mormon doctrine, history or beliefs. It is a practical manual explaining how to put Mormon teachings into practice in our lives. It explains the central role that repentance plays in being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but more importantly, it explains in plain English how to do that. It is the ultimate how-to book for Mormons.I have read it twice, the second time carefully parsing it and outlining all of the most important ideas contained in it. It has done more to change me as a person than anything else I have ever read except the Book of Mormon. Because I read this book I progressed from someone who merely believed Mormon teachings to someone who actually put these teachings into practice and made them part of who I am.Anyone who is sincere, who is a true believer, who is a genuine Christian, who is honest in his desire to follow the Savior, can profit enormously from reading this book and putting it into practice.

These we will discuss in greater detail in a later chapter. There are also sins which approach the unforgivable ones in seriousness but seem to come in the category of the forgivable. These are the diabolical crimes of s-xual impurity. In varied form they run from aberrations involving self-abuse, s-x stimulation, and self-pollution to abhorrent and unnatural practices involving others. Whether named or unnamed in scriptures or the spoken word, any s-xual act or practice which is \\"unnatural\\" or unauthorized is a sin.\\" (p.61)\\"Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity. Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained. Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle.\\" (p.196)\\"The progress toward eternal life is a matter of achieving perfection. Living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation through that perfection which comes by complying with the formula the Lord gave us.\\" (p.208)Oh, what wise council, what strong doctrine this latter-day auspex gives out.

Kimball spent many years working with Latter-day Saint individuals whose lives were a spiritual mess. He organized all of his counsel to them into this book.His advice to people in deep sin who are justifying their behavior is good, but his book fails in two important areas:First, his attitude is one of using shame instead of hope. For people struggling with serious sins, that sometimes may be the right approach. But your average Latter-day Saint is going to find his method unnecessarily harsh, one that takes all the joy out of repentance and living the gospel.Second, his book contains questionable anecdotes and claims. He repeats the late, third-hand account of David W. Patten's encounter with a traveler who claimed to be Cain (p. 127-28), a highly doubtful story that should have been laid to rest, but the myth continues because it's included in this book.

I figured the characters would make that era come alive. The beginning of the book is a bit difficult to read since the author uses the language they used back then. It wasnt very prolific though and so it didnt really pose a problem. The author also didnt specify who was speaking but it was pretty easy to tell and this also didnt prove a problem. The story is very similar to \\"The Jungle\\" and elaborates on how the poor and vulnerable were often exploited by employers, con types and even police and the relief workers that were there to help them. This was all especially pertinent for the women who were often beaten by the men and had many back alley abortions or many children whom would often go hungry. When they went to the government for help oftentimes the women would be claimed as mental and steralization would be recommended. Eugenics was all the rage during this time-to devastating effect. Women were also often given electroshock treatments that made them catatonic or killed them. These treatments were often recommended by the those who these desperate, vulnerable and hungry went to for relief. During all this the story unravels through a 'greenhorn's' introduction to this environment during the thirties. She is a young woman who came from poverty and is trying to support herself while providing her family with one less burden to strive for.

Back then the average musician was limited to a 4-track cassette Portastudio and a couple of SM57s; if you had a 4- or 8-track reel-to-reel tape machine, a separate mixer, a few bits of outboard gear and a half-dozen mics you were sitting sweet!If you're looking for a book that will show you how to turn your laptop or desktop computer into a usable recording studio and get your head around ProTools or any other DAW, you'll need to look elsewhere. This book won't help you.What it is still very useful for is understanding the sheer basics of recording; how microphones, preamps and so on work, signal routing, noise management, the use of EQ and effects, bouncing and mixing. Even rudimentary stuff like like how to solder up your own cables, set up a patch bay and clean the heads on your tape - just in case you still have one - are still as relevant in 2011 as they were 20 years ago.Also in the book's favour is its refreshing \\"make do\\" attitude. With pro-sounding gear more affordable than ever, it is easy to forget - and too many newer books do - that plenty of people still can't afford to drop a thousand dollars or more on their studio. So if you can still only afford a cassette four track and a couple of stomp boxes, it shows you how to get the most out of them.Bit hard to recommend it has a first or only book these days, but if you happen to come across a secondhand copy for a reasonable price it would not be a wasted purchase."},{"Title":"The Musician's Home Recording Handbook (Reference)","review":"Gives well explained information on all aspects of recording. Useful pictures and graphs. Explains the use of certain equipment well. A good, well rounded book for home recording."},{"Title":"The Musician's Home Recording Handbook (Reference)","review":"An excellent book for a musician in desperate need but with no possibility of going into a professional recording studio. All the basic controls are explained, the book deals with recording and post processing in an easy and understandable manner using graphs and photographs. A great book for those that want to produce good music from home, but if you want to get noticed and step away from your home recording studio you should also read \\"How To Make A Fortune In The Music Industry By Doing It Yourself: Your Personal Step-By-Step Guide To Having A Successful Career In The Music Business. ... To Sell Music, Book Shows And Get Noticed!\\" By Ty Cohen, a great book to get you started in the music business ."},{"Title":"The Musician's Home Recording Handbook (Reference)","review":"Gives explanations on equipment,such as effects signal routing,basic mixer functions,tells what mics to buy for what job,covers effects to some extent.But far as hands on recording...this book fails miserably"},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes","review":"I've studied Latin, German, Japanese, and French using various popular methods. This course with its accompanying audio and workbook materials is the best language course that I have ever attempted on my own. Most self-study language courses are either too simple to be of practical use or focus so much on grammar and sentence construction that they turn into drudgery after a few lessons. Unless the course material is engaging, it's very hard to continue the course with no mid-term or final exams as motivation. Simply put, I enjoyed this course so much that I looked forward to each of my weekly self-study sessions."},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes","review":"I received my book in a timely manner as promised. The book itself was in the condition listed, but the listing also said \\"with Audio CD\\". The problem is I only received 1 CD not 2. The CD I received clearly reads \\"CD 2 of 2\\" this means I am missing CD 1 of 2. I would be less upset if I had received the first CD, as that is the one I need for my class at this time. I should point out that at the time I made my purchase I was not aware that the book should have contained 2 CD's, if I had known this I would have been leery of the listing stating \\"with Audio CD\\" not CD's. I now need to purchase the first CD separately and will have to wait for it to be delivered. I prefer to buy my books on line as they are cheaper and for a student this is a very important aspect of maintaining my budget. That said this experience will make me reconsider future purchases. I recommend checking any books purchased and all accompanying accessories immediately after receiving them. I did not do this and that is my mistake."},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes","review":"Unfortunately I bought this thinking it would meet the requirements of the French class. However, it was not as complete as the teacher expected. So I had to buy another book at the bookstore. I returned this book for credit which I believe I have not used as yet."},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes","review":"Positive: fast shipping, price was cheap.Negative: the item condition was worse than described, it looked liked it had been dipped in water. Fortunately there was no missing or torn page."},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes","review":"I find the organization is a little \\"off\\" with learning the tenses and grammar, and there are some small grammatical mistakes. The CD included is good to listen to to hear native accents."},{"Title":"Allons-Y!: Le Francais Par Etapes","review":"Both in this text and in the exercise book, there is a constant use of words that the student has yet to learn and are often not in the glossary. There are also many mistakes in grammar throughout. The decision to try to introduce slang was poorly made, as the slang that is used is incredibly outdated and, even if it were not now, it would be so in a year."},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"I don't remember the last time I read any book that made me feel that way - that I'm on adventure, that I'm learning something, that programming is fun. I think if I read this book as a teenager, I would start programming much earlier. Thanks for this book!"},{"Title":"The Little Schemer - 4th Edition","review":"Little Schemer is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read on the subject of recursion, and what is interesting because they never really go into a formal definition of what recursion is, as most texts on computer science try to. Instead they show the reader time and time again what recursion is, while providing a great series of rules (commandments) on how to get the most out of recursion, particually in a tail-recursive language like Scheme.The book is structured as a series of questions and answers. Each page has several questions on the left hand side, with answers on the right hand side. The overall interpretation of the book is that you can read this without a computer, using pencil and paper to work through the many questions in the book.As the reader progresses they will continue to develop and reimplement many useful tools in Scheme that become more and more practical as the text goes on. What is great about this method is the pacing and the steady revealing of topics and good practices presented by the author. Because they gradually accustom the reader to topics like recursion, list operations, and lambda, by the time they show how define is unneccessary in Scheme due to the Y Combinator this rather challenging concept seems somewhat intuitive.Overall I think this is one of the greatest computer science books I have ever read. Sure it may not formally define things or be the absolute easiest text to read on the Scheme language itself, but this book should not be used as a reference product - it should be used as a tool bye which the reader strengthens their fundamentals in computer science and programmer, whether or not they ever touch Scheme again."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],F={key:0},H={key:1};function j(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",F,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const L=u(B,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-f0991c37"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/20.md","filePath":"library/20.md"}'),E={name:"library/20.md"},q=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{R as __pageData,q as default};
