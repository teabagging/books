But she would have been happy, I think, knowing that people were reading them again and enjoying them.She is one of those cases where a novelist could be extremely popular in her own lifetime and then, almost forgotten. Meanwhile the movies made from her books (including STELLA DALLAS and NOW VOYAGER) show how original and striking her plots were, how unique she was. Sylvia Plath, who wrote her many flattering, almost gushing letters so long as Prouty was giving her money, was vicious about her in private (and in the pages of THE BELL JAR, in which Prouty appears as a menacing, elderly Lesbian, almost like She-Lob at spider). It's funny how the encounter between Plath and Prouty has taken on mythic proportions, and how indeed Prouty's best work approaches thast of Plath in terms of its insight into the human condition, especially of suffering, illness, pain and madness. Anyone who reads NOW VOYAGER, or its \\"prequel,\\" LISA VALE will see that Prouty was intimately familiar with neurosis. Plath might have been taken aback had she realized that Prouty herself had been hospitalized for mental illness when she was a teenager, way back at the turn of the century. In many ways, Prouty's whole life foreshadowed Plath's. We note in NOW VOYAGER the way that Charlotte's stifled New England ways explode when she encounters the debonair, sexy European man who turns her on to Lawrentian sexuality and rebellion--Sylvia and Ted much?Now if only someone would reprint (among others) WHITE FAWN, HOME PORT, GOOD SPORTS and PENCIL SHAVINGS! Olive Higgins Prouty could write and it's time the world realized it."},{"Title":"Now, Voyager (Femmes Fatales)","review":"\\"Now, Voyager\\" is a remarkable publishing event. Here is a timeless tale of love and transformation that first appeared 64 years ago, instantly became a best-seller, went through God only knows how many reprintings before sliding slowly into near-obscurity, along with its author, Olive Higgins Prouty, today all but forgotten. Neither the author nor her book deserved this sorry end, and The Feminist Press is to be congratulated for re-publishing \\"Now, Voyager.\\" The publisher pigeonholes this novel as \\"pulp\\" writing, a sometimes derogatory term implying fiction that is popular but not very well written, and certainly not enduring literature. This novel is in fact anything but \\"pulp\\" fiction: \\"Now, Voyager\\" is a story brilliantly conceived, and the reader who takes a chance on this novel will be repaid with sheer exhilaration as the text soars on every page with rare lyricism and hauntingly beautiful passages.Here's a typical sampler of Prouty's art:\\"The pointed pinnacles of the cathedral loomed up above the heterogeneous mass of buildings surrounding it like the pointed tops of spruce above deciduous trees of various varieties. The buildings crowded down to a string of small boats at the water's edge. The blue bay was full of rippling reflections-sails, roofs, pinnacles, and mountain-tops. The air was full of sunshine, breezes, gulls and gulls' calls. The tenders were already plying between the liner and the shore. Other little boats were chugging here and there, plying through the reflections, trailing long wakes of watered silk.\\"The new edition is a faithful rendition of the original novel. The only changes have been the addition of a foreword and afterword and chapter titles. Misprints in the reprinted edition, not present in the original text, are irritating but fortunately rare. There have been small changes in typography that are indeed helpful in bringing the typography up to a more easily readable modern standard. The republished paperback and hardcover versions are identical, but the paperback has added a thumbnail biography of Prouty and its cover displays a publicity still from the well-known film with Bette Davis and Paul Henreid.While overpriced, the hardcover edition has a binding and cover that are much more robust than those of the original 1941 edition; fittingly, this new hardcover \\"Now, Voyager\\" will last for generations. (A pristine first edition of \\"Now, Voyager\\", if you can find one, sells for over $1000.)"},{"Title":"Now, Voyager (Femmes Fatales)","review":"If you've seen the film, you expect an even greater novel from which the great film of the same title is based. I didn't go for the \\"cheesy cover\\" with the movie actors' photos, nor did I appreciate the \\"modern spin\\" vis-a-vis the publisher's commentary on what is to me a great classic story. I think Warner Bros. improved on the story in their wonderful 1942 movie version. Also, when you watch the film, you don't have to put up with typos, which are not few in this printing!"},{"Title":"Now, Voyager (Femmes Fatales)","review":"This is one of the rare cases where the film is better than the book, I think. However, the film follows the book very faithfully and it is a pretty good story. Charlotte Vale is a dowdy Bostonian who is bullied by her family into what was charmingly then called a nervous breakdown. After a long respite at a \\"sanatorium\\" run by a helpful psychiatrist (plus a good diet, haircut, makeup, wardrobe, and eyebrow shaping) she takes a cruise to Europe. On ship she meets a rather sad-sack married man who finds her blunt awkwardness endearing, and they have a drawn-out unconsummated love affair. The unconsummation somehow works in the context of these two lost souls (the man also had a nervous breakdown) who are good, honest people at heart. Back then (1941) men who left their wives and children paid a serious social cost. So in the end, the two find a rather odd way of being together without compromising either their reputations or their integrity. Olive Higgins Prouty may not have been the greatest writer in the world, but she shows a sensitivity to mental illness and feelings of alienation due to her own struggles with them. Which makes the treatment she got from her far more famous student protege, Sylvia Plath, all the more cruel. Prouty supported Plath financially and emotionally even after her suicide attempt but was viciously lampooned (along with nearly everyone else Plath knew) in \\"The Bell Jar.\\" Even more ironically, there is this passage in Now, Voyager: \\"Everyone who takes his or her own life increases the fear in all his progeny of committing the same act during a period of depression. In fact, every blood relation he possesses gets a drop of the same poison. Nice parting gift. Mighty bad example to set for one's friends and associates, too.\\""},{"Title":"Now, Voyager (Femmes Fatales)","review":"Two much time has elapsed since reading the above mentioned books that I have not rated.

Many of the stories feature one of Howard Norman's typically quirky, unmarried, 'male in his 20s or 30s' narrators. In his novels, these characters have the opportunity to grow on, and charm, the reader - this is less the case within the confines of the short story, so that often what remains with the reader is the eccentricity, without the charm.I found the title story, in which the main protagonist never transcends his wilful eccentricity, to be the least successful among the seven included in this book. \\"Old Swimmers\\", with its alienated teenager and geriatric survivors of a torpedoed ferry, also failed to rise above the quirkiness of its characters. \\"Milk Train\\", in which an engineer considers his life while waiting for rescue in the aftermath of a train crash, seemed pointless, lacking in any kind of resolution.However, I really enjoyed the remaining four stories: \\"Jenny Aloo\\", in which an Eskimo woman believes the spirit of her son has been trapped in a jukebox, \\"Laughing and Crying\\" (a young teenaged boy's confusion following his parents' divorce), \\"Whatever Lola Wants\\" (a man's special 50th birthday gift to his wife), and - the best in the book, in my opinion - \\"Catching Heat\\", in which a racing announcer describes his sadness at the loss of his girlfriend to a jockey.As I said, a mixed bag. But the four best stories are really exceptional. Norman stays on my list of interesting writers to look out for."},{"Title":"Flannery O'Connor's Religion of the Grotesque","review":"Gentry focuses on the role of the narrator and the strategies Flannery O'Connor uses to move characters in her fiction toward achieving redemption.Contends that Mrs. Shortley of \\"The Displaced Person,\\" and the grandmother in \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" serve as \\"extreme examples of the two contrasting transformations O'Connor dramatizes.\\" Suggests that \\"the energy for Mrs. Shortley's redemption comes primarily from within her own psyche, while the grandmother's awakening is forced upon her.\\" Suggests that O'Connor \\"dramatize[s] Mrs. Shortley's peculiar sort of redemption in many works,\\" while \\"the grandmother's more traditional version of redemption -- requiring a conscious response to outside forces -- appears rarely\\" in her fiction.Groups O'Connor's stories into those which demonstrate \\"the positive grotesque\\" wherein characters \\"bring about their own redemption,\\" (as in \\"Revelation,\\" \\"The Enduring Chill,\\" \\"A Circle in the Fire,\\" \\"Greenleaf,\\" \\"A Temple of the Holy Ghost,\\" \\"The Partridge Festival,\\" \\"Parker's Back,\\" \\"The Artificial Nigger,\\" and Judgement Day\\"; and those in which \\"transformation comes from outside,\\" wherein \\"negative grotesqerie\\" prevails, (as in \\"A Late Encounter with the Enemy,\\" \\"A Stroke of Good Fortune,\\" \\"The River,\\" and \\"Everything That Rises Must Converge.\\"Examines Mrs. McIntyre, of \\"The Displaced Person,\\" and The Misfit of \\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find,\\" described as characters \\"who do not complete a grotesque self-redemption.\\" Notes two other stories with similar outcomes: \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own\\" and \\"Good County People.\\"Offers readings of O'Connor's two novels, Wise Blood and The Violent Bear It Away, demonstrating how they \\"constitute her most complex involvement with the grotesque.\\" Concludes that \\"the reader of O'Connor is encouraged to produce an extremely personal reading,\\" as it appears that her \\"greatest act of faith as a writer [was] to assume that 'misreadings' of her work might turn out to be so many more paths to redemption.\\"R.

She shows you how easy the concept is but how it is a lifetime commitment - not easy but tremendously rewarding!"},{"Title":"What Gets Into Us","review":"Fayton, N.C., is a small town in Moira Crone's imagination, but it will strike a truthful chord with anyone who has experienced small-town life, with all its claustrophobic joys and troubles. The South is familiar territory to this New Orleanian, who teaches at Louisiana State University. In \\"What Gets Into Us,\\" a story collection that also works as a fragmented novel with varying points of view, Crone depicts the tangled lives of Southern families -- the secrets of the neighbor next door, the waves of change that came with the civil rights movement and feminism and greedy development. Springing out into the world or slouching homeward, Crone's characters are as real as real can be.In \\"The Ice Garden,\\" winner of the Faulkner/Wisdom Prize, Crone tells a story of Claire McKenzie, one of the most engaging characters in this collection. Daughter of a troubled mother and a father in denial, Claire has more than her share of difficulties to face, but she does, and head-on, as is often the way with Crone's female characters.Crone knows the tangled ties of mothers and daughters: \\"After a while I had the thought that my mother was very brave, compared to other people,\\" Claire says. \\"Because it was so hard for her to live, knowing all she knew, feeling all she felt, as disappointed as she was, as confused and jealous. My mother needed beauty to keep her going. There was just no other way for her. She could never get enough. I must be just like her, I thought, then I thought, no.\\"As with Ellen Gilchrist's beloved Traceleen, Crone's African-American domestic workers often provide the most telling perspectives. Sidney Byrd returns to town for her friend Pauline's funeral and has tea with a grown-up Lily Stark, whom Pauline once rescued from a terrible situation. \\"At the sight of her serving me, I think, well, the time has finally come when Lily and I can talk as if there had been one life in that town in those days, and not two, the one at the front door and the one at the back. But soon I learn.\\"Crone has a gift for the telling phrase that conjures a time, a shared perception. Remember those parties, 'the kind where there was a huge dance band, white tablecloths, rum and Coke, and dinner\\"? Or the days when \\"There were big state hospitals then, with nice grounds, which were peaceful, some of them -- people lived in such places for years, their whole adult lives. Families could take a person there and drop them off.\\" Or consider this description of a desperate woman: \\"She is old now, but she can still throw herself at strangers.\\" Or \\"Being a lady is all about ignoring things.\\" Entire eras, types of people, states of mind are summoned in Crone's gorgeous, memorable sentences.As time works on Fayton and exacts its inevitable toll on human life and spirit, Crone's families -- the Senders, the Starks, the McKenzies, the Cobbs -- experience loss and change, abuse and betrayal and sometimes redemption. The drug of place -- sometimes intoxicating, sometimes poisonous -- gets into the town's inhabitants with its changing architecture, its difficult, sometimes blinding, sometimes obscuring, light. Crone wholly imagines the lives of these people, who might be you or me, in the house next door in any Southern town, with all the lights on and everybody home, dark secrets in every corner.. . . . . . .Book editor Susan Larson can be reached at slarson@timespicayune.com or at (504) 826-3457."},{"Title":"What Gets Into Us","review":"Crone's portrayal of the South in mid-twentieth century is an authentic, gripping view of dysfunction and perceived reality. Claire's understanding of her parents' world grows as she grows. The use of multiple narrators through time to tell the story draws the reader in, even though the individual stories can stand on their own, complete with power, narrative shape, and characters you care about. Like Larry Watson's view of Montana in his novels, Crone makes no real judgment, simply recites the events from vantage points that bring the reader to her own conclusions. Worth reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"What Gets Into Us","review":"These haunting short stories cover about 50 years in a North Carolina town...each story can stand on its own, but since many of the characters weave in and out of all of them, the book is really more like a novel (similar to Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio). The narrators include some of the main characters, so the style of each tale varies; moreover, the people aren't freaks, as many of Sherwood Anderson's characters are----so what happens over the years in this small town is moving and meaningful to the reader in the way that the best literature becomes part of our lives."},{"Title":"Erle P. Halliburton: Cementer","review":"This was a Christmas present for my husband he loved it. He has been looking for it for a few years. It was in excellent condition and I got it quick."},{"Title":"Gazing on truth: Meditations on reality","review":"Meditations on reality is the subtitle of this magnificent but diminutive book. It's physical dimensions belie the power contained therein; though the power of this book flows so gently.Kitty Muggeridge, through these forty meditations, shares with her readers some thoughts on such subjects as love, happiness, marriage, children, suffering and peace. She does all of this in only eighty-two pages. The simple mathematics reveals that each meditation is only about two pages long. This means that one can easily pick up this book and read just a little from anywhere. It's almost like picking up the Bible and reading a few verses of Scripture from whatever page it happens to open at. Which isn't surprising given that this book contains quite a few quotes from Holy Scripture.For me, Kitty's writing highlights two important ideas. One is that facts are not truth. They, along with faith and other intangible concepts, serve to reveal to us what is true, but are not in and of themselves, truth. The other is that reality is the opposite of fantasy. This may seem obvious, but what Kitty so gently tells us, is that if we do not seek out the truth about 'what is real' (the title of the first meditation) then we are doomed to be living in fantasy without even realising it. This book was given to me only a year or two after it was first published in 1985 and in all that time one expression has stayed with me as a most powerful and profound understanding. It is the title of the thirty-third meditation; Individual Love and Collective Concern. One will just have to read the book to fully understand what that's all about. But if I may be permitted, I would offer this one quote from that meditation which for me reveals the essence of the enitre book.\\"The reality of love accepts suffering, and heals and enriches; the fantasy of 'concern' rejects suffering and commits murder.\\"It's seems like strong stuff, I know, but read it! All will be revealed!"},{"Title":"Called to Preside: A Handbook for Laypeople","review":"This is a solid, concise introduction to lay presiding. It includes questions to consider that make it very appropriate for group training. It includes short descriptions of good and bad liturgy so that it teaches by example as well as by instruction. It also makes reference to the official documents of the Church in a manner that will lay to rest concerns about encroaching on the domain of the ordained clergy. Add to this a solid sense of liturgy by the author and one has good training material.The book covers the full range of liturgical concerns - symbols, objects, environment, words, gestures, sprinkling, liturgical flow and timing etc. Occasionally the author makes an error e.g. use of oils by laity; and she imposes her difficulty with masculine father-son terminology upon us all.

They are themselves experts, after all. The author, however, cannot be thus excused; he has produced a rarefied book that will be unreadable to most genuine newcomers, and that is singularly unedifying to this newcomer.Consider this sentence plucked nearly at random from the beginning of chapter 5: \\"Charles-Louis Diderlot (1767-1837), half French, half Swedish, studied and worked under a variety of the eighteenth century's ballet innovators, including Noverre, Dauberval, and both Gatan and Auguste Vestris.\\" Two questions immediately arise. 1) Are the names Noverre, Dauberval, or Gatan and Auguste Vestris supposed to mean anything to a likely reader of a book of this title? 2) Assuming that they do not, what is the reader supposed to learn and retain about the unfamiliar name of Diderlot through its immediate juxtaposition with four additional unfamiliar names?Huh. I guess a bunch of people who were really famous a few centuries ago worked together ... too bad I can't remember any of their names.This sentence is highly typical; the entire book is written with this degree of thoughtlessness. The author breathlessly drops names without context or clarification, and technical terms are used throughout without introduction or explanation. Indeed, the book lacks a basic overview of the technical terminology -- something that one might find useful in a book advertising itself as a complete introduction.The author may be a fine critic (I do not know), but this book warrants a wide berth."},{"Title":"Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet","review":"This book is proof that a good editor can make all the difference. This might have been a great guide, but unfortunately its editor let it wander off in the wrong direction.There's no question that Robert Greskovic knows what he's talking about. He is a talented writer with charm and all manner of neat little anecdotes. But the problem with this book is how he spends his time.The book is 600 pages long, but regrettably half of it is composed of cheesy \\"let-me-walk-you-through-it-and-tell-you-what-you're-seeing\\" descriptions of twelve famous ballets available for home viewing on videotape. Some 300 pages of that stuff.The remaining 300 pages, though, are very interesting. In fact, in reading that first half of the book, you will get a very good idea of the history of ballet, and the names of its major shapers, stars, and proponents. Also, the glossary at the end of the book is both clear and generous.All in all, this book doesn't really come through on its promise. It's sort of an encyclopedia article on the history of ballet worldwide glued onto \\"Leonard Maltin Goes to the Ballet.\\" And the whole notion of teaching readers how to go to the ballet and appreciate it sort of gets left in the wings."},{"Title":"Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet","review":"Noted dance writer and critic Robert Greskovic's handbook is a recommended pick for any who would understand ballet; especially for newcomers to dance. BALLET 101: A COMPLETE GUIDE TO LEARNING AND LOVING THE BALLET isn't just an overview of dance: it's a full history of ballet in general, using specific performances to outline key players, techniques, ballet positions, and notable performances and videos alike.

His is an honest account of the last 30 years in Northern Ireland, from the civil rights movement and the birth of the Provisional IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries to the signing of the Good Friday agreement. It also offers a logical and well-researched analysis of why and how the Provisional IRA lost the war. Hope Against History is a must for all readers of Irish history."},{"Title":"Green labeling 92: The battle over what you can and can't say about your package's environmental features","review":"Having family in Belfast I found this book to be both interesting and factual. It is difficult at best to try to understand the ins and outs of the &quot;Troubles&quot;, but Holland takes a neutral approach in explaining how events have transpired since 1966. I found new information that makes me think that both sides screwed up the peace process and how the English are just as ruthless as the IRA, if maybe not more so. The book cleared up a few questions I had on Bloody Sunday and other pertinent dates in this war. Holland should be commended for keeping the details interesting and at the same time informative. The &quot;Troubles&quot; will never really be a victory for either side but at least it is a little easier to see how things have progressed or regressed through the years. It is hard to stop a war, especially one thats been off and on since the 1100s. May peace be with both sides and the killing stops."},{"Title":"Green labeling 92: The battle over what you can and can't say about your package's environmental features","review":"As I followed the progress of the Good Friday agreement (or, rather, lack thereof), I realized that I knew little about the Northern Irish Troubles before 1995 or so. My salvation came in the shape of this book, which recounts the major events between 1966 and 1998 clearly and intelligibly. It is easy to become lost in the endless cycle of violence and even more violent retribution, yet somehow Holland keeps it focused and readable. His viewpoint even seems to remain objective throughout--surprising, surprising all the hot blood surrounding the issues he discusses. I found it a compelling (albeit grisly) read and have a better understanding for it."},{"Title":"Green labeling 92: The battle over what you can and can't say about your package's environmental features","review":"Hope against History is an accessible, fascinating account and could easily be used as a textbook on the &quot;troubles&quot; of Northern Ireland. Holland provides all the gritty details of life in the war torn ghettoes of Belfast and Derry and does a great job of bringing the conflict to life for the reader. Not only is it a fine history of the conflict but a very engaging portrayal of Northern Ireland culture, both protestant and catholic. A must read for anyone with even a passing interest in Irish or British history and a wonderfully quick read for those well acquainted with all the violence and horror of the Troubles."},{"Title":"Green labeling 92: The battle over what you can and can't say about your package's environmental features","review":"This history of the Troubles is chocked full of people and places involved with the Northern Ireland Struggle.

Teachers in turn wonder why the grammar they teach doesn't seem to \\"stick.\\" Scott Thornbury tries to provide some answers in a clear, readable primer on how to teach grammar.I'm using this book in a course I'm taking in teaching grammar, and I think it's excellent. Numerous books and papers have been written on the subject, and Thornbury neatly summarizes the arguments for and against teaching grammar in a short two chapters. But as a practical matter we DO teach grammar, and Thornbury quickly gets down to the nitty-gritty of explaining and analysing the ways to do it. What I like about this book is the lavish use of examples and sample lessons. He urges that teachers develop personal theories of teaching grammar--there are plenty of theories and methods, but I think one can only decide by trying them on for size. Attention to the organization of the chapters and a neat \\"Conclusions\\" section at the end of every chapter makes navigating through this book easy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Teach Grammar","review":"\\"How to Teach Grammar\\", like others in the series, (How To Teach Pronunciation (Book with Audio CD)), is an excellent and very practical resource. As always, it is written with the classroom teacher in mind, and Scott Thornbury has written a very accessible and very useful book.The book covers some broad areas, such as why teach grammar and even how \\"NOT\\" to teach it. Thornbury gives three broad approaches: teaching grammar from examples, texts and rules. He also covers issues related to correcting it, practicing it and integrating it through a couple of different approaches, (such as PPP and skills-based teaching).I found the book an excellent resource for new ideas and getting a fresh look at a complex issue. If you have been a teach for awhile and happen to be looking for a renewed outlook on grammar, this could be a book that you need to see. I loved it, and still refer to it a lot."},{"Title":"How to Teach Grammar","review":"I think this book is a must-have.

Families were torn apart and they were either sent to Siberia to be locked away or executed, during the years of Josef Stalin's rise to power. Marya and Georgi live in an apartment in Leningrad with their parents, who were children of aristocrats. Marya's family lives in fear that they will suffer for their political views. Since Marya's mother was the daughter of an aristocrat, she tells her stories of living in Winter Palace and the four daughters of the Tsar.One day, Marya encounters a locket shaped in a 4 Leaf Clover and in each leaf there is a picture of a girl, the Tsar's daughters. Marya's father clarifies that the Tsar's family had been executed as enemies of the state. Marya makes a terrible mistake and exposed that her parents lived in the Winter Palace and also brings the locket, which is solid evidence that they knew the Tsar.Marya's parents get arrested and locked away in Siberia, and Marya and Georgi are forced to live with their distasteful neighbors. Fortunately, Marya and Georgi make plans to escape in order to reunite with their parents. They must reach Siberia before the Winter comes, and they begin the impossible journey.The Impossible Journey is a bleak reminder of the appalling incidents that happened during the reign of Josef Stalin. This book made me feel blessed to live in a place where we have freedom, which sometimes I take for granted. To see what happens to Marya and Georgi read The Impossible Journey by Gloria Whelan."},{"Title":"The Impossible Journey","review":"If you liked the book Angel on the Square, by Gloria Whelan, you'll love the squeal The Impossible Journey. The main character from Angel on the Square is Katya. The Impossible Journey is about Katya's children. The story takes place in Russia under the rule of Stalin. Katya and her husband are arrested by fake charges and sent to Siberia. The children, Marya and Georgio, go to stay with their nasty neighbors who only take the children in so they can have the family's possessions. The neighbors plan to send the children to an orphanage, so the children run away and travel an impossible journey to find their parents.

Her parents have been taken by Russia's communist government. Marya sells paintings she made to get money for the trip. Then she and her brother Georgi set off for the town in Siberia in which they know their mother is. On their \\"impossible journey\\" they encounter many things that could either slow them down or help them along the way."},{"Title":"The Impossible Journey","review":"This is the story of a young girl who drags her younger brother from St. Petersburg Russia to an outpost in Siberia in an attempt to reunite with their exiled mother; exiled by the secret police to this far-away place. First they journey by train, then by river, and finally by an even more unusual method. Their father, by the way, had been arrested by Soviet police officers and sent away as well, but his destination couldn't be determined by the children; whereas they were able to learn their mother's whereabouts. This book thus is a grand adventure story (written for young readers), but interesting on another level as well. For the book does provide a semblence of what life was like in the Soviet Russia, and provides a window into that society wherein people were arrested for no reason in the dead of night, seemingly at random, just to keep the citizens of the country passive & afraid. Moreover, the (limited) historical details presented herein are actually factual so those unfamilar with the events of this era will learn a few things. One character in the book helpfully explains a parable within this story of how a bear gets upstaged by a younger, quicker one. \\"When you make our leader look weak you put all of us in danger.\\" Substitute these bears for the leader of Soviet Russia and the Communist Party chief at the time of the city of St. Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and you have the basis for this novel. A charismatic man by the name of Sergei Kirov was the city chief & the person who was apprehensive of this growing ever-more-popular person was dictator Josef Stalin. A character within the story herein classifies real-life Kirov as \\"our best hope,\\" but it isn't to be as Kirov is gunned down in cold blood in 1934 (The world-famous Kirov Ballet company is named after this man, incidentially). Historians (in particular, Amy Knight & Robert Conquest) have persuasively shown how Stalin himself was behind this murder; to remove a potential rival in the making. Stalin then used this incident as an excuse to crack down on all potential Kirov sympathizers to consolidate his (Stalin's) own hold on power (since there weren't elections in Soviet Russia & a leader could only be forced out by those around him). \\"It's people like you,\\" a politcal official thus tells an arrested citizen \\"who are responsible for Kirov's murder.\\" And it was people like that who were arrested and sent off to God knows where---like the parents of the children of this story---traumatizing people far and wide across the Soviet Union so that leaders like Stalin who ran the country from Moscow could continue to do so as they liked. The Soviet Union/ USSR no longer exists, of course, but the legacy of Communist leaders such as Stalin still does linger over Russia even now as it tries to put the nightmare of Communism behind it. And this short entertaining book is a fine introduction to that era for young readers. (06Jun) Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Impossible Journey","review":"This was a great book--full of adventure and very exciting.

The ending of the story is heart-warming, with the discovery of their mother and the return of their father in a house in Siberia owned by an old woman who takes them in.

Although Gillman and Klimkeit's book covers much the same territory as does Moffett, it does so in a more balanced and accessible fashion. The authors are experts in the field: Hans-Joachim Klimkeit is Professor of History of Religions at Bonn University, and an authority on religion in Central Asia, and Ian Gillman has recently retired from the Department of Studies in Religion at the University of Queensland, where he taught for 28 years. The result of their collaboration is a magisterial treatment of Christianity in Asia.The book is divided into 12 chapters of varying length. Klimkeit has written two masterful chapters on Central Asia and China, and Gillman the remainder of the book, including comprehensive chapters on Syria and Palestine, \\"Arabia\\", Armenia and Georgia, Persia, India and South-East Asia, as well as editing the whole. Both authors write from a wide - indeed, magisterial - knowledge of the field and with empathy for the subject matter. They are circumspect in their analysis, not falling into the trap - as other treatments of the topic have sometimes tended to do - of building a theoretical superstructure upon the foundation of a limited range of evidence. Nor do they uncritically accept the evidence that is available, but use it cautiously, with balance and discernment. Thus, Gillman argues against an unquestioning acceptance of the accounts of the Apostle Thomas' ministry in India, and suggests that the alternative originator of Indian Christianity - Thomas of Cana - might be dated in the 8th, rather than in the 4th, century. Similarly, his chapter on South-East Asia does not claim too much, or to engage in \\"wishful thinking\\" based upon slender or non-existent evidence. Both authors present all sides of the question, and argue their case fairly, succinctly and persuasively. I found their treatments convincing.The book covers all aspects of the topic, and its country-by-country coverage of Christianity east of the Mediterranean is set into the overall framework of Jewish and Syriac Christianity, producing an illuminating synthesis. I was particularly impressed with Gillman's summation of the theological controversies that underlay the emergence of Asian Christianity. In a brief 8-page section entitled \\"A Necessary Excursus into Theology\\", he manages to produce the clearest account I have yet seen of the complex issues underlying the theological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries. As he points out, understanding of these various \\"Christianities\\" is essential if one is to understand the development of Asian Christianity. The clarity of his treatment is matched by his discernment and wide knowledge of the issues.To sum up, the book is an excellent analysis of Christianity in Asia to 1500. The only criticism that I would make is that Gillman at times betrays a tendency to riddle his text with short indented quotations which do not always appear necessary, and which interrupt the flow of his writing. Having said that, these stylistic issues do not seriously detract from a most valuable book, which I predict will become the new standard text for the study of early Christianity in Asia. If I could afford only one book on the subject of Asian Christianity before 1500, this is the one in which I would invest. (...)"},{"Title":"Encyclopedic dictionary of mathematics","review":"The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics is an astonishing achievement. The result of an extraordinary, decades-long collaboration among literally hundreds of celebrated Japanese mathematicians, it will not only never be equalled but in all probability will never be challenged. In two massive volumes, the EDM surveys the whole of the mathematical sciences, both pure and applied, through a series of pithy articles containing the key definitions, methods, and results of every mathematical subdiscipline sufficiently coherent to have a name. It also tabulates vast amounts of information -- homotopy groups of spheres, symmetries of ordinary differential equations, characters of finite groups, class numbers of algebraic number fields, and so forth, seemingly, ad infinitum -- available, as far as I know, in no other single reference work.Equipped with a detailed and extensive system of indexes, the EDM makes its myriad resources readily available even to the befuddled; the vaguest, most dimly remembered hint is generally enough to track down a topic or result quickly and easily. Each entry, too, offers its own references to the mathematical literature -- and these invariably include the seminal contributions to the particular area under discussion. But it is important to note that the EDM was written by the Japanese, for the Japanese: many of its references direct the reader to (untranslated, Japanese-language) works in (often inaccessible) Japanese mathematics journals.It is likewise only fair to point out that the EDM is a tool for serious research mathematicians. To keep its component articles brief, it makes full, unapologetic use of a wide variety of notational and expositional economies. The EDM seldom if ever provides a heuristic explanation of anything; although it often gives a bare outline of the historical development of a subject area, it resolutely eschews Toeplitz's &quot;genetic&quot; exposition, in which the crucial problems and examples that engendered a field are placed in the foreground. Only those persons comfortable with a very considerable level of compactness and abstraction in the exposition of mathematical ideas will find the EDM easy reading.A further cautionary note: although the EDM does offer the same tables of integrals and lists of the zeroes of Bessel functions that make up the bulk of a book like Abramowitz and Stegun's, it makes no attempt to be a handy desk reference for the harried engineer who imagines he may someday need a tidbit of mathematical legerdemain to cope with the odd ODE. First and foremost, the EDM is a sophisticated survey of all extant mathematical knowledge. Those who come to it seeking only the solution to some thorny integral will find, besides the solution they seek, a staggeringly vast, undreamt-of universe of profound mathematical ideas. The experience may well leave them stunned and bewildered for days."},{"Title":"Encyclopedic dictionary of mathematics","review":"If my house were on fire and I had only sufficient time to rescue four books, I would likely grab my four-volume Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics, Second Edition (EDM2). Truly, this is one of the most useful books I own. As testimony to this fact one need only observe that there are more bookmarks protruding from my copy of EDM2 than there are pages (well, almost).If you are a mathematician, or if mathematics is central to what you do, you will likely appreciate this collection as it contains wonderfully concise yet informative and authoritative entries on nearly every branch of modern mathematics. Need to refresh your memory on Radon-Nikodym derivatives and their properties? No problem. Are you up on Grassman algebras? If not, you can look it up in EDM2. Interested in game theory? It's in there. What about semi groups, elliptic integrals, perturbation theory, lattice theory, Hilbert spaces, projective geometry, integral geometry, measure theory, geometrical optics, and non-standard analysis? All there!But simply listing the topics covered in EDM2 will not give you an adequate picture of its utility. What is amazing about the book is how much information it can pack into very few pages, yet manage to keep the discussion quite readable. Don't get me wrong; it doesn't read like a Stephen King novel (nor would you want it to). But the entries are self-contained and cogent enough that you can actually learn a good bit about topics that are totally new to you. Of course, you will want to avail yourself of the many cited references to gain a more complete understanding of any given topic, but you will be well on your way to getting acquainted with fundamental definitions and techniques of a hitherto unfamiliar branch of mathematics.Here are several examples: If you look up &quot;polynomial approximation&quot; you will find a succinct discussion that rigorously defines such terms Bernstein polynomials, Chebyshev system, Haar's condition, degree of approximation, moduli of continuity, approximation by Fourier expansions, trigonometric interpolation, Lagrange interpolation, and orthogonal polynomials, and all in FOUR terse but readable pages, with plenty of references at the end. The entry on &quot;geometric optics&quot; covers Fermat's principle, Gauss mappings, Malus's theorem, and aberration, all in TWO pages. The succinct one-page biography of David Hilbert is followed by a one-page synopsis of Hilbert spaces. In a mere eight pages on function spaces it provides what amounts to a condensed survey of functional analysis, covering norms, dual spaces, Besov spaces, the Sobolev-Besov embedding theorem, Kothe spaces, etc.Of course, what you will not find in this book is a single proof. Nor will you find up-to-the-minute esoteric theorems. But then I cannot imagine how such a reference could encompass such things; mathematics is far too vast. Nonetheless, EDM2 has amazing breadth and depth for a meager four-volume collection. And it is written with mathematicians in mind, so the discussions are crisp and rigorous. It's exceedingly well done."},{"Title":"Encyclopedic dictionary of mathematics","review":"I've been using this book in my work as a mathematician since I bought the first english-language edition in 1984. The second english-language edition is not enormously different to the first, but it is an improvement. Both have been by far the most useful reference on my bookshelf for 18 years. I have always found that the coverage is in-depth and yet comprehensible (with a bit of pen-on-paper work). It's especially useful for accessing results from areas other than my own speciality. I've found the differential geometry coverage literally better than the dozen texts on DG which I have bought. It must be worth more than 100 books on the shelf.

Each major field of mathematics is divided into subfields and treated in essay format. There are no synthesizing overview articles. It does a good job of referencing original results and notable texts as of around 1980.To meet their goal of covering all fields of mathematics while keeping EDM2 to a reasonable size, the editors appear to have set two basic limits. First, there is no coverage of methods. You won't find any description of how to do something. The second restriction is on depth. The articles tend to cover about 80% of the terms you would find in an introductory graduate text on the same subject. Often, even those terms are just mentioned in passing. It's useless for help in reading research articles, because the coverage is not sufficiently deep or current.I would recommend EDM2 to any math major. The articles give a good introduction to practically any field and the references are current enough to get you started in the library. There's a lot to be said for the security of having at least something on everything. Get the paperback version as an undergrad, take good care of it until your math library grows enough that you don't refer to it any more, and then pass it on to a younger student."},{"Title":"Encyclopedic dictionary of mathematics","review":"This dictionary is great.

He does this without losing what he sees as the essential &quot;Scripture Principle&quot; that must remain if one is still to be called a Christian.What Pinnock does is opens up the fields of form and historical criticism as being useful fields for the evangelical without compromising their faith. He shows that Scripture is entirely reliable for the use for which it was intended, but our modern view of documents and &quot;scientific&quot; objectivism have caused many evangelicals to enter intot he realm of fundamentalism rather than thoughtful, honest inquiry.There is no doubt that some would be uncomfortable reading this book, as it would perhaps make someone feel that the result is a &quot;low&quot; view of Scripture. Rather, Pinnock wishes to &quot;walk the line&quot; between decetic inerrantists and liberal theologians who wish to do away with orthodox Christian beliefs.The concepts really is not that hard. If we believe that God has spokent through the Bible, then what is wrong about bringing honest questions to it as we read it?Read and Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Scripture Principle","review":"I am rereading the first edition of the work (1984) after over 25 years. I am really impressed with Pinnock's ability to find balance between critical scholarship and orthodox belief. I realize the newer editions might revise his 1984 position somewhat. But based on what he wrote in '84, it's hard to see how anyone could do a better job of touching on all the various issues.However, I do have a basic problem. Late in the book, he talks about the \\"Surplus of meaning\\" (or something similar to that) in the Bible. What he's saying is that sometimes a passage written at one time will come to have additional, and maybe deeper, meanings later as God reveals more of his truth. Now, I don't deny that this is a solid Christian view: as Pinnock shows, it seems to fit the way the Bible writers themselves wrote. They took older texts and gave them new meanings related to the revelation of Christ. They weren't always concerned to follow the original meaning. In theory, the idea makes sense. But it seems that at times, rather than enlightening things, those new uses inhibit people's ability to understand the older texts. For example, Pinnock says the New Testament (Matthew) \\"gave a deeper understanding of Isaiah's prophecy to Ahaz\\" (Isaiah 7:14) by showing it was a prediction of Christ. But in the context, that doesn't make any sense of what Isaiah is saying. He's giving Ahaz a promise that what he fears from powers to the north will not happen. It wouldn't do much good to say the promise would bear fruit 600 years later! It seems Matthew just fastened on an accidental similarity between that text and the story of Christ.A little more complicated example is Daniel 9:25. Pinnock doesn't refer to this verse specifically, but does say at one point that the Book of Daniel seems mostly focused on events in the 2nd century B.C. He doesn't seem too bothered by the idea that it could be a pseudepigraphal book from that time. But if you look into the two varieties of translations of 9:25 represented, say, by the New International and New Revised Standard, you will see that the New International translation corresponds to a traditional attempt to make it a prediction of Christ. Once again, it seems to be an example of people fastening on an accidental correspondence to make something a prediction of Christ. If you combine the 7 and 62 \\"weeks\\" (of years) into 69, as the New International does, you *might* be able to get them to correspond with the time of Christ's birth. But if you do that, the passage doesn't make much sense: it seems to say that the Christ (mashiakh) comes and is cut off at the same time. So what's the meaning of those separate periods of 7 and 62 weeks? The New Revised translation makes more sense.To get back to Pinnock, I just don't see how you can interpret those two interpretations as giving a \\"deeper\\" significance to what the original writers said. On the contrary, they seem to falsify their meanings.I welcome any feedback or further readings someone might suggest.Addition: Since nobody has responded to or rated my review yet, I thought I'd raise another issue. Why is it necessary, for all his sensitivity to problems, for Pinnock to say those reinterpretations are right? Of course essentially, it's because he wants to hold onto the idea of infallibility of scripture. He cannot see the Bible as simply an important source of information about God, but must see it as an authoritative statement *from* God. I believe we need to give this idea up. Not that God wasn't involved in the inspiration of the writers, but we need to give up the idea that this makes it infallible. Even Pinnock admits towards the end that, from all appearances, God willed that we use discernment in our understanding of scripture in its many different forms and genres. We cannot simply accept all its statements at face value. But if that's true, why does it have to have the unique status Pinnock gives it? I don't see why recognizing that Matthew's interpretation of Isaiah was inaccurate means we therefore give up any reason to believe the things the Bible says. We shouldn't completely dismiss any source of information just because it's imperfect in some way."},{"Title":"How to Design and Report Experiments","review":"This book is an excellent tool for researchers and anyone wishing to conduct statistically sound experiments.

Unlike many books written strictly for business, this publication is alive with style, relevant quotations, humorous quips and interesting fonts. Whereas beauty is only skin deep, this book has helpful and attractive information from cover to cover. Author Jim Clemmer is the founder and president of The CLEMMER Group, a strategic consulting firm. Jim is a best selling author, workshop/retreat leader, and keynote speaker on organization improvement, leadership development, and personal effectiveness. Clemmer presents the values and philosophy he models to others in this fine book.One of the main messages that clearly jumps out at the reader is this powerful theme...leadership and change is a living philosophy that must permeate every aspect of life including family, career, personal responsibility and self-fulfillment. Many business books on leadership put the various life roles of a leader in separate boxes. Business is one box, family life is another box, personal goals and self-actualization in yet another box. It is often assumed that these various roles have little to do with each other and for this reason family life and spirituality are typically ignored. &quot;Growing the Distance&quot; is not afraid to challenge this misconception by boldly discussing a leader's various interconnected roles!&quot;Growing the Distance&quot; is a book about creating positive change within yourself rather than being the victim of change. Its powerful premise is that we can begin from where we are today, and choose where we want to be tomorrow. By making these choices we can grow the distance. Clemmer believes that each of us can develop the qualities of leadership that reside inside us no matter what our position in life. This publication discusses what leadership is, why change is essential, and the importance of vision, values and purpose. Clemmer encourages personal accountability for our choices and writes how we can learn and grow from disappointments. He encourages us to find commitment and passion in our workplace, as well as in spirit, and meaning within our lives. He proceeds to discuss growth and personal development while reminding us that great leaders are able to energize others to motivate themselves.If you want to read a book and be enthusiastic about your leadership potential, &quot;Growing the Distance&quot; is a must.

Their mother and father have been kidnapped by United States soldiers and sent to Fort Sumner where they will work as servants and slaves in a massive prison designed to hold all the Navajo people. Sarah and her sister must pick their way over the land, hoping to reunite themselves with their extended family and, then, with their mother and father. As the families are reunited and then sent trudging the long walk to Fort Sumner, and as soldiers murder their people for being too old, too slow, or too pregnant to keep up, Sarah overcomes the fear and sorrow in her heart to tell stories in the evenings, stories to chase away their sorrow.Ann Turner has done a wonderful job of presenting the horror and pain encountered on these forced marches to prison. While she provides a \\"nice soldier\\" as a counterpoint to his companions, it is brutally clear that the majority of the soldiers treat the American Indians most shamefully, and the narrator and her sister are warned carefully to never wander alone, for the soldiers \\"are cruel to our women\\". The plight of the men is also poignant, as they labor like slaves in the fields and feel helpless and heartbroken that they cannot protect their families from the horrors visited upon them. The children struggle to be brave and strong, and Sarah in particular is able to heal her father's heartbreak with cleverness, carefully guarded food and medicines, and love.For parents, this book bares a terrible truth about our nation's history and shines the light on our crimes so that we may not repeat these crimes again in the future. This is not, however, light reading. Although Sarah and her extended family remain safe through her determination and cleverness, many other Navajo die badly, with the elderly falling prey to the cold weather, and a heavily pregnant woman murdered by soldiers because she went into labor. Rape is hinted at, when the young girls are warned to not bathe naked because the soldiers are cruel to the women. Though this is an important book for both children and adults to read, sensitive children may find a good deal of the subject matter upsetting.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"This book is about Sarah Nita and her sister .

When they got to the Fort, the first thing that Sarah Nita did was to look for her mom and dad.Then the Treaty of 1868 was when the Native Americans were released from the place that they knew was no good for them.I thought that the book was interesting because my ancestors were forced to go on that walk and I would recommend this book to other Native Americans who wants to know about the Long Walk. I just hope the some people will realize what they did to are Native Americans. And Yes, we are Native Americans from the New Mexico that care about what happened in the past and that is willing to help out our People."},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, it was pretty interesting and kind of sad because I felt sorry for the Native Americans. I also thought that Sara Nita was a very brave young girl because she stood up for her family."},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"I enjoyed the story greatly. It was fun learning about tbe Navajos. I liked Sarah a lot. The Long Walk was completely heart breaking."},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"I just read this book yesterday and I liked it a whole lot. However, this Ann Warren Turner must be new to this series. If you have read this book, you'll probably know what I'm talking about but if not...... Well, at first I thought that the Sarah Nita in the book was writing in the diary. I couldn't understand why there wasn't a date and how come at the beginning, it talked about how 'Grandma told me to write what she told me in this book that the teacher gave me,' in italics. Of course, that isn't exactly how it went. Anyway, every so many pages, there would be that italic thing again telling how &quot;Sarah Nita&quot;'s hands hurt from writing. Well, on the last &quot; italic thingy&quot;, I finally got the book straight. It turned out that &quot;Grandma&quot; was the Sarah Nita in the diary and the &quot;Sarah Nita&quot; in the italic block was actually the daughter of the Sarah Nita in the story's child. Now I know personally that if a person tells you a bit of the book ( not too much!) then you will want to read the book even more than before. I will do just that. Sarah Nita's family gets taken by soldiers so she and her sister travel to a sacred place to the Navajo. Then the people in the sacred place get taken by soldiers and they have to WALK to a fort, which is where the Navojos are kept. If you want to know what happens next, read this book. And what happens, well, it's definatly not you expectations!"},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"This Dear America book tells the story of 13-year-old Sarah Nita, who together with other Navajos is forced to endure the 400-mile Long Walk to Fort Sumner with many casualties along the way. The picture painted is one of great suffering and sorrow, though the Navajo spirit endured despite all the humiliation and cruelty they suffered.At the end of the book, there is a historical note by the author as well as a collection of historical photographs depicting the Navajos' way of life, their captivity in Fort Sumner, a Navajo prayer and maps. All in all, this is a riveting read about a tragic part of American history and highly recommended to those interested in history."},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"I loved this book.

The writer (who is Anglo)wrote this book with the historical facts all wrong. The main character Sara Nita has an English name and the Navajo's didn't get English name until they were forced to the American schools. It is good to have someone write about the Navajo's but they should get their facts correct. The Americans were too nice in this book. I am Navajo and from what my Elders tell me they were cruel to my people."},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"This book was about a thirteen-year-old Navajo Indian girl on the Long Walk in 1863-1864. It showed how terrible the Native Americans were treated back then, even more than My Heart is on the Ground, another wonderful Dear America book. I highly reccomend reading this."},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"First of all I would like to say that I am not Navajo, do not know Navajo culture and therefore cannot talk about this book's cultural content. But I do study US history and can say that it is definitely lacking in historical accuracy. As a reader I can say that it is confusing.The book is about Sarah Nita (I have to wonder how a girl who speaks only Navajo got an English name) is living with her family, peacefully, when one day her family is carried off by United States soldiers. Sarah Nita and her sister travel for many days to reach some of their father's relatives in a distant area. But after the girls reach the relatives, they too are taken by the American troops. The people are forced to walk for days on little food and water. They reach a camp and are then forced to walk some more.Okay now you know what the story is about. Let me tell you why I gave this book only one star.First of all it is a well known fact that if a pregnant woman was going into labor, on this death walk, would be shot because her giving birth would slow everyone down. In the book this only happens once or twice. In actuality it happened on a daily basis.One statement in the book says that the soldiers were sometimes cruel to the women. Which is true, but that statement makes no sense to a ten-year-old child reading it. Take it from me; I read this at a fairly young age (about ten or eleven) and I did not understand that statement until about a year ago (I am a teenager now).One more thing. This book glorifies the white soldiers! There are several instances in the book that refer to nice soldiers. Which of course might have happened but if it did there is no recorded evidence of it. As a Native American I personally find that insulting.I would not reccomend this book to anyone.P.S. In writng this reveiw I mean no disrespect towards the people, and their descendants, who had to suffer through such a horrible atrocity. I am only trying to state my opinion."},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"In the beginning of the book shows the part where she is with her family when the Amercian soldiers take her family when she is with her younger sister, Kaibah, herding sheep. Shara Nita is a very good story teller and Kaibah likes to listen to her stories.When she heard someone scream she hopes it is not her mother, she tries to go to her family but her dog, Silvercoat, does not let them pass because he does not want them to get captured by the white man.When they return to their home their family is not there. They decided to go to Caynon de Chelly to find their family from their father's side of the family. Sarah Nita and Kaibah had found the caynon on their own just to be with her family again.They had found some people who were related to them and they stay with them until this evil time has pass. They were caught in the caynon walls when High Jumper had poked his head out and one of the white man had saw them.They were taken to another place where they had to eat the white mans food and they did not like it at all because it was not good for their stomaches.Some of the man and boys had run away because they didn't not like the way they were treated. When went on marching there was some old elders and pregnant woman who got shot because they could not walk any more.When they reach Fort Sumner, Sarah Nita and Kaibah were looking for their parents. They had stayed with the people they found as their relatives to get to Fort Sumner. When they found their family members, her mother was a slave for the white man, and her father was very sick. This is a very emotional and very sad book to us, Navajos.I'm am tell you this because this is a cultural thing to the Native Amercians. I am a Native Amercian and this is my history that is part of our lives and know one that is a Navajo will ever forget this time of the white man, which is also known as \\"The Long Walk\\"."},{"Title":"THE GIRL WHO CHASED AWAY SORROW","review":"This book was real page turner I loved it I am a huge fan of the Dear america series and this was one of the best booksI have read in the series.

It got better once there was some excitment, after Sarah Nita's family was taken by the soldiers, but It still had an element of boredem in it.

Now that US Corporations are under the microscope only the willingly transparent will succeed in attracting domestic and foreign investors.The common good, described by Peter Drucker as \\"Civil society and its common decencies\\" demands a return to basic values and senior executives must be acutely aware that gaming the system today can only lead to penalties from regulators and investors.The 'earnings game' needs to be replaced by a spirit of transparency toward all stakeholders to ensure they have what they need to make informed decisions.The Three Tier Model of corporate transparency so clearly articulated by DiPiazza and Eccles in Building Public Trust provides the map through the complex maze of GAAP, compliance etc., with a centered moral compass. This book belongs on every professional manager's bookshelf as an essential reference and reminder."},{"Title":"Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting","review":"Working with Price Waterhouse Cooper, Robert Eccles has delivered the perfect companion to his last book, &quot;The Value Reporting Revolution&quot;. If you're interested in investing or just trying to understand what is happening in the world of business, there is no excuse for not reading this book. Not as complex as his last book, &quot;Building Public Trust&quot; is a concise overview of what needs to change in America's accounting system. A quick read and very informative."},{"Title":"Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting","review":"Kudos to the authors and their editorial team for managing to publish this quickly enough to become part of the debate. With luck, some of what the authors have to say may even become part of the solution."},{"Title":"Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting","review":"There is a risk that this thoughtful proposal for a new way of formatting business disclosure will be overshadowed by the spectacular bankruptcies and accounting scandals of the day. What the market appears to be looking for in the summer of 2002, with headlines of business disasters at Enron, Global Crossing, Adelphia Communications, and WorldCom, are corporate wrongdoers in orange jumpsuits and silver bullet solutions from the SEC and Congress. But \\"building public trust\\" requires a more patiently developed strategy as well as immediate action. The underlying issue here is a spirit of transparency, a charged word for anyone in the \\"corporate reporting supply chain\\" (viz., corporate captains, accountants, security analysts, investors). Transparency is nothing less than a legal and ethical obligation to make available sufficient information on which to base an investment decision. More transparency will not prevent business failure, the capitalist's place of Hell, but it does offer the promise of fewer shocks, less investor pain, and a more efficient deployment of capital. Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr and Robert G. Eccles call for a three tiered approach to reporting this information. It is a holistic approach in search of the \\"real economic entity\\" and an attempt to move away from the obsession with quarterly earnings numbers, the so-called \\"earnings game\\". Is there a place for pro forma earnings? Pro forma earnings, so maligned, may have a useful role for highly acquisitive companies where unusual events are a pattern. But pro forma should be supplemental to GAAP [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles] not a substitute. At the base of the authors' three tiered model is a reconciliation of GAAP with other country-based standards to achieve a Global standard. At a second level of disclosure industry specific issues need to be reported and evaluated. It makes sense that an R&D pipeline of new drugs is critical to a pharmaceutical company, while inventory turnover is paramount to a warehouse retailer, and market share gains the key value driver for a computer manufacturer. While progress has been made on setting global accounting standards, much work is needed by industry associations to define and measure values especially important within their sector. Tier three information would also report on many nonfinancial issues identifed by a company as important to them in particular such as initiatives on product and service quality, customer loyalty, employee satisfaction, etc. If these matters are, as surveys show, a high priority with companies, they should be reported, evaluated, and factored in investment decisions. The internet offers an opportunity to make this information available on a continuous basis. The use of XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language) by Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, and a few other companies allows information to be 'tagged' with a contextual description for retrieval wherever it is buried. Accessibility is just another aspect of transparency. This is a slim book with an ambitious agenda that should be read by board members of publicly reporting companies."},{"Title":"Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting","review":"This book is not what I expected. A friend who knows I occasionally sit on boards passed it along. I was suspicious--most books by consulting firms are really pamphlets on steroids, a cute idea puffed up by a bit of bombast, some ambiguous examples, and a metaphor that the author thinks is profound but really reads like something from the margins of a high school year book. Still, you have to read your friends' book recommendations, so I did. Bottom Line: It's pretty good, and worth a read.I found it a thoughtful and useful take on a very difficult problem. Over my career, I've worked in forty countries. The one difference I have found between those that work and those that don't is public confidence in the institutional fabric. The current loss of faith in the U.S.stock market therefore, is a really, really big deal.This book tackles that issue head on, and offers some good ideas to fix it. Several pieces are particularly good. Directors of Boards should take a look at the Information Supply Chain framework, which is very good. CEO's and CFO's should look at Chapter 4 on metrics. Regulators should seriously tackle this issue of global gaap raised in Chapter 2. (Most large companies are no longer based in just one nation, and having different sets of rules encourages all sorts of gaming that is counterproductive.) Etc.I docked it one star, perhaps unfairly, because of chapters 5 and 6, which I suspect were written by committee. At any rate, they were much less clear and the writing more convoluted than the first four, which were just plain well written.At any rate, it is a well intentioned, honest and well thought out effort. I found it useful enough to put a few yellow stickies here and there, and will keep it on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting","review":"In the wake of the Enron bankruptcy, there has been plenty of teeth-gnashing about what went wrong, but far too little analysis of what we can do to make things better. Samuel A. DiPiazza, Jr., CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Robert G. Eccles, a PwC fellow and former Harvard Business School Professor, take a brave stab at addressing the fundamental shortfalls in the process through which companies report their performance. By proposing a new vision of corporate transparency, the authors take an important first step in reforming the corporate reporting system and restoring investor confidence. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to any readers wondering where the financial community should go from here."},{"Title":"Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting","review":"The public trust in corporate America has been shaken in the wake of several recent accounting scandals and, as a result, the capital markets are in upheaval. There is, rightfully so, a public outcry for reform - the government has cranked up its regulatory machine and members the class-action plaintiff bar are sharpening their litigation pencils. Many question, justifiably so, whether such attempts at reform are the legal equivalent of putting a bandage on a gunshot wound. In addition, investors and other stakeholders query whether there can be any meaningful reform to the extent that special-interests and their representatives (lawyers and accountants) are successful in jockeying for position in these efforts.Messrs. DiPiazza and Eccles present a compelling blueprint for wholesale restructuring of corporate reporting and the concomitant rebuilding of public trust in the capital markets. The foundation for their model is built on the values of transparency, accountability and integrity. Their model -- development of a global GAAP, development and application of industry-specific standards, and establishment of guidelines for disclosure of company specific information -- makes sense given the expansion of capital markets across country-specific boundaries, but also is timely given the wide-availability of enabling technology (i.e., the Internet and XBRL).Meaningful reform cannot be had solely through governmental reform, the lobbying of special interest groups, self-regulation or lawsuits by regulators and disgruntled investors. The end results will likely be half-baked attempts to address the symptoms of the breakdown in corporate reporting and the capital markets, rather than development of a cure. Accordingly, DiPiazza and Eccles stress that meaningful reform through development of their three-tiered model must be had through open dialogue and lines of communication with all members of what they term as the \\"Corporate Reporting Supply Chain\\" which, in a nutshell, includes all stakeholders in the capital markets.\\"Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting\\" provides, in plain English, a detailed description of the problems plaguing corporate reporting and roadmap to a meaningful solution. The road to reform, however, is long and, as DiPiazza and Eccles suggest, requires that the journey (read: participation) be undertaken by ALL members of the Corporate Reporting Supply Chain. The book is a must read for corporate directors and officers, regulators, lawyers, accountants, analysts, the investing public and all other persons who (or whose clients) have a stake in the smooth functioning of the capital markets.The time for open debate on reform is now. It is up to members of the \\"Corporate Reporting Supply Chain\\" whether they want such reform to take the form of a lecture leading to mandates by the few, or an open dialogue leading to a consensus by the majority. This book provides its readers with a grounding for developing the tools to accomplish the latter..."},{"Title":"Building Public Trust: The Future of Corporate Reporting","review":"A most insightful and timely book that is a must read for regulators, politicians, businessmen, investors, and everyone interested in - and worried about - the state of public trust today.

While some of their suggestions state the obvious - that managers should be honest people, for instance - others are more daring. DiPiazza and Eccles propose, for instance, that the internal data managers use to make operational decisions within their company be made available externally. The authors also suggest that each industry follow sector-specific rules, and that accountants be granted more flexibility when they write their audit opinions to reflect what they Really think of the numbers.

While it deals with some rather abstract issues, authour Ramsey Dukes manages to write in a very clear and humourous style which makes for a very engaging read... I found myself thinking over the book throughout the day, while I waited to get back into reading it.The main focus of the book is to examine the deeply ingrained duality (e.g. good/bad, God/devil) which affects most of our beliefs, attitudes and reactions, while proposing a fresher and newer way of thinking and acting. Duality is a very static realm for ideas to be caught in... always bouncing back and forth between good and bad, or lying static somewhere in the middle. Dukes proposes that we advance to a Trinitarian way of thinking, which allows for a flowing, flexible and fluid movement rather than a static binary. As a possible evolutionary path for our thoughts, the trinity is chosen instead of unity, because it permits the possibility for humans to continue generating new possibilities of expression, and maintain the dynamic creative force that is absent in unity. Try thinking about some singular concept, such as \\"a boundless, eternal universe\\"... perhaps your mind soon jumps to questions such as \\"when did it begin?\\" or \\"well, can anything really have no boundaries?\\" or \\"how do we have a concept of eternity, without a concept of limitation, and then how can something limitless contain the concept of limitations\\", or some other confused series of internal debate and questioning that takes a concept based on unity as a starting point. This, Dukes argues, is because unity is very boring for our minds. We are excited by the possibilities of dynamic change and generation.If somebody asks you what the opposite of \\"God\\" is, what would be your reply? The aim of this book is to open your mind, to expand your way of thinking, so that you would be as likely to respond with \\"Trickster\\" as you would with \\"Devil\\". The quality of the Trickster (often a detached, neither good nor evil character) is used by Dukes to explore different ways we can broaden our way of thinking to evolve beyond a restrictive dualistic way of thinking. Examples of three-fold thought include \\"Creation, Maintenance, Destruction\\" and \\"Love, Hate, Indifference\\".Dukes is predominantly a writer on occult philosophy, and a prime instigator in the development of Chaos Magic... so I was a bit surprised while reading this book, because it really seemed to come across more as a book about logic. However, in the last chunk of the book the direction took a very interesting turn and revealed itself as the most practical writing on magic that I have ever encountered by Ramsey Dukes. Amazing, but I won't go into details here. Additionally, the book is an excellent counterpart to both SSOTBME (because of it's exploration in cyclical patterns in thought and in culture) and WORDS MADE FLESH (which considers matter, energy, and information as models of reality... one of the best books I have ever encountered, ever).Changing the way we think is an incredible task, and fortunately this book is so good that I will be happy to reread it several times, and take the effort to implement it into my way of thinking. This may take patience and effort, and may lead to long-lasting changes... if none of this is appealing, fortunately the book is an excellent read and provides page after page of amusement."},{"Title":"Handwriting Analysis Guide to","review":"This book was an excellent book for fine tuning my novice graphology skills.

It contains ten poems or excerpts, both narrative and lyric. The 1847 narrative EVANGELINE takes up over 80% of the total text. This is not a critical edition. It has only one introductory note, with special attention to the dactylic hexameter verse used by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in both EVANGELINE and THE COURTSHIP OF MILES STANDISH. The author's best known example of the dactylic hexameter verse in English (lifted not always happily from classical Greek and Latin) is the first line of EVANGELINE:\\"This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks...\\"This review is about only the poem EVANGELINE: A TALE OF ACADIE.EVANGELINE is as much a religious poem as Francis Thompson's \\"The Hound of Heaven\\" or Gerard Manley Hopkins's \\"The Wreck of the Deutschland\\" or \\"Margaret, Are You Grieving.\\" Like the ILIAD, EVANGELINE's message is that, come what may, the will of God will be done. And like Saint John's Gospel, the message of Longfellow's poem is that God's will can mean that a hero or heroine must undergo undeserved suffering.The poem begins on the peaceful French speaking shores of Maritime Canada in the autumn of 1755. Generations earlier, rugged pioneers had emigrated from Normandy and wrested a living from Acadia (today's Nova Scotia) on difficult lands bordering the ferocious tides of the Bay of Fundy. Richest of the farmers of the little village of Grand-Pre is the 70 year old widower Benedict Bellefontaine. He has a 17-year old daughter Evangeline. In the evening their engagement to marry is solemnly inscribed by the local notary. Next morning father and daughter open their house to receive the congratulations of neighbors.Why have British ships anchored offshore the past four days? At noon the men of Grand-Pre find out; they are summoned to assemble in the church by the British military governor, where they are made prisoners pending deportation. On national security grounds they are informed that every last Acadian will be shipped off to British colonies to the South. For France still controls the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Montreal and much else and Britain regards the conquered Acadians as an alien, disloyal threat to the English-speaking colonies. All Acadian property is forfeit to the Crown. All houses are burned to the ground. Among the men held prisoner are Evangeline's fiance Gabriel Lajeunesse and his anti-British blacksmith father Basil.The Acadians are essentially apolitical. If the British leave them and their Catholic religion in peace, they are too busy farming and fishing to go to war for or against anybody. But their priest says that somehow this forced migration is the will of God, undeserved and unjust though it be. They must accept it patiently.A second tragedy is that the deported Acadians are hustled higgledy-piggledy onto the waiting British vessels. Father is separated from daughter, husband from wife, grandparents from grandchildren. Evangeline's father dies of shock on the beach. Like thousands of other Acadians, Evangeline and Gabriel are herded onto different ships and exiled to different colonies. Only Maryland gives any of its Catholic coreligionists something resembling Christian hospitality: not New York, not Virginia. In a few years Spanish Louisiana invites the \\"Cajuns\\" to come populate the bayoux. Gabriel and his father migrate to the humid plains of southwestern Louisiana, \\"the prairies of fair Opelousas.\\" Evangeline, her guide Father Felician from Grand-Pre, and others travel later down the Mississippi following rumors that Gabriel and Basil have settled amid \\"the lakes of the Atchafalaya.\\" Father and son were indeed there. But Gabriel despairs of ever finding Evangeline and hours before she arrives, sets off as helmsman on a light craft for the American northwest.\\"Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting, unhappy and restless,Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.\\"He passes near an unseen Evangeline.Father Felician and Evangeline come to the comfortable house of Basil, now a wealthy Spanish herdsman. He has sent Gabriel to trade with the Spanish and then trap in the Ozarks. Though Basil promises and delivers a rapid pursuit of the just departed Gabriel, the latter is never quite found. Meanwhile Basil Lajeunesse delivers a paean to the glories of the new Acadia that is much quoted around Lafayette, Louisiana in the 21st Century's revival of all things French Canadian in those parts:\\"Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer,\\"Alone in the evening Evangeline wanders along forest paths, relishing the fact that they have been so often trod by Gabriel. Here is a new Eden and she is a new Eve. All that is lacking is her Adam; and the trees whisper \\"tomorrow\\" and \\"patience.\\"Together Basil and Evangeline learn at the Spanish horse-trading town of Adayes that they had missed Gabriel by only one day. Together they strike out after him into the vast prairies. A violently widowed Indian woman tells Evangeline tales of phantom lovers and Evangeline begins to wonder if she, too, is pursuing a phantom. A Jesuit missionary priest informs them that Gabriel had been with him only six days earlier. He had told the sad story of himself and Evangeline then pushed on. But he promised to return to the mission in the autumn when the hunt was done. So Evangeline lingers there. Week follows week through the seasons:\\"Patience!\\" the priest would say, \\"have faith, and thy prayer will be answered!\\"Decades later, no longer beautiful, Evangeline consciously ceased her search. She felt the call of a new life in William Penn's Philadelphia. Love previously stored up for Gabriel she now showered on strangers.\\"Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others,This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.\\"Evangeline Bellefontaine next followed her Savior for many years as a Sister of Mercy. She became an angel of the poor, a precursor, if you like, of Mother Teresa. Then pestilence struck Philadelphia. On a Saturday morning in summer, Evangeline brought flowers to comfort the dying poor in the almshouse. Suddenly she cried in anguish as she recognized in a nearly dead old man the Gabriel of her youth. For one brief moment her cry and her face returned Adam to the Garden of Eden. The long search was finally over and with it ended the longing that could never be satisfied on this earth.\\"And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, \\"Father, I thank thee!\\"Gabriel and Evangeline lie side by side, unnoticed, in the small Catholic graveyard of Philadelphia. Other hearts ache. Other hands toil. Thousands of feet plod by. But Gabriel and his Evangeline have completed their journey.In Canada some few French exiles have trickled back to Acadia and Bel-Pre, including maidens\\"And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline's story.\\"What was God's plan for these two? Why did Evangeline follow Gabriel so faithfully while he fled ever farther away from his happiness? The poem does not say. -OOO-"},{"Title":"Evangeline and Other Poems","review":"This Dover Thrift Edition makes an economical and convenient introduction to the work of Heendry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882), the American poet who sort of provided the antithesis to Walt Whitman by always looking back to the continental European canon in writing verse on American themes. The volume contains his long poem \\"Evangeline\\" and is rounded out with 9 shorter poems.\\"Evangeline\\" (1847) is a long poem in dactylic hexameters on the expulsion of the Acadians, the French settlers of Nova Scotia who were forced out by the British in 1755. The poem opens with a depiction of happy life in an Acadian village, around the time that the lovely maiden Evangeline is betrothed to the handsome blacksmith's son Gabriel. Immediately after, the British military comes in, and the couple are separated. Evangeline spends long years searching for Gabriel from Louisiana to Michigan and on to Philadelphia. Besides reminding his contemporary readers of the historical tragedy of the Acadian expulsion, \\"Evangeline\\" seems to be Longfellow's tribute to the North American continent and its diversity from the chilly zones of eastern Canada to the feverish bayous of the Cajun land. I enjoyed the plot, and Longfellow is to be praised for successfully creating a long poem in English in dactylic hexameters, as this metre is not at all appropriate for English. I was surprised to see that dactylic hexameter lacks a certain gestalt that other metres have; I love to memorize verse, but little of \\"Evangeline\\" could be committed to memory when written in this verse form.Little of the remaining poems in this volume appeal to me, as I'm not a big fan of typical English rhymed poetry of this period. Nonetheless, \\"The Cross of Snow\\", which Longfellow wrote in memory of his second wife, is quite moving. \\"Divina Commedia\\", a series of six sonnets the poet wrote while translating Dante, have some interesting metaphors."},{"Title":"Evangeline and Other Poems","review":"I got this book of poems for the title piece, Evangeline, which is the romantic story of young lovers separated by politics. Evangeline is the name of the young woman, who spends her life hunting for her lover but finds him too late. This work was written in a poetic form called dactylic hexameter, which is the epic style of poetry used by the ancient Greeks in works like The Iliad and The Odyssey to treat subjects of war and epic journeys, and this form, with its tight construction and singing cadence, is a good one to treat the subject of star-crossed lovers. The poem is a paean to one woman's faithfulness and loyalty and follows her journey over thousands of miles and scores of years as she searches for her man. This was written over a hundred years ago and is a bit overwrought to modern sensibilities; I have heard that it is still taught to middle schoolers in the Atlantic Northeast, and I can see why. The language reaches and yearns, the poetic form is tight and constrictive, and the subject matter would appeal to a young person's sense of the grandiose. That said, I as a middle-aged man still enjoyed the poem, and the other poems in this collection. It reminded me a bit of Romeo and Juliet in its ambition and sweep. I wanted Evangeline to find her guy and get her life together and was appropriately sorrowful when it didn't work out for her. I like stories of star-crossed lovers every once in a while, and this fit the bill nicely. The dactylic hexameter form was a little weird to get used to at first but grew on me as I got a feel for the rhythym of it, and I've since read other poems in this form, though I think this was the best of the bunch. This poem won a lot of attention in its day and continues to entertain today. If you're looking for something a little different from what you're used to and don't mind trying an older form, this poem (and the others in this book) will reward your efforts with a good read."},{"Title":"Evangeline and Other Poems","review":"I was interested in reading Evangeline and a few other Longfellow poems.

It is not offensive but not powerful either."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"A Good Book That Should Receive Some Kind of AwardFor one project in my English class this quarter, I spontaneously decided to read Joy School by Elizabeth Berg. I could not put this book down. It might as well have been tied to my hand, as it rarely saw the bookshelf, a table, or a desk in two weeks.This book was mainly about a girl named Katie, a teenager whose mother has died, so now she is living with her father. To make times worse for Katie, she has moved from her Texas home to Missouri. She doesn't fit in at her new school or in her neighborhood. She has one friend, Cynthia, in her new town. One day she goes ice skating at a nearby pond, and falls through the ice. She manages to get out of the water, and wanders to a gas station across the street. The gas station is run by a man named Jimmy, who Katie develops an instant crush on. Jimmy is ten years older, however, so Katie only tells a few people.Later on in story, Katie meets Taylor Sinn, a new girl at school. Taylor and Katie become friends, and Katie learns some things about Taylor that she would rather not be a part of. For instance, Taylor steals outfits from stores and doesn't pay for meals when she eats out. Taylor also does other things, which I will not go into detail on. I can't say much more without giving away some key plot points, so I'll stop here with the plot outline.I find this book excellent. On a scale, one being awful and ten being the best thing I ever read, this book is way off the chart and has found its way into the twenties. This is in all probability the best book that I ever read to date. I think that everyone should read this book, unless they are under 13 or 14, due to some (a-HEM) adult language/scenes. Otherwise, this book was excellent and if you are looking for a good book, try this one."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"As her readers have come to expect, Elizabeth Berg's book, Joy School, is a wonderful sequel and continuation of the story about Katie, whom we first meet in Durable Goods. And while this book can easily stand alone, I do suggest that both books be read.Joy School now finds Katie once again living with her father but this time on a different army base and in a different part of Texas. Her sister is still off with her boyfriend and instead of her neighbor and confidant Cherylann, Katie now has a housekeeper who becomes her close friend.Although Katie has found it difficult to find true friends, after an accident she does meet an older man, and he becomes her main interest.As Katie forms a serious crush on this 25 year old, it's as if all of the bad in her life is somehow being erased and she thinks to herself that &quot;He will be my joy school.&quot;This is a poignant and memorable story of young love which I imagine many readers will identify with from their own first love experiences."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Please read Durable Goods first as Joy School is the sequel. While you can probably get by without reading the prequel, I think you'll appreciate the continuation of 12 year old Katie's life more if you know her history. In Joy School we find Katie relocated from Texas to Missouri. It's now just Katie &amp; her dad. In this novel we share in Katie's experience of her first crush and the trials and tribulations of trying to fit in to a new school as a teenager. Berg introduces us to some unique friends for Katie and how she struggles to discover her own identity. Once again, Berg excels at viewing the world from a young girl's perspective. It will remind you of your own youth. Katie feels like a new friend-I only wish we could hear more from her!"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I absolutely love Elizabeth Berg and started to fall in love when I first read her novel \\"Open House\\". I was soooo excited to finally read \\"joy school\\". Well, it did not add up to Berg's other books at all, and I was very disappointed. Since I am in my early 20s, I found the character Katie to be nothing like a 13 year old. Her character was very unbelieveable. I constantly felt like I was rolling my eyes at Katie while I was reading. In Berg's other books, the characters are dynamic and interesting and believeable. This book was not all I hoped!"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I was able to read this book in one day (this is with two small children to keep up with). It was an interesting story about a young girl trying to figure life out. The storyline is minimal and it all from her perspective. Interesting book but not fabulous, more like three and a half stars."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"First of all, the marketing of this book made a serious error. The cover of the book does not reflect the fact that this is the sequel to _Durable Goods_. I read _Durable Goods_ many months ago and I bought this book much later. After reading _Joy School_ I still did not make the connection that this was the sequel. Tonight, I read comments of other readers in preparation for writing a reader's review. I discovered to my dismay that I missed a very important fact that this indeed was the sequel! I then closely examined the book and the editorial comments, but no where was a reference to _Joy School_ being the sequel to _Durable Goods._ I felt cheated, as I would have pulled out _Durable Goods_ and reviewed it quickly so as to make the _Joy School_ a more pleasurable experience.However, I must admit that the book stood well enough on it's own.It is a subtle coming of age story of a young preteen faced with a disfunctional family life and the uncertainty of being constantly relocated due to her father being in the service. She falls in love with a man too old for her and is challenged by some neighborhood bullies that leave disgustingly rude notes in the bushes in front of her bedroom. Like a ship trying to find a port in a storm, she is challenged by the friends she meets and heart broken by the problems her family faces.Hopefully, other readers will catch on quicker than I did and make the connection between the two books."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Joy School is the continued story of Katie that we met in Durable Goods.Both books are written for a more young adult audience. Here in Missouri Katie falls in love for the first time. The story is quick, somewhat boring and largely forgettable. I am mostly a huge Berg fan, but this and Durbale Goods were both a disappointment to me. These books just weren't compelling to me like some of her others Talk Before Sleep, Until the real thing comes along, Say When, Open House, and Ordinary Life."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"\\"Joy School\\", written by Elizabeth Berg, is a heartfelt and captivating story for the teen and adult audience. It explores the adolescent life of a thirteen-year-old girl, Katie, and her many adventures and transitions in life. Previously living in a small, hot, Texan town near a military base, Katie makes the very difficult move to Missouri where her new neighbors find pleasure in tormenting her with cruel, hand-written notes propped outside her window on her bushes. At school, Katie is a social outcast and with her older sister Diane no longer living at home, the somewhat recent death of her mother, and the fact that her stern militia father understands very little about women, she seeks comfort and feminine influence in her housekeeper--Ginger. Katie's few friends at school include an overly obsessive misfit named Cynthia and a stunningly beautiful rebel named Taylor; both holding many of Katie's secrets, loves, and lies. Elizabeth Berg explores the different sides and traits of Katie using the two very different friends. Cynthia brings out the child in Katie at times and helps preserve her innocence, where as Taylor shows her how to find thrills in dangerous and exciting things; such as shoplifting and meeting boys. But, Katie has her own unique interests, too; including the 23-year old, gorgeously handsome gas station owner who just so happens to be married. Although age is a large factor in many relationships, it is not for Katie who has fallen completely head-over-heals in love. Katie must learn to move on and that a broken heart can be mended in this hilarious and unbelievably realistic tale of heartbreak and growing up."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"The second in the trilogy about young Katie, daughter of a distant, sometimes kind of abusive, Army father, this book begins where &quot;Durable Goods&quot; left off -- Katie and her father are moving to a new town (in Missouri) and Katie's sister has run off to Mexico with her boyfriend to get away from her dad and his totalitarian rule over their family. Katie isn't too happy with her new school, where she is having trouble making solid friends, or with her new neighbors, who keep putting mean notes in the bush outside her window. And she struggles with the confusion of puberty and the fact her sister left her right when she needed her most. But when she accidentally falls through the ice while skating by herself, she meets Jimmy and immediately falls in love with him. He's much too old for her, and also married, but she is entranced. As their relationship unfolds, so too does Katie's awareness of the pain and intensity first love can bring. Especially when that first love is unrequited.This is another wonderful exploration of what it means to be a girl growing up without a mother and raised by a father who just doesn't really understand. Berg is a beautiful writer and her characters spring to life with a single sentence, a single thought, a single motion. All three books in this series are really short (about 200 small pages), but they are jam-packed with intensity, hilarity, and agony. I highly recommend the full set to anybody who loves coming-of-age novels."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"This is the fourth Elizabeth Berg book I've read, and it has cemented my admiration for this writer. &quot;Joy School&quot; is actually a follow-up to &quot;Durable Goods&quot;, but I wasn't aware of this when I commenced this book. You don't need to have read the first book to enjoy this one. Ms Berg has a real gift for creating wonderfully three-dimensional characters. In this case she's writing in the first person as a teenage girl (often a curly one for some writers) and she pulls it off beautifully. There are funny moments, sad moments, and moments so poignant you feel as though you're the main character yourself. I've just started another of Elizabeth Berg's books, &quot;Range of Motion&quot; and so far, so good. I'll certainly keep buying books by this author - long may she write!"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Joy School is a story about a 12-going-on-13-year-old girl, Katie, learning about life and love. She moves from Texas to Missouri with her father after her mother's death. She tells us about her experience in a new school, finding new friends and trying to fit in. She describes what her life is like and what her daily routine schedule is. Her whole life changes when she sees Jimmy, a 23-year-old married man. She falls in love with him. The age difference and the fact that Jimmy is married do not stop her love for him from growing. In the meantime, Katie writes to Cherylanne, her best friend in Texas, tells Cynthia and Taylor, her friends at her new school, that Jimmy is her boyfriend. Jimmy likes Katie as a &quot;little friend.&quot; She keeps on making up stories in her mind about how he does not get along with his wife and how he is not happy with her, but she is shocked when he tells her that he is leaving to go to Ohio. All of her dreams are destroyed and she is lonely and sad again.This is a good book to read if somebody is interested in an adolescent experiencing first love. First I thought it was going to be slow and boring, but the more you read, the more interesting it gets.I think it is an excellent book, which describes a short period of Katie's life in detail and makes the reader live the story and get so close to the character, Katie, and even feel her sadness at the end of the novel, when Jimmy leaves. It also makes you realize that the hardest period of life was the adolescence and you will be happy that you passed that period of your life."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"You can't go wrong with Elizabeth Berg's stories.

Elizabeth Berg&Auml;&ograve;s, Joy School, tells a story about Katie, a young girl who has just been introduced to her wonderfully new, unfair world of love. Ever since Katie&Auml;s mother&Auml;s death, she has been bashed around by complications of adjustments, both internally and externally. Now relocated in Missouri, she has forced herself to see the glass half full even though her journey to finding new companions is seemingly fruitless. Though saddened by her futile search for friendships, she has managed to find goodness in two comical characters, nauseatingly talented Cynthia and defiantly gorgeous Taylor. But the most notable friend she has made is Jimmy, her 23 year old crush, who has all the qualities she ever wanted in a man. In return for her perpetual love, he heaves a truck load of negative responses at Katie and she is blown away. Though this has scarred her for life, she finds strength in herself to convert this confusion and frustration to a learning experience where she must grow and move on. Berg reaches out to those emotional individuals and makes them feel Katie&Auml;s splintered heart. Joy School&Auml;s tale of innocent first love is poignant and unforgettable. The only disappointment the reader will experience is the shortness of the novel. They will implore Berg for more magnificent and heartfelt stories of Katie. Berg must feed the need."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I was on vacation and needed some books to read while I was away. I finished the books I had already read and needed more. There was a display of Elizabeth Berg's books at the bookstore and something struck me to buy this and Durable Goods. I usually buy different types of novels than this but I thought I would try something new.I am soooo pleased that I did! It has been 11+ years since I was the heroine's age of 12/13 but this book brought me back to my childhood in a beautifully vivid way. Although I was not an Army Brat and my father is very loving and my mother is still living I connected with this character. I was moved by how Elizabeth Berg captured being a preteen. I had a crush like Jimmy, I wrote letters just like Cherylanne, admired misfits like Taylor, and had a friend like Cynthia. Katie's thoughts are put to paper so vividly you will feel like you are watching her in real life or reliving your own childhood.You don't have to be a teenager to relate to this book. Although this (and Durable Goods) would be a wonderful book to introduce to a young girl. If you just want to be taken back to the thoughts and feelings of your childhood (the good, the bad, and the innocence of it all) then read this and Durable Goods.

I loved this book and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"One of the most remarkable aspects of our early adolesence is our ability to make events loom larger than life. Elizabeth Berg carefully inspects the heart of one young women and invests her with those qualities of character and personality which endear her to the reader. This is not merely an investigation of the heart itself, but of the world of love, hope, and fears which inhabit all of us throughout our lives. Coming-of-age novels appeal to us because we, regardless of our chronological age, evolve. Berg convinces us that the way to discover ourselves is to involve ourselves in the larger emotional issues of life, and damn the consequences."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"\\"Joy School\\" is such a touchingly heartbreaking, and at the same time funny book. The exquisite details of young Katie's observations are what make this enthralling novel such a gem.The immediacy of this young girl's feelings and experiences is due to Berg's masterful handling of narrative and dialogue that are totally in sync with a young girl psyche. At the same time, the appeal to the adult reader is unmistakable. I could read this book over and over.Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"When I first started reading this book I thought how can I relate to this?

The other characters are well-developed and interesting, especially Katie's know-it-all friend Cherylanne who sends Katie letters filled with advise about boys.

I enjoyed the books, and feel that Ms. Berg does a good job of capturing the feelings of an adolescent. What is missing in this and Durable Goods is a lot of the sharing and the thoughts of women found in her other books about adults. Of course, it would be inappropriate to include them in this book, but she captures those so incredibly well that this book just can't live up to Range of Motion, Talk Before Sleep, and Pull of the Moon. So I found this book very readable and engrossing, but I did not cling to it the way I did with the others. Worth reading, if you like her work. If this is the first one of hers that you have read, try one--or better, all--of her others, too!Melissa Lenihan"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I chose this rating because the I found the main character, Katie, unbelievable and far too advanced in conceptual thinking for a young girl.

And I have to admit, at one point it had me downright sobbing for Katie, she was that sympathetic for me.This is a must read for anyone past Katie's age -- 13 -- and all adults. I can't praise its glorious writing and deep insights enough."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Easy to read and a very sweet story. I am a busy Mom of 2 little ones and I was able to read this and enjoy it between diapers and bottles and choo-choo's. It is an easy read with a nice story."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"When one is 13, every feeling and emotion is utterly and deeply heightened. The world becomes wrapped around one person and that person happens to be the 13 year old narrator. In this case, the teenager is Katie, whom falls madly in love with a 23 year old Paul Newman look-a-like, whom happens to be married.But love is only one segment of the story. Katie moves to a new state and is meeting new friends--one who is strange and awkward--and one who is beautiful and 13 going on 30. Of course, being a girl, one knows three is a bad mix, so Katie juggles between the two.Berg, once again, creates irresistable characters, such as Nona, the weird old Italian grandma \\"When you-a-come over again. Bring-a-me-a- some whiskey, no?\\"And the priest who listens to Katie's concerns about coming of age. He is absolutely lovely and I want him as my preist, only I'm Baptist! Katie describes him as bent over and old, but seeing everything, looking you in the eye,really listening.\\"Joy School\\" is deliciously delightful. Berg's insights and wisdom is continually right on, witty, and thought provoking. I love this woman. I understand her. She is a true woman's author. \\"Joy School\\" and most of her other books make one feel as if they are eating a sweet bowl of chocolate ice cream--savoring the sugar upon their tongues until they turn the last page."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Joy School has a wonderful flow and explores themes of losses, loves, and friendships of different kinds. Some reviews describe it as a book about first love -- first love is simply one facet. The voice of Katie is true. You will feel her heartbreak and joys within yourself. She is a character that you will think about for days before she starts to fade away. Also Cherylanne and the father. I am so happy to see that there is a sequel out this month! &quot;Durable Goods&quot; (the first in the series) was edgier. Definitely start there."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I loved it. Even though the storyline is familiar, the feeling and the depth of this story are not. It wasn't what I expected--a trite, silly story. Every word is carefully chosen and nothing is in excess. I was pleasantly surprised with the simple, beautiful writing. In some ways, Katie is a very peculiar little girl-woman. Her attention to detail is meticulous and the narration is strange. Innocent, yet perceptive and wise. At the same time, Katie's desperation and yearning for &quot;something more&quot; is something that probably many people can relate to. Katie's genuinely likable--not brilliant, not talented, not beautiful. She's just real and only wants to find where she fits in."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"As the author of young adult fiction I kept wondering if THE JOY SCHOOL was of that genre. But whatever genre, I thought it was a wonderful look into the mind of thirteen-year-old Katie. I've read all but one (TALK BEFORE SLEEP) of Elizabeth Berg's books. She is a marvelous storyteller and THE JOY SCHOOL is proof of that.."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I just finished this book last night, in one sitting. This was my first book by this author, but now I am anxious to read more. It is written in a beautiful style, that one can almost put themselves in Katie's shoes. I loved it!"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Too short would be my only criticism of Joy School, but then, again, how much can a 13-year-old experience, and who can ever get enough Elizabeth Berg? Each of her words is worth 100 of just about anyone else's.I am always disappointed when I realized I've finished a Berg book, even though I usually do it in one sitting and desperately need to eat, work, pee or do something else by then! With this book, I had the same experience I did with Pull of the Moon: I drew a hot bath, poured a glass of wine and didn't notice until I'd read the last page that I was shivering in a tub of ice cold water....with nothing warm but the untouched glass of wine beside me.Elizabeth, you're mesmerizing."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"A wonderful book I think 10's should be saved for only very special books and this is one. You learn much about where joy comes from. I read it in the best possible way immediately after finishing &quot;Durable Goods&quot; Berg's earlier novel which first introduced the characters in &quot;Joy School&quot;"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Joy School, by Elizabeth Berg, takes place in Missouri. Katie, a freshman in high school is an only child who lives with her sometimes-abusive father. Katie's mother had recently died. At her new high school, Katie has trouble fitting in and she makes very few friends. One friend she makes is a shoplifter, while another one is purely a misfit. Katie's neighbors are constantly harassing her with cruel notes left in her bushes in her yard. The housekeeper and Katie's father fall in love, making Katie's life even more complicated. Also, Katie's sister had moved away, gotten pregnant, and got married. While ice-skating in a pond one day near a gas station, Katie falls through the ice. She is rescued by, in her opinion, a handsome young man and immediately she falls in love with the young man who happens to be a married gas attendant. Katie enjoys telling all of her friends the story of how she found true love. What she doesn't tell them is that the gas attendant is married, and is many years older than her. Hoy School is the story of unrequited love. Katie's thoughts are filled with the gas attendant, Jimmy. Jimmy, although nearly ten years older than Katie, is everything Katie could possibly have hoped for in the man of her dreams...Except for the fact that Jimmy is in love with a wife his own. Katie brings presents and tries to show off for him while ice-skating. The book was interesting but too short. Elizabeth Berg's choice of words made the book very easy to read and therefore was a quick read. Also, if it had been longer, the story probably would have been able to develop more thoroughly then it was written. However, it was still very intriguing and hard to put down. One reason it was so interesting and easy to read was because it was so easy to connect with. Katie is forced to deal with the troubles of a terrible gym teacher, a friend who is hard to resist even with her bad qualities, fitting into a new school whose cliques have already been established, harassment by the new neighbors, and a crushing first love. On top of all of these troubles, Katie must deal with growing up through adolescence with no mother, only a strict father. It seems Joy School is full of new twists just about every page. This also added to my enjoyment of this novel. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially girls who are Katie's age. They would find this book most enjoyable because they can relate to so much of the book. Overall, it was a great book; but I think it should have been longer because it was so interesting I wanted it to continue."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"This book is soooo good. I am 13 too and can relate to Katie so much while reading. You have to read it.... it is worth it. As said in another review,,, you will definately miss Katie as soon as your finished this book...

I remember feeling those unbelievably deep emotions. I remember loving an older boy who did not love me back.

She is trying to come to terms with moving to a new state, changes taking place in her body and mind, her own individuality, her first crush...'He is the most beautiful boy, a Paul Newman look-a-like. I will NEVER love anybody like him as long as I live!' (been there)Berg gives Katie insight. We hear her 13 year old thoughts, dreams, and her hilarious observations.She says about one of her teachers...\\"He gives some idiotic assignment,which he probably doesn't even know, then sits there reading a newspaper for the entire hour. He gets paid for this?!\\"Berg, once again, captures the 13 year old voice we remember.(Been there, done that!)

There was so much truth of growing up in there. It was so funny.I recommend this author to anyone who loves to read.Ellen"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"'Joy School' is the continuing story of Katie, whom we were introduced to in 'Durable Goods.' Army brat Katie now lives in Missouri with her father and a housekeeper Ginger.The reader can see how Katie has grown up since her move from Texas and the problems that plague her as a teenager like her classes at school, friends (good and bad) that aren't all true and a crush on an older man. This novel expands more about Katie's life, what she is thinking and how her life has changed since she's moved away from her best friend, Cherylanne. 'Durable Goods' seemed to introduce us to the characters and 'Joy School' expands on them. However, this book can be read on its own without reading the first novel.I enjoyed this book more than 'Durable Goods.' I feel that Elizabeth Berg was able to tell us more about how Katie was feeling and there were more scene actions than the first book. The author also leaves the ending open so that there could be a continuing story of Katie's family."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"For thirteen-year-old Katie, life has been quite confusing since the loss of her mother, the disappearance of her sister and a move from Texas to Missouri. Joy School follows her adventures while trying to make new friends, understand her dictatorial father and experience the pain and heartbreak of first love.Unbeknownst to me, 'Joy School' is actually a follow-up to Berg's 'Durable Goods,' but I didn't have any trouble getting right into the story and understanding how things were playing out. Berg's writing is exceptional -- thought-provoking, as delicate as snow. But somehow the book lacked an emotional intensity I was so hoping for . . . everything felt muted, distilled. I think that was supposed to be part of its charm, and I really did like Katie, but I had a hard time getting immersed in this world.I absolutely loved Berg's 'Dream When You're Feeling Blue,' and 'Joy School' still follows Berg's carefully crafted system of evaluating human and family relationships. I could certainly relate to falling in love for the first time -- and knowing that no one will appreciate how real it is for you, the one so smitten -- but didn't really plunge into the storyline. Fans of Berg will still be intrigued, but it might be a little too slow for others -- there really isn't any \\"action\\" here."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"\\"Young as I am, I know now that everything is about to come. Jimmy will be the place for me to learn the real happiness. He will be my Joy School. My joy. Mine.\\"These words sum up this story, about a 13-year-old girl, Katie, transplanted to Missouri after her mother's death, and subject to the mercurial moods of a stern, inaccessible father; she finds solace in the housekeeper and in her two friends - Cynthia, who is odd and whose grandmother actually interests Katie, with her loud, Italian ways and her penchant for cooking pasta in the middle of the night - and Taylor, a shoplifter, who introduces Katie to her larcenous skills and to make-out sessions at the drive-in theater.And then there is Jimmy - a 23-year-old married man, who comes to her rescue one day when she has fallen through the ice while skating - and who pays her the kind of attention she is sorely lacking in her everyday life.This coming-of-age tale skillfully describes a young girl who is out-of-place in her world - a world set in the fifties or sixties - and who searches for some kind of kinship with the cast of characters placed in her path.We connect with her, in that the author paints a picture of this isolation in such a way that we can relate. We think - Oh, yes, I know what that feels like. And as the story comes to an end, we can feel the hope - just as she experiences it.Joy School (Ballantine Reader's Circle)is memorable, hilarious and heartbreaking.By Laurel-Rain Snow"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"There are few authors who could turn the simple story of thirteen-year-old Katie Nash-a story where Katie only moves, starts high school, and experiences the universal \\"first crush\\"-into a novel that will linger in readers' minds. Even rarer is the author who could make this spare plot into something that is a joyous reading experience the second time around. Luckily, Elizabeth Berg is a writer who accomplishes both of these things.\\"Joy School\\" is a novel that is written so uncannily well that its simplicity and seemingly ordinary character only highlight the outstanding writing. And in this case, \\"well written\\" doesn't mean \\"unable to be enjoyed by anyone but snobbish literary types;\\" it means that Berg has such a complete understanding of her own character that it's breathtaking. Katie's thoughts and actions (and schemes when it comes to her crush Jimmy) perfectly fit a thirteen year old, but at the same time, they are filled with such intelligence and wisdom that it's breathtaking.This is one of those books that is actually deeply comforting to read, since its main character effortlessly and naturally echoes our most private thoughts. As you read Katie's musings about school lunchroom hierarchies, the complexities of friendship, and the pleasures of time alone, you'll be thrilled to find a wise philosopher as well as an everyday teenager.Sweet and poignant, pensive and surprisingly funny, \\"Joy School\\"'s beautifully honest story is not to be missed."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I was not expecting a novel written from the perspective of a 13-year-old girl, but after a few pages I was hooked. It took me right back to junior high, and to the losses and hopes of that age.

Judy Blume for grown ups, in a nutshell."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"\\"Joy School\\" was probably written with a young reader in mind. It is a story of growing up, meeting new friends and having that first crush on an older man. More mature readers will recall their adolescent years and their own \\"first love,\\" whether it was a teacher, the boy next door or in this case, the mechanic down the street. You will also enjoy Katie's friends - some sweet and some bizarre.Thirteen year old Katie's heart is broken when she discovers the love of her dreams, Jim, is married and moving away. Jim is a fine, happily married, twenty-three year old man with a family and thinks of Katie as absolutely nothing more a sweet young girl. Their relationship is completely innocent. He enjoys her visits to the shop, a conversation and game of cards now and then, but has no idea how strongly Katie feels towards him. The end is bittersweet but all a part of growing up. When Jim tells Katie his family is moving, she confesses her true feelings to him. Jim feels her grief and tries to explain to Katie that one day the right boy will come into her life when she least expects it. Needless to say, she is devastated. The reader will laugh with Katie and her friends, share her sorrows, and perhaps say, \\"I remember when ....\\""},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Without a doubt this book flowed easily and couldn't put it down.

Katie misses her best friend Cherylanne, who sends katie letters from time to time, explaining how she is too busy to write because of social commitments such as the prom, boyfriends and school. While Cherylanne is the popular girl in school, Katie is trying to get noticed and is desperate to make just ONE friend.Katie manages to latch on to a few misfits. Cynthia is another misfit who lives with a mother who is obsessive and a grandmother who is a little off the deep end and only speaks in Italian. Katie doesnt' really like cynthia too much, but finds the grandmother a hoot.Another new friend of Katie's is an up and coming model named Taylor whose hobby is shoplifting. Taylor sets katie up on a date, which turns out to be a disaster.Katie also experiences her first crush on another new found friend, Jimmy. Jimmy works for the local gas station and is 23 years old. Although he's married, Katie imagines herself dating him and they soon develop a close friendship.Life couldn't be more complicated, until katie finds out her housekeeper is in love with her father! what more could go wrong?I enjoyed Joy School. Elizabeth Berg is becoming one of my favorite writers. Her characters are always people you wouldn't mind meeting,and you find yourself caring about them. I thought the book was too short, and wouldn't mind reading a sequel."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Joy School is the best book that I have read this year. I totally understood every emotion that Katie went through, although back in 1973 I thought I was all alone. Nona is the funniest character in the book. The use of her words: &quot;What are you gonna do, complain-a-city hall?&quot; at the end of the book was perfect! I am now midway through Elizabeth Berg's Range of Motion and love it too. I plan to read the rest of her novels as well, and recommend this author very highly."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Katie, a lonely 13-year-old living alone with an emotionally distant father, longs for friendships which just don't seem to be happening. Just having moved from Texas to Missouri, Katie waits for sporadic letters from Cherylanne, her former \\"best friend\\" who isn't much of a friend at all; and without any provocation, the twins across the street leave nasty notes in Katie's yard.Then one fateful winter afternoon, Katie decides to ice skate in a small pond behind a gas station. She falls through the ice, and nearly succumbs to the cold wetness when she is helped by Jimmy, the 23-year-old station manager.Katie immediately falls in love, although there is over a decade between them, and she knows that Jimmy is married with a young son. All that matters, she decides, is that she loves him and he must love her back in the same way.As the months progress, Katie continues to visit the gas station. She tells both Cherylanne and her new friends Cynthia and Taylor about him, and it's obvious that Katie truly believes she has a chance at a future with Jimmy. He is, as she dubs it, her \\"joy school,\\" her opportunity to finally learn to be happy for once.There comes a time, of course, when Katie is forced to realize what's really happening -- and as painful as it is, she realizes that the experience has caused her to mature, just as all the other people in her life have been slowly changing all the while, without her noticing.While Katie's story is simple (and, one might say, fairly predictable) it's still poignant and engrossing. Who among us can't relate to being thirteen and feeling the pangs of first love, of being surrounded by others yet lonely? Berg is a talented storyteller."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Joy School would be a great book to read, if you are a female teen. Elizabeth Berg wrote this book mainly for female teenagers attending high school. The recommendation of this book would be more towards females than males because Berg describes everything in detail and most female teenagers can easily relate to some events that take place in this book. I would have to honestly say the only reason that I wasn't totally into this book was beacuse Berg was telling a story about a girl and her troubles with the crush of her life and her friends. Other than that I would have to say that this book would lure female teens because it would make them engage into what is going on in the book."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I borrowed this book and it was only when I got it home that I discovered that it was a sequel to &quot;Durable Goods&quot;.

She is desperately trying to fit in but finds it awfully lonely, until she meets Cynthia, and then another new girl, Taylor sort of 'adopts' her as a friend. But both have their odd values or family life.Then Katie meets Jimmy and he befriends her, listens to her, and she hears him. It's what Katie needs and she begins to fall in love him, knowing that he's 10 years older, married and has a child. She wants to promise him the world, share his dreams, be his everything.Unfortunately for Katie, as the story unfolds, Jimmy is hopelessly in love with his wife, would do anything for her and that involves moving away, to be closer to her family. The scene when Jimmy and Katie meet for the last time is very sweet and will stay vivid in my mind for a long time to come.

We all know Cherylanne; the best friend who is both exasperatingly concieted and loveable. We have all had Ms. Sweet; the humourously agressive gym teacher.This novel made me laugh out loud more than once. Nearly every page has one of Katie's memorable wryly-worded observations on life.

I read &quot;Durable Goods&quot; after &quot;Joy School&quot; so I didn't get into it really fast because &quot;Joy School&quot; was always intresting ever word was intresting.

I hope Elizabeth Berg can see this and e-mail me because I've tried to find her online before but couldn't."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Reading is not my favorite past time, actually I have never enjoyed it. There are few books I have read from cover to cover, I usually get too bored to finish them. JOY SCHOOL was an exception! It was like time travel. I couldn't beleive how Ms. Berg captured my adolecence almost word for word. I AM Katie! I lost my mother when I was 14, my sister got married and pregnant(not in that order) and moved to Texas, I grew up in Missouri and still live here, my father was not emotionally there for me, and my life revolved around GREG, the 24 year old man that worked at the grocery store up the street.

Berg does a great job in making us feel 13 again. Katie was an obviously likeable character with all her female pre-teen drama &amp; you just couldn't help but smile."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Elizabeth Berg's novel Joy School is a hilarious, but heartbreaking story of a young girls first love. Thirteen-year-old Katie is new to her Missouri town, living alone with her stern father after her mother's death. Trying desperately to fit in at school, Katie makes new friends wherever she can. Katie first makes friends with her new housekeeper, Ginger. Then there is a misfit named Cynthia, with the almost too perfect mother, and then finally the beautiful Taylor; a young model who gets her kicks out of shoplifting. But the most frustrating of Katie's new friendships is that of the very handsome, twenty-three-year-old gas station tenant, Jimmy. This is the first person to really capture Katie's heart.Berg's Joy School takes place in a small Missouri town in the late 50's and early 60's, where the adolescent army brat, Katie, desperately tries to find her place in life. It is in the small town where Katie finds her first love. It is the first extremely cold day in November, and everything is frozen, including the little pond a couple of blocks away from Katie's house. So, she decides to go ice-skating. While skating on the little pond hidden behind the Mobil Gas Station, she hits a thin part in the ice, and falls through. Luckily, it only goes up to her waste, but the water is so cold, that she can hardly move.She finally gets out, and walks into the gas station, frozen, and looking for warmth and help. This is where she first meets the first love in her life.Katie soon finds a couple of new friends in school, and also pursues a relationship with this Jimmy character. She finds that he has her passion for the simple game of checkers, poetry, and reading. She becomes great friends with the beautiful girl Taylor, who has charm enough to make Katie's dad laugh, the absolutely impossible task, and who also teaches Katie a few things about boys, and takes Katie's on her first date. She also finds another unusual friendship with a fellow misfit, who has the coolest grandmother, and the almost too perfect mother, who Katie can't stand.Throughout the book, Katie grows as a person, and as an adult too. She learns new things with every step she takes. She learns how life isn't always fair, and how good friends are worth pursuing. Katie captures your heart as she takes you on a wild ride through a thirteen-year-old girls life, who finds herself in love, and it all takes place in a point of view that even the simplest of minds could understand.I completely recommend this book to anyone who likes stories that seem real, and can capture your heart because of it. I loved this book, and even before you read Joy School, take a look at the book Katie first appeared in, Durable Goods. The way Berg writes is completely incredible, she knows how to take simplest of words, and mix them together, to make a flowing, and interesting yet, easy- to-understand novel. Just the way Berg describes Katie's teachers is reason enough to buy this wonderful and delighting book Joy School."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I did not read &quot;Durable Goods&quot; and did not realize this was a continuation. However, Joy School took me back to a younger, more innocent time of my life and for that alone, it was worth the read. While this is a pleasant way to spend time in a waiting room or on an airplane, it's not a book that will stick to your ribs. It's simply a pleasant companion for an afternoon and then its gone. This is very unlike other Berg books that I have read and loved. While not her best effort, it's still fun to read. &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; and &quot;Open House&quot; are much better Berg novels and will stay with you for sustained periods after the final page is done. Still, I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from picking up Joy School--I'm sure you'll enjoy it, you'll laugh, you might cry--but you will be moved emotionally at some level. This is one great author! Her simple prose and straight from the heart writing is such a welcome relief from some of the often painfully contrived popular writers of the day. Keep em coming Elizabeth!"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Katie is such an endearing character. Perhaps because she is the same age as my own daughters, I felt moved to reach out to her and give her some good old-fashioned nurturing and motherly love/guidance. She struck a chord in me as I related very closely to her feelings of trying to fit in, find good solid friendships, despair and loss - and these aren't just from reflections of my own adolscence but from experiences in my current adult life too.I can't wait to read True to Form, the last book of this series!"},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"She doesn't waste your time. She writes a great story. It is so easy &amp; fun to read. It's hard not to get hooked on her."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Berg has done it again -- she has the uncanny ability to capture the inner thoughts of women (in this case, girls) at their most vulnerable. From her gorgeous (but addicted to shoplifting) friend to another friend's overbearing mother, our young narrator captures perfectly the confusion and pain of growing up female. She develops a crush on the handsome gas station attendent who rescues her one day after she falls into the ice and thinks of him even as she has uncomfortable sexual experiences at a drive in movie with her popular friend. Even the lesser characters are well drawn: her friend Cynthia's mother and grandmother, Jimmy and Taylor. Although young teens would love this book (I think it would make them feel that others go through many of these issues), I think the real audience is adults who remember the pain of these years as though it were yesterday. Very touching and affecting."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"The moment I pick up this book, I could not put it down. It envelops you like a warm blanket. I finished reading it with a broad smile on my face. I wish I had a teenage daughter I could recomend this book to."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"I picked this book out at random in the public library since I wanted a small book. But when I got into it, and read about Princess Phones and the Presidents program for youth fitness, I started to realize that this was a period piece. That is my favorite form of writing. So, I spend my time looking for clues. The Princess Phone was introduced in 1959. But it was really only like a status symbol cool thing in the early 1960s. I have this feel for history, and I believe I narrowed down my guess to 1962. I wanted to write the author, but she gives out her home address, but no email. She even has her own website.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in recent history as told from the point of view of a teenager. I would like to know if there are similar books about other time periods."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"Lifeline Online: A MemoirJoy SchoolSo simply written, yet so full of knowledge. Katie, a young girl wants to grow up, fall in love and be noticed by her peers. She learns and grows the hard way through rejection and trying to be a circle that doesn't quite fit the square. Like most of us at the age of thirteen, she's awkward and full of questions. With each hurt and sorrow, Katie learns life's lessons, the hard way. She learns of herself.Berg, not only speaks to the young adult in this story, but to the adult. Her philosophy on life is insightful and speaks straight from the heart. The world would be a better place if we all did this. What a wonderful way to pass on what you believe and Berg has done just that."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"We first met Katie in Durable Goods, now she's back.It's the late 1950s, and Katie is living with her father and a housekeeper in a small suburban home.Her teenager neighbors love to tease Katie by leaving her mean notes in the hedges beside her window. The kids at school also tease Katie, and her father is still strict and mean.One day Katie decides to go iceskating behind the Mobile station. She gets a little to far to the thin ice and falls through. Somehow she managers to pull herself out of the water, and walks freezing cold into the Mobile station where she meets the twenty five year old manager, Jimmy. Katie developes a crush on Jimmy, despite the fact that he is married.With her new secret crush Katie begins to have more confidence in herself, and begins to stand up to her neighbors, the kids at school, as well as her father.I honestly think this is a great book. Written in the usual Elizabeth Berg fashion. If you have ever read an Elizabeth Berg book you will know what I mean."},{"Title":"JOY SCHOOL","review":"After reading this book, I was hoping that there would be another book written about Katie.

Maxi Amberville is the daughter of self made millionaire Zachary Amberville, and has, at this point, lived life as a complete airhead, flitting from husband to husband.After Zachary's sudden death, control of his empire falls to his widow Lily, with a minor share going to their three children.Lily soon marries Cutter,Zachary's younger brother who is determined to undermine and eventually destroy the publishing empire, simply out of hatred for his brother. The story centres around the recreation of one of the firms earlier and failing magazines by Maxi, to the point where she is able to take on Cutter and so preserve the company..admittedly a big stretch of the imagination but so in tune with the soap opera style of the book that it's almost impossible to put down !"},{"Title":"Ill Take Manhattan","review":"Perfect transaction from start to finish.

Lowry. It tells the story of a life of dedication to Art , and of a personal isolation mitigated by friendship. Lowry's great revelatory moment was when his parents and he were forced to move from one side of Manchester, the wealthy, to the other, the world of the mills. It would be the mills, the world of urban hardship and poverty which inspired his most well- known work. And his pictures of the industrial landscape filled with figures of sticklike isolated human beings would become his most well- known work. Later he would change his subject, devote himself more to portraits which were most powerful when they revealed a kind of oddness and sadness of soul in their subjects. That oddness and sadness too characterized in some way Lowry himself.Emotionally his story is of prolonged and close ties to his parents, especially his mother. A petulant dissatisfied woman she nonetheless held him emotionally. He with care nursed her for the last seven years of her life when she was unable to move. And he said after she died that the meaning and purpose had gone out of his life. And in some way he did feel this throughout though in the last thirty some odd years of his life his work was increasingly recognized and appreciated.Lowry lived a ' double- life' as artist and rent- collector, something which he did much to hide. He was known as a good friend and especially generous to young artists after he himself became successful.This work is an exhaustively researched one.I might add, that it focuses on the life. And while there are a number of outstanding passages describing the work , and much background information which will certainly help any student of the work understand it better, the heart of this work is a very careful and skilled telling of Lowry's life- story."},{"Title":"Mountaintop summer","review":"Front cover flap description:'When the doctor told the Thurlows that Daddy had to go to the mountains, Janie thought the world had ended. But when Mother announced that they would all pack up and go with him, things started looking up. And look up they did! The summer turned out to be the most wonderful three months of their lives, all because their secondhand station wagon, the Odyssey, broke down on a forsaken mountaintop. A deserted cabin near a sparkling trout stream high in the Colorado's was enough incentive to spend the summer right there. They enjoyed all kinds of exciting adventures as they explored the mountain and became acquainted with the forest ranger and the village folk below. Short of money but long on talent and initiative Mother, Daddy, Janie and Joey each contributed tot he family's support in his own special way.

I wasn't sure what I was going to get from this book-- I picked it up because of Donald Trump's track record, and none of his other books really goes into real estate investing specifics. This book was a pleasant suprise with a lot of good investing tips. The best part of the book (and worth the $17 bucks) was the chapter on negotiation-- George Ross tells us how to make a good deal, great by using negotiation as a key tool. I can't wait to put this book to use."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"Donald Trump, multi-billionaire real estate investor is unashamedly big on self promotion. His name is predominate on the book jacket. But that is not inappropriate as he is the focus of the book. His major deals and properties are the center of attention and make the book worth reading.George H. Ross, successful New York City real estate attorney, long-time associate of Trump and apparantly player in the Trump reality show, The Apprentice, is the major contributer to the book. His name is next. Mr. Ross has been in the business a very long time and also lectures on the skill of negotiation.At the bottom of the page we find the author, Andrew James McLean, who has written several books on real estate investing.This book is interesting, if simple. The anecdotes about Donald Trump make it worth reading. The details of the Trump Tower, Mar-A-Lago, and the GM Building, for example are very interesting. There is also quite a bit of chest thumping and self-congratulations in this short book, but who can argue with success?The advice given in this book is very good, but neither new nor Earth-shaking. Anyone who is making it in the real estate world probably already knows this, but it never hurts to have it reenforced. The point that hit me the most was to avoid the tendancy to focus on the property more than the customers. There are tips on negotiation, how to find and treat customers, how to handle difficult people and how to stay out of trouble. This is not a how-to book, but has some excellent pointers."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"Phenomenal investment insight from one of the worlds leading Real Estate gurus. I have been in the business for 10+ years and I could have saved myself a lot of time and aggravation of \\"cutting my teeth\\" in the business if I had this book as a resource early on in my career. This is with out a doubt the real world MBA of Real Estate Investment. Mr. Ross does an unbelievable job of relating he and Trumps world class Real Estate Investment empire in a way that is understandable and applicable to any size investor. I can assure yo the tricks and methods he describes in this book are the way it \\"really\\" works out there. No classroom can prepare you in the way that this book lays it all on the line. The subtleties existing in the business world and Real Estate dealings in particular make the diffence to your success. Mr. Ross almost divulges too much information by un-locking the Billion dollar secrets that only hard core experience and proven success over many years and Real Estate cycles could foster. If you want to know how to do Real Estate Investment RIGHT...read this book!"},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"\\"Trump Strategies For Real Estate\\" is written by Donald Trump's right hand man, George Ross. If you have watched \\"The Apprentice\\", then you know exactly who George Ross is. Being a real estate investor, I was interested to see what George had to say around real estate investing. Give that the title includes the phrase, \\"Billionaire Lessons for the Small Investor\\", I thought I would see what a billionaire had to say to the small investor.While this book doesn't offer a lot of advice for the small investor, I still enjoyed this book. George talks about several of Trump's big real estate deals and overviews some of the problems Trump ran into, and the creativity behind the solutions he came up with. I found this to be extremely interesting and educational.George mostly focuses on real estate deals that would result in capital gains, and only touches on cashflow properties (essentially his strategy is hold the properties that product good income). This isn't a bad thing, but just one to be aware of when purchasing this book.George also focuses a lot on the big deals, but then says how the advice can relate to the small deals. I did get the feeling that George is slightly out of touch with what a \\"small deal\\" is anymore.Regardless, the advice is solid. The negotiation principles, learning how to pay attention to detail, and learning how Trump deals with contractors are all worth the price of admission. I especially liked how George included a list of questions to ask advisors that you should hire.In summary, this book is worth reading. It's easy to read, it has plenty of examples (although they are all big deals), and it gives you insight into what a billionaire real estate investor is all about. 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"As a relatively recent entry into the real estate world, I sought a book that provided excellent real estate advice. I didn't care who the author was or the picture on the cover, as long as the author had relevant experience. In fact, with Donald Trump on the cover, I was considering not getting the book. As big of a fan I am of the Apprentice in its first seasons, before I read the book my impression of Donald Trump was a lot of flash with relatively less substance. George Ross's book proved me wrong.Ross goes into good detail about how he and Trump achieved their major successes. Based on the book, Trump's accomplishments were based on creative thinking, hard work, and brilliant understanding of challenging issues (and people). I particularly enjoyed learning about the Grand Hyatt New York project as I work in hotel real estate; however, even the sections on residential real estate provided solid general R.E. advice. The book is a fast read but loaded with strategies. I am now reading the book a second time just to ensure I caught everything...even though each chapter provides a summary of key topics.After reading the book, I have newfound respect for The Donald, but particularly for George Ross. His knowledge flows well on the pages, with a somewhat casual tone in the writing but never appears too advanced or too simplistic. He presents topics well. The structure of the book and each chapter are organized. Each chapter is highly relevant. Undeniably, the book succeeds in its goal in providing real estate strategies that could work for all investors (from duplexes to a five-star resort).Certainly knowing basic real estate concepts (such as air rights and leasehold interest) will help in understanding some of the case studies, but Ross and co-writer Andrew James McLean never overly complicate each example. Granted the case studies aren't as in depth as anything a business school student deals with from HBS--but the main points of each case are presented well.I highly recommend this book. I can't find any significant faults...the book is simply well done."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"This is a rather readable book which you can finish within an hour or so. In style it is terse and it is well rounded: the very hallmark of a good advocate. Basically, this book stresses the use of one's imagination in every way to make your investment a success. It essentially touches and concerns the big deals. There are for sure a number of good and practical investing tips: very good as a quick reference. The most brilliant part of the book, however, is the chapter on negotiation which is well covered and could practically be used in almost all kinds of negotiations."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"George Ross generously dispense wisdom from his hard earned experience.

George Ross tries in many chapters throughout the book to relate the concepts to the small investor in order to help the reader link between large scale strategies and their application in small real estate deals.You will need as a small real estate investor to have the ability to isolate the concept of the strategy from the magnitude of the Trump deals. Otherwise, you will feel that this book is teasing you more than teaching you. A good example, which is mentioned in the book, is when George Ross talks about the importance of choosing a property with a great view. Then he relates that to small investors by saying that if you can't afford one, maybe you need to put some nice tall trees in front of the building to compensate, if you were targeting a mid level neighborhood.I gave it 4 out 5 because as a reader if you take that extra step to scale down Trump philosophy in a way that will be suitable to your property target audience, then the benefits are 100% invaluable.Overall, it's a great book."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"Take investment advice from people who've actually made moneyin real estate.

Heck, he is probably great at real estate but everything in this book is common sense.

Just case study about how great Trump is and how he implemented his MIllion and Billion dollar real estate deals.

If you truly want to understand how Donald Trump made himself wealthy, then read this book. George Ross has over 50 years of real estate experience and knows what his is talking about. Another benefit of this book is he describes some of the methods Mr. Trump used for real estate and illustrates their application with the small investor."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"If you are watching The Apprentice and trying to learn something from it than you should read this book since all the tough behavior on The Apprentice makes sense after reading it.These guys, George Ross and Donald Trump, do multi-million dollar multi-negotiation deals that go on-and-on for weeks or months and some for yes years. The only way to get through one of them is not to quit, to remain loyal to your team, and to know how to negotiate well over-and-over again since the process of real estate development and building buildings includes a series of negotiations, maybe hundreds of small negotiations, and a few big drawn out long negotiations. The book says that preparation is key, research is key, just like on The Apprentice.After reading the book I see why The Donald considers some of those on the show to have created major errors that excite him to hostility. If they were working for him the errors would cost truly millions of dollars. Having said this, no one under the age of thirty should really be on the program. I wouldn't trust anyone in their twenties with responsibilities this large regardless of their \\"trumped up\\" credentials designed to hype the program.Though \\"The Donald\\" can overdo the verbal slams on The Apprentice, I hope for TV affect, the book emphasizes making positive business relationships that will last. It also emphasizes the need for consistent best behavior over the long term.A list of key elements needed to make a great workable real estate deal is included. Negotiation techniques are listed by George Ross. George explains well a number of the morally questionable tricks used on people during negotiations. My reaction to this is to not allow myself to be unduly manipulated by them when I think I see them coming. The book really builds your confidence to go out and do a deal. I suppose they tell you all they dare in the print of a book.The book is easy to read without being stupid. It includes black-&-white pictures of some Trump buildings that give an-ancient-look-to-new-buildings so the overall effect is a surreal artistic approach that adds a fascination and credibility to the book making you feel like you've entered the deep secret world of New York real estate.This is really George's book giving away some of his 50 plus years of learning as a real estate deal making lawyer. His background listed in the book is astounding. Books like this, in which a person looks back and gives you the key meat of their life's learning are usually the best books and this book is a great example. I really felt cheated watching The Apprentice but having no way to go to New York to take George's negotiation class and this book makes up for it. Thank you George. Good luck Rebecca. Sorry to see you go Torral. Sorry guys but can you blame me for wanting to watch the women."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"I've been in real estate for 12 years and this is one of the few books worth buying and keeping in your library. Many of the things I already knew, but it's good to have this as a source of reference. I like the info on negotiation and research (the party that spends the most time/energy on project tends to want to complete the transaction). Trump believes in hiring the best experts available and \\"value added,\\" which is another way saying adding glitz to his properties. The author is also right on when he states that most people take the path of least resistance. I agreed with 90% of what the author wrote about."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"great source of information and idea's on how to handle situations no matter their size."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"I found this book to be easy reading and informative. Yes, lots of the information is \\"common sense\\" and much isn't really aplicable to the small investor.

For the Trump fan, it's great reading."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"One thing that people won't know without reading this book is that George Ross has been involved with not only Trump's biggest deals, but with other multi-millionaire's huge deals. He gives some amazing insite into things that not even Trump himself would talk about in his books. Obviously what ever Trump does works, and in this book it tells how. I also like the way this book (very similar to The Art of the Deal) opens up the reader's mind to Trump's world of huge real estate investing. It is fun to read about these huge deals that he pulled off, these stories will make you grow some hair on your business chest and make your deals feel like nothing. In my opinion this book is better than Trump's last few books, maybe better than The Art of the Deal! READ IT it is worth your time."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"I just finished this book today, and I think it's worth the time to read it. Mr. Ross is succesfull in giving you the overall aspects of what makes Trump's projects special and why they produce millions. Although it is not a guide, I saw it as a collection of recommendations and with several case studies in which examples can be found. Although the \\"Small Investor\\" advice is not as specific as one would like, the overall illustration of Trump's approach to business is very useful. From hiring architects to add glamour to any project, to fibding loopholes in local laws, Ross wrote a preety decent book, without it being the black thread of Trump's fortune."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"Trump is a real estate player in the major leagues. This book is written by his right hand man, George H. Ross. Some of you might know him from the show The Apprentice. He focuses mainly on Trump's deals, but I really liked how he described what Trump does to sell himself. For example, Trump is very good at using his enthusiasm to inspire others, building relationships with everyone involved to lower their suspicion, and applying his showmanship skills to excite participants. Not only does the author show how Trump does it, but also how we can use it to help with our deals. To have showmanship, he uses an example of not just showing prospective buyers a vacant piece of land, but hiring an artist whose work can show the buyers what the finished product can look like. The chapter on negotiation is fantastic. I don't believe anyone can learn the information in this book in a classroom or from any other book.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

Its a good book but I think the strategies George talks about are more ideal to the big time investor like Donald and not the small investor like the title implies.

If your looking for a real estate book, this is definitely not it."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"I found the general business examples more helpful than the real estate concepts.

I recommend this book. I know I have gained a lot from taking time to read this book"},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"I once read that there are 4 kinds of business and financial information. The first is written by employees, for other employees. These are typically budgeting booklets and money magazines, that tell you to play it safe, invest in mutual funds and so forth. Second there are small business literature, written for and usually by small business people, that teaches you how to generate an extra stream of income on the side, in addition to your job. The third and fourth are what wealthy people read, and that's high growth business literature, written by, and for other high growth business people, and those who partner with them such as investors.That is where this book categorizes.Many will read it and get lost in its savvy, but if you want a high growth real estate portfolio, keep practicing. Again, I will admit that it is hard to digest, no easy beginner stuff here, but its written in the language of wealth, so it takes a while for we the working class to interpret it properly.

For anyone who has ever watched Trump's show, you know Mr. Ross as the quiet man who gives spot-on advice (which Trump doesn't always heed--too bad!). Mr. Ross is great not only at story-telling but also at gleaning lessons (life lessons) from his and others' experiences. He shares those in this book without being too preachy. While it's quite clear his background is solidly in NYC, he does a good job in expanding his lessons to other parts of the country. This book is a very good read!"},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"its a good book for anyone to read and its been a big help to me.i suggest you read it if you intrested in investment."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"This book is great for somebody looking to find the 'big picture' in real estate, with some very helpful thoughts to guide decisions. Working in real estate, I have already used much of the advice in this book with my real estate clients with great success. Though not all thoughts apply to my area, the book as a whole was a great read."},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"George Ross presents excellent ideas for real estate investment! His interesting experience blends perfectly with sound advice that calls for an honest ethic and smart thinking.

It's a must-read for anyone interested in real estate, negotiating, or marketing!"},{"Title":"Trump Strategies for Real Estate","review":"I hoped for something much better than what I received. Generally, the book is written by a lawyer who assisted in big real estate deals and seems to have little experience in advising small investors.

I thought my memories of the book were imaginary, but they turned out to be real recollections. Reading this book as I child I was transported to Disneyland while turning the pages of this book. Mickey is your guide on your trip through DisneyWorld (I always thought it was Disneyland - and you can't really tell the difference with the content of the rides featured in the text). This is a PULL-TAB, POP-UP interactive adventure. You ride on the Submarine while turning a dial to see all the sea-life. You climb the Swiss Family Robinson Tree House to find a hidden treasure at the top. You ride the Tea Cups with Mickey while spinning him around ending in a very funny discontented look on Mickey's face from all the spinning. The bears at the Country Bear Jamboree play their instruments for you. There are numerous others voyages. I had as much fun seeing the book at age 28 as I recalled all the fun I had with it as a child. A TRUE treasure and TOP book for the avid Disney fan, especially since they closed the Submarine and Swiss Family House in 1998/9. Many happy memories are in the book for the person who attended the park as a child."},{"Title":"The Mormon dilemma","review":"Former Mormon Ed Decker (author of books such asThe God Makers: A Shocking Expose of What the Mormon Church Really Believes,MY KINGDOM COME: The Mormon Quest For Godhood,Decker's Complete Handbook on Mormonism,The Dark Side of Freemasonry, etc.) wrote this book (also available as a DVD:Mormon Dilemma (DVD)) in 1990.It is the story of a Mormon couple who discover that their neighbor's church is showing 'The Godmakers'; they have a conversation with their neighbor going over the points made in the film. (This book/film is quite a bit less 'antagonistic' than the 'God Makers' movie itself is.)Here are some quotations from the book:\\"...the real fruit of Mormonism, which are the broken homes, the discouragement, and the spirit of failure found in 75 percent of LDS members who have never made it to the Temple even the first time---or that other 12 to 15 percent who have lost their worthiness and cannot go back to the Temple without going through the steps of a Church-regulated repentance.\\" (Pg. 13)\\"'What about the part about Jesus and Lucifer?' Jim burst out. 'Are they literally brothers?' 'We were ALL brothers and sisters in the Preexistence,' Lorri smiled at him.\\" (Pg. 51)\\"'What about this business of Joseph Smith being your judge?' ... 'Of COURSE he will be at the judgment bar, but I can assure that he is there as your friend to plead your case if need be. But nobody will go to the Celestial Kingdom without his express approval.'\\" (Pg. 60)\\"I still don't understand how some of the things we did in the Temple are all that pleasing to God. I cringe every time I go through the Washing and Anointing Room,' she said with obvious revulsion, 'and I feel something terribly wrong at times when I embrace the worker representing Heavenly Father at the veil'... Sometimes when we put our arms through the slits and embrace, he pulls himself against me ... too .. tightly.'\\" (Pg. 92-93)\\"The speaker said that ... 'If I'm a liar, call my bluff right here in front of the whole town and I'll be out of business.' But the Bishop just stood there.

Similarly, most urban Americans know little of the &quot;Republic of Texas&quot;, the militia movements, the &quot;common-law courts&quot; and sundry other manifestations of rural anger and paranoia. To a European like myself it is even more incomprehensible.I chanced on this book when I was in a bookstore in Champaign, IL and heard the author speaking. I am glad that chance meeting took place as reading this book has given me more understanding of the American rural mind (or at least a portion of it) than anything else that I have read on the subject.Joel Dyer is the editor of the Boulder Weekly and is a sensitive editor well tuned to all his readers' shades of opinion. It is all too easy for people to dismiss these more extreme beliefs as those belonging to wackos, weirdos and lunatics. Dyer has at least treated adherents of these views with respect and done them the courtesy of listening to them and analyzing the underlying causes of their frustration, resentment and seething anger.He presents a fairly convincing picture of why those who are tied to agriculture are so paranoid about government in general and the federal government in particular. He explains patiently and convincingly why there is a feeling of desperation. He shows how for many people desperate times call for desperate measures and how these people have sought to rationalize and justify their actions. Dyer is understanding while not approving of the aims or means employed to achieve the ends.It would be easy to descend into simple mockery and condemnation of extremists. Whilst Dyer concludes that extreme beliefs and actions are wrong headed, his respectful analysis acknowledges the colossal pressures facing these people. He points out the urgent need to do something about their plight. His non-judgmental fact gathering has allowed him access to people whose voices are rarely heard other than through their most strident and extreme mouthpieces.Dyer concludes that America is sitting on a powder keg. Unless governments heed their rising voices, then we can expect the Oklahoma bombing to be only the first of many large scale outrages designed to force people to pay attention to a neglected section of the community.The style of this book, as befits an editor, is journalistic. However, Dyer recognizes the value of his research for those with more scholarly interests and there is a susbstantial section of notes and references at the end to allow those interested to further research the issues.A worthwhile and sobering read."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"The best part of this book is how the author did his research--out in the field knocking on doors and talking to people, the way it should be done. He gets so far inside that one of the guys involved in the Republic of Texas standoff awhile back called him--while the whole thing was going down! That is getting inside to do the story! I'm not sure I totally agree with his thesis of stress being the main reason that the far right is gaining so many adherents, but he certainly backs up his theory with evidence. The author also presents a chilling story on the Oklahoma City Bombing that I guarantee you haven't heard--God knows the jury didn't hear it. Not only did I like this book, I'd certainly consider reading anything else Joel Dyer has written. A good book."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"This book opens up a lot of feeling for those who over the last two decades have lost everything and have attempted to find a reason, a cause and an enemy, sadly.Anyone dealing with and wanting to understand the movement that has effected millions in our society must read this book. I recommend this to our state and national leaders. Dyer writes in such a balanced way and with tremendous care for those who have become caught up in the anger that exemplifies an occassionally growing portion of our society."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"I found Dyer's book to be the most informative and insightful work I've found on the the &quot;milita&quot; movement in rural America. Mr Dyer, in stark contrast to most other work in this area, left most preconcieved biases on the issues out and provides for the reader a detailed and factually grounded work on aspects of the orign, philosophy, and psychology of the rural milita movement. I would recommend this work for those wanting to come to a better understanding of this phenomena in Ameirca."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"Dyer's book talks a great deal about problems that rural people have undergone since the farm crisis of the early 1980's. He talks about how this culture has reacted to the destruction of their farming way of life and how this has resulted in much of the militia movement. He does rural people a great service in teaching readers about the human scars that the destruction of family farms left. Bravely, he discusses much of the economic consolidation of rural farms by the huge agricultural companies and lenders. However, he does stop short of condemning the system in its entirety, as much of the people in rural areas have, and dismisses much of they say as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; as he provides an entire chapter &quot;a grain of truth&quot; validating much of what they say. This diminishes the credibility of the book to some degree as he is not clear exactly what he means by &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Also, Dyer seems to take as given that the Fed govt has been hijacked by corporations, and not itself a active participant."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"I have spent my life in government (30 years) and studying the causes of revolution and instability, and I would sum up the core insight as this: violent anger is spawned by unfairness and feelings of helplessness combined with a loss of faith in \\"authority\\" or existing mechanisms for conflict resolution.This book joins a growing body of literature that I have been exploring that suggests that America is losing its mind as a nation, is fragmenting in multiple ways including states planning for secession, divides between rural and urban, increased ethnic violence especially among poor whites, and so on. There is also a growing literature on government ineptness if not actual mafeasance and betrayal of the public trust.In terms of details, this book is persuasive in documenting either a federal cover-up or massive federal incompetence. The suspects not interviewed, the suspects blocked from testifying, it all adds up to the federal government having a story line that is not supported by the facts.I just finished watching Gandhi for the 20th or so time as background to writing an article on Human Intelligence (HUMINT), and I fear for America. We have dumbed down the population and betrayed multiple demographic elements of the population is ways that will have consequences. The Obama Borg Administration being almost identical to the Bush-Cheney Borg Administration is certain to make the situation worse.Other books I recommend:Rage of the Random Actor: Disarming Catastrophic Acts And Restoring LivesSomeone Would Have Talked: The Assassination of President John F.

I also think he points out quite correctly that disenfrancisement can and does lead to organized violence. I worry about the vision of the leaders of the anti- groups and see more than a hint of facism in their teachings and pronouncements. Additionally, and related to this but not covered by Joel Dyer is the possibility of gaining new converts to the anti- crowd because of the new laws regarding siezure of property, especially when the person losing the property has done no wrong, only rented to the wrong person or allowed access to the wrong person. More and more people will be drawn into the movement as the government cracks down, as usual, on the innocent. To undermine this growing movement, the gov't should francise more farmers, relax seizure laws and give people some say back into their lives. However, like most governments and history has shown, gov't will not give up control without a fight."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"This book is one of the few factual and coherent analysis offered about the new domestic terrorist movement in the United States, and prospects of future civil war in the US. One of the other coherent analysis I've seen came from the ICFI's, a socialist organization, web site. Of special interest to me were Dyer's observations on the fine but thin line between progressive and reactionary movements, and Dyer's serious consideration of the effects of the dramatic growth of economic (and hence social) inequality. Also of interest is how the economically, social and politically disenfranchized often turn to the ultra-right when no real progressive political opposition exists. Even wondered what form and face emergent fascist movements might take in the US? Then take a look arround. This book also shows that a dire need exists in the US for a real (definately NOT the Green party, which is happily lining up with the reactionaries) political alternatives."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"Length:: 9:59 MinsThis Video combines the following books:Harvest of Rage,My life changed forever.

Most moving to me were the number of suicides and the apparent orchestration by the federal government under Reagan's term of kicking farmers off their land.While the author predicts that the militia violence (rooted in the festering of disenfranchised farmers) will only get worse, time has shown another picture -- a deadened silence across the land. Big business continues its domination of ag and the remaining farmers are hanging in there.Time will tell how these problems get resolved, but Dyer's book is a great primer on the subject."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"I am using this item for research and it has helped a lot.I received it quickly and it was in excellent condition.Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Harvest of Rage: Why Oklahoma City Is Only the Beginning","review":"The author obviously began with an economic theory to explain what he calls an &quot;antigovernment&quot; movement, but without the historical perspective that the movement is actually as old as the republic and is driven by dissatisfaction with corruption and abuse of power, and that the movement is stronger today because the corruption and abuses are worse than ever before. It is the same movement that led to the American Revolution, and it is motivated by the same kinds of abuses. He chooses to ignore the abuses and dismiss them as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, but one has only to read the many books on such abuses to find the real causes of the militia movement, and learn the stories of the many victims of abuse that haven't been told yet.

Consequently, if you are using the play or either one of the available film versions, I can strongly recommend Suzanne Pavlos' CliffsNotes for Lawrence and Lee's &quot;Inherit the Wind.&quot;Pavlos begins with the life and background of the playwrights, looking at themes in their other works such as &quot;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail&quot; and the influence of Maxwell Anderson's play &quot;Winterset&quot; dealing with the Sacco-Vanzetti trial. The introduction to the play section is especially strong as she covers both the passage of Tennessee's Butler Act in 1925 and the ACLU's test case in the Scopes Trial. More importantly, she specifically details the major differences between the play and the history. Despite Lawrence and Lee's insistence their play &quot;is not history,&quot; I can tell you that there are a lot of history textbooks and reference works that have confused the two. I would not like to think that this play is being taught without students understanding the differences. After all, Lawrence and Lee were concerned more with McCarthyism than the teaching of evolution in public schools. This section also includes a synopsis of the play, a list of characters and a detailed character map.Of course there are critical commentaries (with glossaries) reflecting the five act/scene divisions of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; as well as Character Analyses of Brady, Drummond, Hornbeck, Cates and Rachel. The Critical Essays cover dramatic conventions and devices such as the chorus character and dialect, themes including freedom of thought, external and internal conflicts, and a note on proverbs. The book ends with the traditional review section and a resource center that covers both tradtiional and on-line reference materials.A final note: if by chance you screen the Stanley Kramer film version, please be aware that the screenplay worked in several elements from the actual Scopes Trial, specifically the exchange in which Darrow/Drummond is cited for contempt of court and the speech of forgiveness given by the presiding judge. Also: &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; was not only the longest running drama in American history when it closed on Broadway in 1957, the 1960 film was the first &quot;in-flight&quot; movie used by TWA to lure first-class passengers."},{"Title":"Guardian of the Great Lakes: The U.S. Paddle Frigate Michigan","review":"Guardian of the Great Lakes is the saga of USS Michigan an iron-hulled war steamer launched in 1843.

Psychiatrist Kate Sinclair is a master at helping strangers straighten out their issues, but she has quite a few on her plate. She is also untrustworthy. I didn't like Kate at all. Kate is yet another loathsome female protagonist - to wit, we have Gail, who was truly loathsome from \\"Life Penalties\\" and Jess of \\"Tell Me No Secrets\\" and Nicole of \\"The Other Woman\\" infamy.Her half sister, JoLynn has taken up with a murderer. Her older daughter Sara goes through the worst of adolescence and bratty younger daughter Michelle is a favored, pampered little queen. (I didn't like Michelle). I felt Kate was unfair to Sara and I didn't like the way she just took it for granted that Sara would go along with her [Kate's] just taking her room to install her terminally ill mother. Poor Sara must have felt displaced. I also hated it when she slapped Sara. I was glad Sara hit her back! It was unfair of her to threaten to throw Sara out if she ever struck Sara again. I wish snotty Michelle had been slapped. She was phony and two-faced and every bit as loathsome as Kate. I actually breathed a sigh of relief when nasty Michelle took up smoking (a singularly VILE vice) and Kate wised up to the kind of obnoxious liar Michelle really was. Kate was singularly odious.I had trouble with JoLynn's murderous lover. Instead of a cliche ending, the lover steals JoLynn's Toyota Camry and kills her. That made for a tragic ending, yet it was good this book did not become yet another cliche. It was \\"tolerable\\" in spite of Kate and Michelle."},{"Title":"The Literary Book of Answers","review":"Great for entertainment at parties, this fun work is broad fodder for essays and free writes, even thematic use in the classroom.The author's selections from favorite and noted sources flash timeless words of wisdom to the user.

The money has been alright, but what I have sought is the sheer, incomparable fun of making up stories, of having characters I made up come alive. Last year, I hit a dry spell. I could come up with decent ideas and force myself to write them down, but the fun, the magic, had disappeared. Everything I came up with was drab and contrived, the writing was mechanical, riddled with clich&eacute;s and cardboard solutions. I didn't know what to do. My mood soured, slowly the world started turning to stone. One day in December I came across Roberta Allen's THE PLAYFUL WAY TO SERIOUS WRITING. From then on, things began turning around. Her book describes the most original and powerful cure for writer's block that I have found. Every day I'll do two, three exercises from the book to get me started, and sometimes I'll use the techniques to do the actual work. Most importantly, using her method, I have discovered that the juice, the magic, the white light, that special something that makes it all worthwhile, has returned."},{"Title":"The Playful Way to Serious Writing","review":"In this book, Roberta Allen says &quot;pressure brings energy to the surface.&quot; The book explains how tapping into the energy of a moment is the key to bringing out the flow of writing.The book has many photos and lines to stimulate response. It's an energizing book to read, and the kind that you stop reading so you can go write!I've read and taught many writing techniques to get people writing and this book was a fabulous find. Though using a timer seemed unnecessary to do the writing, I tried the five-minute technique. The emotional energy I felt in a word, picture, or memory DID move the writing forward in a playful, yet productive way. This technique injects a gaming element into what could be a drudge.I normally write non-fiction and poetry, but have never been able to enjoy writing fiction. Using this approach of &quot;finding the energy&quot; has energized my fiction process as I follow the energy to new action, characters, and scenes."},{"Title":"The Playful Way to Serious Writing","review":"I have reviewed a lot of how-to books for writers; this one truly fills a niche. I've read how-tos that could help in one's personal life (like &quot;Word Works&quot;) and how-tos like Syd Field's that give great advice for screenwriters and also might help novelists. I've also contributed to an e-book called &quot;Musings&quot; that ruminates on life, love and the written word. This, however, is the first I've seen that is quite this flexible.As a former teacher, I can see &quot;The Playful Way to Serious Writing&quot; by Roberta Allen as a tool for elementary teachers, art teachers, photography teachers, English and creative writing teachers. Allen is a photographer and artist as well as a writer and this book is the most visual, the most appealing and the most practical exercise book yet.That it is also fun is definitely a plus. I shall probably use my copy when speaking to genealogy groups about how to turn their heritage into readable stories. I plan to take a couple of the exercises in the book to my critique group (boy, will they be surprised!) and I plan to use a couple of Allen's graphically delightful pages when I tutor my Korean students. These pages weren't meant for that but think of the ESL possibilities in phrases like &quot;a goatee&quot; and &quot;a potbelly.&quot; Immigrants often have the English basics. It is the colloquial phrases that throw them.If you happen to run across this book on the shelf of your bookstore, grab a copy and open it. Leaf through the pages. It will get all of your creative juices flowing.Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\""},{"Title":"The Playful Way to Serious Writing","review":"As a child who grew up in the fifties loving to play with words more than with my Barbie doll, I was inspired and delighted by this &quot;Anything-Can-Happen&quot; book by Roberta Allen.I literally stumbled on &quot;The Playful Way to Serious Writing&quot; while putting together a writing workshop for children. After testing out a number of the exercises on myself, my own imagination began to soar.This book is designed for all ages sparking a sense of energy and freshness that can be applied to any form of writing.The children delighted in these exercises and were writing even when not &quot;assigned.&quot;I am a Lutheran Pastor and a trained psychotherapist working in a congregation that is racially, economically, and educationally diverse. I especially appreciated the way Roberta Allen made her book accessible to a wide population. Her photography as well as the way she uses words, numbers, and shapes makes this book highly adaptable.I recommend this book to anyone who loves to write, anyone who hates to write, and to anyone who needs more play time in their lives. This is definitely one for your holiday gift list!"},{"Title":"The Playful Way to Serious Writing","review":"&quot;The Playful Way to Serious Writing&quot; is by Roberta Allen, the author of &quot;Fast Fiction.&quot; In both books, Allen advocates the use of free writing in order to access your creativity. The idea is that you take a &quot;prompt&quot; or exercise of some kind, set a timer for 5, 10, or 15 minutes, and then write. This isn't the kind of writing where you plan and organize and outline--you just write whatever comes into your head and keep writing. This is supposed to help you turn off your inner critic and get down to the really creative stuff. In &quot;Fast Fiction,&quot; Allen specifically applied this technique to the creation of the short-short story, and to the creation of longer pieces of writing from smaller building-blocks. In &quot;The Playful Way to Serious Writing,&quot; she's sticking with the simple idea of just getting started and being creative, without worrying about what comes next.Allen does a wonderful job of establishing a childlike tone to the book. The font is large and plain, and looks a bit like a child's handwriting. The sentences are short and direct, kind of like what you'd expect to hear from a child. Allen discusses events from her own childhood, and the prompts seem to evoke a child's curiosity and lack of understanding about the world. She talks about the energy that some words and ideas have, always capitalizing it (&quot;ENERGY&quot;)--it seems a little bit silly, but again, it's the sort of thing you can imagine a child doing. This helps to establish a tone and sense of freedom--it helps to disable that inner critic so the child in you can come out and play without fear.There isn't much to distinguish the prompts and exercises themselves from those in any other writing book (like Heffron's &quot;The Writer's Idea Book,&quot; Shaw's &quot;Writerrific,&quot; or Rekulak's &quot;The Writer's Block&quot;). But the tone of the book itself is certainly more conducive to helping us shed our serious, adult critic-minds and return to a more playful, childlike attitude. And this can be a handy thing for anyone having trouble tapping into their creative side. This approach isn't for everyone, but if it sounds like fun, you might enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"The Playful Way to Serious Writing","review":"I teach a writing workshop, and this time around, we've been using The Playful Way. It's a wonderful book, full of interesting and...as others have mentioned, FUN exercises. I really like the combination of written and visual cues and feel as though they honor different writers' ways of seeing the world. Some beginning writers do fine with verbal suggestions, but for others, having a wonderful photo to use as a catalyst can make all the difference between a moving pen and a static one.I also like the use of a timer, though I must say my students sometimes balk at it. They get so involved in the exercises, they just want to keep going!Whether you're a beginning writer or an old pro, The Playful Way to Serious Writing will help you to get and keep the pen moving."},{"Title":"The Playful Way to Serious Writing","review":"This fun book provides a lot of exercises to help further your skills, and find some new ones. I recommend to anyone who is looking to do something a little different with their writing."},{"Title":"The Playful Way to Serious Writing","review":"One of the many challenges in writing and teaching writing is knowing how, when and where to begin. The exercises in this book take care of that for you. They are curious, challenging, and creative.The use of the timer is particularly helpful because it foucuses the writer/student/teacher into a finite period of time. There is less chance of judging and more opportunity to just do it!I am a teacher and have found this book a great way to start writing class. The ideas here are, as someone else said, fun, fun, fun!"},{"Title":"The Playful Way to Serious Writing","review":"For beginners only. There is nothing here but the kind of exercises you get in a beginning writer's class, coupled with plenty of pictures and oversized print.

NO dictionary is going to have separate entries for different declensions or conjugations of a word--you must always know the standard form (for adjectives--masculine gender, subjective case; for nouns--subjective case; for verbs--infinitive form). The Oxford dictionary, in combination with another gold standard, Smirnitsky, got me through life in Russia and a graduate degree in Russian. I can't help wondering if the previous reviewer's fiancee isn't writing at least partially in Ukrainian (since she lives in Ukraine, it would make sense)--in which case a Ukrainian/English dictionary would be most helpful. I'm sorry for that small rant, but I couldn't let the last reviewer's derogatory comments about an EXCELLENT standard reference work go."},{"Title":"The Oxford English-Russian Dictionary","review":"My fiancee lives in Kharkov, Ukraine. She has tried to send me Email messages in Russian. When I try to translate them, less than 2% of the words she sends me can be found in this (dictionary????)

In my opinion this book would not even make good toilet paper!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Nice Night's Entertainment: Sketches and Monologues, 1956-81","review":"This fantastic collection of Humphries' satirical monolgues spanning over three decades is essential reading for his fans. See the birth of Mrs Everage as a 1956 housewife offering accomodation to Olympian athletes and read her early tips on interior decoration. Relive the time when Sandy Stone was a working husband having a 'bit of strife parking the vehicle' on a Saturday morning and witness Les Patterson's definitive tribute to &quot;The Yartz&quot;. Best of all, this book will introduce you to Humphries lesser known characters such as Rex Lear (a father of the bride), Lance Boyle (a Trade Unionist) and Neal Singleton (a trendy artist). The wide-ranging list of characteristics that make Humphries' work so distinctive is exhibited here - from the outrageous flamboyance of our alternative cultural ambassadors to the aching pathos of 'the little man of the suburbs' feeling the chill of being on 'the outer'."},{"Title":"AHFS 99 Drug Information (P10599)","review":"Target market is Physicians and Pharmacists, gives drug description, pharmacology, indications, contraindications, side effects, adverse reactions, dosages and packaging information.

Myofascial medicine impacts every practitioner of medicine. At least half of the patients in any general practice have myofascial trigger points. This book should not be on your shelves--it should be in your hands! If doctors, nurse practitioners, dentists and physical therapists knew how this book could impact their practice and their patients' lives, the publishers would not be able to keep up with the demand for it. This book carefully explains the difference between fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome, with new findings on the nature of trigger points. The trigger points of the upper body are explained, with their referral patterns, as well as why they can occur, and what to do about them. Every minute you spend with this book will be worth the time."},{"Title":"Travell & Simons' Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual (2-Volume Set)","review":"Janet Travell MD and David Simons MD spent a lifetime studying the patterns and treatment of muscular and soft tissue pain in patients. It is a specialty in itself, and provides an amazingly detailed review of anatomy. These books are the bible on the subject written by the &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;father&quot; of the specialty. There will hardly be a day in the professional life of a busy primary care practitioner, rheumatologist, orthopedist, neurologist, physiatrist or physical therapist when these books will not be used. The more one knows of this field, the more revelations one gets into those difficult chronic pain patients. The etiology and muscular complexity of the huge field of &quot;tension headache&quot; syndromes now become clear. With these books you will have the tools to diagnose and treat effectively (usually dramatically) the entire spectrum of myofascial pain from head to toe, muscle by muscle.

However, the workbook alone has been a Godsend. I had surgery on a sacral, subarachnoid cyst where a shunt was placed in my spinal canal. Three surgeries later I was experiencing horrible chronic pain in my lower back, buttocks and right leg. 10 years later the pain had spread throughout my entire body! It has been frightening to feel my body actually \\"freezing up\\", muscle by muscle, layer by layer. NONE of my \\"western physicians\\" have been able to address the central problem.My partner happens to be a massage therapist (an actual \\"Muscle/connective tissue\\" focused therapist) and a licensed acupuncturist since 2005. After many hours of listening to her talk about the body as a \\"whole\\", functioning as a \\"unit\\" and how, with even ONE small glitch in one aspect of this \\"unit\\" can bring about a total breakdown in Its entirety - I was focused and wanted to know more! I began on page ONE of the \\"Trigger Point Therapy Workbook\\" and never stopped. The results I have experienced are NOTHING less than Profound!At this moment, as I write, I know that I will spend a majority of the rest of my Life exposing others to this miraculous information. I have had a career as a dental hygienist for 20 years but will definitely be moving away from the mouth and begin to focus more on the body, as a \\"whole\\".

In fact, I just ordered my second set. . . The first is so threadbare it's barely usable. ANYTIME I have a patient with a pain that I can't immediately identify I grab my Travell's. This set is an absolute BIBLE for anyone in the health care industry. Travell and Simons have esentially written &quot;The Instruction Manual&quot; for elliminating myofascial pain by going to it's source!Janet Travell, MD and David Simons, MD were absolute pioneers when it came to myofascial pain and it's treatment. What makes these books even more amazing is that they were written a full quarter of a century before doctors even acknowledged that myofascial pain actually exsisted. . . What makes them interesting is that, in this, the most current edition, they have re-evaluated about 65% of the sites that before would only be considered for cortizone or saline injection and now recommend these areas be attended to by a Massage Therapist. They even go into strong detail as to stroke, direction and stretching. There are still plenty of sites that they recommend for injection, but only in a last resort situation.The chapters are laid out in an incredibly easy to understand manner, though that's not even the beauty of the book's design. If you know the name of the muscle in question, you simply look inside the front cover; the muscle are all listed with their coresponding page numbers next to them. Don't know the name or not sure which muscle it is in the group? No problem. You again open the front cover and there, in 5th grade simplicity, are charts for all the areas covered in the book. Flip to the area in question and look through the diagrams. When you find (in the super well drawn diagrams) the pain you are trying to treat, you are given, not only several treatment plans, but etiology and most likely direct verve aggravation associated with the pain.My only problem with the set is that the book are not as well bound as maybe they could be for the price.

He took many pictures of the same spaces but from different angles to achieve different effects. Full prints of his photographs constitute more than half of the book, and balance out the more lengthy explanations by David Harris. This book is organized into three main sections which make for easy navigation through its pages. The first three chapters analyze Atget's photographic style, his life as a commercial photographer, and his life at work. The bulk of the book, and the most interesting part, showcases the seven Parisian sites where he took many of his photographs. Lastly is a short conclusion and thumbnails of his photos displayed in the back of the book. Although the photographs may not be that interesting to the average person, photographers will enjoy Atget's choice of historic subjects and his dedication to documenting the city of Paris.

Kennedy is the typical modern biographer,always ready to destroy another one of America's heroes. In the sad and cynical fashion of today, Kennedy does his best to paint Thomas Jefferson as a lousy President, slaveholder and racist. The book is deplorable, just as most modern American history has become. I am sure the modern left, postmodernist, deconstructionist crowd loves this piece. It has all of the nihlism, lies, and propaganda one would expect from a &quot;profession&quot; laden with Marxists and Leninsts who would like nothing better than to see another American icon destroyed. A real piece of garbage."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"This book had strong content and very weird organization.On the plus side: Kennedy puts together a commanding set of facts to show that while Jefferson's words rang strong and true, the man himself was hamstrung by his allegiance to his class and could not affect any change regarding slavery in America.One reviewer called Kennedy's work a Marxist critique of southern history. I would argue precisely the opposite. The \\"lost cause\\" of the title was the idea that yeoman farmers, tending their own farms for their own benefit would lead to a strong, engaged and committed citizenry. This was originally a Roman idea shared by men such as Adam Smith, James Oglethorpe, George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. This practice was in place in the Northern colonies and later the Northwest Territory, and led to economic development and economic independence from Great Britain, industrialization, wealthy citizens and a diversified economy.In the South, the plantation system meant large farms run by absentee landlords who exploited and ruined the soil, enslaved and robbed people of self-initiative (those people being the slaves), stifled diversification (all hail King Cotton), discouraged industrialization, and prolonged dependence and subservience to textile manufacturers in Liverpool and Manchester. Since the people actually working the land did not have a stake in it, or in the care of the tools they used, the factors of economic production - capital, land, tools and labor -all were \\"run into the ground.\\"The lasting effect of the plantation system - low wages, demoralized citizens lacking entrepreneurial spirit, ruined tools, ruined fields, death and suffering - strongly parallel the effects of 60+ years of Communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and before that the effects of British absentee ownership of Ireland. Indeed only in the past couple decades, a full century after the fall of the plantation system, is the South now reviving with manufacturing, entrepreneurship and economic diversification. Post Communist Eastern Europe has strong resemblances to the Reconstruction South.Therefore, if anything, Kennedy's book affirms the social, moral and economic benefits of the Capitalist market system of small time farmers and business owners over the ruin that stems from collectivization of any sort - Communist or Plantation.The rest of the book is a wonderful excursion through the history of the deep South. This is what I enjoyed about the book.On the negative side: the book needs a new title, the current one is misleading. The book is not really about the Louisiana purchase as much as it is about how Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and their cohorts lead the nation down a path to a condition that would only be rectified with much bloodshed in the 1860s.The book needs better organization (this is the worst organized book I've ever encountered).It needs a new appendix. The book mentions Aaron Burr and his doings, trial, conspiracy, sentencing, exile, etc. without provide some sort of appendix to tell us about Aaron Burr. All I know about the man is that he dueled with Alexander Hamilton and won. I think the author presume much to much on the readers part when it comes to Burr. That was troublesome.The matter of how and why the Louisiana Purchase came to be is found in ONE obscure paragraph buried deep in the book: Napoleon's real interest was the income from sugar plantations in Haiti - Louisiana served only as a source of material to operate the plantations in Haiti -- and when Haitian rebels took over (sound familiar?) France was forced out of the sugar business and found a better use for Louisiana: cash it in - cheap.Finally, the book comes together only on the final page when Kennedy sums up Jefferson's accomplishments and failings, especially how his ideas finally came to fruition under Lincoln and in the various Homestead Acts.All in all, despite its numerous faults, I highly recommend this book. It is a very interesting and engrossing history of the US acquisition of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas; the personalities of Jefferson, Washington, Madison, Monroe; Native American-African American-European and American relations and quite a bit more. Lots of food for thought here. Great book."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"I found this book fascinating on many counts.First, the description of how the plantations east of the Allegheny Mountains were viewed as disposable by the men who ran them, since it was cheaper to buy new land on the frontier than properly maintain the land they currently possessed. Also, how these same men for various reasons and led by Jefferson resisted the industrialization that would diversified the economy of the south.Second, how Jefferson and his allies catered to the land gluttony displayed by those early planters as new land was acquired for the United States. This was largely accomplished by dispossessing the people inconveniently already settling the land, and handing large swathes of land over to slave-holding planters emigrating from the lands they had exhausted.Kennedy in fact dwells for much of the book on the territory of Florida (expanding beyond the current borders of that state across much of the South) possessed by Spain and settled prior to US acquisition by a mixture of Indians, whites and blacks who out of neccessity practiced sustainable agriculture on a small scale. I found the picture of Florida in that period to be one of the particularly interesting parts of the book. The relationship between the US and the people already settled on lands it wished to acquire (especially Indians), using Florida as a case study, was enlightening.Kennedy provides some critical information for evaluating Jefferson's political leadership on the most compelling moral issue facing the young republic-the endurance and expansion of slavery within its boundaries. First, although the debate in Congress during his presidency over the expansion of slavery into new territories was very close, Jefferson refrained from using his influence to lead in this controversy. Thus, his anti-slavery rhetoric was saved for moments in his life (early and late in his career) when it was unlikely to influence policy, and perhaps as no coincidence his self-interest and the interest of his landed friends. Indeed, once Jefferson's agriculturally impoverished land would no longer yield a profit, rather than join other planters heading west, he decided he could support himself most easily by breeding slaves to be sold to those emigrants. In this way, the man who despised the merchant and industrial classes for their supposed lack of moral character, supported his own extravagent lifestyle. In this, as on many other issues, Jefferson was an impressively self-indulgent hypocrite. Sadly, this supposedly great president was striking for his lack of will and vision on how best to establish a republic in which the AVERAGE citizen would have a reasonable opportunity to pursue happiness.I would have liked to have given this book 4 1/2 stars, because there was a certain lack of organization, and some parts were confusing, so I can't say it was perfectly written. But I found the subject matter truly eye-opening and heartily recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"Thomas Jefferson wrote eloquently against slavery and in favor of a nation of small farmers. He also ran a large plantation worked by several hundred slaves. Traditionally, Americans have emphasized the former, and found excuses for the latter. Kennedy does exactly the opposite. In fact, he argues that Jefferson was in a real sense responsible for preserving and extending slavery--and the system of large estates owned by &quot;planters&quot; that went with it.During the Revolutionary War, a number of Virginians felt that slavery would eventually have to be ended. Jefferson did not support them, and slavery became more firmly established. In 1784, the government set up by the Articles of Confederation began to decide what to do with the new territories outside the 13 original states. A number of people felt that slavery should not be allowed there. Jefferson did not support them, and slavery was extended. In 1802, Jefferson, now president, bought the giant Louisiana Territory from France. A number of Americans felt that slavery should not be allowed there. Jefferson did not support them, and slavery was further extended.Why would Jefferson do this, especially since slavery made impossible a country of small farmers? Kennedy has several answers. First, Jefferson wasn't really that fond of small farmers. He considered many of them to be uncivilized bumpkins. But he positively hated industrialization, and felt especially bad about free black &quot;mechanics.&quot; He thought that the only proper way to treat freed slaves was the bring them back to Africa (or maybe Haiti). Until that would happen, it was &quot;not yet&quot; time for emancipation. Jefferson was a planter himself and felt that other planters were his peers. He wanted them to like him, and he relied on them politically. Kennedy also seems to say that Jefferson was an unwitting stooge of British merchants. They wanted to lend the planters money, buy their cotton, and sell them English manufactured goods. Had the South developed like the North, with towns and workshops constantly springing up amidst the family farms, this &quot;neo-colonialism&quot; (or &quot;colonial-imperialism&quot;) couldn't have happened.Kennedy thinks slavery was especially environmentally destructive. Compared to owner-worked small farms, slave-worked plantations killed the soil. This is a difficult argument to make. No landowner deliberately exhausts his land in ten years if he can keep it productive for 20 or 30 or more. There was new land in the west that one could move to, but you didn't have to be a plantation-owner to sell and move (and if your land is ruined, why will anyone pay you much money for it?). However, says Kennedy, more small-holders were too poor to move, and out of necessity, they took better care of their land. Besides, caring for the land required initiative and local knowledge or complex procedures or special tools. Slave-owners would not permit their slaves to do much besides follow simple orders and use simple tools.And Kennedy is heart-broken at what could have been. Maybe free soil outside the old slave south, maybe freed slaves as yeoman, maybe decent treatment of the Indians, maybe well-cared for land. The second half of the book might be summarized: merchants sell individual Indians money on credit, then with the US Army at their back, force Indian nations to give up vast tracts of land to discharge the debt. Slave-owners move in and ruin the land. Americans settle beyond the boundaries of the United States. Then when the local Indians, escaped slaves, &quot;maroons&quot; (mixed Indian and African), and European colonial governments resist, get the US armed forces to enforce their stealing. Slave-owners move in and ruin the land. I was unclear exactly how this related to Jefferson. Kennedy seems to be saying, &quot;He knew about a lot about it; he was happy about it; sometimes he took positive action to bring it about; even when he was no longer president, he did nothing to stop it.&quot;I liked the way this book takes on hypocrisy, pretension, and myth, e.g., the myth of the &quot;independence&quot; of southern plantations. Planters borrowed money every year, and every year had to sell their crop on the world market. Prices and interests rates were never the same from one year to the next, and planters see-sawed between boom and bust. Yet Kennedy then buys into an equally ridiculous myth: that English merchants just decided on their own what prices and interst rates would be. He can't seem to comprehend that in these markets, everyone had &quot;exposure&quot; and no one was &quot;in control.&quot; A major flaw of the book is the idea that after the Revolution the South became part of &quot;an invisible empire manipulated from London and the [English] Midlands.&quot;I feel like I should have liked this book but I didn't. Why? The book has some beautiful phrases and sentences but too often they were like raisins in a poorly cooked pudding. Sometimes it's hard to tease out exactly what Kennedy is saying and sometimes he just sounds silly. Along with the raisins are some awful jellied currants (a failed metaphor? now you know how this reader felt).Kennedy has been head of the Smithsonian's American history museum and of the National Park Service. This book left me with the impression that Kennedy feels, &quot;Once I had to uphold the icons. But now I may indulge myself. In an oh-so-civilized way, I will skewer those who are unjustly worshipped and elevate those unjustly scorned.&quot; All too often it sounded bureaucratic and snide.The book just doesn't flow well. It was exceedingly difficult to keep all the people and places straight. And THIS was maddening: three quarters of the way through the book I turned the page and found 8 glossy pages of prints and rudimentary maps. They would have been some help. Yet nowhere, NOWHERE in the book are these pages mentioned, not when the people shown are introduced, not when places are mentioned, not in the table of contents, not anywhere.Toward the end I began to feel like I was reading some of the anti-Clinton investigative journalism that blossomed at the end of his presidency. I was glad someone had the energy and the commitment to do it but I was overwhelmed by the minutiae. And I knew that I was getting a one-sided picture.I give it four stars for content, two for presentation."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"Roger G. Kennedy examines the steps that were taken by Thomas Jefferson to secure the Louisiana Territory from Spanish acquisition. MR. JEFFERSON'S LOST CAUSE: LAND, FARMERS, SLAVERY, AND THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE covers the pivotal years of 1802 and 1820 and other years connected to Kennedy's study. His main premise is to prove that if constrictions did not exist for Yeomen and slaves, if Jefferson's personal character, arrogance and pessimism, did not interfere with the decisions he made, concessions could have been made before and after the execution of the Louisiana Purchase that may have prevented the US Civil War and the issue of slavery.MR. JEFFERSON'S LOST CAUSE is a unique examination that Kennedy narrates with extreme detail. But one of the unfortunate aspects of his narration is that some of the passages are so intense with historical data that one loses his point, or forget what the book is about. As Director Emeritus of the National Museum of American History and the National Park Service, Kennedy attempts to creatively intertwine his knowledge and fondness for biological, geological, ecological history, Early American and Roman history as it relates to the activities that occurred with the land. However, they appear out of place and somewhat disconnected to the main subject at hand - Jefferson, the land, slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase. For example, readers may become lost if they do not know about geology, and the different periods that existed, the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, which he uses as analogies to explain John Marshall's Dartmouth College decision of 1819 and how it ties in with the phases of capitalism and corporate growth as well as the introduction to chapter 13 where he begins his discussion with a short biology lesson about organisms. In addition, this is yet another book where the main character disappears amongst the immense amount of information. Kennedy dedicates a chapter or two on several key contributors to the Louisiana Purchase, Alexander McGillvray and Fulwar Skipwith.So in essence, what can be learned from reading MR. JEFFERSON'S LOST CAUSE? Kennedy emphasizes that Jefferson was the \\"father of the land,\\" but did use his experience of Plantation management to the best of his ability to provide balanced relations with the Yeomen. The story and analysis of this historical event was told from a different angle, but may have been enriching if the narrative moved laterally. While reading the book, memories of the past come to mind when I used to have to write and revise papers for my history classes, and had to constantly remind myself what my thesis was. Otherwise, the bibliography is a helpful source to understand the foundation of Kennedy's research."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"Don't believe reviewers who rachet this book down on grounds of its being \\"revisionist history.\\" Sometimes the truth hurts, especially when one of the Founding Fathers is shown to have, at the least, feet of clay.If you are willing to accept heroes with feet of clay, or even see them toppled from pedestals, don't flinch from this book.More than any other early president except Washington, Thomas Jefferson had a large moral bankroll to spend. And yet, he consistently and repeatedly kept his wad of cash in his pocket on the slavery issue.Author Robert Kennedy documents several points in early American history -- namely, in the first few years of independence (more at the Virginia level than nationally), in dealing with the settlement of the trans-Appalachian west, with the aquisition and settlement of the Old Southwest, and finally with the Lousiana Purchase -- where Jefferson could have at least checked the spread of slavery. But he did not. In fact, many of his actions at these points in time actually promoted the growth of slavery. Kennedy details his connection to freebooting expeditions against Spanish Florida and his connection to unsavory characters such as Gen. James Wilkenson, along with his aching desire to be liked and accepted by fellow members of his planter class, as background to this.Jefferson is not being scored for not being an abolitionist. Rather, the idealistic author of the Declaration of Independence is being faulted for not even lifting a moral finger, let alone a whole hand.Kennedy also includes discussions on matters such as Southern cotton and tobacco monocrop soil depletion as part of the price of Mr. Jefferson's lost cause.Though some would fault this as revisionist history, they can't attack Kennedy's credentials, as he is both former director of the National Park Service and director emeritus of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.That said, this book is not perfect. I had three major editorial dislikes.One is explanatory endnotes. Endnotes are fine for citations, but I feel explanatory material should either be in footnotes or worked into the body of the text.The second is the relative lack of maps, primarily for the Gulf Coast, to illustrate the provenance of some of the freebooting.The third is a desire for more charts and other illustrative material for information such as soil depletion, if applicable.That said, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"Roger Kennedy has written a great book. Thomas Jefferson's Cause was truly lost because the planters and slavers whom he represented continued to use up people and land until they were stopped at the Civil War. Thus the internal contradiction of the plantation system worked itself out. Hopefully, others will pick up where Kennedy left off, and continue to trace the strain (or stain) of the users up to the present day. Just as slave owners used slaves in labor and other ways, they also used up the land in a grossly wasteful way. We see their ilk with us today in the oil industry, the lumber industry, and in the political helpers of the inheritors of the tradition of the planters and slavers. These are the ones who use things and people up, and then move on to greener pastures where they can continue their destructive ways."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"Having purchased this volume from a bookseller's table, with its gorgeous portrait of the aging Thomas Jefferson, I began to read it. After a chapter or two, I sought the review at Amazon.com. That reviewer was not overjoyed, nor was I. Roger Kennedy has assembled a collage of words, weaving together some history and some ideas about agriculture. The result is a success at neither. In the Bibliographic Notes (readable and comprehensible) he faults Henry Adams for describing Jefferson with faint praise, which Adams then turned against the 3rd President. Roger Kennedy does much the same.If Kennedy's cause intrigues you, purchase the volume from Amazon.com at a good discount! The forewarned buyer will be less disappointed with a generous discount. Some errors of fact are thrown together with obvious errors of interpretation, the dust jacket is nicely done.The thesis of Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause is hardly realized. At its minimum, Kennedy suggests that Jefferson was a member of the planter class and promoted the planters' interests, while writing enthusiastically about America's yoeman farmers. While a marxist might joyfully propose a comparison between the planter class and modern agribusiness, that hope will be dashed by the author's denunciation of the southern farmer for failing to raise adequate capital by the development of larger banks."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"The author fails to see things with the eyes of the generation about which he is writing. That makes for bad history, merely the out-of-context attachment of situations, strung together into a book. How disappointing. However, he cannot be very lonesome. I'm afraid he has the company of a lot of clever, educated, useless historians (so-called) these days."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"If you want a good book regarding the Founders and slavery, look to Paul Finkelman's Slavery and the Founders, not this disappointing mess. The organization is poor, there's not a logical flow to the information provided, and the author has a tendency to ramble. We know the Founders failed to implement the Declaration and Jefferson was a hypocrite on many subjects. Don't waste your time hearing it over and over again in this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause: Land, Farmers, Slavery, and the Louisiana Purchase","review":"The truth comes out sooner or later, we hope. Here the record speaks for itself, deflating the strains of Yankee Doodle with some 'historical materialist' analysis of the facts of the case re the schizophrenia of our revered founder, Tom Jefferson, a man of fine words and a spastic record on the issue of slavery. 'What might have been' competes with the indictment of the lost opportunity to prevent the spread of the plantation system into the new territories of the emerging American system, especially in the wake of the Louisiana Purchase.Between the Declaration and the Gettysberg Address we find too much American history sawdust.Excellent piece of research behind the myth machines operating on a July Fourth schedule, 'whole cloth', like the commodity of empire in the British cotton kingdom that rapidly survived the blunder of losing its fiefdom in the soon reconquered South.Yeoman farmers?

If u don't like history, buy it, u'll like it (history). Asimov knows how to write in such a way that u start reading about something and u can't stop till the end. With his historical books (he wrote many others about specific periods) u start without knowing that much and u find in the middle of a wonderful novel with his characters, complicated stories, mistakes, blitz, wars, family problems, murders and so on... and from time to time u find urself saying &quot;hey, but this story is true, it is HISTORY, the world we have now is this way because all these facts really happened&quot;. It is reallya wonderful reading. There are some negative aspects and it is correct to list them. It is completely europocentric. East world is often described in a very few lines. Well, actually it is english-centric. After 1776 USA are the great character of the story. Sometimes it is as if world history is a process doomed to bring to the existence of USA. If are not american you'll surely find that Asimov neglected many events in ur country history. There are probably too many spelling mistakes in foreign languages ( i am italian and believe me there are many italian names mispelled). The book is 750 pages long and probably it deserevs 75,000 to appear complete ! The index of names isn't really complete, i looked only for a name ( Brahms) and i didn't find it but Brahms is mentioned two times (omre than Mozart, yeee !!). Finally, i find this kind of history books necessary when u need to have a wide vision about history. After reading this book u need another book that deals not with facts but with ideas. Here u won't find many &quot;history ideas&quot; but u'll find all the necessary facts to understand those ideas.

Various countries, areas, groupings are written about with the historical, scientific, artistic, geographical, etc features of the period mentioned in varying degrees of detail. Thus you get a bit of cross talk but it is anything but repetitive.When the period in question is finished you end up with a fairly easy to understand patchwork of what was happening in the world in the various areas during the period in question.The good doctor's writing is easy and \\"chatty\\", anything but dull or condescending, and as I said earlier, leaves you looking here and there for other bits and pieces that have sprung to mind.I love history and this is a book I would recommend to ANYONE who wants to start studying in that area.

If it was a major happening, it's almost certain to be there, and realtively easy to find.Asimov does sacrifice depth for breadth in this work; many more minor events are not covered. Also, if you plan to read this work cover to cover (I did, and it was very well worth the effort--doing so gives a broad perspective on history very difficult to find elsewhere), you need a good historical atlas on hand to understand how events unfold.The only complaint I have with this work is that Asimov did not live long enough to write the sequel, chronologizing the events from 1945-2000.

He wrote over 465 books (easily the world record), including the popular sci-fi Foundation series, but the \\"Chronology of the World\\" is perhaps his greatest monument.Spanning the entire duration of the universe (until September 2, 1945), this astonishing history sweeps across the whole of human existence, covering vast amounts of material from the spheres of politics, military history, science, mathematics, art, music, literature, even athletics. If it has defined humanity, Asimov, a one-man publishing house, throws it in, somewhere in this massive volume.This book is not another pedantic purgation of history--it's very exciting to read. As a professor of biochemistry and author of thousands of scholarly essays, Asmiov certainly has the intelligence to write this book. But as a writer of popular science-fiction stories, he also knows what it takes to make the book fun and compelling to read. This rare combination of brain wits and communicative wits make Asimov a great guide through history. His accounts of the outstanding people and wars are gripping--especially his treatment of Genghis Khan and the Mongol raiders, the rise and fall of Greece and the rise and fall of Rome, and the climactic battles of World War II.While I am astounded by the breadth and the depth and the insight and the sheer achievement of this book, I cannot pretend that it's perfect. Asimov chose to structure it purely chronologically, country by country, from start to finish. The result is one massive block of near-continuous text, making it difficult to grasp the big picture, and difficult to review the major events. There is a timeline at the beginning and an index at the end, to try to compensate for this flaw. Also, there is nary a map to be found in the entire book. This was a disappointment and I often found myself referring to a world map to see what in the world Asimov was talking about.Even with the flaws, this is an amazing achievement and a fantastic read. In few other books does humanity, at its worst and best, unfold so brilliantly as in this one."},{"Title":"Asimov's Chronology of the World","review":"Asimov is an acknowledged genius. This book is a great example of the man's genius.A general problem with history books is seeing how the little bit you are looking at fits in with the big picture. Asimov doesn't over-analyse - he gives his history in bite sized chunks so the thread of the overall historical flow remains undisrupted.Asimov has the good sense to draw the book to a close while it is still history 50 years before his writing date. The little mention of his birth is just one of the many points that raises a smile.I would have liked more on Australia, but I guess like many parts of the world the stuff Australia did up to the middle of the 20th Century did not have major international impacts.Start reading your history here and then specific areas afterwards."},{"Title":"Asimov's Chronology of the World","review":"This is a fantastic book.

This one I can hardly put down; I keep staying up way too late reading it; I look something up, and then look back to see what happened beforehand or what happened afterward, or I check to see what Japan was up to during WWI, etc. This book could easily have been a dry listing of names and dates, like most textbooks (especially given the enormous scope of the book), but Asimov does a wonderful job of helping the reader to identify the significant events and why they are significant, and to follow trends and threads in history by linking effects to their causes. His editorial commentary is fun too;like when he calls Italy's performance in WWII \\"comic relief\\".

Asimov has compiled a giantic timeline of human civilization. Each time period has been subdivied into individual countries, empires, and regions(when there wasn't a country to speak of). Within each country section, he gives the most important information first, ending with scientific and artistic achievements. The book ends in 1945 with him siting the segnificance of that year and the fact that he would never be able to catch up with current history.

The historical nature of literary criticism was, if not on the same level as criticism of form and style, at least an indispensable consideration of the literary critic. Lewis, perhaps more than any other medieval and renaissance critic of the 20th century, embodies the ideal of historically grounded literary criticism. His efforts to reconstruct the various categories of the historical setting (intellectual, religious, social, political, economic, etc.) in conjunction with an appropriate attempt to step into the author's own aims for the piece of literature are both successful as a project of literary understanding, and a delight as a reader who wishes to \\"get into\\" the life of the book as it was intended to be received. In this respect Lewis is the consumate critic of the literary author. His Preface to Paradise Lost does double duty in providing the reader with the proper context for understanding the genre of writing into which Paradise Lost was consciously cast, and the historical relevancies, to which the contemporary audience was oblivious because of their being second-nature, but to which the modern reader are as alien as an undiscovered tribal culture. Its other duty, in addition to this framework of understanding, is to propose an alternative conception of Milton's Satan to the modern romanticized interpretations of Satan as a tragic hero. For the original audience, argues Lewis, the rhetorical prowess of Satan would simply reflect the Accuser's God-given nature as the most shrewd created being of all--not to be admired or emulated, but to be scoffed at in light of its diabolical consequences in rebellion to the all-powerful Calvinistic God of the Puritan and 39 Articles confessing Anglican English readers. If any sympathy for Satan were to be had, it would be in recognition of his similarity with the inherited sinful nature all men possess as descendants of Adam (the true comic hero of the epic). While such a reading often clangs with the sympathies of the modern reader, Lewis' efforts are to put the modern reading into the perspective of the original audience, which ought to, insofar as Lewis is concerned, position the reader in the appropriate posture for evaluating Milton's efforts, and therefore his success or failure in producing the type of literature at which he aimed (as well as being able to provide a more balanced and reflective assessment of the timeless quality of the piece of literature). Even if one finds Lewis' efforts outdated, misguided, or otherwise undesirable, one can find few, if any, attempts at literary criticism that accomplish the aim of historical-contextual literary criticism as well or as poignantly as Lewis'."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"C.S. Lewis provides a great intro and overview of Paradise Lost. He makes Milton's masterpiece far more accesible and reveals obscure and forgotten nuances in it.

I learned a lot from this book. Literally on page one C.S. Lewis talks about how people misread narrative poetry (like Paradise Lost) all the time because used bookstores are full of books of narrative poetry whose first few pages are underlined in random places and the rest of the book is blank. This made me laugh because that's EXACTLY what my copy of Paradise Lost looks like. C.S Lewis points out that you can't read it like lyrics looking for little nuggets of good lines. That's what I did the first time and I quit reading Paradise Lost after 20 pages.Stuff I learned from this Preface in case you don't really want to read it:*The form of poetry is important and the rules add to it's beauty, not take away from it.*Epic poetry comes from the court so it is meant to be oral. (Good to know - I will try to read it like a speaker instead of a drone voice in my head). Since its traditionally oral, there is a lot of repetition because if you have to think too much while you are listening to a poem you can get lost very easily.*Epic poetry tends to be about men, historically true and tragic.*The beauty of the poetry is in the paragraph or the whole. Looking for good lines is like looking for good stones in a cathedral.*The language is repetitive but not commonplace, like having pumpkin pie every year for Christmas. This also makes it feel ceremonial.*Everything we need to know is in the poem itself. Another reason I got stuck in Paradise Lost was the massive amount of details. I was delighted when C.S. Lewis said that we don't need to look up all the places in the notes. The feeling that Milton is trying to achieve is the important part. Yay for that.*Milton purposefully made it feel like you are listening to a never ending voice go on and on. There aren't many stopping points in the poem.*One of the techniques that Lewis suggests in reading Paradise Lost is to immerse yourself in the poem and feel like you are living it yourself instead of trying to strip away all the \\"exterior stuff.\\"*The idea of hierarchy is seen a lot in Paradise Lost. Everything has a superior (except God) and an inferior.Then Lewis talks a lot about heresy and whether or not it's there in Paradise Lost (which I didn't much care about).So there you have it. I feel properly prepared to read Paradise Lost and actually finish it this time."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"C.S. Lewis' insight into the work of John Milton is invaluable to any Milton scholar or student. I purchased this book to gather lecture notes as I taught Paradise Lost to my students because of Lewis' concise style and approachable rhetoric, but I read the book from cover to cover once I received it because of his excellent insight. Like C.S. Lewis' Allegory of Love and Discarded Image, it is evident how thoroughly Lewis' understands Milton and his desires. I was ecstatic to see in the newest Norton Critical edition of Paradise Lost they included many of these essays, but I was even happier with this inexpensive reprinting of all of them.This book is a must for anyone attempting to approach Milton's Paradise Lost."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]In \\"A Preface To Paradise Lost\\", Lewis talks about what Milton was trying to accomplish with this epic, and this critical work will always stand in very high circles indeed in Milton scholarship. Much of his wisdom is sound, especially when it comes to judging a thing. Lewis says to judge something we must know what it is and what it is intended to do, and then he goes into types of epic poetry and what Milton is trying to accomplish with his work.Milton's influence on \\"Perelandra\\" is very evident, for Lewis took everything he did not like in Milton and threw them out in the elaborate construction of \\"Perelandra\\". It is obvious Lewis greatly admires Milton, and his tribute to him is very great indeed.One issue, as some critics have pointed out, is Lewis's inability to appreciate spoken poetry, which is a very real weakness. Other than that, however, \\"A Preface to Paradise\\" lost stands as one of Lewis's best work of scholarship and will greatly add to anyone's understanding of Milton's aim and theology in general.Lewis deals with the several key issues in Milton. One thing often misunderstood by the Romantics was it seemed to have a positive portrayal of Satan, and how lordly he sounds. The idea of better to be a king in hell than a slave in heaven is of course an absurd one, but from this Lewis builds his great little novel \\"The Great Divorce.\\"Ultimately, like Tolkien with \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\", Lewis has written the definitive textual commentary to \\"Paradise Lost\\", and probably the most read book on Milton as well as far as literary criticism goes.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)"},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"In this preface, Lewis first outlines what an epic poem is and what Milton was trying to do with Paradise Lost. Then he discusses his views on how Milton's theology played a role in this epic. Lewis debunks the view that Milton had compassion for Satan. It was a good introduction, which I read before the poem because I thought it might help me comprehend the poem while I'm reading it. It was helpful, though it managed to make me more skeptical that I'll comprehend Paradise Lost."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"This book got me through my A level English - we studied Book 4 and I soaked up all that CS Lewis said about Paradise Lost. He gave me a breadth of insight that got me an A grade - that was over 30 years ago !!But eternally grateful."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"This work is considered a classic of Milton criticism. I began the book with great expectations and must admit to being somewhat disappointed. Lewis sets out defining the 'epic' as genre, and explaining why Milton chose this form. He also traces the history of the Epic giving special emphasis on the turning point in the form made by the 'Aeneid'.He also outlines the stylistic peculiarities of Milton which helped give shape to his Epic. The latter part of the book is a discussion of the Themes of 'Paradise Loss' and considers among other things, the relation of Milton's work to the thought of Augustine, the role of Satan in the work, that of Adam and Eve. Lewis tends to the view that the Arian Milton did not attempt to force his own religious views on the Poem, but rather was concerned with the Poem's achieving its artistic and moral end.There is an important chapter on 'Heirarchy' which shows how for Milton as for Shakespeare this is a key conception in their worlds. Lewis is a chamption of Milton's discipline, and shows how his stylistic brilliance created a continuous motion and form for the poem. The great Miltonian sentence in all its complexities is central here.There is much to learn from this work about Milton, and also about Lewis.I find that it did not however provide the kind of overall picture of the meaning of the Poem that I certainly thought it would."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"Milton's epic poeA Preface to Paradise Lost: Being the Ballard Matthews Lectures Delivered at University College, North Wales, 1941m \\"Paradise Lost\\" assumes that the reader has knowledge of many tiers and occupants of the mythological worlds of Heaven and Hell.

Very helpful."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"I was amazed by how quickly the book was sent out and delivered--even without express mail."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"John Milton's Paradise Lost is perhaps the most debated work in western literature. On one side you have those who say that Milton was secretly on the Devil's side. (Due to the realistic portrayal of Satan and the seemingly far off and tyrannical portrayal of God) On the other side you have those who say that Milton's sympathies were with God and the angels. (Due to the loving portrayal of the angels and mankind) C.S. Lewis was of the later camp. In 1942, he stood up against those who said otherwise.I have a hard time labeling this as a 'preface'; Lewis was obviously writing to the learned elite at Cambridge, not to new readers of Milton. But Lewis does an excellent job of explaining Milton's worldview and how it works in Paradise Lost. His chapters on Primary and Secondary Epics, Miton and St. Augustine, and Hierarchy are EXTREMELY helpful. (Particularly the helpful to American readers is the Hierarchy chapter; we just don't understand what it means to live under and totally submit to a king or emperor.)I highly recommend this to readers of Lewis or fans of Medieval and Renaissance literature."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"This book was a pleasure to read both before and after reading PARADISE LOST. In fact, one can make a nice trilogy out of PREFACE TO PARADISE LOST, PARADISE LOST, and Lewis's PERELANDRA. Lewis's PREFACE should interest both the general reader and the specialist. Lewis gives a roadmap for working through Milton's epic poem, discussing what an epic is and why Milton chose it, for example, or why Milton used a certain style for writing; he also comments on Milton's theology, medieval hierarchy, and a number of other pertinent subjects with which the reader will probably not be overly familiar. The writing is clear, the discussion lucid and enlightening, and the subjects are interesting. This is certainly worth purchasing."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"Lewis's lectures, though half a century old, speak today with the same clarity, simplicity, and depth of learning as when they were first delivered. His presentation of background information sets the great English epic in its contemporary context--literary, historical, and theological--with a minimum of fuss and footnotes. Some of his negative judgments, such as calling the last two books &quot;an undigested lump of futurity,&quot; deserve reconsideration, but on the whole his judgments encourage critical reading rather than bardolatry."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"C.S. Lewis had one great advantage for truly comprehending Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\": he shared Milton's Christianity. It seems that many modern non-Christian critics of Milton impose concepts on the text which would have been foreign to Milton. Lewis, in contrast, belonged in his whole mindset (according to his own admission) much more to bygone ages than to the twentieth century. Thus he was able to understand bygone poets more than most people today.Added to this advantage is of course Lewis's gift of having a lucid mind extended by an enchanting pen. His writings, including his academic ones, bristle with a liveliness lacking in most academic circles. \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" is no exception in this regard.As for the content of the \\"Preface,\\" Lewis first spends eight chapters describing and defending the style of Epic Poetry, to which \\"Paradise Lost\\" belongs. He distinguishes between Primary and Secondary Epic and draws parallels to the Roman poet Virgil. The remaining eleven chapters are used to discuss the theological concepts in \\"Paradise Lost,\\" making particular note of St. Augustine's influence on Milton.The bottom line of the book is that Milton's poem, more than anything else, embodies concepts found in the Bible and the teachings of the Church, and that the supposed \\"revolutionary\\" concepts in Milton have largely been forced upon the text by later critics.My own experience of reading Milton, for what it is worth, agrees with this view. I studied the Bible and church history quite extensively BEFORE I picked up \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and I was surprised to find how very unoriginal the poem was in its portrayed concepts (which does not mean that it is a bad poem); almost everything in Milton has its source either in the Bible or in Christian traditions and teachings.Edward Wagenknecht from \\"The New York Times\\" was right to say that in the \\"Preface,\\" C.S. Lewis's \\"most valiant service is to protect us against the many students of Milton who have not been able to see the woods for the trees\\" (taken from the back cover of the book).A superb academic work - not only for academic readers.(By the way, for a start on Lewis's own poetry, I recommendSpirits in Bondage: The Anguished Spirit That Found Narnia.)- Jacob Schriftman, Author of The C.

And then i discovered Milton, and his Satan, and Lewis re-entered the picture.His preface to Paradise Lost is largely a defense, mostly against the attacks of contemporary and irreverant poets like Pound and Eliot who criticized Milton extensively, especially for his Latinate syntax. Lewis engages Eliot specifically in one chapter that reads like a very wordy rap beef. If you ask me, Eliot, certainly the better poet, is out of his element in the crit ring, and Lewis smokes him good, at times you might shout \\"OHHHHHHHHHHHH\\"Far as his approach to the poem, he lays out the foundation for a modern understanding of Milton, namely a reverence for ritual and heritage, and an appreciation of epic and narrative poetry. His chapters on Homer Virgil and Beowulf are valuable and enjoyable reads worth the price of admission themselves. His criticism is highly intelligent but never overwhelming or tangential, it is systematic and thorough while still retaining a smooth readability. Easily one of the most valuable studies of Milton to come out of the 20th century."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"Read this before reading Paradise Lost for a much easier time comprehending the work. Lewis is recognized by most literary scholars for his ability to interpret the language and literature from the Milton's period in literary history. It is clear, easy to read, yet profound in insight.

Style, content, form, all the essentials. What makes Homer Homer: what it means. Where Virgil deviated: why it matters. Where Milton deviates: why it matters. &c.;2) Lovely interaction with contemporary \\"New Criticism.\\" I. A.

You wouldn't think you'd be able to quote Lewis on the fatuousness of certain \\"sacred cow\\" tenets of \\"progressive modernity\\" in a book on Milton, but it's here--and moreover, each little epigrammatic jab is perfectly felicitous and apposite. Only Clive! Each one yields great laughter and reflection.4) Some _excellent_ and _original_ universal literary criticism. It is my opinion that many excerpts of this book should be included in Literary Theory anthologies. He treats such overarching topics as reading, poetry _qua_ poetry, criticism _qua_ criticism, authorial intent, &c.; &c.;5) His criticism of Milton's Satan is pretty much the coolest thing you'll ever read. I'll leave it at that: you must read it for yourself! I've read the chapter on Satan four times it's so good.That's enough for now. Buy and read!"},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"Although a work of extraordinary brilliance and charm, this is not the critical last word on Milton. Lewis is brilliant almost to the point of being overwhelming on everything which is story and narrative and character; his comparison of Adam with Satan, his account of the diabolical cabinet meeting in book two, his description of what eating the apple did to Adam and Eve - the father of all bright epigrammatic wastrels meeting the mother of all [evil], selfish sentimentalists - his observation on Eve's sin, which could have been written by Chesterton, all are outstanding and hit the nail on the head so hard that it rings. And his immense learning is certainly up to the task of disentangling the intellectual background to the story - his account of the correspondence between Augustine's view of the Fall and Milton's, and his observation that both Satan and Abdiel \\"are good Aristotelians\\", show his easy, almost careless handling of vast stores of knowledge and understanding.The problem with this otherwise superlative and certainly indispensable essay is that Lewis, taken with his vision of a common \\"mere Christianity\\" embracing Protestants, Anglicans, Catholics and Orthodox, simply misses the extent and significance of Milton's sectarian and heretical opinions. Sure, he knows that Milton was a sort of modified follower of Arius, who denied the divinity of Jesus - that is, that he stood at the outer edges of what is permissible for a Christian to believe - but he does not seem to understand that the consistently materializing imagination of Milton, that almost transforms the Trinity and the Angels into Greek Gods, was a typically Protestant and sectarian reaction against Catholic theology and especially against Thomism, with its wholly spiritual view of Angels. Nor does he give sufficient space to the most sectarian feature of Milton's spirit, the bitterness, amounting almost to bigotry, with which he denounced opposing viewpoints; in spite of the famous passage in the AEROPAGITICUS, he is a bad friend of liberty. Listen to the pointed observations of the historian Eric Voegelin:\\"[Milton writes in Of True Religion , 1673:] Catholic worship cannot be tolerated \\"without grievous and unsufferable scandal giv'n to all consciencious Beholders.\\" And he leaves it to the civil magistrate to consider whether Catholics in England can be tolerated at all, even without public worship. If Catholics should complain that their conscience is violated if the celebration of the mass is not permitted to them, he replies that \\"we have not warrant to regard Conscience which is not founded on Scripture.\\" . . . . Radical scripturalism has become, in the field of social technique, the instrument through which the conscience of man can be kept within the limits of national jurisdiction.\\"Milton goes even further in his scripturalism: he expects everybody to do his duty and to use the opportunity offered by the English Bible translation for becoming thoroughly acquainted with Scripture. \\"Neither let the Countryman, the Tradesman, the Lawyer, the Physician, the Statesman, excuse himself by his much business from the studious reading thereof. . . .\\"Using a modern category, we might say that Milton was a totalitarian National Scripturalist. . . . \\"Lewis is possibly too much in love with Milton's masterpiece; certain it is that at the end of this marvellous little tome we may find ourselves wondering why, if Milton is really so wonderful as Lewis makes him, we feel so little need to go and revisit his work; why, indeed, we would much rather re-read Lewis' own PREFACE than Milton himself."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"There are many approaches to criticism of Paradise Lost. None is more in the spirit of the poem as Milton wrote and intended than C. S. Lewis's Preface. Lewis's spirit is in harmony with Milton's and his Preface is a masterful explication of the greatest poem ever written. It is a delight to read and, as Lewis wished, urges one on to read the poem itself, with greater understanding."},{"Title":"A Preface to Paradise Lost.","review":"This book by CS Lewis is such a classic that it really needs no further recommendation as far as the quality and the content of the book go. However, I think it would be helpful to clarify how Lewis approaches Milton.Lewis's conception of poetry, like Milton's, is fundamentally classical. To paraphrase Lewis, poetry is both something said (logos) and something made (poiema). If you can adjust yourself to this view of poetry, this is a superb book that provides tremendous insight to \\"the divine poem\\". If you cannot adjust yourself to this view of poetry, you will hate this book.The implications are serious, for Lewis's book will not help you to \\"read into Milton\\" an embittered individual trying to avenge his political failures, nor will it help you to \\"prove\\" that Milton is a misogynist, nor will it help you to conclude that Milton secretly belongs to Satan's party. In this sense, Lewis's book will not necessarily give you ideas on writing clever papers for literature classes. If that is what you are looking for, please refer to the Cambridge Companion to Milton.As De Quincey says, \\"What you owe to Milton is not any knowledge, of which a million separate items are still but a million of advancing steps on the same earthly level; what you owe is power, that is, exercise and expansion to your own latent capacity of sympathy with the infinite, where every pulse and each separate influx is a step upwards, a step ascending as upon a Jacob's ladder from earth to mysterious altitudes above the earth.\\" If you are prepared to appreciate the power of Milton in all its splendor and subtleties, Lewis's book is an invaluable guide."},{"Title":"Ethel Rosenberg: Beyond the Myths","review":"Ilene Philipson is a pyschologist and a practicing therapist. This is the strength, and sometimes the weakness, of this book. Her insight is into the personality and upbringing up of Ethel Rosenberg. The book gives a great picture of one of millions of working class youth of the 1930s who grew up to be fighters for unions and opponents of capitalism.Ethel Rosenberg grew up amid the massive poverty and oppression of the Jewish Lower East Side in New York in the beginning of this century. She grew up in an environment in which families with electric lights, hot water, and their own bathroom were considered privileged. Ethel had none of those things until after she was married, her husband got an engineering job in WWII, and they got their own place. Philipson quotes the memory of a school friend of Ethel Rosenberg who explans that as teens Ethel and her friends were afraid to go into the cheap and simple cafes in the neighborhood because that they didn't know how to use a full set of silverware.Ethel Rosenberg also grew up in the oppressive atmosphere of a traditional family, where no future was expected for the girls except work, marriage and work, and work and children, while her brothers were doted on, no matter what. She grew up in a family where the not always successful struggle for financial survival overwhelmed any concerns for a bigger world of politics, culture, or education.From early childhood Ethel Rosenberg'sr mind and heart struggled for a bigger world in her studies at school and in her growth into a capable amateur actress and a great singer. She received no encouragement from her family. Instead, her activities in music and theater and her working class activism were mocked, especially by her mother and older brothers.Despite Ethel Rosenberg's excellent academic record and her great singing and her acting (her high school year book predicted that Ethel would be come a Broadway star), there was no thought of Ethel doing anything but going to work for a low-wage job when she left high school. There was only derision at home for her attempts to save money and devote time for music lessons, acting groups, and purchasing an old piano.It was on Ethel's first job that she was swept up into one CIO organizing campaign and another. The singing lessons she received and her participation in amateur acting troupes and a large choir that regularly sang at Carneige Hall were replaced by Ethel singing on picket lines, at union rallies, and at political meetings. She blossomed into a fighter for her class and her kind. Unfortunately, like so many of her generation, she could see no further than the ruinous and reformist politics of the stalinized American Communist Party, but that is another story.Yet, this book provides an excellent view to the inspiring and fighting spirit that workers of the time had. It is particularly interesting to read of the organizing campaigns among \\"white-collar\\" workers in stores and distribution centers and among technical and professional workers that Ethel and Julius Rosenberg joined in the 1930s and 1940s.Philipson does a good job at show the type of stress Ethel felt as a wartime and post war house wife, totally devoted to her children, and perhaps unnevered and overwhelmed by the difficulties her first son Michael presented. She even took college level child pyschology courses to try to learn to be a better mother.In these later days and in talking about the trial and imprisonment, Philipson centers her work on the emotional and pyschological stress that Ethel went through. Her younger brother David Greenglass and his wife had succumbed to Government threats. They invented lies about Ethel and her husband as the FBI dictated to save their skins. Her own mother and her brothers were pressuring her until the last days of her life, to \\"confess.\\" The wanted her to make up a story that would \\"save\\" herself, even if she would have to lie, implicate her husband and many others.It is here that Philipson shows this is the echo of the conflict in her family she faces as a youth, between the narrow world of personal greed, and a bigger world that Ethel came to live in. At the same time, Philipson who takes no position on the case itself, shows that Ethel was a human being, not the plaster saint some have made her out to be, who felt pain and sorrow, depression and fear, during her imprisonment. Among other women at the Womens House of Detention Ethel became popular, her songs being requested every night by other women. Yet, alone, the only woman in Sing Sing's \\"death house,\\" she succumbed to fear and depression at times.Philipson wrote this book before the recent disclosures of government tapes of Soviet dispatches from the period and the testament of a former KGB agent who claims he worked with Julius Rosenberg. Apparently, this book was written even before Robert and Michael Meeropol, Ethel's sons, gained Freedom of Information Act files on their parent's case.Even these sources reveal the government understood that Ethel Rosenberg had absolutely nothing to do with whatever Julius Rosenberg did or did not do. The government was simply using her prosecution to put pressure on her and her husband to confess. The government knew they were murdering an innocent woman when they electrocuted Ethel Rosenberg.I want to underline that this book is most interesting as the personal story of a working class woman from the lower east side, telling her story without romance or sentimentality, giving a picture of the kind of real stress and trauma real family life inflicts on us. It would be a great read and a precious book even if Ethel had never been involved in a cause celebre.What Ethel was guilty of is wanting to fight for more for working people and believing that her own fate was tied up with that struggle, and that giving her life was better than lying for the FBI and the rest of the US government. When a new wave of young working class fighters rises up to fight the persistant government and big business attacks on our jobs, our benefits, social programs, to fight the permanent war drive and the attacks on civil liberties, they should look to the example of Ethel Rosenberg to guide them."},{"Title":"Oral Presentations for Technical Communication: (Part of the Allyn & Bacon Series in Technical Communication)","review":"I'm teaching a class in technical presentations and this book helped me distill down the material into talking points.

Unfortunately, too many youths (and adults) in our own contemporary society continue to be crushed by parents & teachers with personal agendas at odds with individuality. This is most harmful in youths because they haven't been given an opportunity to explore or pursue themselves, and who often wind up emotionally stunted throughout their adult lives. Now as far as Hesse goes, he is one of my favorite authors, and I'd love to give this book more than three measly stars. However I don't think \\"Unterm Rad\\" (\\"Beneath the Wheel\\", aka: \\"The Prodigy\\") is nearly as interesting as his later works. I even think his earlier novel \\"Peter Camenzind\\", though less developed, is more enjoyable. Still, there are some good reasons to read this book. Though it was written after \\"Peter Camenzind\\" it details an earlier period of Hesse's life. Like Hans Giebenrath, Hesse was miserably unsatisfied with the pressures and direction of his early schooling. Hans' father (like Hesse, his mother was deceased early in his life) and the local village community push Hans to excel in the state examinations. His required studies include Latin, German, Greek & mathematics. Hans is a very sensitive and emotional boy who prefers poetry, art, and the simple pleasures of fishing to the rigid manner in which he taught the classics he otherwise enjoys immensely. Although Hesse doesn't go into great character depth with Hans, it's plain for all to see that he's stressed out and unhappy. He is even denied a summer vacation in between schools in favor of preparatory study. When he does manage to advance into the Maulbronn Seminary we experience \\"college\\" (boarding school) student life with Hans. He befriends a rebellious boy named Heilner who is a stock-type in many of Hesse's novels, and who represents the person Hesse actually wanted to be, or strove to be, as opposed to the protagonist who is always the person he believed himself to be. Hermann Heilner (note the similarity in name with Hermann Hesse) is eventually kicked out of school for his obstinance and basically disappears from the scene, but remains largely in the consience of Hans. Heilner is similar to Richard from \\"Peter Camenzind\\", except that he does not \\"die\\" here. Richard represented an intellectual & bohemian aspect of Hesse's life after college that he felt required to \\"shed\\" in order to grow into the \\"respectable\\" & \\"responsible\\" married man he became in and around 1905. If you read enough of Hesse's works you'll find that all of his novels pick up where the previous one left off in terms of inner-development. So for example, Hesse separates Heilner from Hans because he needs to take Hans to his natural conclusion right here and now, before returning to the Heilner in him in \\"Gertrude\\", \\"Rosshalde\\", and then \\"Demian\\", and so forth. Hans and Richard never completely leave Hesse or his future protagonists, but play smaller and less significant parts of their lives in the same way we grow older and (hopefully!) develop into wiser, more complex individuals.Literary analysis aside, \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" is Hesse's second full-length novel and you'll find him here building strength as a writer and artist; especially through his vivid descriptions of German Black Forest village life, the refreshing natural scenery always comforting and reflecting individual psychology, and a little bit in the colorful depictions of local characters and dialogue. Although I find \\"Peter Camenzind\\" more interesting as a novel, \\"Unterm Rad\\" is more well written and developed than \\"Peter Camenzind\\" which comes across as fragmented and incomplete. Both novels deal with the real, inner-life of youth and are morose, and depressing at times. No one reads Hesse for humor though. He has been aptly described as a \\"biographer of the soul\\", and I think this is why he appeals to so many individuals throughout time and country. \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" presents two important characters in the Hesse universe, all the more important for representing the early stages of individual human development amidst an indifferent and sometimes damaging social-system. Young Hans, like so many of us at one time or another struggles with the pressures of callous parents, neighbors, teachers, and society in general. He has to confront peer pressure, awkwardness in balancing his desires with what's desired of him, and the strangeness and power of first-love and sexuality. He excels in spite of himself, is on the \\"track\\", and a part of the system. He then falls off, and now suddenly must handle disappointment for the first time in his life. How will he deal with these unforseen (but predicatble) obstacles? This is the dark, mysterious realm where true character strength, courage, resillence, individuality, and beauty are forged in man & woman alike. Sadly, it is also the unknown realm which comfortable, status-quo, pigeon-holing, stereotypical, automaton producing society opposes, fears, and needs to repress, crush, and see defeated in order to vindicate itself.Thankfully, this will not happen as long as there are friends & soul-mates of writers like Hesse who continue to stand up for the demands and freedoms of individuality amidst the larger, impersonal society Hesse eventually comes to have great hope for in \\"The Journey to the East\\" and \\"The Glass Bead Game\\"."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Hesse wrote a very short autobiography in his later years, which can be found on the web. In this minute memoir, Hesse lists the works which he feels best represent him. \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" is not among them. My perception of this second novel of Hesse's is that the artistic merits of this work are limited by a personal desire on the part of the author to assign blame. While there is no doubt validity to Hesse's expose of various authority figures as being willing to sacrifice genius on the altar of bourgeois philistinism, it reduces the scope of the story down to a very narrow and particular, rather than universal, application to humanity.We can certainly sympathize with young Hans, who was robbed of his boyhood and adolescence by the insensitive ambitions of family and mentors. But there is a one-sided-ness to the portrayal. From the start, it is evident that Hans is to be a sacrificial victim, whose destruction paves the way for a condemnation of the establishment types who brought it about.Somehow, though, Hans' portrayal strikes some incongruous notes for me. Beside being a whiz at languages, Hans seemed to be a pretty normal, although quite intelligent, kid. He loved fishing, the outdoors, keeping pets, and constructing little mechanisms such as the water wheel in his garden. But he is seduced away from all these pleasures by the mephistophelian temptation, instilled by his instructors, to become an academic star.Somehow it doesn't ring true for me that a boy with such a love of nature would allow himself to become an inwardly pathetic, thin-armed, head-achy glory-seeker. Hesse felt he had been thwarted and impeded by the authoritarian academic system which destroyed Hans in his novel. But Hesse was not a grind who reveled in the brain-taxing philological studies of Hans, but was a nascent poet who made good his escape from the clutches of his repressive masters. Perhaps Hans had his counterpart in real life, but it seems likely that his character was a concoction designed to elicit maximum sympathy, and thus, maximum condemnation for the system and its practitioners.It is not a poorly written or mediocre novel, but the subjectivity of its highly interior viewpoint begins to feel monotonous. More dialogue and more insight into other characters' point of view might have contributed more interest. As it stands, it reads more like an expose of a very particular situation than a universal work of art. The theme of the outstanding genius who is not properly nourished by society is one most of us can only identify with vicariously. Here, that theme is presented more or less in a vacuum, without enough inclusion of supplementary or corroboratory themes to flesh it out and make it really take on life."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"I have read Hesse's Siddartha three or four times, and when I saw this book recommended during a TV tour of Maulbronn Monastery(the main setting), I decided to read it. The book is relatively rare and unknown, thus I was forced to purchase it new rather than from my trusty, nearby used book store. It is one very enjoyable read. The story is relatively short, clean, and simple; and true to Hesse's style, the imagery, especially of nature, is clear and effective. The reader gains a good measure of insight into the mind of the main character. More narrative than symbolic, the writing is clean and very readable, but with plenty to say. Those of us who have recently raised and schooled children know full well of the educational rat-race that seems to be growing more frenetic than ever. The net result of the translation is superb, though I cannot say whether it is true - just that it is very \\"American\\" and highly readable in its presentation. I have observed that certain British translations of German often appear chopped and jerky, often with odd and excess punctuation. If you like Hesse, or classic fin de siecle literature, (I do) then this will please you."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Hesse's one of my favorite writers. \\"Siddhartha\\" and \\"The Glass Bead Game\\" are among the best books I've read. Having read eight of his novels, I found Beneath the Wheel especially interesting. Interesting from the point that you'll notice some of the themes Hesse expands on in later novels. In this early work, for example, he tells of the struggles of a young man and you clearly see Hesse's real life disdain for the teaching mindset of the time.\\"Beneath the Wheel\\" is a good start for anyone reading Hesse for the first time."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"What is most interesting, for this reader, at least, is the smooth prose, the handiness with words, the flow of plot, and some of the archetypal imagery that we see in romantic writers describing adolescent suicide--e.g. drowning, floating, physical fragility and so forth. In terms of ideas, Beneath the Wheel is less impressive, and somewhat immature, which is a particular weakness since the book has an almost didactic undertone--a sort of humorlous cautionary tale. The underlying notions are recognizably romantic and not particularly original, although fresher certainly in Hesse's day than now. There is the young genius, sired from a philistine father, who is a bit too fine for this world, is of nobly fragile build, suffers under the oppressive, singularly bourgoise weight of the adults in his world and their oppressive education system, and succumbs, finally to the brutality of the system, drowning himself. Themes are of intellect versus feeling, city versus nature, conformity versus creativity, bourgois values versus art, and the nobility of sadness that finally culminates in suicide. In this sense, this coming of age novel is not particularly...novel, and the romantic story is told better by others--Goethe of course coming to mind. Nor do we particularly get a glimpse of the workings of Hans mind for much of the book, although one aspect of this novel did seem insightful. Those are the paragraphs describing Han's emotions and perceptions as he deteriorates during his tenure at the academy--detachment and dissociation, immersion in memories, longings for maternal love, the feeling that nothing matt ers. Otherwise the ideas seem borrowed from the floating currents of the era and are not particulary engaging except as a period piece. For comparison's sake, one can read Kafka's description of his philistine father, and see a more acutely observed description.

The main character is pressured academically like so many kids are today - pushed to the brink at the expense of his adolescent innocence and quality of life.

A very typical Hesse novel thematically, with an appropriate and unexpected ending."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"A compact book that is powerfully insightful about the passages to self discovery and individuation, like The Cather of the Rye, but alot more disciplined and poetic style of writing.

(no spoiler). This book, although not hard to guess the ending from the title, is highly interactive with the reader through its powerful motifs."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Hans Giebenrath is an adolescent who lives in a small, industrial town in the province of Wurtemberg, in Germany. For many youths of Hans' age schooling is coming to an end, and each one must choose a profession form the various trades offered in the near vicinity. But Hans is no ordinary youth. He has proved to be an excellent student, and indeed is the best scholar in his school. Hans is the only student in town who this year is to be entered into the Landexamen. Those who pass this exam gain free entry into the state run Protestant Theological College at Turingen. This training qualifies the student for a career at \\"the pulpit or the lecturing desk.\\" To be a vicar is a most esteemed career and Hans' father is very proud of his son, and strictly enforces a regime of learning, rather than allowing the boy to gad about wasting his time on fishing and the like. Hans receives hours of extra tuition lessons, in Greek from the Headmaster, in Latin from the Vicar, and in mathematics from that subject's head teacher. Like Hans' father all these important men are most proud of the boy and look forward to his great success. Not surprisingly Hans feels superior to most of the boys in town, who after all will soon be merely apprentices. Hans is too good-natured to be overly a 'snob', though he is socially cut off from his piers. The school year is coming to an end and soon the boy's 'great adventure' of learning will begin. But where in Hans' life is there room for the development of what might be called his essence, his core self?This book has also been published in English under the title _The Prodigy_._Beneath the Wheel_ (1906) is Hermann Hesse's second novel. His first, _Peter Camenzind_ (1904), examined the themes of personal happiness and the development of the 'true self'. This second novel also looks at those themes, but concentrates on the particular issue of education. Many would hold that education is essential for the full development of the personality, but looking realistically at the school system one must ask does it really assist, or in fact perhaps even hinder, the growth of the individual? What are those things that are essential to our selves? And if the personality is damaged what things can heal our 'core self'?Also like _Peter Camenzind_ this novel is written in a beautifully lyric style. There is a particularly delightful passage where Hans goes fishing during his holidays. Hesse describes this event so magnificently that the reader cannot help but become nostalgic for his own childhood. What is more this and other scenes truly 'live' for us. Where the first novel was truly of the Romantic School, this story, for all its beauty, is less hopeful, more harsh, and perhaps more realistic.The character of Hans develops well throughout the story and we have a definite sense that the book is taking us somewhere. Hans' friend, Hermann Heilner, is representative of the 'Romantic Poet' and here too we see an arch of trajectory in the character. The other characters, however, remain quite static. Flaig is the only character who shows any insight into Hans' predicament, but he does not really actively engage with the youth or take any other role in the development of the tale. That is to say he too is static. To be fair to Hesse, though, I should note that this static element in characterization is representative of the many useless, unhelpful elements of life, that lead nowhere in development.This novel represents a development in Hesse's thought. The author maintains his fascination for the vital elements of life, yet also thinks deeper into this philosophical question. At the same time Hesse leads his audience to think deeper into their own lives. Have we gone astray? Do we know exactly where things went wrong? These are deep questions yet the book is light and easy to read. At around 150 pages it is indeed a short read. This novel is certainly well worth reading and you may even find Hesse becoming one of your favorite authors."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Luis Mejia - Hesse's Beneath The Wheel can be classified onto his classic \\"youth\\" tales. Actually, out of this context I am not too experienced with the rest of his works, although there is something about the nature of the human spirit; which can only be described with certainty and growing beauty on it's formation, on adolescence, that Hesse's captures in a way you can feel so close as to your own father. This first novel - which wasn't his cup of tea as a writer - tells the story, almost in a philosophic perspective, of how an educated formation of a young kid, who by the times the story is set and it's cultural contexture (the Germany of early 20th century) is taught to be a sort of \\"spokeman\\" for his very own town, to the cumulative expectatives of others, by the honor of him being the only one to assist to a famous exam and even more famous institute. but through the experience this boy passes through crude and serious adult experiences, turning around numb headeaches, frustating insecurity, the lack of a clear goal, his thoughts of going through a wrong path only to go different from what the boy calls \\"the rest\\", and soon in this spiral he goes all the way back to dissapointment, finally falling without any type of emotional support; or rather unravelling it.On this institute (which was somewhat accurate due to Hesse once being expelled from this academy) the group of classmates is well explained, the death of one of the children; but specially his acknowledgement of friend Herman Heilner; a flamboyant poet boy who has such a strong spirit the proper academy has encounters with him. The story is dramatic by Hans going out due to his physical pains; and by this archaic failure, he soons discovers (progressively and secretively) the whole town and relatives had worn him out, and his treatment was just like a living death. The results: to fall into the dark side and end in tragedy. Apart from the severe education critic Hesse exposes with such delicate spirit, he describes most greatly the nature of the adolescent condition with such a warm and factual nature...I can't explain it very well, all I can say is that you must read it specially when you're a teen and specially to understand it; it will open spiritual doors. At the end of almost each of his stories, there's always that sense of essay and the message drowning the story, although this is something very peculiar about Hesse. It is short, to the point and sincere; a very important read."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Although I have seen this Hesse novel called \\"a Black Forest 'Catcher in the Rye',\\" I see little similarity beyond a young male protagonist who drops out of school. Otherwise, both the book's tone and the protagonist's personality are wildly different from Salinger's. Hesse's book is more steeped in academia than Salinger's, which only briefly treats Holden Caulfield's disillusionment with school early on in that book. Here the criticism of the academic grind are more focused and take up more than half the book. Also, \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" contains Hesse's trademark Romanticism and obsession with nature, and though we can consider Salinger's young hero a frustrated Romantic of sorts, sarcasm and cynicism are the preferred vehicles used and there's little in the way of paeans to nature as seen in the German tale.Fans of Hesse will find this book of interest, but might consider it \\"Hesse Light\\" compared to the author's more heavyweight entries. There's a touch of \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy-itis\\" to our young hero, Hans Giebermath, and some of his Werther-like sufferings are staples of adolescent tales we've read before. In his rebellion, Hans will sample blue-collar work and the siren calls of beer and cigars, but it is his forays into nature that lend the story its appeal. Hesse is at his best when describing forest streams with silent fish rising to dimple the surface, autumn valleys with milk-white mist rising from their crevices, and the torches of October trees turned bright red and orange before the approach of winter. If you love description, \\"Under the Wheel\\" will not disappoint. As a bildungsroman of a young man in school, however, it is very good, if not the strongest example of its kind."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"This book tells a meaningful story about a young boy struggling with an academic system that stifles freedom and creativity. He finds great success academically until he is awakened by a rebellious and free-spirited friend, who makes him rethink his drive to succeed on someone else's terms. This story seems to be going somewhere- as the boy falls out of the academic system he ultimately finds some new satisfaction in manual labor and finds a second chance to experience childhood. However, the story ends in a melodramatically tragic way, without exploring the boy's conflict in any real depth.Hesse makes some insightfully cutting remarks about academia's taming of young genius \\"like a jungle... cleared and its growth thwarted,\\" and manipulation of students as vessels to store teachers' ideas. However, Hesse just as often gets distracted in irrelevant details and overly brief development of flat characters.This is certainly not near at the level of Hesse's best works, though this is still early in his career (1906). Also, though there are thematic comparisons to Catcher in the Rye, this is an otherwise very reserved and repressed writing style typical of its time."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Hesse wrote this before he had full access to the wellsprings of creativity that produced masterpieces like STEPPENWOLF and NARCISSUS AND GOLDMUND. Nevertheless, the idea that standards from outside drive a gifted student to despair takes on new prophetic meaning as the current U.S. government strives to force all students (and teachers) into standardized measurements that can only shame those who do not &quot;measure up&quot; or whose uncalculatable gifts--you know, artistic talent, intuition, faith, courage, imagination, passion, idealism, love of learning--all that trivial stuff--will now fall ever more deeply into the cultural shadow.Later in his life, Hesse saw his early novels as hopelessly bourgeois. Some critics have followed him in this, but it's simply wrong. He always wrote from the heart; the difference is that the later novels spring from a heart fully cracked open.BENEATH THE WHEEL reflects the beginnings of that painful opening up to wider vistas for the author....and, it is hoped, for the reader as well."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"This is a brilliantly written critique - of the Prussian Education System - in the form of a novel. Herman Hesse intended to show how a natural genius(or any child) is stiffled under an educational system that does not care for the needs and desires of the children. A system that is designed for the benefit of the status quo social structure, but ignores the freedom of the children to grow up in accordance with their own dreams.The central character in this book is Hans Giebernath, a brilliant student in school, but a miserable failure in college after a short while. He is burned out - studying, studying, studying - matters irrelevant to him. He is not able to enjoy and cherish the joys of life. This is the story of his tragedy. His attempts to find a different path for himself in life, his desire to break out of the cage of the academy.Many will be able to relate to the story; I especially felt a strong similarity between Hans' lifestory and my own. I was a brilliant student in high school, went to an elite college carrying high hopes placed upon me by everybody that knew me, but burned out by the sheer boredom and irrelevance of the 'ivory towers'. However, unlike Hans Giebernath, I managed to put myself through four years, but not without much frustration similar to that felt by him. That is why I loved this story, finally a book that understands and sympathizes with young men like me.Hans' story continues after the college, has a few surprise twists and an ending that many can see coming. But that is not a shortcoming of the book, the author has built it up so that many a readers will not feel surprised by how the book ends.What can be said about the writing itself? It's brilliant and choke full of great imagery. Even without a florid prose, Herman Hess has created a work that is great pleasure to read for it's quality of writing and deep thoughts contained therein."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Hans lives in a small town with a small-town life and mentality. He turns out to be a remarkably intelligent boy and the leaders of the community take an interest in him. So they take him under their care, and start preparing him for admission into the Seminary. First sign: Nobody ever asks Hans if he wants to become a priest. It is simply assumed that a gifted boy like that, a rare jewel in such a sleepy town, has to go that way. An added pressure is that Hans's father is very proud of his boy and, besides, he has no mother. So he tacitly accepts studying Latin, Greek and Math, with a memorizing method. Studies are hard and abstract, and not connected at all with reality. Hans is rather shy and introspective, but likable nonetheless. For a year, he dedicates all his time to study, and finally gets to be admitted in the Seminary. He goes there, but finds life miserable (hint: he doesn't really like the idea of becoming a priest). There, he meets the excentric poet-to-be Hermann Heilner, and feels attracted to him. Heilner is an embittered young man, a loner and pompous lecturer. Their friendship gets Hans in trouble, and he becomes alienated from the rest of the students. He starts to underperform in class, and at some point suffers dismays and nervous breakdowns. And so he is sent back home, to suffer the disappointment of the town, which had put hope in him. Hans, of course, will always be conscious of his great failure: he didn't live up to the expectations he arose on his fellow townsmen. Hans then becomes a mechanic, surrounded by fellows he clearly does not belong with. One day, they go for a drink and, on returning home.. well, I won't spoil the ending. although it's not hard to imagine.I have no idea if Hesse projected himself in this book or not. What is clear is that, frequently, brilliant people are forced to live lives they don't want, but find extremely painful and difficult to speak their minds. Think of XIX century, puritan Germany. There was no way that Hans could say to his father and the local leaders: &quot;Hey, I'm smart but I'm not that ambitious. I just want to develop like a normal boy and then see what happens. I'm free to decide my life&quot;. No way. He falls prey to strict social structures, as so many people do even today.&quot;Under the wheel&quot; is certainly not one of the best books by Hesse. But it is well written and a first step in the elaboration of the basic subjects of all Hesse's work: the individual conscience and its relation to the World; the search to find a meaning to life; religion and individuality. Let's say that if you read this book, you'll find it easier to understand subsequent and more elaborate books."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Hermann Hesse's second novel, Beneath the Wheel, concerns the plight of young Hans Giebenrath who is a highly-prized student of his village. the pastor, the school master and Hans' father contrive to make the boy work hard so that he can take the examination that would allow him to enter the academy.In a society rife with class-consciousness, a middle class youth has few options. An academic career leading to a church position is the highest they can achieve. There is not much between. To be a clerk or artisan is looked down upon at his school. Hans achieves well.But his success is not enough. he is worked harder and at the academy he finds a friendship that clearly demonstrates that this type of striving is wrong-headed. His friend, Heilner, is considered a revel and forced to leave the school. The hypocrisy of the staff is evident in the losses the school suffers.Hans returns home in disgrace having experienced a breakdown no one diagnoses correctly. His own death is something only the shoemaker Flaig can assess correctly.Some of this plot seems aubiographical, but Hesse makes a point in 1906, the year in which this book was published, that a society that divides people by class and forces their young into desperate work is doomed. The wheel of time, of fate, of relentless, mindless motion will grind the ones who seek something more transcendant.The book is touching. Yet in light of Hesse's other works, this book is somewhat immature. It certainly remains a good start and the author will go on to write farw more challening material. Yet Beneath the Wheel offers challenge to the x-generation. Are they, too, mindlessly achieving without attending to the transcendant?"},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Distinctly autobiographical, this novel (Hesse's second),tells the story of a young man driven to accomplish andachieve, then finally to a complete breakdown and suicide.The young academic who spends his summer learning Hebrewreturns home in disgrace, having been unable to keep upwith the combined emotional stress of his intense studiesand the pressure from his family to always do better. Thisis the story of Hesse's frustration--the author himself didsuffer a breakdown, and would continue to have problemsthroughout his life--and the direction it could have led.It is also a severe indictment of those who, in livingtheir own failed dreams through another, destroy the vesselthey seek to fill with accomplishment."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"I like this better than all of Hesse's other books because it paints such a vivid picture of the downfalls of modern education. The rigid intellect is stressed that crushes the human spirit and creative mind. So you can bubble a few circles on a scantron? So what!

But it translates well to our SAT-driven society and the pressure we put on gifted adolescents to acheive in the areas &quot;we&quot; believe they should acheive in."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Hesse's second novel, published in 1906. The story fosters an attack on educational systems that foster intellect, purposefulness, and ambition to the detriment of emotion, instinct, and soul. The duality of human nature (a familiar theme in Hesse) is represented by complimentary figures of Hans and Hermann, the latter escaping through art and a rejection of the system, while the former is crushed beneath the wheel. Hans' progress towards oblivion unfolds with many surprises, and the sensuous beauty of nautre plays its part even at tragic moments, as in the finale, when Hans is infatuated with the village girl, Emma, and when he goes off on a summer afternoon's drunken spree."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"In this book plenty of sensibility and, sometimes, hardness Hesse show us the negative consequences of some educative systems, which are efficient for success at expense of loosing the mental and physical health and waste the important years of childhood and adolescence.

Like a lot of American high-schoolers in the &quot;fast track&quot; to college, I was feeling way overworked. I never had time anymore to enjoy nature, good books or anything else. It seemed that my life was school, and nothing else.On a whim, I picked this up. &quot;Beneath the Wheel,&quot; or &quot;Unterm Rad&quot; (auf Deutsch) is the story of a brilliant young man (in the prodigy sense) who is worked to death by those who unconsciously care nothing for him, but to see his advancement.While I never experienced anything as extreme as Hans, this book really made me question why I was doing what I was doing. Why was I working myself to death in high school? Was I learning anything? Was I growing as a person?This book is wonderful because Hesse tells the story is such a simple and poetic way; and it is translated marvelously. Simply a joy to read. I can read it over and over again. So, take heed, reader. Enjoy this book and spend many an afternoon questioning the merits of forced education; and different systems of learning. A good technical follow-up is &quot;Teaching As A Subersive Activity.&quot; Check it out."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"BENEATH THE WHEEL is the tragic story of young Hans Giebenrath. Young Hans is a precocious, possibly genius young man from a small one-horse German village. It's a working class town that is known for its steadfast character of its denizens, but not for the scope &amp; breadth of their erudition. Hans is the exception to the rule: he is far &amp; away intellectually superior to his peers, and he knows it.So bright is Hans that he is selected to attend a German monastery to continue his academic studies. So prestigious is this academy that it would be comparable to an American student being accepted to Princeton or Stanford. It is on this journey that we join young Hans; so full of promise as well as a wee bit of arrogance.In some ways, this book could be described as the anti-CATCHER IN THE RYE. Instead of extolling education as something worthwhile as opposed to merely banal, Hesse has a far less flattering view of the educational system. The crux of the book is found in the following passage:&quot;A schoolmaster will prefer to have a couple of dumbheads in his class rather than a single genius, and if you regard it objectively, he is of course right. His task is not to produce extravagant intellects but good Latinists, arithmeticians and sober decent folk.&quot; (99-100)Here it becomes evident that Hesse has little regard for a German pedagogic system which places pragmatism above nourishing persons of exceptional mental acumen. Most of the rest of the book revolves around the nucleus of this passage.The whole tone and style of this book very much reminds me of Thomas Mann. The theme of transition from adolesence to adulthood is present in Mann's works as well. By coincidence, due to the fact that they're both German authors, Mann's &amp; Hesse's books are alongside each other on my bookcase. After reading this novel, I found this arrangement to be all the more fitting. I do know that Mann &amp; Hesse were friends; it appears that they held an influence over each others works as well.This book is highly recommended, particularly to promising high school students who plan on attending college. It engages one of the most horrifying prospects that a serious student faces: flunking out and falling back into the milieu of the blue collar working environment. Of course, working any honest job is a noble endeavor. However, we at once remember the closing paragraph of Schopenhaur's essay ON GENIUS:&quot;A person of high, rare mental gifts, compelled to attend to a merely useful piece of business for which the most ordinary person would be fitted, is like a valuable vase decorated with the most beautiful painting, which is used as a kitchen-pot; and to compare useful men with men of genius is like comparing bricks with diamonds&quot; (Arthur Schopenhaur, PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS, p. 97. Trans: E. F. J. Payne)For those of us caught in the middle of Schopenhaur's dichotemy, it is with the greatest strain that we reach for the one, but end up plunging into the other. This is both a consoling and cathartic novel for all the people out there who (like me!) have strived for greatness, but fallen short. When it comes to profoundity, most of us tend to fall beneath the wheel."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Herman Hesse wrote this novel in 1906, long before he became known as one of the greatest writers in the 20th century. Obviously autobiographical, it tells the story of a Hans, young boy from a small village in the Black Forest region of Germany, who was pushed to study for exams so that he could gain admittance into a famous school that prepared boys for the ministry. Under the tutelage of the schoolmaster and the minister, he is pushed almost beyond endurance to master Greek, Latin, Hebrew, mathematics and other subjects. His childhood is spent in unrelenting study and he even has to give up his love of fishing. And then when he passes his exams and is admitted to the school, the pressure gets even worse. No wonder he gets splitting headaches!Immediately, the reader is drawn into the story and we become the young Hans, and see the world through his eyes. We are there with him during the long hours of study and we meet his schoolmates, one young man in particular, a poet, who rebels against the system that is forcing the students to keep pushing themselves from getting crushed \\"beneath the wheel.\\" Young Hans starts to have episodes of forgetfulness and fainting and eventually has a nervous breakdown and is sent back to his village in disgrace. The inevitable conclusion is tragic.I can easily see the making of the great writer in Hesse's youthful novel. He's a master of simply stating the contradictions around him without making the connections obvious. And his descriptions of the beauty of nature are wonderful. He captures the essence of the heavy price we pay in doing what is expected of us without question. There's historical significance here too because, as we read, we have the hindsight to know what later happened in Germany. And yet, we also see that there's a strong element in our own American culture that pushes young people to bend to the yoke of prescribed achievement too. There is food for thought throughout and this book is as fresh today as when it was written almost a century ago. Recommended."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"As an educator, I just had two of my gifted students read this novel, and am pleased that I can now read it with multiple lenses. I re-read it recalling my own experiences of high pressure and one-up-manship from an affluent Catholic suburban high school. But now, as a teacher, I see all the dangers in creating gateways and irreversible standards for present day students where colorless logic and linguistics have sadly replaced the need for creativity, independence, and integrity.Set in pre-World War Germany of the early 1900s, it's also a remarkable read when you compare it to the state of affairs of modern America. These timeless themes have surprisingly remained the same: social status over spiritual discovery, labels and test scores over substance and meaning, product over process. One must ask, are we headed in the same direction as early 20th century Germany?How many Hans Giebenrath's will we neglect in our lifetime? How many times will we set up an education system where genius is stifled? It makes you wonder how many great minds are lost in the rat race of modernity.This classic is a great way to generate discussion between teacher and student, especially the student who strives for excellence yet struggles to maintain sanity and identity in a world that has unfortunately favored high SAT's and social rank over family, honor, friendship, and art for art's sake.It's a beautiful contrast of the real and the ideal; the simple life and the complexity of adolescence."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"This is a story about the faults of education and how they push gifted kids too hard. In an effort to maximize their intellectual talents they leave out expression of soul and of the spirit. In the process of trying to cram their brains they may destroy their desire to learn and maybe even their lives....In this story Hesse presents a completely opposite personality to the main character. Hans (the main character) meets Hermann, who is more concerned with poetry and the soul than academics like Hans. These opposite characteristics seem to attract each other and they become best friends.Overall this is a very good book and I would reccomend it to all Hesse fans.

I completed a BA, MBA, and PhD...and found two professors in all that time who even vaguely gave an idle damn about the students they were supposedly educating. I have since found that comparative discussions with peers have proven my experience to be anything but unique...indeed, my observations have met commonplace agreement, and therefore are all the more disappointing as a result. Hesse called it fairly and true way in advance of current times."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"(4.5 stars, actually)'Beneath the Wheel,' or, as it was originally titled in German, 'Unterm Rad,' is a stunningly good early Hesse novel, one of his best and more memorable early books (although my personal favorite of his early work is 'Rosshalde'). I wouldn't say it's as memorable as a book like N&G; or 'Steppenwolf,' but it's more memorable than, say, 'Knulp' or 'Peter Camenzind.' It concerns a promising young schoolboy, Hans Giebernath, one of the brightest minds in his local school, who is so intelligent and accomplished a scholar he is chosen to take an important test that, if he passes, will grant him entry into a higher institution of learning and knowledge, so much more advanced and well-equipped than the village school he's currently enrolled in. If accepted, he will be able to make a better life for himself and make his father, a widower, proud of him. However, as much as Hans is longing for this opportunity to break away from stagnant home village, he also isn't too keen on the idea of having to study 'round the clock instead of being able to spend more time in one of his very favorite pastimes, fishing.Hans is incredibly worried he won't pass, even after all he's given up and how much he's studied, convinced he has completely blown the Latin or Greek portion of the test. But, since he's so brilliant, he passes with flying colors and is able to go away to the big school. However, before he leaves, the local priest counsels him that they may teach him Greek in a \\"heretical\\" fashion; i.e., in a way that may expose some centuries-old mistranslations and misinterpretations of the Bible, and therefore cast into doubt the entirety of religion and the authority of priests such as he is. Hans doesn't agree with the priest's narrow-minded view, and determines he'll study Greek however he wants to, whether or not it conflicts with traditionalist translations of the Bible.Upon arriving at the school, Hans very soon finds himself crushed further and further \\"beneath the wheel.\\" Instead of encountering enlightened nurturing teachers, he finds teachers who are little more than machines, not instilling any love of or joy in learning. He starts falling behind in his studies and suffering from ill health as a result of all of this, and in addition has become friends with Hermann, another nonconformist the school is trying to crack down on. This friendship gets him into trouble with the other boys as well, not just their teachers. What follows exposes the dangers lurking in ivory towers, how bright innocent young people who come to post-secondary institutions full of joy, hope, and promise, on a quest for knowledge, enlightenment, and people who feel the same way they do are often turned into mindless automatons or risk paying the price for how they don't fall into line. Hans himself is eventually expelled the same way Hermann is, finding his way back to his native village, looked on with shame and stigma, with little choice but to follow in his father's footsteps and become a mechanic. The final result of all of this was really a surprise to me; I did not see the end coming, though some people might have predicted it."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"First of all, let me explain that I give this book four stars instead of five only because I do not think that it measures up to certain others of Hesse's works--namely, Siddhartha and Steppenwolf. Nonetheless, it is excellent.Beneath the Wheel (Imagine that italicized; I wish I could italicize it!) is the story of a gifted boy's schooling. The main character, who seems to represent the young Hermann Hesse, simply does not fit in with the people of his small German town. When the townspeople and his father discover that young Hans is unusually bright, they take control of his life and dictate what his ambitions should be. The town piles its hopes on Hans, and in so doing, forces all sense of balance out of his life.Well, if I tell you any more than that, I might ruin the plot, although I do have a few more comments. Like many of Hesse's main characters, Hans seems to suffer from some form of depression. His experience is not very different from that of modern gifted students, who, as soon as it is discovered that they are \\"gifted,\\" are often put into programs (such as Honors programs) that seem designed to overwork them and punish them for their natural gifts. So, Hans's story, though fictional, resonates with me: I feel that I went through a very similar kind of education. I was selected, through standardized testing, for gifted programs; once in those programs, I was not challenged with work that required more creative or expansive thinking, but rather with ridiculous quantities of work; I, too, ended up dangerously depressed.Therefore, I recommend this book to all teachers involved in gifted or Honors programs. I recommend it even more strongly to the administrators really in charge of determining what those programs will be, who often leave the teachers powerless to help their own (sometimes suicidal) students to restore balance to their lives.Read it if you were punished by the \\"Honors\\" system, and you want an author who can commiserate.And anyway, it is, as the rest of Hesse's work is, beautifully written."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"This is a well-written book, very personal as all of Hesse's works are, but suffers from a rather underdeveloped writing style -- understandable since it was written so early in Hesse's career -- but still quite noticeable. The book is based upon the character of Hans Giebenrath, a boy who is \\"beneath the wheel\\" -- he is attending school to become a member of the clergy, which was one of the few options available to intelligent people in Hesse's day. he had to study Latin, Greek, history, theology, and so on -- none of which to hans seems to have the slightest relation to reality -- it's all just dry, dead scholasticism that stuffy professors have to know that does nothing but remove one from the centre and essence of life rather than contributing to it. Hans tries and tries, and succeeds until he meets Heilner, a misfit whom hans secretly admires but does not have the courage to emulate totally. Keeping Hesse's later works in mind, one would get the idea that heilner is actually a projection of the true, inner self of Hans -- the person he needs to be, but does not have the courage to become. Nevertheless, Heilner is a poet -- he sees the silly scholastic activities for what they are -- as if conjugating aroists and memorising the date of Charlemagne's death had any real significance! And he manages to get himself disgraced; it is then that Hans begins to realise that all that he is doing is nothing but hypocrisy. He is doing it simply because he is expected to do it, not because he has any real passion for his studies. he loses interest, and to all mundane valuations, becomes a failure. He gets a job in manual labour which offers even less in the way of mental stimulation that the challenging, but useless scribblings of the clergy and professors do. (...) The book highlights a central theme in the life of the \\"artist\\" types: how one is forced to accept values that one knows are false, but to which there seems no other alternative. the creative person is caught between a rock and a hard place, having to choose between a common, bourgeois existence or dead scholasticism and vital life -- one needs to choose vital life, but how? No answer is given. A very autobiographical novel, Hesse's own struggles are not really the result of any inherent mental instability, but simply underlines the problems of the traditional Wilsonian \\"Outsider\\": how is one is to live the most intense life with integrity and not bow out to the values of the masses? Like so many outsiders, Hesse and Hans knew that something was wrong, knew that they needed a way out, but Hans was not successful in finding out exactly where that path lay. An excellent book, well-worth anyone's time."},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","review":"Having been a long time Hermann Hesse fan, I was more than pleasantly surprised by Beaneth the Wheel - the story of early conflict between fitting into and earning respect in a bourgeois society and allowing for the discovery of the self and life's meaning. This conflict would be further enumerated in such books as Narcissus and Goldmund and Steppenwolf. The writing style is very straight-forward and not as developed as in later works, but overall this is a much better introduction to Hermann Hesse than most high school students get in the form of Siddartha or Damian. I would recommend it highly to any age group."},{"Title":"Love and Death in Brooklyn (Blades Overstreet Mystery)","review":"Ex NYPD cop Carmen \\"Blades\\" Overstreet returns, and is thrust back into crime solving mode in this murder mystery, Love and Death in Brooklyn.

He's over the animosity caused over his departure from the force and is comfortably settled with his wife and newly discovered nine-year-old daughter. Life is going good. He attends a birthday party for Noah, where his estranged son Ronan decides to make amends with his father. A moving public display of love and forgiveness is shattered in the split second it takes for a bullet to end Ronan's life. Naturally Blades can't sit around and do nothing. The cop instinct is too strong plus his loyalty to his friends, and he feels it is his duty to discover who or what is responsible for this heinous crime. As the reader is drawn further into this tangled web, people close to Blades are intricately woven into the murder. I wondered how he trusted anyone, but his intuition and uncanny ability to stick with his feelings sees him through.I was struck with the similarities of writing style between Glenville Lovell and Walter Mosley. I can see Blades reaching the status of Easy Rawlins if he continues on this writing level. Blades is memorable, an active participant in the drama and cognizant of his influence in the lives of those he is surrounded by. Both writers tend to use a lot of characters to illuminate the plot and build a healthy anticipation level. No ends were left undone, which is remarkable with such a large cast.

Blades feels as though everything in life is finally falling into place, and he's beginning to think that leaving the danger of the New York City Police Department was the best decision.

He is then thrown back into the dangerous world he thought that he'd left behind.LOVE AND DEATH IN BROOKLYN by Glenville Lovell is a heart stopping action thriller that kept me guessing. With the themes of friendship, lust and the need for revenge, this is an exhilarating novel. I love fast paced crime novels with a hero for who I can root and Blades Overstreet, who serves up a hefty dose of drama and sex appeal is quickly becoming my favorite mystery man. For excitement and adventure with a sexy backdrop, I recommend that you invest in a copy of this book.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawksof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Love and Death in Brooklyn (Blades Overstreet Mystery)","review":"This book is Lovell's 2nd \\"Blades Overstreet\\" novel, the 2nd of many more to come (I hope!). I really liked the story line in this book, It kept me turning pages to see what was going to happen. I especially liked that it was set in Brooklyn and mentions some of the establishments that I myself have frequented throughout the years. this helped to make me feel like I was a part of the book. I found myself imagining that I was Blades and all this was happening to me! In my opinion that is what makes good writing. Keep up the good work Glenville!!"},{"Title":"Love and Death in Brooklyn (Blades Overstreet Mystery)","review":"Several years have passed since the \\"friendly fire\\" bust nearly cost the former NYPD African-American Officer Blades Overstreet his life. He became so acrimonious in his thirst for vengeance his beloved wife Anais fled across the country to California. His friend Noah helped Blades release some of his anger, but what helped most was winning his lawsuit against the NYPD last year for 2.5 million and getting Anais and their preadolescent daughter back living with him in Brooklyn. Much of the bitterness has left Blades though he can still taste some bile.Blades attends Noah's sixtieth birthday party held at a South African restaurant when Ronan, the son of the guest of honor, arrives in spite of a rift wider than the Grand Canyon between father and son. The joy is short-lived when thugs appear and kill Ronan in front of the ecstatic party attendees. Perhaps he has a compulsive personality that makes Blades obsess over the homicide and makes inquiries, but soon finds his life and loved ones threatened by the Brooklyn-based Russian Mafia. Ignoring the police warning him to stay out of this and driving Anais crazy, Blades continues his private investigation.LOVE AND DEATH IN BROOKLYN uses the same theme of a fanatical angry Blades seeking resolution but driving his wife crazy and the police confrontational as he did in the wonderful TOO BEAUTIFUL TO DIE yet the plot is wrapped around an entirely different delightful plot. While Blades stays true to character, the fast-paced story line takes readers throughout Brooklyn. The delightful secondary ensemble enables readers to see inside Blades and his co-star, the largest borough, to the heart and mean streets in a terrific urban private investigate tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Flying High: The 2004-05 Fighting Illini Record-Breaking Season","review":"This thing was published March 30.

As enlightening as he is,I find that Massey omits to consider the inner aspects of religion.He fails to see that the Egyptian mythos is primarily concerned with the spiritual development of man, and it uses outward Nature to symbolise inner spiritual evolution.This is explained by Alvin Kuhn in THE LOST LIGHT, who is indebted to Massey, but takes his ideas further into the spiritual and soul aspects.All in all, ANCIENT EGYPT, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD is a unique and fascinating book.Most books written about ancient Egypt are way off beam, but this book puts you on the right track.It is a must read in order to start to understand the ancient Egyptian mythos."},{"Title":"Ancient Egypt : The Light of the World (2 Vol Set)","review":"Gerald Massey is much like Freud, a man whose herculean intellect combined with his revolutionary discoveries (and in Freud's case obvious character flaws) make people long after him debate his relevance in the intellectual world he himself created (kind of like debating the existence of Frank Lloyd Wright's art in the Guggenheim Museum). What stops this book from being a five star epic is simply his tendency to ramble, creating a labyrinthian world of insight and ideas that can confuse the reader. Yet his work is so meaningful, and so provocative, that it is has only been in the last few years, with the advent of Mega-book outlets like Amazon.com, that his books were available outside of the occult or Afrocentric bookstore.Gerald Massey was not an &quot;Afrocentric&quot; as we have come to know the term today- which is now seen as pejorative. That is what makes him all the more important. In fact, one major reason that his work has been written off for most of this century, is that his logical deductions, gathered from the variety of disciplines that work so logically together, fly in the face of conventional scholarly wisdom without an obvious thing for him to gain from it in the form of reputation or finances. His work reifies the linguistic, astronomical/religious, architectural and Darwinian/evolutionary perspectives to such a degree that devout Christians and Greco/Roman cultural sepremacists should beware this book. It will shake the very foundations of your faith before giving you the space to reclaim it with a new point of view; particularly in his decoding of the origins of our comparitively modern religious beliefs and literary myths.Like it or not, Gerald Massey was one of those authors that turn your mind upside down, like Alice's looking glass, to the point where you wonder what is the &quot;real&quot; ancient world, and its influence on the world after it- up to and including today. That alone makes him profoundly successful as an historian/Egyptological anthropologist, with something great to offer all of us.He may be considered, along with the superhuman Godfrey Higgins (ANACALYPSIS), as the gatekeeper of alternative scholarly vision.

Not of the muscle and action, but of the heart. It covers 50 saints from St. Ann, the grandmother of Jesus, to St. Casimir of the 15th century. There is 1 - 2 1/2 pages of written text and 1 picture given for each saint. The water color paintings in this book beautifully illustrate the accompanying stories.It would be too historically based (IE. discussing the historical background of the saint's life) to be meaningful for elementary school children. But junior high school children and adults alike would find it enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"L.A. Justice","review":"Though the suspect comes from wealth, the case against Randy Bingham is as tight as a glove on a hand. Los Angeles police detectives Virgil Sykes and Dan McNeil immediately upon arriving at the crime scene in the Hancock Park section of town realize that someone sloppily tried to change a murder into a suicide, making the homicide even clearer. The culprit shot Shelli Dietz in Randy's home. Shelly's preadolescent son testifies that Randy killed his mother.Deputy District Attorney Nikki Hill sees holes in the case that her lover Virgil and his partner provide to her, but continues with the prosecution against Randy. As she gathers more information, Nikki finds her own office hoping she will fail in this headline case. Also causing credibility problems for the prosecution is IA looking into Dan's recent killing of a prostitute. Still, the predominance of the evidence clearly points towards Randy even if Nikki begins having reasonable doubt.The second Hill legal thriller is an exciting tale that keeps the octane flowing at its highest levels. The story line is fast-paced, filled with action, and never slows down for a nanosecond though readers will need to keep an open mind about the facts in the case. The relationship between Nikki and Virgil crumbles too easily due to misconceptions, misinformation, and miscommunication and adds little but unnecessary turns to the plot. Still Christopher Darden and Dick Lochte provide an enjoyable tale that sub- genre fans will appreciate because of its insider's look at the system at a supersonic pace.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"L.A. Justice","review":"It is very easy to dismiss this book as a continuing opportunistic money generator from a notable trial Mr. Darden was involved in. Suggesting it resembles anything to do with the infamous Criminal Trial Mr. Darden prosecuted is just too easy and lazy. The truth is that this book would probably be more highly rated if his name were not associated with the book. Cynicism is a sport in this Country, and if that kept people from this book it's their loss.While the Courtroom plays a role in this book it does not monopolize the story. Mr. Darden could easily produce courtroom tales from his 15 years as an L.A. Prosecutor. The book is more of a mystery and it is much better than what most Lawyers turned Novelists are offering by the truckload. You never know who really wrote what in these collaborations, but Mr. Dick Lochte deserves his share of the credit as well.I have not read the first installment in this series but I enjoyed this volume enough that I will backtrack to the first. I view books of this type as clever and entertaining if done reasonably well, and this book certainly qualifies. The book did contain a couple of comments that were based on the fruit who was, \\"responsible for but not guilty of\\", killing two people. I found these distracting at best, and petty cheap shots at worst. In his book on the trial his personal feelings were appropriate, to continue to drag them into novels just gives credence to the charge he continues to use and profit from the one trial.I don't read many books like this, however this is worth the time. My only criticism is that the book was a bit longer than it needed to be, and the more of this type of book you have read the earlier you may puzzle out the plot. I believe the Authors started tipping their hand too early almost as an effort to justify the continuation of the story they wished to tell.Entertaining read. 3.5 Stars"},{"Title":"L.A.

This engrossing page turner opens with someone being murdered and the race is on to convict the accused of a crime he doesn't remember committing. Filled with excitement and sure to have your attention from the very first page, LA Justice is a novel for those who need to read a well written story with no stones left unturned. Told as one would come to expect from an ex-lawyer (Darden), this novel is definately a great read!"},{"Title":"L.A. Justice","review":"I enjoyed this book because the African American female character, Nikki Hill, is strong, independent and intellegent. So few novels offer up African American characters who challenge the intellect while not making clowns of themselves. Other top-notch serial mystery authors (with interesting African American female characters) who deserve attention include Eleanor Taylor Bland (The Marti MacCallister Mysteries), Grace F. Edwards (The Mali Anderson Mysteries), Penny Mickelbury (The Carol Ann Gibson Mysteries)and Paula L. Woods (The Charlotte Justice Mysteries). Christopher Darden and his co-author are breaking into a level of excellence heretofore only shared with the mystery divas mentioned above.

She has a son, Adam, who is ten years old and a mechanical genius. Shelli is having an affair with Randolph Bingham III, a multi-millionaire.Then Shelli is murdered. The prime suspect is Randolph Bingham III. Enter Nikki Hill, the young black bright and beautiful Deputy District Attorney and her lover, detective officer Virgil Sykes.Jeffrey, brother of Randolph tries to burn down the house where Adam is living. Nikki and Virgil try to provide what security they could for the boy genius while they go after the murderer of Shelli.A lot of plot threads branch out from the main story. I guess it was necessary to fill out the 434 pages.Virgil's partner, Detective Dan McNeil is accused of murdering a whore with whom he had a relationship. The whore had been working for two gangsters, Ricky and Pickett. Both of them are murdered. By whom? Was it by Dan?Another plot thread is the relationship between Virgil and Nikki. The book depicts its ups and downs quite in detail, including their fights as well as some gratuitous love scenes.Yet another plot thread is provided by the intrigues within the District Attorney's office.The action is well paced. Could have been a little shorter and more to the point. The court scenes are very interesting. The ending seems a bit contrived. On the whole, the book is quite readable and does not bore.Ahmed A.

I didn't get a chance to read the first Nikki Hill novel 'The Trials of Nikki Hill',so the character of Nikki seemed a little shallow. Overall though, the book reads well by itself. The story moves at a steady pace until the action packed finale, which was entertaining, yet surprising. The relationship between Nikki and Virgil seemed a bit contrived.

Yet despite their fame - and despite pioneering research in the early twentieth century - they remain little known and little studied today. Their lives are still shrouded in mystery though the faces they depict have great clarity and immediacy.Their portraits, reproduced here in spectacular colour plates show, primarily, members of the Courts of Francis I and his successors, and are comparable to those made by Holbein at the Court of Henry VIII. Professor Jollet begins this book by discussing the status of portraits and portrait painters in sixteenth century France and analyses the importance of the \`self image' at the court of France. He sets the paintings and drawings of the Clouets into their European context, and traces the development of the \`Clouet formula' through the art of both father and son. 33.0 x 25.0 cm 169 illustrations, 114 in colour First published 1998 320pp"},{"Title":"Jean and Francois Cloet Hb","review":"Absolutely amazingly beautiful portraits by these artists!

This book really captured the same feeling of many of the historical sites I visited. My favorites are Chenonceau and Vaux-le-Vicomte, the French chateaux with formal garden.This paper back version is only 287 pages much shorter then the first hardcover that was about 400-500 pages. I don't quite remembered, but I think there were some lesser chateaux taken out. I found the hardcover for $130 at a local architectural bookstore. So, this definitely a steal at Amazon price of $28.The pictures are very big; every other page is a full page photograph. Some pages have a smaller picture and a written summary. This is more of a picture book with very little written texts, so you can't really use it for writing a resource paper. The picture of the building or site is very clean, since most of these places are full of tourist and it is funny seeing it empty. There are photographs of Chateaux, garden, interior design with furniture, and sculpture.If you like France and garden after the Baroque period, this is a nice book.

Many years later, he is married and the father of a teenage boy of his own. He has suppressed his true sexuality for all this time, but when a school reunion comes up, Brad meets up with an old flame and the two men rekindle their feelings. Brad finally comes to grips with his homosexuality and the fact that his life is a lie. He makes the decision to divorce his wife as soon as their son, Josh, leaves for college. Meanwhile, Harp is a beautiful, if somewhat naive, high school student who wrestles with his own same-sex attraction. He meets an older man named Doug and the two of them embark on an exploration of sexuality that eventually leads to Harps involvement in prostitution. Brad and Harp meet and fall in love, but there is a mysterious third person involved in this romantic triangle and his shocking secret might just destroy what Brad and Harp have built together...Delightfully trashy...perfect for fans of soap operas or Jackie Collins novels. This smut is plentiful and graphically presented...'--Jay Klein, Out Front Magazine\\"-- zebraz"},{"Title":"The Man Nobody Knows","review":"In his second major work, The Man Nobody Knows, author Bruce Barton portrays Jesus Christ as a salesman--not an ordinary salesman, but the world's greatest salesman--and exhortsreaders to profit by his example. Additionally, the story of the carpenter from Nazareth, Barton argues, is \\"the story of the founder of modern business (12).Throughout the book, Barton paints Christ in a positive color. He disavows the \\"wicked falsehood that [Christ] never laughed\\" (23), from inference of the New Testament--the men whobecame his disciples never would have been attracted to a man who demonstrated Miltonian characteristics. Further, Barton comments on Christ's leadership, as \\"only strong magnetic meninspire great enthusiasm and build strong orginizations. Yet Jesus built the greatest orginization of all...He picked up twelve men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an orginization that conquered the world\\" (35-36). This act could have only been done by a supreme business executive, a man who knew how to persuade others, and was so passionate in hisrhetoric that men would be willing to give their lives for his cause. Hence, Christ was the greatest salesman of all.Finally, through the use of scripture, Barton demonstrates Christ's ultimate leadership qualities during Christ's cruxifiction. As Christ was hanging on the cross, one of the thieves painfully asked that Christ remember him when Jesus returns to his kingdom. Barton believes this was Christ's greatest act of leadership, as \\"there have been leaders who could call forth enthusiasm when their fortunes ran high. But [Christ], when his enemies had done their worst, so bore himself that a crucifed felon looked into his dying eyes and saluted him as king\\" (220).Written in 1925, The Man Nobody Knows was an immesensely popular book. With the post-World war I production levels becoming so high that consumers were unable to buy all theproducts that industry produced, new markets had to be created. It was out of this climate that the advertising industry came of age. Barton, chairman of the board of the New York advertisingagency Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborne, saw Christ as the ultimate master of salesmanship. He hoped that his readers, in an age of wealth and extravagence, would reflect back upon Jesus, not as weak man, but a man of such strong physical and emotional characteristics that readers would \\"exclaim [Jesus] is a man nobody knows\\" (vii).Bruce Barton's The Man Nobody Knows, is written in beautiful, sincere prose. Throughout the novel, Barton maintains a high quality of reverence for Christ, and his teachings.Although Barton's primary audience are salesmen and businessmen, the book appeals to any reader, religious or atheist, businessman or farmer.The Man Nobody Knows is a wonderful tool for examining Christ's life as a smiling, divine businessman. As the wheel of big business turns and men spend their lives striving tomake millions of dollars, Barton reminds us of one businessman who gave his life in comforting millions of souls."},{"Title":"The Man Nobody Knows","review":"I think some people wrote their reviews without reading the book. If you judge it by only the chapter titles or the text on the front of the book, you are really missing out. I was required to read this for a college class and I am very glad I got the chance to find this gem. For anyone interested in the life and works of Jesus or just love to read a good book that makes you rethink things, definitely check this one out."},{"Title":"The Man Nobody Knows","review":"Comrade McAllister's review below, \\"Astonishing This Chestnut is Still Around,\\" has nothing to do with this book (The Man Nobody Knows, by Bruce Barton). It is as if he didn't read it, much less understand its profound and deeply moral meaning. The message of this book is dead set against what McAllister sees as the \\"gluttony of corporate America.\\" Indeed, Bruce Barton says repeatedly that those who seek long term success must first be willing to \\"lose themselves at the bottom\\" - in humble, spiritually enriching service to their fellow man. The few men of history (besides Jesus) who Barton characterizes as \\"great\\", are not CEOs and Wall Street bankers, but world leaders, scientists, etc (Asoka, Abraham Lincoln, Francis Bacon) who gave us a higher vision.McAllister also concedes an all-too-common, perverted, Marxian understanding of Jesus' message. Jesus' admonition that the rich \\"give their money away\\" to find the kingdom of Heaven, was not an attack on money itself as something inherently evil, but an allegorical attack on the love of money eclipsing the love of God. Indeed, like Barton, Jesus valued monetary gain if acquired with an open, self-reliant, service-oriented heart. This message is obvious in Jesus' parable of the talents, in which 3 servants are given talents/money by their master (i.e. God) to manage in his absense. The servant who multiplied his talents the most through creative, industrious effort is rewarded/praised the most by the master. And the servant who added no profit to his talents is castigated as lazy and wicked. Thus rings Christ's truism, \\"To those who have shall more be given, but to those who have not, even what they have will be taken away.\\" To not understand this message and instead call Jesus a \\"freeloader\\", a man of lowly self-worth who leeches off society's fruits, betrays pure ignorance.Again, Barton's main reason for writing the book was to help ordinary people apply Jesus' principles in their daily lives, beyond ivory tower theology. In truth, we are all \\"salesmen\\" to some extent. We have to be to survive, grow, and prosper. Belief in the childish, utopian, and arrogant notion that we do not have to \\"put ourselves out there\\", do not have to extend ourselves in the least, do not have to try to persuade others that our philosophy, or service, or product, or even matrimonial proposal will be serve them best in the long run, is the first step on a descending path toward the stagnation of the human soul. In political terms, such belief is manifested in centralized systems of control (Communism, Fascism, Feudalism) in which a tiny elite, brandishing great power and wealth, makes decisions for billions of cogs in the wheel, who literally have no commerical or political power to be self-reliant and improve their economic condition.Perhaps McAllister would like to return to the days of the Feudal lord in which inherited stations in life determined a man's destiny from birth? Free markets, and free markets alone, lifted 90% of the masses out of that hell (even in the last 20 years, free markets, not Communism, have pulled 600 billion Chinese out of poverty). Then, when \\"the poor\\" were no longer the brunt of humanity, were no longer indistinguishably \\"equal\\" to each other in their misery, cultural Marxists began complaining about the newfound economic contrast between the poor and everyone else. Of course, they blamed this contrast on the very system that brought the other 80% out of that horrid poverty.Indeed, McAllister offers no new solution to our imperfect, yet \\"better than the alternatives', Western democracy. His analysis is that of a quibbler - an incessant complainer with no higher goal. Bruce Barton's is that of a quester - a man who is truly seeking - offering a viable method for improving people's lives amidst the realities of our human world. I guarantee if you read this book with an open heart and seeking mind, it will enrich your life for years to come.I leave McAllister with one of my favorite quotes from the movie, Chariots of Fire. Two stuffy, old, \\"ivory tower\\" Cambridge University headmasters are castigating Harold Abrahams, an ambitious collegiate runner with Olympic dreams, for subtly breaking the lofty code of the amateur athlete in hiring a professional coach to try to unlock every bit of athletic potential in himself. They maintain he has lost sight of the pure ideals of the amateur and lowered himself with this foray into \\"business\\". Abrahams replies, \\"Gentlemen... you yearn for victory just as I do, yet achieved with the apparent effortlessness of gods. Yours are the archaic values of the prep school playground. You deceive no one but yourselves. I believe in the pursuit of excellence. And I'll carry the future with me. \\""},{"Title":"The Man Nobody Knows","review":"I wanted to read what a book written in 1925 on Christ would have to say. I was surprised that this was such an inspiring book. It took a perspective that I'd simply not thought of before.

Description was precise, delivery unusually speedy, and I felt I was given a personal recommendation from the Seller. Thanks."},{"Title":"The Man Nobody Knows","review":"The notion that Jesus' values were those of corporate America and his \\"charisma\\" of the sort that makes insurance salemen is so laughably a fantasy that I hope the other reviews are meant as jokes. Portraying Jesus as a \\"booster,\\" a kind of successful Willy Loman, is about as ludicrous as picturing Mother Teresa as a fashion model and Gandhi as a comic book superhero. The Jesus of the New Testament would have observed the conspicuous consumption of corporate America, the cultural gluttony of the Western World, with sadness and disgust.Jesus may be the ultimate Rorschach. We look at him: Nazis see a blue-eyed Aryan beset by Jews and look for somebody to beat up; gays see their lifestyle affirmed in the friendhip with John; chickenhawk warriors somehow see endorsement of the hateful causes they want others to die for; the tenderhearted and compassionate see him surrounded by happy children; feminists see the women by his side; lying hypocrites see... God knows what.The hardest thing for humans to do is to comprehend that their heroes are not just big versions of themselves. A hero should be something to push against, not a self-endorsement. Jesus told the rich to give away their money. He told his followers not to gather up treasures in the world. He said wealth is a burden that will keep the rich out of Heaven. He scourged the moneylenders. He was a freeloader. He is bad for business.Today, as the most affluent country on the planet, we hear the Christian message as unhappily as the young wealthy Hebrew who asked Jesus what he must do to be saved. His answer was NOT \\"get an MBA.\\" But instead of walking away, we invent new myths of a Jesus more suitable, one able to see past his silly prejudice against money grubbers, to see that it is possible to be rich and really nice.Barton's book is a bizarre anachronism; a last survivor of the Babbitt years of pious Philistinism and Pharisaic self-approval just before the Depression turned our complacent cultural narcissism upside down. How sad, that it's coming back into fashion. Read Jim Wallis' *God's Politics* for a theology less absorbed with self-justification."},{"Title":"The Man Nobody Knows","review":"I pulled it out of my cataloging stack because it sounded so intriguing. \\"What a good idea, \\" I thought. \\"The Gospels are so familiar, to read them as a 'modern life' will be very refreshing.\\"And sometimes the author approached the potential -- a few paragraphs here and there really did cast light on Jesus as an actual human being.However, Mr. Barton evidently decided to ignore His divinity. That's just as unbalanced as the too reverential tomes which ignore His humanity. Barton mentions healing, feeding the 5,000 etc., but never acknowledges that He is actually working miracles.Further, he implies that it was the strength of Jesus' message which caused it to last for 2,000 years, rather than its being the actual, living Word of God, straight from His Son. Barton seems to think it's like something from Karl Marx or Charles Darwin, or even Aristotle and Plato.And finally, he ends with the crucifixion, ignoring the Resurrection altogether. Jesus was not just a magnetic preacher or an inspirational teacher. Either He was God in the flesh, or, as C, S. Lewis so aptly points out, He was a lunatic who claimed to be God.If He was God, his humanity and His divinity should be equally acknowledged and enjoyed.

Bruce Barton dares to conjecture a living, vibrant man who inspired others by his mere presence. This does not negate the idea of a divine Jesus. Barton attempts to paint a picture of what Jesus as a man might have been like. Why do modern men and women fear the concept of a living, human Jesus? Probably because he is still alive. They look out the window and see Jesus coming and they know that he will not simply rearrange the furniture, he will rip out the interior and create something new and extraordinary. I first read this book as a child of ten, and kept it all my life. It was such a refreshing and brilliant vision of the human Jesus ... someone I could admire and want to be around. From this seed I would one day develop a passionate spiritual relationship with Jesus. But I will never forget the humble beginning of first learning to love the human Jesus, who struggled and suffered even as his children do.

Her descriptive writing was so beautiful I just had to read on.

The disturbance echoed against cold stone and hard wood; it multiplied into a dozen voices that tumbled down the aisles or rolled up the tower steps, dying as they nudged a bell into song. A deep tone, soft as an angel's voice, sighed from the tower and cajoled sympathetic ripples from neighboring bells. In the ringing chamber below, their ropes swayed as if pulled by invisible hands, the sallies dancing ghost-like in the dark.\\" (Now isn't that grand?)The story is set in what seemed like an ancient English village. A dead body is found in St. Nicholas Church--on December 6, St. Nicholas Day.These villagers really get into this St. Nicolas Day thing, baking bread for the poor and the elderly, wrapping gifts to give with the bread. This December 6, however the bread and gift distribution and church celebration were cancelled by the police.My favorite line in the book is by the church's secretary, talking to Sgt. (Miss) Taylor, about the bad winter road conditions: \\"I always say, for all the fancy gadgets the police has these days, a car's a car. And you still can't drive on ice.\\"One murder, one fire, and then more deaths and fires in this small town where there has been a lot of \\"inter-breeding\\" of lives, loves, fortunes and secrets.

Unfortunately, while the message is great, the book is poorly written. In essence, it is a poorly organized sermon where the pastor has no time limit. The book teaches very little, presents very few insights, and glosses over most of the important issues that support the message. The obligatory three point outline for the sermon doesn't show up until the last three or four chapters. Instead, the book tries to feel the reader into understanding or agreeing with the message.The book also gets caught up in the cheating idea rather than focusing on the message. The author redefines cheating instead of using English words with meanings we understand already, but for no good reason. As a result, the redefined cheating is not cheating at all, but the author still fashioned the book around this concept to the detriment of clear communication of the message. It is as though the marketing took over the book.In short, the book is an example of poor communication with a catchy title."},{"Title":"Choosing to Cheat: Who Wins When Family and Work Collide?","review":"Although the main point of this small book has value and, needs to be addressed by all people (Christian or not), this particular treatment is fairly useless.We are all indeed overburdened by our work and family life, and will lean more heavily to one extreme in attempting the impossible task of \\"getting everything done that needs to get done.\\"That being said, and an obvious point, this book's style is so diluted and simple that it could be played as background chatter in a dentist office. There is no theology here, no strong Biblical support. Rather, you will find here cute anecdotes, colorless stories and dinner table pabulum at a low budget counseling seminar. These are not deep Biblical truths, but cheap examples of popular pseudo-psychology.If you search for theological and biblically rooted evidence, this is not the book for you.

Tragically, it's easier to cheat our families than than to cheat at work. Andy not only tells us why we should cheat at work; he also tells us how. Ironically, cheating at work can make us more productive.I needed to read this message again, because it's always easy to return to old habits. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Choosing to Cheat: Who Wins When Family and Work Collide?","review":"Andy Stanley has chosen a rather provocative title for this book in which he challenges folks to choose to cheat their employers rather than their families when it comes to priorities and time. I'm hard-pressed to disagree with this general principle, and I think that he offers a compelling case against the workaholism that has plagued generations of American families. And as one can always expect from Stanley, his writing is engaging and easy to read, so this one can be tackled in one or two sittings.My apprehension about this book stems from its misapplication that I've already observed in some of my peers. As a 29-year-old, I'll be quite frank in declaring that the potential plague of my generation is not workaholism but sloth. I see a generation of my peers who were raised in a world of entertainment and pleasure, who get into the working world and try to find ways to be uncommitted, lazy, irresponsible employees so they can spend their time and money buying and playing with their toys. Within that context, I've seen young singles use the \\"Choosing to Cheat\\" concept to avoid hard work, cheat their employers, and invest their energies in self-gratification. This obviously misses Stanley's whole point, but I've seen it happen.My critique is not so much about the book, then, but about the intended audience. For the 40+ generation who maybe struggles more with the dangers of workaholism, I think this book could be perfect. It's certainly a challenging and interesting book to read. But I won't be sending this to my twenty-something friends, who instead need a book that challenges us to work hard in whatever we do as a means to glorify God."},{"Title":"Choosing to Cheat: Who Wins When Family and Work Collide?","review":"Andy Stanley writes, \\"Following the principles of God results in the blessings of God.\\" The author's dad, Charles Stanley, says, \\"God doesn't reveal His will for our consideration.

Andy Stanley says that \\"your Creator does not define your life by your career achievements or the neatness of your pantry.\\" Writing to both stay-at-home parents and spouses in the workplace, Stanley says you must cheat on your work if you're going to win at home. (Read the book for his definition on \\"cheating.\\") He once admonished a struggling fast track executive, \\"the problem is, you love your family in your heart, but you don't love them in your schedule. And they can't see your heart.\\"When you read this book, you'll never, ever think of Daniel without recalling Stanley's commentary. \\"Daniel's choice of diet was an indication of where he placed his loyalty. For us, the chief indicator is time. Daniel's loyalty was tested by what he ate. Ours is tested by what we put on our calendars. Where you spend your time is an indication of where your loyalties lie. In effect, you pledge your allegiance to the person or thing that receives your time.\\"There are lots of books on balancing work and family. This one is different. It's not a guilt trip. Instead, it's a simple, thoughtful, Christ-centered process to help couples dig deep and ask themselves two or three really tough questions.Stanley adds, \\"No where in Scripture are you commanded to lay down your life for your stock options. Or to love your career like Christ loved the church. We are instructed to do our jobs and love our families (see Colossians 3:23). When you love your job and do your family, you've not only stepped outside the bounds of family life, you have stepped outside the will of God.\\""},{"Title":"Choosing to Cheat: Who Wins When Family and Work Collide?","review":"Andy Stanley is the senior pastor at North Point Community Church in suburban Atlanta. From his years of shepherding God's people in Atlanta and from his own life, he realizes that workaholism is a serious and growing problem among many American men (and not a few women as well). The effects of workaholism that Stanley primarily concerns himself with is its effect on the family. Loneliness, tears, strained relationships, the rebellion of children, arguments, and divorce are just some of the negative impacts excessive working can have on a family. In \\"Choosing to Cheat,\\" Stanley shows the reader the dangers of keeping constantly excessive work hours, then provides encouragement and advice for changing this habit.In the first part of this book, Stanley's focus is on diagnosing the problem. His main arguments are that a) every person is limited to 24 hours in a day and must daily choose how to invest that time b) many men, out of a sense of obligation and attracted by the admiration of co-workers, choose to invest an excessive amount of their time working, c) all those vying for a person's attention directly correlate the amount of time spent with them to the amount he cares about them (e.g. if I spend a lot of time with my dog, it shows that my dog is very important to me; if I spend just a little time with my child, it shows my child is comparatively unimportant), d) because a man's family deeply desires his acceptance, they are willing to put up with great stress so that he can pursue work, and e) there will come a point in time when the individual members of the family can no longer take the stress of an absent father and will simply give up on him; while this shift occurs suddenly, it is preceded by many warning signs. The tone of this section is emotional as Stanley attempts to shock the reader into WANTING to change.The second part of this book provides advice and encouragement for cutting down on the hours at work and spending more time with the family. Using the Biblical account of Daniel as a model, Stanley advises the reader to 1) figure out what concrete things are non-negotiable and devise a new work schedule to honor those non-negotiable points, 2) calmly ask your employer if your job could accommodate these points, 3) prepare yourself to endure potential consequences of this request, 4) be prepared for God to be active in the midst of this change.The book contains an appendix of discussion questions based on each chapter.Stanley certainly provides sound secular advice. He correctly analyzes and presents a societal/cultural problem. He is further correct in his urging men and women to allow their primary (yet not sole) loyalty be to their family. He states truth when he points out that there exist thousands of people who can do your job better than you, but there is nobody who can take your place in your family. Stanley understands the positive benefits the family will enjoy if the family members are each dedicated to one another, and he gives sound advice for approaching your employer about changing your schedule. If he would have stuck with these points, his book would have been much better.But Stanley goes too far. A major premise of Stanley's book is that God promises to bless a person who re-prioritizes his life in such a way that family takes precedence over work. Nowhere does God make such a promise. Although Stanley relies heavily upon the account of Daniel, but the Bible's account of Daniel is DESCRIPTIVE, not PRESCRIPTIVE. In truth, Stanley buys into the popular (on television at least) \\"health, wealth, and prosperity gospel.\\" That is to say, Stanley argues that if a person aligns his life to conform with God's will, he will enjoy earthly blessings. To be more specific to this book, Stanley argues that if you give up wealth and career advancement for the sake of your family, God will bless you with MORE wealth and a BETTER career than that which was given up. There is no Biblical support for this--in Scripture or in \\"Choosing to Cheat.\\" Aside from that, even assuming that his (false) premise is true, why would he want to focus on the \\"fringe benefits\\" of Christian living as opposed to the ultimate reward for faith? The true reward God gives us for the gift of faith, is forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation; a promotion at work pales in comparison.In short, Stanley presents good a good paradigm for aligning values (e.g. family above career) and assists the reader in lining up his life with those values. This book is especially helpful for those caught in workaholism and is primarily geared toward men. However, the underlying premise, that God will materially bless you for realigning your priorities is not necessarily true; He may or He may not. Neither recommended nor not recommended."},{"Title":"Choosing to Cheat: Who Wins When Family and Work Collide?","review":"Choosing To Cheat is a must read for anyone in ministry from the church board to the lead pastor!

I picked it up and read it in two days, in about three short sittings. The size belies its value, though. Stanley makes the case that we all -- men, women, parents, career managers and stay-at-home moms -- cheat something. We cheat our family by choosing to work long hours instead of spending time with them. We cheat our churches by bailing because of a big weekend project. We even, in rare cases, cheat our jobs to spend more time at home with our family... usually in a time of crisis.Stanley's premise is that since we'll always cheat something -- there aren't enough hours in the day to do everything -- we should CHOOSE to cheat our work. By cheating, he means prioritize our families, in very specific and tangible ways. He spends a lot of time talking about how you then have to work harder, more efficiently, and even effectively at work.

It made perfect sense that one of the early purchases for my Kindle would be one of his writings. \\"Choosing to Cheat\\" offers a practical argument aimed at those who have workaholic tendencies. Andy addresses the tension felt between the drive for success in the workplace and the significance of healthy relationships at home and finding the balance point. \\"Work is about doing. Family is about being.\\" We are created for both.The underlying message is about priorities and addressing the gap between that can exist between what we say (family first) and what we do (time doing work). The title of his book comes from the premise that something has to give, and what gives is cheated. For workaholics, it is the family that is cheated. Family measures \\"love\\" by time. Too much time at work results in a family that feels unloved.Not content to point to the problem, Andy uses the biblical example of Daniel to provide a practical plan to regain the healthy balance between doing and being without getting yourself fired.I would highly recommend this short book that be read in just a few sittings, the time spent can result in huge benefits."},{"Title":"Choosing to Cheat: Who Wins When Family and Work Collide?","review":"Andy Stanley did a great job in writting this book.

It examines the poet's relationship with Naomi Ginsberg and her illness, as well as his own childhood and adolescence.From the russian girl coming to America in the early 1920's, the socialist mom, to the mentally ill patient in her old age, Ginsberg reviews the life of a remarkable woman and the ways in which their relationship affected his life and work. And affected it did. Kaddish is also a therapeutic work for the poet, almost psychoanalitical at times, a courageous and loving exploration of the profound influence parents can have on a writer's life."},{"Title":"Kaddish and Other Poems 1958-1960","review":"Appearances to the contrary, \\"Kaddish\\" was not a poem that commemorated a life, but one that attempts to exorcise a ghost. The spirit was Ginsberg's mother, a tortured soul who haunted the poet. Kaddish is at its heart a repudiation of a smothering mother, a feckless father, useless brother and antiquated traditions. The poem was an exercise in a kind of separation through sadomasochism.It could be said that Ginsberg was both a product and victim of his time. A transitional figure when transgression was increasingly a means of establishing one's creative reputation. Throughout the work, Ginsberg's slaps at paper tigers, violates wilting standards of taste, and dispenses with fading taboos with ease of washing one's hands. Reading this book today, in our time of profitable exhibitionism and confession without contrition, seems entirely beside the point; it is often quaint, an artifact from a time when blue jeans were a mark of defiance.Ginsberg attempts to speak at the volume of Whitman, but there are degrees of exuberance, and, in his case, he's merely annoying. He's like the man who arrives at a party already drunk and grows only more embarrassing. The words vomit and vomiting appear frequently, and one does not have to be a Freudian to suspect Ginsberg not only finds his memories revolting. Even free verse requires a certain discipline to demonstrate, if nothing else, a degree of sincerity.I read the book to its end and then read each poem again and felt cheated. Kaddish is a kind of Beat Kabuki, its chaos, its incoherence, is part of its form, if not, ironically, its gravitational center. I grew bored with the poems' hipster attitude, namedropping, and Zen and Hindu references. All of it gathered and flung as if Ginsberg knew that no one was paying attention.Yes, Kaddish is occasionally touching, but in Ginsberg hands even intimacy becomes a form of insinuation, which is to say, he manipulates his readers, so that it is his suffering and eventual \\"satori\\" that is the poem's subject, and the book, the map of his \\"hero's journey.\\"It's hard to criticize a work that asks to be read as a poem of mourning and that aspires to the level of prayer. But the more I read, the more I felt the entire work was a kind of hustle, and Ginsberg, a grifter playing on our emotions and deference of the sacred.In the poem \\"Mescaline,\\" the poet asks, \\"...who wants to be famous and sign autographs like a movie/ star.\\" The answer is, of course, Ginsberg, who went on to construct a life with the deliberate intensity of a movie or rock star, and who would be famous and sign autographs like a movie star.Over all, the poems share: facile politics, spiritual references without depth, confessions that don't feel heartfelt and pseudo-poetic speech, all combined with an adolescent's pleasure in vulgarity and profanity.While I thought both the collection and the poem, \\"Howl\\" overwrought and self-regarding, the book had at least two poems, \\"A Supermarket in California\\" and \\"In the Baggage Room at Greyhound\\" I would read again. I found nothing in Kaddish I would revisit. \\"At Apollinaire's Grave\\" seemed both dishonest and strangely prescient. (It immediately brought to my mind the filmed, photographed and choreographed photographs of Ginsberg and Dylan at Jack Kerouac's grave site.) There is more than a little borrowed interest buried in Ginsberg's work.The one piece that left me troubled and engaged was the short poem \\"The Lion for Real.\\" It seemed to succeed in showing real feeling expressed in lovely language. But even when Ginsberg appears at his most sincere he seems to me rather predicable:\\"The sadness is, that every leaf, /has fallen before.Charming, yes, but when compared with David Ignatow's \\"I wish I understood the beauty/in leaves falling. To whom/ are we beautiful/ as we go,\\" one sees Ginsberg's sentiments belong more to Hallmark than to posterity.In an introduction to the poems, Ginsberg wrote: \\"Acknowledged the established literary quarterlies of my days are bankrupt poetically thru their own hatred, dull ambition or loudmouthed obtuseness.\\" He then lists the many magazines where his poems first appeared, which suggests the \\"[poet] doth protest too much, methinks.\\"In terms of the man's ambition, it seems every bit as fierce and contemporary as that of his generation of Jewish lawyers, politicians and financiers, who broke through the barriers that kept them out of business and academic establishments. At a time when the establishment itself was shuddering, Ginsberg would push himself inside. That said, I think he was as surprised by his success as other committed careerists including Bob Dylan and Andy Warhol.With Kaddish Ginsberg became more than a one-hit wonder; he would avoid obscurity, or worse, passing notoriety. He would be celebrated and become a celebrity. Become, in theory, everything he professed to disdain.Especially telling is a \\"Note,\\" printed above his acknowledgement. In it he informs us: \\"Magic Psalm, The Reply, & The End record visions experienced after drinking Ayahuasca, an Amazon spiritual potion. The message is: Widen the area of consciousness.\\" For my part, I could not distinguish these poems from any in the collection. Ginsberg's tragedy was that he grew up not only to be a good son, but also a member of the establishment whose work would be part of the new canon."},{"Title":"Kaddish and Other Poems 1958-1960","review":"If ever there was a trip through hell as mental illness, this is it. Ginsberg relates the story of his mother, a schizophrenic, and how her struggle shaped his life more decisively than anything else. Written as a lament, it vividly evokes her weird symbolic behaviors, her noises and smells, her struggle with demons. He wonders if she wanted to have sex with him, what it means, how the experience stamped him. This was more horrible, I am sure, than even a gifted poet like him could describe. He even states that, when he tries to make love with a woman, he sees her in his mind. Pretty strong stuff.Recommended. This is the deepest Ginsberg and the best of the beat writing, in my opinion. But is only the horror, in my reading."},{"Title":"Kaddish and Other Poems 1958-1960","review":"I carry this collection with me literally everywhere and read at least a poem or two from it every day.

As on answer on could says that his job is to linger the pain of suffering. The poet becomes a man who brings water to the one who suffers, brings understandment, and widens the picture of reality. This is on of the importent things Kaddish is about. Allen Ginsberg wrote this poem to his mother who became insane during his childhood. During her periods of sanity she brought and taught him importent values, things to live for, political point of vievs and understandmens, which gave him perspectives for the rest of his life. The poem is also a great political statement against the existensial order, normality conserned. It shows us the political implications of Naomis madnes. The poem makes clear that her madnes has a connection with the order of modernity in capitalist America. At the same time whe are shown the human experience of lolines that comes out from being left off with the label mad. The sad and unbearebel feelings of guilt and anger felt by Ginsberg himself. An over it all something more, something beautiful about the human relation of love between mother and child which is flaming strong trough all this horrible prospects of shame and suffering. At the end of the poem and in the begining, Ginsberg is dweling with the question of the death of his mother. For him it was in on sense a relief, but at the same time is was his greatest loss, and the ambivalence of this question goes trough the hole poem."},{"Title":"Masters of Jazz Guitar: The Story of the Players and Their Music Softcover with CD","review":"This is quite an excellent book and is surprisingly done in soft cover now.

Although \\"The Folded Leaf\\" is not his most acclaimed or famous novel, it probably has the most devoted (indeed, nearly cult-like) following. Its charm is its utter simplicity; a coming-of-age story, it is also a passionate tale about love--between two men. Yet this is no classic of \\"gay fiction\\" (although it will certainly appeal to gay readers); instead, \\"The Folded Leaf\\" tells about the intensely intimate, innocuously physical, yet almost entirely platonic relationship between two boys who don't quite fit in with the crowd and who grow up to be very different men. Published in 1945, this is the type of novel only the bravest of straight male authors would be comfortable writing today--and, in a way, that's too bad.Lymie Peters is the ectomorphic and studious introvert who meets Spud Latham, a dim yet muscular teenager who serves \\"as a kind of reminder of those ideal, almost abstract rules of proportion from which the human being, however faulty, is copied.\\" Latham is new in town--his father has lost his job, and he lives with his family in a cramped apartment--and he inexplicably gravitates towards Lymie. At first Lymie's own feelings about Spud's attentions are ambivalent: \\"He couldn't help noticing the scales of fortune were tipped considerably in Spud's favor, and resenting it.\\" What the boys have in common, though, is an undercurrent of barely suppressed fury that the people they know and the world around them aren't the stuff of their daydreams.Maxwell is compelling in his ability to transform what should be two excessive stereotypes into recognizable and believable flesh and blood. Even though Lymie almost sycophantically fawns over Spud (even serving as his towel boy at the gym), Spud in return offers emotional protection, social acceptance, and true friendship; in spite of Spud's increasing popularity, it is a relationship of equals, and the pair is inseparable. Maxwell has re-created the ideal friendship, which many of us once had, if only briefly in our youth--or in our imaginations. Ultimately, however, as with any relationship this close, the snare of jealousy and the fear of being alone gradually introduce crises that build to a startling crescendo.Although there is enough going on to move the story along, Maxwell's concern is psychological portrayal--and several of the pivotal scenes (even how the two boys meet) are completely left to the reader's imagination. But what makes this book memorable is Maxwell's lyrical and understated prose. This is a novel that invites hyperbole: the descriptions are disarmingly beautiful and the revelatory passages are quietly powerful. Lymie and Spud are so lifelike and, at the same time, so idealized that, when you've regretfully reached the last page, you'll be hungry to know even more about these two friends."},{"Title":"The Folded Leaf","review":"This book is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read.Such is the quality of writting that some part of it will have resonance for evryone. The story is engaging and rewarding to read, the writing is intelligent and elegant.Maxwell can capture the subtleties of both verbal and non verbal communication and convey them with startling accuracy. His ability to identify the fragile and unredeemed features of human existence is both powerfull and moveing.Every boy &amp; man should read this book, it will leave them richer than it found them."},{"Title":"The Folded Leaf","review":"This is the best William Maxwell novel I've read and one of the best novels I've ever read. I found the writing in this book to have the quality of a daydream and for the situations to ring true to life. The novel unfolds as life does and the details fall right into place. The characters themselves often engage in daydreams, which helps give it that life-like quality. Anyway, with most novels you get a sense of a strong authorial voice behind the words, as if someone is telling you the story. With Bellow or Cheever or Nabokov, for example, Maxwell's contemporaries, all of whom I like, you get a strong sense that their voice is theirs alone. With Maxwell, the authorial voice is much more gentle, almost as if the author were vanishing and his words were rising up off the page like vapor. It's interesting that Maxwell's voice seems somewhat different, novel to novel. There are some stunning passages in So Long, See You Tomorrow, but this is my favorite of the Maxwell I've read. It captures time and place so well. The midwest in the 1920's. It's very endearing - Sally says things like, \\"in a pig's ear\\" - yet still mysterious and, finally, heartbreaking. I've read it three times in the past nine months and it is a book I'm sure I'll return to again."},{"Title":"The Folded Leaf","review":"William Maxwell writes in the small spaces. He explores the little sad areas of our lives that are comprised of looks that are not returned, thoughts that remain unuttered because we simply cannot figure out how to say them, and embraces we wish we have shared but did not because we lack the courage to put our arms around the person we love. The Folded Leaf is a beautiful, melancholy story by an author whose understated value has sadly caused a lack of popular appreciation compared to his flashier contemporaries - Hemingway, Nabokov, Bellow, Updike, Roth.The Folded Leaf is the story of Lymie and Spud, two young boys who share a strong friendship, even though they seem utterly different. The novel is told primarily from the perspective of Lymie, a shy, withdrawn, introverted and very sensitive young man who loves Spud with all of his heart. Spud, on the other hand, is something of a strong man, an athlete who does not understand, but is able to appreciate, the sensitivity of his friend. They compliment one another, with Lymie taking security from Spud's strength while Spud draws another kind of strength from his friend.The two boys love one another, with Lymie's love much the stronger, but the love remains platonic. It is the casual, affectionate, innocently physical love of young boys who become college men understanding that there is nobody else in the world more compatible with them than the other. A girl, of course, shatters this, but even though Spud may lose that first blush of pre-sexual affection, Lymie does not. The novel moves very slowly from the boys' strong relationship to a rather one-sided, heartbreaking examination of what happens when one friend moves on and the other cannot.Is the story a homosexual one? It is hard to say. Spud and Lymie are physically affectionate, going so far as to spend almost their entire college life sleeping in the same bed. Note: Sleeping. While there is a lot left unsaid about Lymie's true feelings - he wonders, every now and again, when he shall meet a woman of his own to marry, but the wondering is academic rather than passionate - my reading of the novel is that Maxwell was happy to have Lymie's feelings remain ambiguous. Lymie is very much in love, and it is to the author's credit that the love does not have to be defined as sexual or emotional - it is simply what we see on the page. Lymie loves Spud and Spud loves Lymie: in different ways, it is true, but what they both feel is what we would call love. Maxwell is shrewd in avoiding the question of romantic or platonic love - what we have is love, just love, and it is shown to be enough. I highly doubt Lymie would have considered his feelings for Spud as anything wrong, and Spud - athletic, not very intelligent, given to boisterousness - certainly has no problem with his diminutive friend.Maxwell shines the brightest when he is delving into Lymie's thoughts. We understand most of the novels scenes, from their school days to when they bunk together at university to when Spud becomes a (rather ignoble) boxer to Spud's engagement with Sally, from Lymie's perspective, allowing us to see the friendship in a way that Spud, and an outsider, never would. Consider this long quote: 'Lymie didn't know what the trouble was, but he was not dismayed. He had worn Spud down once before and he was sure he could do it again. Every day between four-fifteen and four-thirty he appeared at the gymnasium and stood a few feet away from the punching bag where Spud, if he wanted his gloves tied on or any small service like that, wouldn't have to go far to find him. When Spud came up from the showers, Lymie was there waiting by the locker, like a faithful hound. He made no move to open the lock, or to touch anything inside the locker that belonged to Spud. Occasionally while Spud was dressing and afterward on the way home, Lymie would say something to him, but Lymie was always careful not to put the remark in the form of a question, so there was no actual need for Spud to reply.' This is unrequited love at its most honest. Sadly for Lymie, Spud of course does not appreciate the layers of meaning and feeling behind Lymie's behaviour, and of course there is conflict that ends in tears. The novel ends the only way it should, but there is hope for the friendship and hope for Lymie, forced by circumstance to face the reality that even though his boyhood love may never have lost its intensity of feeling, Spud's certainly has."},{"Title":"The Folded Leaf","review":"Personally, this book broke my heart. This is a story of an intense friendship, a kind of friendship that can only be had by the young, and the inevitable truth of life--that love eats friendship. The book ends on a somewhat upbeat note, but Maxwell's illustration of what you have to leave behind in childhood is so, so sad. Also interesting is the physical relationship that Spud and Lymie have with each other. It is completely innocent, but I know that it would never fly in today's homo-paranoia society."},{"Title":"The Folded Leaf","review":"That was all I could think as I read the final page and closed this book, The Folded Leaf. And there was this sense of wonder too, that William Maxwell lives on in this small masterpiece, first published over 60 years ago. I have made it a habit in recent years to try to contact authors whose works I read and admire. Maxwell died in 2000 though, so I felt instead this awful sudden sadness at the passing of a man I never met. But he left behind this book, this message from the past, which imparts such a detailed picture of what it was like to be young and alive - and in love - back in the 1920s. Because this is much more than just a story of an intense and important friendship between two boys, and then, young men. There are definite and obvious homoerotic undertones in the relationship between Lymie and Spud, but this repressed impulse is never acted upon. It remains unsullied, and Lymie's feelings - his love - for Spud are as pure and unselfish as you will ever find in literature. Their relationship is perhaps best expressed - culminated - in a scene that takes place in a hospital room after a crisis has been narrowly averted -\\"Neither he nor Lymie spoke. They looked at each other with complete knowledge at last, with full awareness of what they meant to each other and of all that had passed between them. After a moment Spud leaned forward slowly and kissed Lymie on the mouth. He had never done this before and he was never moved to do it again.\\"This is not, however, a book about homosexuality.

It rings very true and took me back to my own childhood, which, although quite different, had nevertheless many parallels with this heartwarming story."},{"Title":"The Folded Leaf","review":"In addition to the high praise offered by others here, all wonderfully true, I must say that this book contains some of the most sensitive descriptions of mental life I've ever read. Dreams, daydreams, musings, and intuitions trusted or dismissed are all present, not to inform the audience or resolve a problem or carry the plot, but to complete the portrait of a whole person. Reading most literature, one could be forgiven for forgetting that many of our most important insights into our relationships occur as random subconscious flashes, not as sums to a long and cold conscious calculation; when it comes to writing about how people think, logical is not the same as believable.This book will provide me with Birthday presentsfor all of my friends for the next twelve months.

When he becomes friends with tough new boy Spud, a kid who fits in with the rest, the relationship becomes intense - on Lymie's side at least - but unspoken issues arise between the two at college.This part was so beautifully written; a lesser author might have broken up the friendship with an argument, but Lymie continues to hang around Spud who allows him to, while barely acknowledging him, in a heartbreaking episode.Maxwell describes Lymie's shyness and 'otherness' so well:'The boys in the fraternity were all friendly toward Lymie and accepted him but as an outsider, a foreigner with all the proper credentials. Their attitude was a good enough indication of what he could expect, socially, the rest of his life.

Some of the story doesn't seem to add up- for example, I never was convinced that Spud was a compelling character but hey, maybe he just wasn't my type. And the ending is tainted with the histrionics that seems to characterize so much early gay fiction (and so much of it written now). But in the end, this may not really be a gay book, so much as a book about one boy who loves another, and how they both dealt with it.Final analysis, the book is warm and generous and kind, beautifully written and quite bold. I can recommend it without hesitation to a general audience, and some should read it as a classic text (and you know who you are)."},{"Title":"The Folded Leaf","review":"I agree that Maxwell wrote quite well, with very descriptive language, detail, and believable dialog. However, I found the story itself to be only mildly interesting. The relationship between the two main characters was unusual, of course, and complex in some ways, while lacking in breadth in many other ways. For example, there is neither significant action nor sophisticated philosophical discussion.Some of the scenes are strong, especially when the adults participate more. I wish the girls had more character development, as Maxwell created some interesting individuals, but left them to relatively secondary roles where a longer book could have expanded their characters and interaction."},{"Title":"How to Design and Report Experiments","review":"This book is an excellent tool for researchers and anyone wishing to conduct statistically sound experiments.

Avoiding out-of-state sales tax is a bonus which is usually offset by reasonable shipping costs. However, there had been an alarming trend, especially in the wake of rising gas costs, to fatten the shipping rates into an often prohibitive charge. One of the things this online shopping manual provides is a guide to shipping coasts and other customer-friendly aspects of various sites. Revised and updated yearly, The Purple Book provides web sites for a variety of needs, assembled according to category, using universal symbols and section icons to show what specific products are offered on each site.The concept is brilliant, as is the color, but I wanted more information on why these particular sites are included, other than that they meet certain criteria, price, selection, security, customer service contact, etc. I was curious whether these sites paid to be included or are actually the result of random sampling, from \\"search engines, message boards and recommendations\\". That issue aside, I chose random URL's from the book, using the author's review to assess the quality of the site. Of these selections, the reviews were accurate and specific, even a bit wry. The universal symbols aren't particularly helpful, some of them obvious, but most important, they do indicate reasonability of price point and shipping costs. A purple star connotes an endorsement by The Purple Book; since the reviews editorialize, I would like to see the text go one step further, with a one to five star rating.Browsing the categories and frequently familiar web sites, I decided to search for printer ink cartridges, using The Purple Book as my resource, without much success. With a search this specific, I was forced back into Googleland to get the results I needed.

But nothwithstanding all this, it was a quick paced easily readable way to become re-acquainted with this too often ignored clash over executive power. And it provides much fodder for discussion of how W is using executive power in our time....."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"No legal historian can crunch through cases as carefully and insightfully as Professor James F. Simon. He was the first court scholar to grasp that the Rehnquist conservative counter revolution had reached its culmination by the mid 1990s, in \\"The Center Holds,\\" and he is the first court scholar to give Roger Taney his due for superior lawyering in a long and distinguished career, in the pages of his new and informative book, \\"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney.\\"Simon's story reads like a well crafted novel, as it weaves back to the early careers of Lincoln and Taney, showing how their upbringings in Illinois and Maryland set the stage for their pivotal roles in the history of American slavery. Then the story moves fast forward to Taney's terrible decision in \\"Dred Scott\\" and the motivation that case played in the political career of Abraham Lincoln.Simon,a former Supreme Court reporter for Time Magazine, writes about Taney's legal career and Lincoln's legal career with an unequalled insight into the thinking of two brilliant lawyers and of the process that operates behind the closed doors of the nation's highest legal tribunal.The human element, however, is always acutely observed by Simon, and he takes the physical stamina of Lincoln, who endured numerous political setbacks, and Taney, who served actively on the court with numerous illnesses, into old age, into great account and into great detail.Once again, James F. Simon has carefully revealed the intracies of the law and the complexity of great lawyers in vivid detail and with painstaking accuracy.Hansen Alexander is an attorney and author most recently of the introductory law book, \\"A Tort is Not a Pastry.\\""},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"This is a very good survey of two of America's most important 19th Century figures. It is a quick read, but covers everything in a way that is readable and illuminating. I agree with other reviewers that those looking for deeper insights into Taney, in particular, might be disappointed. However, where he gives short shrift to both individuals, he makes up for it by bringing the times into fuller context. Moreover, his summary of the major court cases of the era is as good as any I've read."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"The follow comments are for the book \\"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney\\" - Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers by James F. Simon.My motivation for reading this book was to acquire information and satisfy my curiosity concerning Roger B. Taney (1777-1864) who was Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court during the period 1836-64. During the past several years I have read several Lincoln biographies and related books concerning the Civil War. Justice Taney is mentioned in all these books having played a notable role during the period he was in office but particularly during the War Between the States.I have no legal training and a laymen's knowledge of judicial terminology. My only exposure to \\"the law\\" was several months of jury duty. I approached this book with some trepidation since an eminent law professor is the author. In fact, James Simon is the dean emeritus of the New York Law School. I can report that inquiring readers with little legal knowledge can profit from reading this book since the author's intent is to enlighten a general audience not just legal professionals.I found the discussion of Taney's close relationship with Andrew Jackson and their joint efforts in opposition to the central bank fascinating. As U.S. Attorney General(1831-1833) and then Secretary of the Treasury(1833-1834), Taney became one of Andrew Jackson's closest advisers.His peers held Taney's judicial expertise in very high regard particularly his ability to make the most difficult legal problems seem clear. William Wirt, who would later serve as U.S. Attorney General said that he, Taney, was a man with a \\"Moonlight Mind\\", explaining that \\"like moonlight of the arctic he gave all the light of day without the glare\\".The core of this book are the issues revolving around Lincoln and the his efforts to preserve the Union. For that discussion alone this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"James F. Simon's Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney shines an interesting light on two overlooked aspects of 19th century American history.The first overlooked aspect is the Supreme Court, specifically the person of Roger Taney (pronounced Tawney), the Chief Justice most famous for what may be known for all time as his single worst legal opinion, and one of the most controversial and ill-considered opinions of all time - Dred Scott.Simon tells the story of Taney's life, including his surprisingly liberal views on slavery and his legal defense of blacks who were seized illegally to be sold into slavery, the fact that he freed most of his family's slaves and even provided a modest pension for the elderly ones. Taney even defended an the rights of an abolitionist preacher to preach his message in Maryland. However, it seems that those opinions all changed once slavery became THE issue of the 1840s and 1850s. His views seem to have hardened in response to outside pressure on the institution of slavery.I must admit that I was not well-informed about Taney - for me he was the man who is most famous for the line about African-Americans in which he says that they were \\"so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.\\" Of course, it turns out that Taney's political life was much more than just that one line that appears in all of the history books and I did learn a lot about Taney's life and the intricate politics of the era - more than a reader normally gets: Jackson, Calhoun, Webster, Clay and finally Lincoln. Taney bridges all of these figures, was seen as a moderating presence for most of that time and really gets the short-shrift historically due to the abusive excesses of the Dred Scott decision.Lincoln, on the other hand, is, seemingly, the subject of a new biography every week. What has not been written about Lincoln? In this case, there is nothing new, but the focus on his administration's interactions with the Taney Court is interesting and thought-provoking.This is a good, small dual biography of two of the towering political figures of their time.Not so much detail that the general history reader is bored, not so little that the serious reader of history is turned off."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"This book reflects on the cold war that existed between President Lincoln and Supreme Court Chief Justice Taney during the Civil War. However, the book also lean heavily on how Taney affected the career of Lincoln due to many of Taney's decisions as the Supreme Court Chief Justice. There is a parallel mini-biography on both men as they slugged through the pre-Civil War period and the issues of slavery and state's rights.The author appears to be pretty sympathatic toward Taney and in most part, Taney proves to be a level headed individual who could have gone down in our nation's history is one of the best in his position. However, Taney proves to be flawed because in certain issues, he acted not as a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court but as a Southerner and that is not the same thing. His Dred Scott decision all but undid his legacy and cost him the respect and awe that should have been duly accorded to him. Not only the Dredd Scott case but his views on state's rights where he often contradict himself where the state's rights to maintain or ban slavery. The book shows that Taney maintained the state's right to maintained slavery but contradict that if the state wanted to ban slavery. Due to these decisions he made before the war, Taney was basically ignored, overlooked and disregarded during the Civil War reflects on the fact that his biased, racist and crude mindedness from his slavery decisions cost him his powers and influence there after.The book also reflects that flawed and crude decisions by Taney in the Dred Scott case and others helped the rise of Abraham Lincoln who used that decision and all who supported it, as a mean to gained national notices that later paved his way to the White House. Once there, he simply ignored Taney as a political or legal factor although he remains outwardly politically correct toward him. Rarely have the Supreme Court been disregarded with such low regards thanks to Taney and his decisions by this nation. Lincoln was able to ignored Taney almost completely and did what he needed to do as a war time president. If Lincoln did abused his wartime power and it appears that he did, Taney simply lack the creditablity to do anything about it. It amazing how much Taney's decision on the Dredd Scott case totally influenced the total lack of powers and respect Taney had during the Civil War. Even Taney's views on secession was regarded as biased and without merit. I doubt if this would have been possible if Taney gave a more respectful decision on the Dred Scott case and the court was still held in high regards.Overall, a pretty interesting and insightful look at the relationship between the two men who influenced each other indirectly and directly."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"It is well known that Lincoln was against extending slavery in the territories, but not for wanting to preserve it in States where it already existed. What is little known are the reasons for Lincoln's opposition to the institution's extension. Simon details these reasons as 1. To prevent an increase in congressional power for the Democratic Party and 2. To prevent the perpetuation of the negroid race. Lincoln was a white separatist if not supremacist.Simon also documents very well the mass killing of civilians in violation of international law as part of his Total War sympathies, the tampering of elections, the assumption of congressional war powers, the gutting of the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 9th, and 10th Amendments, the packing of the Supreme Court, the declaration of martial law in the North, and the detention and deportation of political opposition in the North. All the abuses of civil liberties and violations of the Constitution for what Simon calls Lincoln's \\"conspiracy theory\\" -- a theory that holds Popular Sovereignty as a threat to the Union.To agree with Lincoln that Federalism threatened the overthrow of the Union implies that the Authors of the Declaration of Independence were rebels themselves. Lincoln's logic holds that King George was justified to commit the \\"long train of abuses and usurpations\\" cited by the Founding Fathers and that \\"government by the consent of the governed\\" was a threat of overthrow to England, was justly prohibited and collectively punished.Tyrants are always paranoid that WE THE PEOPLE are conspiring against them. This isn't to say that conspiracies do not exist, only that conspiracies consist of the few conspiring against the many, not vice versa. Such was the case of a deranged man who had a difficult time making heads or tales of anything -- that man was Lincoln. The Constitution, he argued, threatened the preservation of the Union in times of crisis and must be limited in its observance to times of peace.The Founders would disagree and state that the Constitution was specifically constructed for times of crisis and to prevent the abuses and usurpations tyrants justify during them. Lincoln set precedence for future presidents (Simon lists Wilson, FDR, Johnson, and Bush Jr.) to create a \\"history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having the...same object of establishing an absolute Tyranny [over] the States\\" and the People. Is there any wonder why Lord Acton opposed Lincoln's iron fisted rule? Or, for that matter, why Karl Marx loved it?Amongst these abuses, the deportation of Congressman Vallandigham and the accusation of treason against and attempted arrest of Chief Justice Taney are especially interesting. Simon suggests that Vallandigham's failure to counsel against resistance to voluntary enlistment and conscription in Lincoln's army amounts to aiding and abetting the rebels -- a crime worthy of detention and deportation. For Taney, Simon suggests that as a resident of Maryland (a State which did not secede), Taney was required to take an oath of allegiance to Lincoln if he wanted to escape the stigma of being a traitor. The violations upon conscience, along with Lincoln's assumption of guilt for silence, are something right out of the movie \\"A Man for All Seasons\\" where King Henry VIII persecutes Sir Thomas More for his silence. In Lincoln's America, it wasn't what you said that was held against you, but what you didn't say.Simon does a very excellent job bringing little known history about Lincoln to the forefront. However, Simon's contradiction of the facts in his Epilogue and his failure to address the Southern States' primary reason for seceding leaves some things to be desired in this book. He should have left out the Epilogue and replaced it with a chapter about the non-uniform tariffs of the Republicans and Southern reactions to them. A chapter on the Republican's Reconstruction of the South and its attendant political corruption would have been a nice addition as well."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"This is an extremely timely book as we look at the situation in Iraq and wonder just what the President's powers to make war really are. Clearly Lincoln had the power to make war against the South, and the Supreme Court did not have the power to stop him. Just as clearly, Bush was able to get the Congress to pass legislation such as going into Iraq and the Patriot's act.This book is on the conflict between two powerful, intelligent perhaps even brilliant men who disagreed on certain fundamental points.The point I found most interesting was 'does a state who joins the United States voluntarily have the right to withdraw.' Chief Justice Taney said that they did. Lincoln said that they did not, and Lincoln was able to fight a war to enforce his point of view. I wonder what the present court, the present President would say if Maine, for instance, decided to withdraw and join Canada instead.Obviously slavery was a big issue at this time. And it in turn brought the two men in conflict. In the emancipation proclamation Taney held that it was unconstitutional to take property away from slaveholders in the Southern states. Lincoln made the emancipation proclamation apply only to the Southern states.All in all a well written book that covers what is a little known aspect of Civil War history that has direct meaning in our own time."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"Professor Simon takes an extremely understanding view of Chief Justice Taney, the author of the worst decison of all those ever delivered by our U.S. Supreme Court. He lauds Taney's personal politeness and overall ability in the law, while still noting Taney's hatred of Northern abolitionists and stated desire for the South to be able to perserve its \\"traditions.\\" To me, this chief justice richly deserves his infamous place in history.A book that will be enjoyed most by those interested in American legal history and those who--given the current War on Terror-- want background information on a president's war time powers."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"Professor James Simon of New York Law School has made a specialty of exploring historical conflicts between the executive and judicial branches of the government of the United States. He has written books on the conflict between President Thomas Jefferson and Chief Justice Marshall, on the Supreme Court during the Nixon Presidency, and on the conflict among liberal, conservative and centrist elements on the Rhenquist court. Simon's most recent book, \\"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney\\" is a study of the various conflicts between President Abraham Lincoln and the fifth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roger Taney, prior to and during the Civil War. Simon offers a thoughtful and timely account, particularly as the Lincoln-Taney conflict involved questions of civil liberties.The book is cast in the form of a dual biography. Taney's life is much less well-known than Lincoln's and Simon provides valuable biographical insight. Simon points out Taney freed his own slaves and disliked slavery, but that, as Attorney General for President Jackson, Taney wrote a legal memorandum foreshadowing the conclusions he would later reach in the notorious Dred Scott decision. In fact, prior to Dred Scott, Taney was a highly regarded jurist, respected for his legal acumen, thoroughness, and balance.The book focuses on Lincoln and Taney's respective views on slavery, secession, and the conduct of the Civil War. Simon offers a valuable discussion of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on slavery before the Dred Scott case and he describes well the process the Court used in reaching its fateful decision in Dred Scott -- generally regarded as the worst moment in the history of the Court. He describes how Lincoln criticized the decision and Taney at length during his 1858 debates with Stephen Douglas and how this criticism helped Lincoln achieve the Presidency. There is little in the book on Taney and secession, but Simon makes clear that Taney was sympathetic to the Southern position and favored a peaceful dissolution of the Union rather than a long and bloody civil war, regardless of its outcome.The larger portion of Simon's book deals with conflicts between Lincoln and Taney following Lincoln's election. Taney objected to Lincoln's assumption of broad war powers which he viewed as in excess of the executive's power under the Constitution. Simon discusses a famous decision of Taney in the Merryman case which involved Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus in the border state, and Taney's home state, of Maryland. The Merryman decision is still studied today for its discussion of civil rights during war time. Simon also explores Taney's views on matters that did not reach the Supreme Court during the Civil War but that involved expansion of presidential powers -- including the Emancipation Proclamation, the use of paper money called \\"Greenbacks\\" to finance the Civil War, and the imposition of an income tax. There is an excellent discussion of a series of cases known as the Prize cases which challenged Lincoln's imposition of a blockade and seizure of ships during the early days of the Civil War. The Court sustained the blockade, based upon military necessity by the narrow vote of 5-4 with Taney voting in the minority. I was unfamiliar with the Prize cases, and Simon describes them well.The book is jargon free and can be read easily by non-lawyers. In addition to the discussion of the lives of Lincoln and Taney and the discussion of legal issues, Simon gives a broad running history of the battles in the Civil War, similar to the narrative accounts available in many other books. This discussion is not at the level of Simon's legal discussion. Simon's history is full of many small but irritating factual and typographical errors. For many battles in the war, Simon confuses total casualty figures with figures for fatalities. This is a common mistake, and it vastly inflates the number of fatalities -- which were horrendous in any event -- for battles such as Shiloh, Antietam, and Gettysburg. Simon also refers to General U.S. Grant as a \\"colonel\\" at the time of the taking of Fort Donelson and Fort Henry. A more careful check of the historical details of the Civil War would have been appropriate and welcome.This book is valuable for its good, nuanced portrayal of Chief Justice Taney and for its discussion of the legal issues surrounding the Civil War, Lincoln's presidency, and the protection of civil liberties during times of crisis.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"I had some concern when starting this fine book by Professor Simon of New York Law School that it would be highly repetitive of other books and articles focusing on this topic. In actuality, I found his discussion to be fresh and quite intriguing. The \\"war\\" between Taney and Lincoln is, of course, well known and has become somewhat pertinent given the current use of the Patriot Act. What Simon does is to put the struggle into a useful context. First, he provides somewhat thorough -- but concise -- discussions of Taney and Lincoln. In this way, the reader develops an understanding of what motivated each of these powerful figures. Next, he discusses key judicial and congressional developments in the period immediately before the outbreak of the Civil War. I thought his chapter on the much discussed Dred Scott decision was particularly effective, since it was obvious given the author's discussion of Taney and the formative influences shaping his outlook why he led the Court to decide this \\"self-inflicted wound.\\" In addition, the author's discussion of the actual legal warfare between the two is written with clarity and insight, and does not require any legal training to understand the conflicting viewpoints. Finally, even after Taney dies in 1864, Simon still carries on with Lincoln, his views toward Reconstruction, and his successful efforts to bring the war to a conclusion. Along the way, I learned a good deal about Lincoln, including that he was a more complex and interesting figure than I had realized. At around 336 pages, the narrative moves along nicely -- I never felt bogged down -- and helpful bibliographic references are included. A particularly apposite book given the current disputes over the extent of president power during the Iraq episode."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"Five MONUMENTAL Stars!! Master historian James F. Simon has written a wonderfully-researched and incisively-written book describing a clash of two historical titans at one of the most critical historical crossroads of the United States of America: \\"the greatest civil war known in the history of the human race.\\" And he hits every salient historical signpost along the way as he patiently develops and delineates the story.Primarily it's the story of two men rising to the top of their professions amid the ever-present and explosive issue of slavery that ripped apart a still-expanding young nation. But there is much more going on and he lays it out magnificently. Simon details how slavery was always the major issue between slave states and free states, among many other important issues. The description of the institution of slavery, the treatment of blacks, and the central role of the courts in this time period is a very sad, abhorrent chapter in our nation's history. Mr Simon has done the uninitiated reader a favor with his detailed background work on all of the issues and personalities involved.President Abraham Lincoln and United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, both tall, imposing, God-fearing figures, bitterly opposed each other on three important points: slavery, secession, and President \\"Lincoln's constitutional authority during the Civil War\\". And the broad tapestry of this book includes all of the major players of that era: John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Nicholas Biddle, John Marshall, James Knox Polk, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, Franklin Pierce, Buchanan, Salmon Chase, and the ubiquitous \\"triumvirate\\" of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun, among many more. And then there were the intricacies of the major political parties: Democrats, Whigs, Know-Nothing, American, and Republicans.He covers the background of Taney and Lincoln in detail. In Lincoln's life we find a man who was always against the institution of slavery. At one point, Taney thought slavery was \\"evil\\" and freed his own slaves. But both wound up curiously at odds in later life for different reasons. Lincoln's economic beginnings from postman to early political candidate, Whig party member, and then member of the nascent Republican Party and eventually President were all based on one year of formal education and an unyielding lifelong zest for reading, learning, and memorization. Taney's life is likewise given a detail examination in fascinating prose.Simon carefully builds both the social/political climates and the laws at issue. He gives an overview of the relevant legal issues of the day: from the \\"Amistad\\" case to the Missouri Compromise (1820) to the annexation of Texas and the war with Mexico with it's consequent 'spoils' of half a billion acres of land to the Compromise of 1850 to the Fugitive Slave Act to the tense and bloody period of Dred Scott v. Sandford (where members of congress were armed and a member of the Senate was brutally 'caned' in a crowded Senate chamber) to the Prize Cases, the Conscription Law, and many more. The reader will be 200 pages into the book by the time we get to the point of the book, with the almost unbelievable confrontation in Baltimore between a sitting Supreme Court Chief Justice and the Commander of Fort McHenry.The book details the fact that Lincoln's problems during the Civil War were harsh and the issues were tricky: the suspension of habeas corpus, censorship, suppression of dissidents, the southern blockade, numerous slavery issues and ultimately the emancipation proclamation, among others. With the trials and tribulations of seceding states, border states with shifting allegiances, British intervention, and military defeats, Lincoln did not need a Supreme Court Chief Justice who publicly challenged the legal validity of Lincoln's decisions at every turn, officially and unofficially, comparing Confederate soldiers to the soldiers of the Revolutionary War and ruling that blacks were permanently excluded from the phrase \\"all men are created equal\\" and were nothing more than property. Meanwhile, Lincoln expanded the roles of Commander-in-Chief, Head of State, and Chief Executive by using implied powers of the presidency, walking very close to (if not over) the edge of unconstitutionality (see my second note).By the time the reader reaches p.306 the fate of the Union, in terms of international law and relations, seems to hang in the balance based on the Court's decision on one matter, the Prize Cases, and the fiery oratory of the author of \\"Two Years Before The Mast\\". We know the final outcome but the final chapters of this superb historical book detail how we got here and they are spellbinding.Lincoln's words at the founding of the Illinois Republican Party are the watchwords of this fabulous historical read: \\"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable\\". This is a masterful, mesmerizing historical investigation by James F. Simon and it gets my Highest Recommendation. Five AWESOME Stars!!(*This review is based on an unabridged eBook digital download in eReader format.

It seems to glass over why Taney made such a seemingly radical decision and why he was able to get 6 others to affirm it. Little treatment of his relationshiop with the Catholic church or even what he thought of blacks as individuals.Rather jarring discussion of George W. Bush and Rumsfeld, where he takes the predictable liberal positions, while excusing Lincolns' abuse of arresting a sitting Ohio congressman. Not one word about controversy of whether Taney had been targeted for arrest by Abraham Lincoln.This book whets your appetite for more and is good for someone who doesn't have the time to read a more detailed study."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"It should be widely known that during the greatest crisis that has faced the US, the Civil War, Lincoln suspended the rights of habeas corpus and essentially bent the Constitution in order to save the Union. In James Simon's book \\"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers\\" he gives us a fairly balanced approach in examining both sides of the issues facing the President and the Supreme Court as it relates to the Constitution and civil liberties. As a law professor Simon examines Justice Taney's rulings and Lincoln's position on civil matters that were affecting the Nation. His book shows how much of an uphill battle Justice Taney had to face when trying to fight the challenges to individual liberties. As the inevitable war approached, Lincoln didn't wait for Congress to return to session. He did all in his power to block any additional states from turning to help the Confederacy. This was especially true in Maryland Justice Taney's home state. Lincoln took the broad approach to Constitutional matters believing that he knew what the Founding Fathers had constitutionally desired for the Nation. Justice Taney maintained a more narrow Jeffersonian state's view. Simon relates Taney's early views expressed in a banking opinion while serving as Andrew Jackson's Attorney General. Reflecting Taney's words Andrew Jackson's states, \\"The opinion of the Supreme Court Judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of congress has over the Judges, and on that point the President is independent of both\\" Jackson wrote. \\"The authority of the Supreme Court must not, therefore, be permitted to control Congress or the Executive when acting in their legislative capacities, but to have only such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve.\\" As Chief Justice during the Lincoln administration, Taney found himself greatly challenged to maintain this opinion. Simon covers the infamous \\"Dred Scott vs Sanford\\" opinion that haunted Taney and how it became a catalyst to move Lincoln forward and into the Presidency. Both Taney and Lincoln had respect for the rule of law. They both desired peace. Taney was willing to allow the states to peaceable leave the Union in order to prevent civil war. Simon reveals that Lincoln's goal was to repair the rupture to the constitutional government established by the framers even if that meant civil war.This is an important read in helping to understand the extraordinary powers assumed by the executive, with the consent of Congress, in times of emergencies and how when the emergency passes should be yielded up. In the epilogue Simon goes over several later Presidents and their use of war powers. He explains how Congress is the best check on the growing assumptions of Presidential war powers. The Supreme Court has been very reluctant to curb the president's powers especially when the Nation's security is at risk.Simon revealed how much Lincoln \\"appreciated that the strength of the Union lay not in the force of arms but in the liberties that were guaranteed by the open, and sometimes heated, exchange of ideas\\"...\\"He didn't use this authority to trample on the civil liberties that the writ of habeas corpus was meant to protect\\". Had Lincoln imprisoned and kept imprisoned anyone just because they were unpopular would have meant the failure of the constitution as well as the failure of civilization and hello totalitarianism. Today as we face issue with regards to our own personal liberties, it is important to stay vigilant so that our rights aren't abused beyond the constitutional law. Simon lays open two legal minds in a time of tremendous pressure. Well worth the read to better understand this critical crossroad in US history."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"James Simon has been making a career out of writing great books that profile legal/political controversies. He has also written one about the Jefferson/Marshall, and then the Black/Frankfurter, fights. But not to worry. They are entertaining, all; this one is no exception.The primary concern of this book is to explore the differing visions - on practically all issues - between then president elect Lincoln and then Supreme Court Chief Justice Taney. Lincoln, from Illinois, was a moderate republican who believed in gradual emancipation of slavery and - most importantly here - sweeping presidential war powers combined with the illegality of Southern seccession. Taney, by contrast, was a quiet Baltimorean and democrat who believed in states rights, fidelity to (a more narrow view of the) Constitution, even during times of war, and the states rights to choose whether to condone slavery. Needless to say for those who know even the most cursory history - Lincoln won.While Simon does treat Taney with a tiny bit of hkostility, he is very careful to give him credit when credit is due. One of the main focuses of the book - the rightfully infamous decision in Dred Scott v Sandford, which saw Taney proclaim that Scott, a black man, could not bring a suit as he was not legally a person - is hard to justify by even the most generous legal mind. And Simon rightfully and flatly treats it to a stinging critique. This, as with several other Tany zingers.But SImon is also quick to point out that Taney wss first and foremost concerned with civil liberties during war time, against the president's sometimes Orwellian actions, such as his acts to shut down newspapers that did not sympathize with the Union, or his actions - yes, it is true - to arrest a priest who did not pray for the Union. When these are looked at by Simon, Taney comes out with at least some dignity.This book covers, first, both men's early years before going into the pre-civil war acts like Dred Scott and follows the trajectory of the entire civil war, highlighting the president's actions therein and Taney's (often ignored) responses to them. Legalese - have no fear - is kept to a minimum, and, in fact, the entire book reads like a historical thriller with a bit of courtroom drama.On a final note, I find this book prescient for today's times, becasue many of the debates that Taney and Lincoln had are debates we ourselves are having in the US today. Whether or not military tributnals can or should supplant judicial courts, whether habeas corpus can be suspended in war time, what it even means to bve at war (the debate then was whether or not you can be at war with your own country men, today it is whether you can be at war with a group not a state). Finally, there is whether the president's war powers give the president virtually unlimited authority to ignore other constitutional provisions. Prescient indeed!Anyhow, this is a good read for anyone interested in an in-depth study of the Civil WAr period or the legal issues rife therein."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"This book does offer quite a bit of information about the divergent evolution of Lincoln and Taney from their somewhat common beginnings, but unfortunately stops short of giving us a full insight into why Taney, who freed the majority of his slaves and personally abhored slavery, would defend it so vehemently and unrigorously in his Dred Scott decision. All the stuff on Lincoln is good, but I've seen it done more eloquently elsewhere (including his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus); I really expected more on Taney.As a Catholic, I would have loved to see more on Taney's Catholicism than a mere mention of it and the name of his parish church -- perhaps how his views either for or against slavery and states rights were formed there. But the author makes mention of and dismisses this religious side in a few short sentences, while hinting that Taney was an intensely religious, if conflicted, individual. How can one arrive at a true understanding of Taney without knowing this dimension of his character?Sadly, Taney himself occupies somewhat less than half of the book, and quotations from (and any extensive analysis of) his decisions other than Dred Scott are lacking. The author spends about as much time on Douglas as he does on Taney (Douglas' name could be added to book's title without falsity).Finally, Simon, in his epilogue, moves to the present and makes this comment on the current political situation compared with Lincoln's: \\"And he did not attempt to escape judicial scrutiny in the name of national security, as the Bush administration has repeatedly done in prosecuting the War on Terrorism, which, unlike the Civil War, has no discernible end.\\" In the book itself, Simon has Lincoln completely ignoring Taney's pronouncements on the writ of habeas corpus and packing the Court with three new pro-Lincoln justices to assure a good decision on the Prize Cases. He furthermore points out that, until quite late, the Civil War had no discernible end either, with defeat after defeat dogging the Union forces during the early and middle portions of the war. Simon's final intrusion of his own modern politics (conflicted with his admiration of Lincoln's strong prosecution of the war against slavery) provides a dissonant counterpoint to the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"In my pervious review, I described Simon's other work,What Kind of Nation: Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and the Epic Struggle to Create a United States, as the struggle between two American icons: Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall. This book is slightly different, although it also features the struggles of a famous president with the chief justice of the Supreme Court; this book features an American Icon vs. an American villain. It is unusual for me to name any historical figure a villain, even when they hold views I find deplorable, because to me that would be strong presentism. However, when I find the presence of such a historical figure to be so negative that it makes almost erases any good points they might have had, I feel obligated to call them out for what they are and that is a villain. I realize that mine is not a perfect system and one could go on and on over the details of various figures, but with this acknowledged I still say: that Roger Taney was an outright villain in American history whose presence we could have done without. Yes, I realize that he was useful to President Jackson during the Bank War, but I think President Jackson would found someone else to fill the role that he needed played, and his evil role in issuing the Dred Scot decision far overrides any good that he performed in his career. While Lincoln is the icon, who saved the Union and ended legalized slavery in the United States.Simon gives Taney a fairer treatment than I would give him, detailing a good deal of his career showing that he was at one point a half-way decent chief justice. Someone who entered the national stage and had participated in big events, back when Lincoln was still a young man trying to find his place in the world. This makes his sudden turn during the Dred Scot case even more shocking. A man who at one point had earned praise of even those who had been Andrew Jackson's opponents suddenly turns away from law and reason. Simon describes how Taney's decision completely upends almost three quarters of a century of precedent, in order just to satisfy his personnel feelings.\\"Taney did not offer a single source of proof for his sweeping generalization. He lumped all of those who signed the Declaration and the Constitution together, the slaveholders of the South with the opponents of slavery in the North. He dismissed the idea that the Declaration of Independence's proclamation that \`all men are created equal' should be taken literally. Blacks were permanently excluded, according to Taney, because they were a degraded class.\\" p.122Taney attempt to protect slavery though the court backfired on him. Instead, it only intensified things, and cost the Supreme Court under his leadership the respect of a great deal of the nation. The case was brought up in the Lincoln/Douglas debates where Lincoln accuses Presidents Buchanan and Pierce, Senator Douglas, and Taney himself of being in a conspiracy to force slavery over the whole nation. Lincoln was of course exaggerating, but his star was rising. Lincoln would win the election of 1860 in a close four-way race in which he would receive less the forty percent of the vote. Before Lincoln ever took the oath of office states were already abandoning the Union to avoid living under a president who was going to be openly hostile to the cause of slavery.Lincoln began to take steps to save the Union, having avoided a mob in Baltimore, things started to take an even more dangerous turn with riots and state officials even trying to persuade Lincoln not to have troops at all in Maryland, to which Lincoln chastises them for.\\"Maryland remained dangerously volatile. Secessionists in northern Maryland destroyed railroad bridges between Washington and the North and cut telegraph lines. The state legislature, dominated by southern sympathizers, was scheduled to meet in Frederick on April 26. Anticipating a secessionist vote, General Scott recommended to the president that he be given the authority to arrest secessionist politicians in advance. If Maryland voted to secede, he told Scott, he would act decisively to put down the rebellion with \`the bombardment of their cities--and of course the suspension of habeas corpus.' Those drastic measures were not immediately necessary. The legislature did not vote to secede. Meanwhile, northern troops managed to filter into the capital in increasing numbers by a circuitous route, first ferrying down Chesapeake Bay to Annapolis, then boarding trains to Washington.\\" p.186Even with the arrival of the Union army, Simon describes and environment in which the threat of sabotage was still ever present. With that, President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus and had military commanders arrest suspected secessionists and hold them without trial. This would give Taney, traveling circuit, an ability to undermine the Union cause from within. He ordered the military to hand John Merryman, the army commander, General Cadwalader, refused to hand him over citing orders from the president himself. In his famous decision, Ex. Parte Merryman, Taney strips to the president down to the bare minimum of constitutional authority. Taney's new position is one that clashed with his own history and views on presidential power and government authority.\\"To achieve his goal of proving that Congress alone could suspend the writ, Taney systematically reduced the president's constitutional powers to Lilliputian proportions. Here Taney displayed the artistry of a partisan trial lawyer rather than the detachment of a judge. His interpretation was starkly at odds with Taney's own reading of presidential power when he had been President Jackson's Attorney General. In defending Jackson's broad constitutional powers in the Bank War, Attorney General Taney discovered deep wells of presidential authority, totally independent of both Congress and the Supreme Court. And Chief Justice Taney, in an earlier judicial opinion that raised an issue much closer to Lincoln's plight in 1861, declared that the governor of Rhode Island could use martial law to put down an armed insurrection. The power to do so, Taney wrote in works equally applicable to the president of the United States, \`is essential to the existence of every government, essential to the preservation of order and free institutions, and is necessary to the State of the Union as to any other government.'\\" p.192-3So low was the public opinion in the Roger Taney, that Lincoln just ignored the order and proceeded as he intended to do. Lincoln would win the war and would receive monuments built in his name for generations. Taney would die in 1864, and be replaced by Salmon P. Chase, formally Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury. I strongly recommended James Simon's book to anyone who is interested in some of the legal aspects of America's Civil War."},{"Title":"Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney: Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers","review":"The book is a good read.

Lewis wrote of the Essenes 16 years for the world had even heard of them. Hence no additional scholarly peer-reviewed books existed to even make a bibliography with. However it is telling that subsequent scholarly works now support many of Lewis's contentions.If you can tolerate the discussion of alternative views of Christianity you might want to give \\"Secret Doctrines of Jesus\\" and also \\"Mansions of the Soul\\" a look.No orthodox Christian or New Age writer--EVEN WITH A BIBIOGRAPHY--can demonstrate that they knew of the Essenes 16 years before anyone else had even heard of the Essenes. So criticizing this book for NOT having a bibliography is not a logical, fair or rational criticism.Again much like in Lewis' \\"Mystical Life of Jesus,\\" Lewis doesn't absolutely prove anything. Nobody can. But then again nobody is sure who wrote the four gospels and interestingly at least some of the more mystical-alternative sects of Christianity that Catholicism so despised seem to have been compatible with many of Lewis' assertions.Regardless Lewis writes in a very clear, compelling and authoritative style that certainly makes one stop and think. And unlike past centuries of orthodox Christianity, that's no longer a crime. Although no doubt some still wish that it were... While even some New Age types seem to have issues with some of Lewis's conclusions, I would suggest to such readers that they objectively assess their motivations. Many of whom are seemingly the self-professed arbiters of tolerance of alternative personal spirituality, wouldn't it be ironic if such as those were merely subsituting one form of dogmatism--hence, pseudo intellectualism--for another?If this has aroused your curiosity then check out my reader's guide for more startling info. on alternative Christianity."},{"Title":"Secret Doctrines of Jesus","review":"For those of you unwilling to blindly accept everything the masses tell you as truth, this book may help you broaden your perspectives.

Three parts conservation, one part natural history, with a bit of how-to fly fishing; Rose's passion for his subject comes through on every page. What makes this read particularly enjoyable is how easily he makes good writing seem effortless.Rose comes across as a dedicated naturalist and astute observer of riverine habitats. These observations extend to the Peninsula's geography, climate, local history, local Tribes and conservation politics. Absent is the grandious bravado of many angling writers and their simple 'catch-and-tell' naratives. He presents solid arguments for protecting wild fish, particularly the remaining wild winter steelhead, from harvest and further habitat destruction. Most notably, he shares with us what these fish and rivers mean to him on an intimate level. Rose paints an image of the Olympic rain forest landscape that is both unique and precious; and outside National Park boundaries, remains in desparate need of protection.I began reading this book to learn more about winter steelhead fishing from a technical perspective. While there are several sections relating to technical aspects, they are few and somewhat short on detail. Illustrations are limited to so-so quality photographs of West End riverscapes and many (but not all) of the flies described throughout the text. One small complaint concerns a number of typos remaining that the editor failed to catch. Admittedly though, my gripes are nominal.I highly recommend this read for those wanting to enjoy an eloquant tribute to the remarkable anadromous fisheries of the Olympic Peninsula rivers."},{"Title":"Steelhead Fly Fishing on the Olympic Peninsula (The Color of Winter)","review":"Doug Rose has authored an authoritative, entertaining, and artful narrative about one of the most amazing gamefish -- the sea run rainbow trout known as The Steelhead -- and one of its most pristine habitats: Washington state's Olympic Peninsula.Rose writes in a colorful narrative style that brings the Olympic Peninsula's winter palette to life. He also introduces the reader to the people who live their lives in pursuit of, and in support of, this great sport fish. Within the story he weaves the important ecological issues regarding the management -- and mismanagement -- of this wild, fragile, natural resource. A series of color plates in the middle of the book bring the reader even closer to the subject.This book is a fine read: a \\"literary fishing book\\" in the tradition of Roderick Haig-Brown and Harry Middleton; a book that should be -- and will be -- read and reread by lovers of fly lines and literary lines alike."},{"Title":"Steelhead Fly Fishing on the Olympic Peninsula (The Color of Winter)","review":"This is a really, really good book. And is very fun to read. You learn a lot about the history of the OP, and obviously a great deal about the fly fishing for steelhead in that area. I find some of the most interesting parts of this book are the chapters about the history of certain rivers and fisheries, and other subjects. Deus Ex Machina, Maximum Sustained Harvest, and The Creeks are a few examples. This is a great book, and so are Doug Roses' other books as well."},{"Title":"Steelhead Fly Fishing on the Olympic Peninsula (The Color of Winter)","review":"The book had a lot of fishing stories but not much on how to fish for steel head.My favorite was Fishing the Hoh River. More how to & where in that book."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Cain","review":"Wilkie Collins is better known for two other novels, THE MOONSTONE and THE WOMAN IN WHITE but THE LEGACY OF CAIN is their equal, in my opinion.A minister is persuaded by an aristocratic woman (who is about to be hanged for murdering her husband) to take her infant daughter and raise her as his own. As happens frequently, the childless couple adopts the child and before long have a daughter of their own.The story explores, partly through the governor (warden) of the prison who is a friend of the minister, how these two girls grow up in the exact same circumstances, never suspecting they are not blood sisters, and how differently they turn out.The governor's narration explores the nature or nurture question in a thoughtful and provocative manner without making an absolute judgment.Anyone interested in this subject would certainly find this story interesting.Wilkie Collins' writing is surprisingly modern and without the flowery prose that was so common during the 1800's."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Cain","review":"If you have read &#34;The Moonstone&#34; and &#34;The Woman in White&#34; and are looking for a Wilkie Collins fix, walk right on by&#34;The Legacy of Cain&#34;. An indignant indictment of Victorian prejudices which lacks the subtle evocations of atmosphere that Collins excels at, &#34;Legacy&#34; fails to round out its characters and is short on plot. Consider yourself warned."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Cain","review":"I have read several books including The Woman in White as well as this title and in all of his other books moved on rather well and even though this story was very good I thought the story moved a little slow at times but the plot was well put together and I also felt that the girls not knowing their ages or not knowing ifthey were real sisters or not really made the book, not as exciting as some of his other novels but still a great read."},{"Title":"The Legacy of Cain","review":"Boring, ho hum, did I mention boring? Some much visual detail that the story was lost won't be getting any more of these from Collins"},{"Title":"Judaism on Trial: Jewish-Christian Disputations in the Middle Ages (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization)","review":"During the Middle Ages, kings and popes would sometimes force Jews to engage in \\"disputations\\" with Christian scholars, in the hope that the Jews would thereby be converted (or at least embarrassed). In some of these disputations, the Jews were treated somewhat fairly, in others less so.Maccoby describes three separate disputations: one in Paris in 1240, a second in Barcelona in 1263 (perhaps the fairest, and the most notable from the Jewish point of view because of the involvement of Nachmanides, one of the more well-known Jewish scholars of the medieval period), a third in Tortosa in 1413-14. In addition, he provides more-or-less contemporary summaries of the latter two disputations.After reading Jaccoby's book, I was surprised how sophisticated both sides were by modern standards. The Christian \\"debaters\\" (often converts from Judaism) were much more sophisticated about Judaism than today's missionary-on-the-street; while the latter focuses solely on a few Biblical passages that he or she alleges shows Jesus to be Messiah, the former focused on Talmud and Midrash as well.Christians took two very different lines: first, that the Talmud was a corruption of Biblical Judaism, and later that the Talmud actually supported Christianity. As to the latter, Christians relied heavily on Midrashic stories - for example, one which suggested that at the time of the Temple's destruction, the Messiah had already been born.In response to the latter claim, Nachmanides not only attacked the Christian interpretations of the Midrash - but bluntly pointed out that this story is \\"either not true, or has some other interpretation derived from the secrets of the Sages.\\" (p. 110). In other words, such Midrashic stories are fables designed to make a theological point, rather than literal truth."},{"Title":"Judaism on Trial: Jewish-Christian Disputations in the Middle Ages (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization)","review":"I highly encourage anyone interested in the disputation(s) or the history of Judaic/Christian relations to take time to read this book. Thanks to the review above {all of which I agree with entirely), I bought a copy of this more or less out of couriosity but found myself eager to continue reading. The style is quite \\"user friendly\\" for those who are not religious or theological scholars - perfectly suited for those with a strong lay interest in the topic."},{"Title":"Judaism on Trial: Jewish-Christian Disputations in the Middle Ages (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization)","review":"I enjoyed this book because it is easy to read and comprehend the Author's analysis of the debates and their translations."},{"Title":"Judaism on Trial: Jewish-Christian Disputations in the Middle Ages (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization)","review":"I found this book to be a great resource in understanding the background and players in these major religious debates. What was interesting was the consistent threats levied against the Jews for speaking up against the theological holes in Christianity. Any religion that cannot convey or support their beliefs through rational arguments, but must kill their opponents should be critically examined before joining.Hyam Maccoby does an excellent job of providing a critical analysis of the written account of Nachmonides (the Vikuach) versus the surviving versions of the account. It is interesting how the debates became more focused on Jewish writings (Talmud, midrashim) as they progressed. We see today a focus on these tactics as well as many missionary groups such as Jews for J-sus attempt to do the same thing.While reading the narratives, you can see the debates focusing on 3 major areas: exegesis (scriptures), historical, and rational points. The book doesn't delve too deeply into these subjects, but I would recommend Daniel J. Lasker's book, \\"Jewish Philosophical Polemics against Christianity in the Middle Ages\\", for more information.This book is a great introduction to the argument points during the Middle Ages between Jews and Christians."},{"Title":"The Itinerant","review":"This autobiographical novel is a very authentic taste of the first generation Jewish families in 1920s -1940s New York, Herrick was crazy about my mother, and I can vouch for the veracity of his characters.

What this book lacks is a proper framework for negotiation, or if it is there, then it is lost underneath the pile of other information that is tossed into the book. This book also does not even go into the aspects of conflict that inevitably result from negotiating and must be dealt with. There is nothing mentioned about reframing interests, or active listening to address concerns. If you want to know everything else about negotiating then this book is great, but if you want to know the true framework for a real negotiation, then this book is seriously lacking."},{"Title":"The Everything Negotiating Book: Savvy Techniques For Getting What You Want --at Work And At Home (Everything (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"I bought this book on sale for $3.99, and I truly believe I wasted my money. There are two big problems with this book. First, negotiating is a skill that is developed through years and years of practice. Unfortunately the author has very little experience as a negotiator, and it shows in the book. Here is a direct quote about the author's experience and background taken from the back cover of the book: \\"Angelique Pinet is a professional writer, editor, and desktop publisher with a degree in commercial art and a degree in literature.\\" I think the publisher made a big mistake by not bringing in someone with real world negotiating experience to work with Ms. Pinet.The second problem is that the book has NO real world examples of how to negotiate. For the average person the three biggest negotiations are salary, purchasing a house, and purchasing a car. This book allocates three pages for salary negotiation, four pages for purchasing a car, and 13 pages for purchasing a house. A grand total of 20 pages out 242 pages are devoted to the THREE BIGGEST negotiations the average person will face in their life! The rest of the 222 pages deal with understanding personality types, being in touch with your emotions, how to feel good about yourself, and other things that most people learned back in the third grade. I'm sorry, but I feel this book was a waste of my time and money."},{"Title":"The Everything Negotiating Book: Savvy Techniques For Getting What You Want --at Work And At Home (Everything (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"Excellent book for beginners, written in an easy-to-follow format that doesn't bog the reader down with too much technical information. I especially appreciate how the author relates the subject to simple, day-to-day situations using professional tactics. Rather than reading like a boring business manual, the book is more like a friendly guide that discusses everything from body language to the steps of negotiating to the different types of negotiating styles. This is a great reference book for anyone wanting to understand the subject and wanting to learn how to practice the skills associated with it."},{"Title":"Reign of grace,: From its rise to its consummation","review":"This is not a review of the content but of the Kindle format.

Yes, after all that is imagined or can be sung, by angels or men, by seraphs or saints, in the church below, or in the choirs above; the charming subject will remain unexhausted to eternity.

The author gives you sample schedules, explanations of typical procedures and medications, and many stories of what other people have been through.

It is written very matter-of-factly with simple language even with technical terminology.Written as a step by step \\"how to manual\\" of sorts, what it lacks in that personal touch it makes up for in sheer volume of information. It weighs in at 300 pages (at a bargain price of $16.95) and has 10 chapters with charts, graphs, sample calendars, resource guide, and a glossary of terminology.For a \\"IVF for Dummies\\" type of book, I'd recommend this for its wealth of knowledge.

Just keep your legs in the air/take to bed rest/keep thinking smiley happy positive thoughts and it always works!

Unlike other cold and technical books on the topic, this one is reader-friendly, accessible and warm. As someone who went through IVF herself, Charlesworth has made sure that hers is a compassionate guide. She shares her stories and those of other women going through IVF. These are the very stories those of us IVFers seek out daily on the Web. If you're thinking about IVF or are starting a cycle, you'll want to buy this book.

Charlesworth is simultaneously optimistic, warm, AND logical in her plain-language explanations of this complicated, overwhelming process. Reading it is like having a best friend who also happens to be a reproductive endocrinologist drop by for a few hours for coffee and a long chat! Charlesworth is an expert communicator--distilling detailed scientific processes into plain English. (My favorite is when she talks about the process of conception, and compares the navigation of sperm in the cervical canal to an action-adventure flick--as opposed to a tender romance movie--it's actually quite a feat for sperm to perform.) The author also sprinkles the book with enough information about her personal experience to reassure you that she's been there herself. But, she's not heavy-handed about it, as you read, you feel like the focus is on YOU and your experience rather than her and hers. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Couple's Guide To In Vitro Fertilization: Everything You Need To Know To Maximize Your Chances Of Success","review":"Gave me really good information.

IT IS A VERY EMPOWERING, ENCOURAGING, INFORMATIVE VOLUME! I recommend it most highly. Although Ms. Charlesworth and her husband are themselves an \\"IVF Success Story\\", Ms. Charlesworth nonetheless has no \\"ax to grind\\"; that is she does a wonderful job encouraging others to make an independent decision as to whether IVF is truly right for THEM.

I can also HEARTILY recommend a wonderful book about the joys of hitting the fertility jackpot--\\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,\\" by Bruce Stockler--the first chapter is when the author and his wife are in the ultrasound room and discover they are having triplets.

I was surprised after I read her book, that, by her own admission, she experienced difficulty getting published in the literary genre, since her characterization of three very different women is amazing! Apparently publishers didn't want her to jump from the romance market to the literary genre. I, for one, am glad she persevered and found the right agent to market her book. As a struggling novelist myself, I will study her book further, to improve my own mastery of the literary devices she's used, such as metaphor and simile, as well as her original, lyrical descriptive settings of northern California. She's accomplished many tasks masterfully in Wildwood. She moves the plot at a wonderful clip and manages to write from three different characters' points of view, each woman unique in experiencing her own growth and ephiphany.I read this novel in two days and was sooooo reluctant to leave the three friends, Hannah, Liz, and Jeanne, when the book ended. It's my hope that Drusilla has other quality literary novels like this in the works!"},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"My friend brought me this book, said she'd read it all the way through on her flight to see me. I didn't believe her. Then I started reading and found myself unable to stop. I was captivated by all of the characters, saw some of myself in each of the women. I loved that it wasn't predictable, as so many books are now. This is a great book club read - really brings out discussion."},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"While it took me fifty pages to get into the book, once I was there, I was hooked. I found myself to be reading through the night, absolutely intent to find out how the now-adult relationship would play out for Liz,Hanna, and Jeanne. It is a new twist on the coming-of-age novel. A twist that all of us who have maintain grade school friendships have or will have to journey through as we enter adulthood. Campbell writes with precision without taking away from the reader's own introspection. Perhaps one of the best Campbell has written and I have read them all!"},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"In her dashing novel *Wildwood* Drucilla Campbell weaves an alluring, highly complex tale of three still-young women who find release from a horrible event shared some 30 years past. During the intervening years they've all lived quite different lives--two have remained close to home, the third has lived abroad--and it is she who returns for a visit and provides the ultimate catalyst for dramatic resolutions.There are many aspects in Ms. Campbell's novel to intrigue us: a curious private school and a tenebrous nature-place of crime are provocative old hometown venues; the maddeningly relentless drought--a seemingly &quot;judgmental&quot; withholding of rain--serves as a puissant metaphor; and then there is the ever-surfacing mystery of a missing piece of intimate clothing, which is a key to their life-changing mystery. And of course there are the relationships between the women themselves--and their men--all inextricably wound together like tangled roots of old trees. These relationships are charged, and psychodynamically layered (especially interesting to me, a NYC psychotherapist), and all are portrayed with marked originality and truly extraordinary perspicacity.On the way, there are delightful tidbits and dividends: a wonderful run through Paris; an engaging ear for the patois of the youth involved; and loads of good southern California.Read *Wildwood*. Read it because it's immensely entertaining; read it because it's incredibly edifying."},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"Speaking as a male who reads (&amp; writes) mainly non-fiction, WILDWOOD was as suspenseful, insightful, engaging, and well crafted a novel as I've read in years.

When fifteen year old Billy Phillips arrives he starts making sexual advances to the twelve year old girl. She gets frightened and pushes him. His head hits some rocks and he dies. When her friends come and sees Billy's body, Liz wants to tell somebody in authority but Hannah and Jeanne talk her out of it.Four decades later Liz returns to Rinconada to see her two friends she regards as family and to have an abortion. All her life Liz ran from commitment and even though she has been living with Gerard for seven years she's afraid to marry him. Hannah, who has two teenagers, wants to adopt a crack baby and Liz's unborn child to the point of desperation. Jeanne is married to the man she loves but fears that he will leave her; she also resents his tomcatting around and that he influenced her into giving up for adoption their three month old son. Will a four-decade friendship survive the surprising revelations that surfaces or will the truth destroy their sisterhood?This is a very absorbing tale that focuses on the lives of three women. They made and make mistakes, feel guilt over an incident that happened almost forty years ago, and their quest for redemption surfaces in strange and tragic ways. This is more of a character study than an action drama but women of all ages will be able to identify with the problems these women face. Drusilla Campbell is a wonderful storyteller who probes into the human psyche with some uncanny insights.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"This is a terrific tale of choices, and of the durability of friendship. As girls, these women share a wrenching experience, and over the ensuing years, make choices about their lives testing the strength of their loyalty to eachother and their current relationships. As a book for a reader's group, there are meaty issues of loyalty, love, motherhood, compromises and choices that are sure to yield lively discussion and memories of old friends."},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"Druscilla Campbell, the author of &quot;Wildwood&quot; did it. She made me care about the three characters and best friends, Hannah, Jeanne, and Liz, when I had enough to care about like my family, a baby on the way, job, etc. She hooked me from tbe first page until the last. Druscilla has an uncanny ability to get inside her characters heads and make them real. More than that, she gives each one of her characters a real and distinct voice; one that leaps out at you from the page. These voices push you along, leading you to the end. A good book makes you examine yourself and those around you. Do I have friends that will last 40 years? Could we endure a similar secret of &quot;Bluegang Creek&quot; like Hannah, Jeanne, and Liz? Not only did I love reading this book, but it got me thinking which is the best kind of book."},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"Drusilla Campbell has captured the moods and personalities of her three main characters in a way that makes the reader feel that they are all friends. She shows how one traumatic event in their childhood has affected all three of them in different ways as they rejoin each other years later. Her descriptions and insights into people are very apt and fresh. This is a book that you will not want to put down once you begin to read it. I enjoyed it immensely!!!"},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"This is the 1st book I have bought from this author. I love it, keeps you interested of what is to happen next. Easy to read and follow. I like the fact that it brings back memories from many years ago. Woolworths, painting toenails (meaning you are not a lady),reading books our parents would not let us read (True Confessions). It makes me laugh as it brings back pleasant memories of a time when life was simple. You would have to be over 50, I believe to appreciate it. Although what happened to Hannah and the choices her friends make is questionably, of whether they did the right thing at the time. The 3 different characters could be my best friends or sisters; each one grows up to be very different. You can feel the jealousy between Jeanne and Hannah.Hannahs wanting a baby to take care because her own kids are teenagers, or perhaps she is middle age. Not sure I like her husband. You can relate to what friendship is and what marriage is after many years. Feels like true to life situations. Can't wait to get some of her other books."},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"i was very disappointed in the writing of this book. the characters were shallow and immature and very self absorbed..the story was boring and just didn't seem to go anywhere.

This book takes 3 women and examines a friendship that lasted over time. My mom always told me that if you can look back on your life and count three true friends, one of course being your husband, then you are truly blessed.

I have to say I thought it extremely dull and boring. It took me 3/4 of the book to even keep apart who each of the characters were and what their life was like. I would of much enjoyed reading the book on what happened in their lives after the accident... and skipped the whole adult part altogether. The only part that I did enjoy was reading about life in Santa Clara, CA. I grew up there and I found myself picturing all of the places I frequented as they were explaining their lives. I pictured Bluegang as our own neighborhood creek that was forbidden for all of the neighborhood children to go. That made it even more appealing and exciting. I found myself wanting to go back there and be in that world again. The author has a definate knowledge of life in the bay area, just by the way she could describe a day by the unique weather. For that reason only I give the book 2 stars. Keep shopping!"},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"Three friends, Hannah, Jeanne and Liz, come together in the same small town 30 years after a traumatic incident which occurred during their lives at age 12.

I'll admit I have had it in my to-be-read pile for over a year, but that was due to my own life being busy with other things. I read this book in three days, when lately, it has been taking me a week or so to read a book of the same size.The characters felt so real to me and I enjoyed it immensely. I did expect a slightly different ending, but, I think the most important gain was the insight into how everyone's life is shaped and how they mold it into their own, with age.I think Campbell is an extremely talented writer and I hope to read more of her work soon."},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"What I liked most about WILDWOOD was the women themselves: Hannah, Liz and Jeanne. Their upscale California lifestyles seemed real to me, not ya-ya, and so did their problems and I felt like I knew them and wanted to find out if their long friendship was going to survive the truth. Women's friendships are hard to write about realistically but I think this author did a good job. Another thing I liked was that Hannah, Jeanne and Liz were trying to be good friends, loving parents, wives etc, but they made mistakes like real people do so resentment and grudges and forgiveness became issues between them and part of what the book is about. The writing is good, sometimes really good. The arguments about abortion were important.I wish I belonged to a book group because there's lots to think and talk about in WILDWOOD."},{"Title":"Wildwood","review":"Wildwood was one of those books you can get into and really identify with the characters.

The modest skill requirements of no. 20 encourage the deeply emotional musician in the intermediate player, while the demands of no. 8 celebrate virtuosity. No. 16 indulges in stormy bombast, whereas no. 7 unabashedly embraces simple sentimentalism. The harmonic advances of the nineteenth century are explored in no. 9, while broad melody comes to the fore in no. 6.

The tonal clarity and simplicity of no. 3 are balanced by the complexity and, in some passages, virtual atonality of no. 14.

Janice Young Brooks creates a very believable portrait of Victorian gentry, and the travel chapters in the novel are simply fascinating, and very well researched I might add. The Beecham's are a family you will want to get in touch with again and again. Don't shy away from the listing of &quot;romance novel&quot; it's worthy of a much more distinguished categorical identity.~Rosemary for Remembrance~"},{"Title":"Cinnamon Wharf","review":"I just finished \\"Cinnamon Wharf\\" and I think that the publishers are really missing out by not reprinting these wonderful hard to find classics by Janice Young Brooks. I devoured this book in one day - something I haven't been doing a lot of lately with more popular authors. Now, I would say that \\"Cinnamon Wharf\\" doesn't quite live up to \\"Guests of the Emporer\\" or \\"Seventrees\\" in my heart. However, it is still a novel of a caliber that is hard to find. I can still taste the salty air of the waves crashing against the cliffs at Castlemere and smell the Rosemary. The characters come alive, they are so three dimensional that I got lost in the book. They felt more like friends than fictional characters. I know it sounds cliche but I laughed out loud, I cried with them... I felt like a fly on the wall of a wonderful life. If you can find this novel it is well worth it!"},{"Title":"Cinnamon Wharf","review":"The story first begins in 1927, as Natalie Beecham has been called to attend her grandmother Mary on her deathbed, and Mary has some family history to impart to her granddaughter before it's too late. Flashback to 1859 at Castlemere, the home of the Beecham family who have a centuries long history in the spice trade as Beecham heir George finds a very ill Mary abandoned on their doorstep. Once she's recovered, George is somewhat flummoxed to find that Mary is the result of an affair he had with a former governess (she'd disappeared and he was told she had died in childbirth). With no sign of her mother, George and his Aunt Nell take red-headed, bright and oh-so full of life Mary under their wing (much to the chagrin of his wife and domineering mother) and he eventually adopts her and raises her alongside his legitimate daughter Hester.Several years later, their cousin Alex from the Singapore side of the family comes to England to attend school and for young Mary it is love and devotion at first sight, although the older Alex just sees her as a charming minx to be petted and played with. Alex and Mary eventually meet again when her father brings both his daughters to visit him and his wife in Singapore, where Mary must accept the fact that Alex loves another and she must move on (or does she?). On their return to England, Mary's life takes plentiful twists and turns, but you know what? That's all I'm going to tell you.I enjoyed this a lot, especially the bits where we got to see Mary using her noggin and thinking (how refreshing), as well as seeing a woman in Victorian England actually getting a say in and running a business instead of just staying at home and breeding babies. This is a novel that's hard to pigeon-hole, since the characters aren't involved in real historical events I can't quite call it historical fiction, but despite Mary and Alex's relationship (can't tell you much without spoiling), I wouldn't classify it as a romance either (if you're expecting sex you will be sorely disappointed). There really isn't a whole lot of action, the story is more character driven and despite the promises on the jacket Mary spends more time at home with family than she does in the family's spice warehouse. That said, I love the way the author could set her scenes, especially the jungles and rainforests of Malaysia (I'll pass on the snakes, thankyouverymuch). While I'm not normally fond of a flash-back alternating POV format, it worked well with this story, especially at the end that wraps up a lot of loose ends without having epilogue stamped on the last chapter's forehead. A wee bit soap-opera-ish and not quite a saga, it still was a highly entertaining read and I plan on hunting down more of this author's books in the near future. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"The haunted earth (Lancer books)","review":"A clever, rollicking little mixed genre number that would be selling like hotcakes if it was new on the shelves.

Dygard writes a lot of sports action adventure books for people from teens to adults.Dygard is known for his game descriptions and his ability to build suspense, mainly through dialogue. In Tournament Upstart, Dygard does a nice job using tons of dialogue to set up characters, setting, and plot. I love good sports stories that relate to sports I play, and let me tell you, I definitely love this book. It just makes you want to keep on reading.The setting that Dygard uses for most of the story is in the arena at Talbott State University for the tournament. Dygard telling us about them sets up all the characters. The whole story is about this small team who is normally in division 2, trying to make it in division 1. They play tough teams and go through some troubles because this new kid is on the team who came from a big city and is not used of the small town. They try to come together and play basketball as a team and try to win the division 1 tournament. Of course you almost fall off your chair when you read the ending, because all of his books make you do that at the end."},{"Title":"TOURNAMENT UPSTART","review":"Yes Tournament Upstart was a pretty good book if you ask me, but it could have been better. There were very heart warming parts in this book, but there were also parts that left me wondering what was going on. I liked the story about them off the court, but I thought the game scenes could be a little more discriptive. Now and then I thought the writer didn't know what he was talking about. There were times in some of the games were I was lost and confused (might just be me). The reason I read the book was to get some good basketball action like the state tournament around here, and I didn't get any out of this book. The games weren't described in enought detail for me (again probably just me). There were many times I felt there was something familiar about the story (anyone seen the movie Hoosiers?), the coach's motivational speeches were just a little familiar. This is what kept me from really liking the book but all in all it was alright."},{"Title":"TOURNAMENT UPSTART","review":"When I first started reading Tournament Upstart I tought it was going to be a book only about basketball. The more I read the more there were other things then basketball. It talked a lot about a kid on the basketball team that was trying to fit in, but had a hard time. They Falcons (the main team in the story)are a small school team, but their new coach thinks they are better then to just play in the B bracket, like they always do. So he signs them up for the A bracket everyone in the little town was angry they thaught he was going to embarrass them. When they got to the big school where the tournament was going to be held they were stund, because all the teams had brand new jersys, the best shoes, and fashonable hair cuts. They're first game was going to be against the last years champs, the Trojans. They played great and won, no one could beleive it. They also won their next game. That ment that they were going to play in the championship game. I wont tell you if they won or not I want you to read the book and find out. The reason I rated this book a four out five is it was really exciting and kept me at the edge of my seat when I read it. The reason why it wasn't a five is sometimes it got a bit too discreptive. Other then that I thaught it was a great book and you should read it."},{"Title":"Research Methods","review":"This is the sixth edition, which means that the still probably useful fifth and previous editions are now good for landfill duty. The price is hefty. (Why don't textbook publishers offer financing?) That said, this is a usable book, one that the reader might be tempted not to sell after class is over. The research and statistics chapters are well-written and placed in logical order. The material is comprehensive, and strikes a nice balance between not being too technical without being too elementary. What appealed to me was the by-the-numbers approach, with numerous lists embedded in the text throughout. (For example, if there are seven factors to consider in reference to the internal validity of a research design, they are boxed off and numbered, after being discussed in the text.) The book comes with a disk containing a 1996 general survey of social science issues. This is provided by way of example, and is referenced at the end of most chapters as a real-world example and 'how to' guide to research methedology and design. Nonetheless, you can do as I did, and read without using the disk (I used it once), and still come away with complete understanding. This book is also free of the filler that crowds and obscures useful information in the garden variety textbook. This book would have gotten five stars, had it not been for the authors' annoying habit of using liberal examples. In a social science research text, reference to politically sensetive issues is to be expected. What annoys is that virtually every example, whether derived from real life, or an admittedly ficticous example, is given a liberal slant. If the factors being researched are education and political orientation, then liberalism correlates with higher education (read: conservatives are dummies). If the subject is nominal variables, the example is party affiliation in a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans two-to-one. In other words, the examples serve the standard orthodoxies of our time. Don't expect to see any on race and abortion, or the use of guns to deter crime. That said, since the main users of this book are college students, and as such are getting much heavier doses of campus radicalism and causes du jour, this book's bias is relatively mild. If you are going to study research methodologies, you could do much worse than this text. -Lloyd Conway"},{"Title":"Research Methods","review":"I highly recommend this book to any social science researcher, not just the beginners intended as the primary audience.

The author presents concepts in graphic way with vivid details of research examples and illustrating live logic of field. Thou good researcher could be only with practices, it will be good to have some touch of real logic of concept in real field2. the author put the system over various methods like observation, survey, interview etc with the logic of causation. This is why this book begins research design part with experiment which is rarely used in social sciences except psychology. Experiment is not practical one in social sciences but it's the model of all other research methods for its design meets all the condition of causation.

(I refuse to even consider that Hamlet or Shylock never lived.) Robert Blumenfeld's new book gives us a history of psychology and how it can be applied to creating many-layered characters; even more fascinating, he delves into specific interpretations of many great characters, and the psychology he himself used when portraying the Marquis of Queensberry in the off-Broadway long-run, complex drama, \\"The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde.\\"This is a book about not saying lines as an actor, or writing scenes as a novelist, but portraying the deepest soul of a character, no matter how short the role may be. Doing this is a great joy, and will make the audience member, or casting director, or reader sit up slowly in their seat and find themselves rapt with attention, listening to the endless reverberations under every word and gesture before them.Keep this book on your shelf and consult it often!"},{"Title":"Tools and Techniques for Character Interpretation: A Handbook of Psychology for Actors, Writers, and Directors","review":"Tools And Techniques For Character Interpretation: A Handbook Of Psychology For Actors, Writers, And Directors by New York actor, dialect coach, and writer, Robert Blumenfeld is an informed and informative study of the interpretive science of psychology and the methodical analysis of acting and character interpretation on stage or before cameras. Presenting a superbly written instruction manual on the performance art of acting, Tools And Techniques For Character Interpretation provides readers with a thematically appropriate interpretation of the great psychologists Freud, Klein, and Jung, as well as a practical understanding of the applications of psychological analysis in acting. Tools And Techniques For Character Interpretation is to be given high praise and strong recommendation for all aspiring or practicing actors, directors and screenwriters for its remarkable coverage of the psychology involved with the art of acting.

It may sound like a difficult topic for a children's book but the author does a marvolous job. The bright colors change the typical pachyderm to look like pop art effect from the 1960's. The story is a moving one but the illustrations are what make the book a true gem.A great gift for children of all ages."},{"Title":"The Tree That Grew to the Moon","review":"A young girl and her mother take turns imagining what might happen after the girl rescues a seedling from the street in front of her Brooklyn apartment. Reviving the tree serves as a balm to their imaginations, as they fantasize about the tree growing up, out, and below their apartment. Hence, the title, The Tree that Grew to the Moon.Each fantasy scenario is excellently illustrated and the story moves briskly to the point the girl decides it would be better to plant the tree outdoors. This decision conjures up a new wave of imaginary depictions about how the tree will bring joy to the neighborhood.Eugenie Fernandes, who is both author and illustrator, crafts a sweet tale that is not condescending or cloaked in some sort of lesson. Her vivid color illustrations reward those who look carefully, making this book fun to read with your favorite youngster."},{"Title":"The Tree That Grew to the Moon","review":"This is a book with brightly colored illustrations that shows the imaginings of a little girl and her mother as they discuss the tree seedling that the little girl finds wilting on a hot summer day in Brooklyn. There's nothing particularly interesting about the story. It's a conversation between two people who are enjoying topping each other's &quot;tall tale&quot; type of ideas for the tree's future. It would be a sweet thing to observe in real life because of the warm-hearted spontaneity it would require but when it's transferred to paper it becomes stilted. The pictures are each lively and bright but there is little to distinguish one picture from the next. Not a bad book, just not a good book."},{"Title":"60 People to Avoid at the Water Cooler","review":"I started off with high hopes for this book. The pictures were funny and the title promising. I had just finished \\"Food Court Druids, Cherohonkees and Other Creatures Unique to the Republic\\" and was in the mood for more character sketches.

It costs $10 and you put it on the back of your tiolet and flip through it once in a while! Lighten up, or write something better if it's really bothering you that much. It sounds like there's someone out there with a personal agenda to write these kind of reviews. I see them all over amazon. What's the point? Either contribute to the culture yourself, or just shut up about it, put the book down, and read something else.By the way, I've never met this author or any of his friends.

A Book of Women's Poetry from Around the World","review":"Ain't I a Woman was not a surprise to me. It is full of beautiful works of art. This book is full of voices of many different women, with different lives, different backgrounds but from their voices you can feel their strength and each voice in that book can add to your self-esteem and make you feel stronger about yourself as a women with every poem. Although some poems are not as powerful as others, their messages are still there: &quot;I lived, I saw, I loved, I struggled, I died, but most importantly I felt, felt what life was like and from my words you might learn how it really is to be a woman&quot;. This book should be read by anyone who has time get lost in its poetry. I personally read a piece of the book everyday at work and I am glad that I made the time. There are many different writers in this book and I recommend reading different works from those authors as well."},{"Title":"Ain't I A Woman! A Book of Women's Poetry from Around the World","review":"This book obtains its title from Sojourner Truth's incomparable speech in 1851, and for the most part is brilliant and moving. My main complaint is that it focuses on the physical (sex, childbirth, etc.) so much that it could be classified as erotic poetry instead of a full exploration of womanhood. However, look for amazing cultural and chronological diversity in authors, and refreshing humor in poems like &quot;Sho nuff.&quot; The development of the book is thematic, according to stages of life by also by subject. Series show different visions of famous women such as Jezebel, Cleopatra, and Medusa, which ends with a hilarious conversation between Medusa and Eve. The poems in this collection really strike - not everyone will like everything, but I'm sure everyone will find SOMETHING in here that really gets their attention. My personal favorite is &quot;Witch.&quot; There are dozens of poems in here, enough to make the book seem very long, but since no poem is longer than two pages, I garantee you won't get bored."},{"Title":"Ain't I A Woman! A Book of Women's Poetry from Around the World","review":"This is one of the best anthologies of poetry I've ever found. The purpose: Bring together words from women of all cultures, all ages, all corners of the world. Here are young women, old women, fat women, starving women, lives touched by peace, war, spiritual joy, physical abuse, passion, motherhood, loss. There are beautiful, haunting words here. There are cold, hard, brutal images here. If you're a woman who complains about feminists, please read this book and try to understand what women have had to go through so that you could be where you are today: free to complain. If only to have a copy of Sojourner Truth's immortal &quot;Ain't I a Woman?&quot; speech from 1852, this book would be worth the price. Read this book for the incredible messages here. You will be moved."},{"Title":"Ain't I A Woman! A Book of Women's Poetry from Around the World","review":"The poetry in &quot;Ain't I A Woman&quot; presents a wide range of experience and emotion. This is not a book of pretty poems. It is a series of moans, cries and hurrahs from the heart.

I like this book very much."},{"Title":"Ain't I A Woman! A Book of Women's Poetry from Around the World","review":"What a wonderful collection of women poets!

From the get-go, Keirsey leads you down the pathways of temperament and character, using the Myers-Briggs Temperament Indicator (MBTI) as a tool.The explanations are not only succinct, but exhaustive on why you behave the way you behave. He relates modern temperament with Jungian ideas, Platonian, and Socratic personality types.I have nothing but good things to say about this book, and today even 3 years after reading it, I find myself going back to it again and again to gleen new information both about me and the people around me.This book opens up a wonderful doorway to character and temperament and now its up to you to step through!-Cheers"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Who would make your best mate?

Well, are you extroverted or introverted; thinking or feeling; judging or percieving; use intuition or sensation? The unique combination of these four types forms your personality. Discovering this is a very affirming experience. Suddenly the decisions you have made--wrong or right--make sense in light of who you are. You don't need to read this book from cover to cover; instead you'll find yourself skipping from page to page and section to section.

Once we figured out the type of question, she read to me the very detailed descriptions the book provides.I usually am not into these types of things, but I will say this book is so accurate it is almost creepy. For example, the books states that people with my personality type tend to be accountants. I am an accounting major looking to do auditing or some other financial jobs that were listed in the book for my personality type.Besides the career aspects, many other aspects, such as love and life roadblocks you could say, were very accurate from this book. I tried this test on other family and friends and it is just as accurate on their lives.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand more about others or themselves. If you have any more questions about the book, drop a comment by and I'll answer you in a timely manner."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I tend to be very skeptical of any book that smacks of 'self help,' but &quot;Please Understand Me&quot; has been one of my most frequently referred-to books ever since I bought my first copy five years ago. I don't ordinarily push books onto friends and family, but somehow or other I can never keep myself from INSISTING that others read--and, most importantly--USE it.I've always known I'm a kook, but never really understood why. I took the Kiersey Temperament Sorter in the front of the book, and found that I am split between INTP and INTJ, two of the rarest personality types. Most of my family members are SPs and SJs--small wonder they think I'm a wacko! And no wonder I kept thinking they were uptight, or lacking in imagination. No wonder they don't get my jokes (which are not really jokes--and if you don't get that, you need to read this book &lt;laughs&gt;).The light &quot;Please Understand Me&quot; has cast on my relationships with my family and friends has been of inestimable benefit. Sure, my ESTP father drives me nuts, but now I understand why, and it allows me to step back and say, &quot;that's how he is--consider this before tearing off on a rant, will you?&quot; It also helps me understand why I am so close to my INFP kid sister, but fought constantly with an ISTJ ex-boyfriend. By understanding how the different types relate to the world and the people around them, it is easier to understand why they behave as they do. It becomes easier to be more compassionate. Rather than lashing out in irritation and frustration because I assume I know why someone is acting the way he or she does, I can use what I know about the Myers-Briggs types and try to see the world through that person's eyes. Some very problematic relationships have been profoundly changed for the better, as a result.I recently bought &quot;Please Understand Me II,&quot; and recommend it as a companion volume; it expands on the ideas here, and is gives more in-depth analysis of the types, but this is really where you should start if you're interested in Myers-Briggs. If you're stuck at Christmastime, wondering what to get your family members, maybe you could give everyone a copy of this book. Get them to take the personality test, and compare notes--especially with people you've never really gotten along with. What better gift than mutual understanding?"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I am an INTJ, and always wondered why everyone wasn't like me. Well, it turns out that I make up less than 1% of the population, and this book was a great help in helping people to understand me, but also in giving me the information I need to realize that everyone is different, and everyone needs to be understood in a different manner. What might make total sense to an INTJ, might really hurt someone else's feelings. And getting passionate about an illogical point in an arguement completely backfires when dealing with someone like me.Everyone is different, and this books helps to at least start defining those differences into 16 general personality types. Now, there is still a ton of differences within a single type, but getting to 1 of 16 is a great start at dealing with those around you, as well as giving them some insight into your personality as well."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Keirsey's explanation of the different temperaments was a real eye-opener for me. Finally I understand why people get upset with certain of my character traits, and why I always felt so misunderstood by some people. It was a big relief to know that after all, I'm &quot;normal&quot;, and so are the others. Where there used to be resentment on my or the others' part, we now knowingly smile at each other, saying &quot;ah, there shows your J again, can't help it, can you?&quot;Keirsey introduces us to four basic opposite tendencies in temperament, then describes the temperaments, and applies this to the areas of relationships, work, children, and learning.The book starts with a questionnaire that you can take to determine your type. I would strongly advise not to just read the part about your own type, though. The real aha effect comes when you read about the others, too. You won't even need everyone to take the test, you'll know just by what you've read what types you're dealing with. It's fun to realize our differences and see them in a new light."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Here is a rarity, a system of personality types that resists &quot;putting people in boxes&quot;. While there are descriptions of each of the sixteen types, they are general descriptions that leave plenty of room for individual deviations. I personally like this system of personality types more than the Enneagram for just that reason: while it is more superficial, it is less limiting.The purpose of this book is not only for self-discovery; it is also in order to appreciate the wide range of personality differences that exist. Less than illustrating personality types, the book focuses on general tendencies, thereby making it possible for two people to be the same type, and still be entirely different.The book does have its down sides, though. While the system is interesting and the book is anything but dry, it is written more like an outline than an actual book. When I finished the book, I felt dissatisfied; it touches on each subject briefly, only scratching the surface. The reader is left with a very general idea of the system, but little beyond that.Another drawback is the &quot;compatibility&quot; fiasco. In this book Keirsey posits that people are happiest when they marry their diametrical opposites--for example an INFP is advised to seek out an ESTJ. Never mind that this ensures that there is no common ground whatsoever, which one would suppose to be somewhat necessary. Luckily Keirsey clears this up in the sequel, and changes his thesis to the idea that people are most compatible when there is a combination of similarity and complementarity. But someone who does not read the sequel could end up seriously confused!I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a book that explores human nature, with the caveat that it be taken with a healthy grain of salt, and that the sequel is necessary for a full understanding. ..."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I'll try to keep it short- the negative reviewers must not have really read this incredible book. I read it in 1980 while in college and found out the reason why I always felt like an &quot;alien&quot; in grade school even though I was popular. Reading about my ENTP temperament finally allowed me to appreciate parts of myself and not compare myself to all my SJ and SP friends! It even made me appreciate a family member that before I thought I'd never get along with. I mistook her non-verbal personality as hostile- then she took the test and I found out she was an ISFP- I felt like I was looking into her very (artistic) soul as I read the words that described her exactly. Now I value her deeply. I've given this book to many friends who all agree with me that above any other &quot;self helper&quot; none other even comes close to the insight this offers.

It helps in career direction, understanding roadblocks in school and in personal relationships and it is particularly useful in dealing with work relationships. I find it invaluable as a framework for seeing situations from the viewpoints of others and to give me the courage to accept my own views even when they are not the same as the views of my colleagues.

It is fairly simple to understand. One is either introverted or extroverted. One looks at the world through one's senses, or through intuition. One evaluates the world through thought, or through feelings. One prefers the world either structured, or open-ended. Each of these preferences can be mild, moderate, or intense, and the way the four preferences can be combined creates 16 personality types. Yet, with variations in intensity, there is ample room to understand the true range of human personality.\\"Please Understand Me\\" and \\"Please Understand Me II\\" are two completely different books, not an original and updated version of the same book. \\"Please Understand Me\\" covers the basics, understanding what each letter means, and the way they combine. \\"Please Understand Me II\\" is a detailed description of each of the 16 personality types, carefully structured to allow easy comparison. It would be difficult to understand for anyone not already familiar with the Briggs-Meyers personality type system from \\"Please Understand Me\\" or another basic book.While the \\"Please Understand Me\\" system can be interesting as a means of self-analysis, it is most useful when turned outwards, as a way of understanding the people around you, and as a way of planning your actions for maximum effectiveness.For example, when planning a party, it can be easy to slip into planning only the types of activities that you like. But your guests will be of all personality types. So consider - the extrovert's may love a loud dance floor, but the introverts will need a quite space to recharge now and then. Sensing types will love the stimulation of good food, good music, etc. Intuitive types may want a space to chat. Judging types will want an idea of what to expect, perceiving types will want room for spontaneity. So invite a few SJ's to show up early and help set up. Let the SP's bring some excitement. The NFs will love making sure everyone feels pampered and appreciated. And the NTs will be ready to understand any possible crisis, and solve any technical problem that may arise.This is not a way of ranking personal development through \\"stages,\\" or of telling you what you should be. It is a way of understanding the world for what it is, and people for what they are. At times it can seem almost ruthlessly pragmatic, such as when discussing leadership types, and how to lead different types of people. Yet it can also be idealistic, seeing the role of a leader as one of understanding and inspiring followers, and the importance of appreciating people in a way that matters to the person being appreciated."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I think the best way to learn about a book is to see some examples. There are sixteen types, with eight letters, and the following two types provide the words that go with the eight letters:INFJ=Introvert Intuititive Feeler JudgerESTP=Extravert Senser Thinker Perceiver1. NFs (intuitive feelers) often report more pleasure in anticipation of romance than in consummation of it. They hold out for the possiblity of a perfect relationship, and some will work hard to create it.2. SJs (sensing judgers) are very responsible, and willing to sacrifice a great deal to meet their responsiblities. They're the nurturers of society's traditional, respected institutions (churches, schools, civic organizations, etc.) They like order and predictability in home life, and are often very good employees.3. SPs (sensing perceivers) are adventurous, spontaneous, and often end up married to SJs. They and SJs outnumber all the Ns three to one.4. NTs (intuitive thinkers) are driven, intelligent, concerned with mastery, and often seem emotionally aloof. They hate to state the obvious or seem redundant, therefore, expressions of affection will not come often, because their commitment is already established.5. Children who are Ns like stories that have a lot of fantasy and metaphor. They like to hear or read the same stories over and over. Children who are Ss (most children seem like Ss because of their need for action) like action stories with plot progressions and straightforward meanings, and like new stories rather than the same ones over and over.6. Is (introverts) are slower to learn, but learn more deeply, and think things over at length. They're slower to learn social skills and slower to approach new things or people. Es (extraverts) have an easier time socially. They outnumber introverts three to one, and are more favored in our society, which encourages gregarious, social behavior. (In Japan, I've read, introverts are more popular than extraverts.)7. Ss (sensors) are in the here-and-now. They observe their environments, remember facts, and they like straightforward language. Ns (intuitives) are dreamers, prefer their gut instincts and inner experiences, and are fascinated by ideas and fantasies or theories. They're often detatched from the factual world somewhat.8.

I have personally interpreted one-on-one more than 1,500 Indicators. Please Understand Me is the book I recommend all those who take the test to read first. It is simple. Well-formatted. To the point. Informative. Accurate. It is wonderful to see light bulbs come on in people's heads when they read about themselves through this book. Thank goodness for Keirsey and Bates who took the time to write this book! I recommend it highly for people who desire to learn about themselves. The most terrific thing is that the reading is not only simple, it's lots of fun!!Dr. P."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"+++++This easy-to-read book, by clinical psychologists David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates, is about character and temperament types. Character is the integration of all traits to yield a unified whole which reveals the nature or personality of a person. Temperament is an aspect of a person's general make-up characterized by dispositions toward particular patterns of behavior (for example, emotional reactions and mood shifts).The authors explain the purpose of their book:\\"The point of this book is that people are different from each other, and that no amount of getting after them is going to change them. Nor is there any reason to change them, because the differences are probably good, not bad.\\"The book begins by making the reader aware that there are four pairs of \\"dimensions of difference\\":(1) (Extroversion vs Introversion) or (E vs I)(2) (iNtuition vs Sensation) or (N vs S)(3) (Thinking vs Feeling) or (T vs F)(4) (Judging vs Perceiving) or (J vs P).All these dimensions are thoroughly explained. These are very important and form the basis of the entire book.There is a page in this book that summarizes these four dimensions. I suggest photocopying this page and keeping it for easy reference in order to get maximum benefit from the rest of the book.From these four pairs of dimensions of difference, it has been determined that there are four temperament types that consist of combinations of two of the above letters. For example, there are SPs (Sensation/Perceiving temperament). This is also called the \\"Dionysian\\" temperament. These temperament types are well explained.From these have emerged sixteen different personality or character types that consist of four letters each. For example, there is the INTJ (Introvert/iNtuition/Thinking/Judging). This type is also known as the \\"scientist.\\" In the appendix of the book, each of these sixteen types is discussed.The rest of the book has interesting chapters on mating & temperament, temperament in children, and temperament in leading.A feature of this book is that it enables you to determine your own character type. The reader does this by completing \\"The Keirsey Temperament Sorter\\" which consists of seventy questions. There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. (For those with some psychology background, this sorter is based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test.)Finally, there is a second version of this book that has much more psycho-babble. This book has no psycho-babble and is easy to follow.In conclusion, read this book to understand why people are different from each other and why that's OK!(first published 1978; 5 chapters; main narrative of 170 pages; appendix; bibliography)+++++"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I highly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in better understaning themselves and those around them. It is easy to use, very detailed, and positively focussed. As a social worker I have used this both with clients in a professional setting, and personally with friends and family. The keys in this book help break down communication barriers, and shed light on interpersonal difficulties that perhaps have not been able to be explained before for many. It celebrates individuality, offers constructive criticism in an easy-to-swallow way, and offers understanding of an individual in all areas of their life (general, professional, family etc.). For more indepth coverage, I recommend pairing it with Please Understand Me II. HIGHLY recommend using with teenagers, as a means for understanding them, helping them understand themselves, and positively framing and shaping their developing temperments. Also a gReAT pre-marital tool! Most highly recommended for anyone.

Although the book is about the Myers-Briggs Temperament Scale, and that scale is a very informative method to learn about the personalities of yourself and others, I was more enraptured with the writing itself.The language was so descriptive and so rich with metaphor and simile, that I felt I was reading an Anne Rice novel. It is a style of writing that mesmerizes me.Since no other reviewer even mentioned the exquisite writing style, I felt an obligation to do so.As for the Myers-Briggs Temperament Scale, here is my very brief explanation of it (after reading it about 15 years ago).There are four temperaments: E-I, S-N, T-F, J-P.E = extrovert. I = introvert. About 75% of the population are E (extroverts).S - sensible. N = intuitive. About 75% of the population are S (sensible).T = thinking. F = feeling. The population is split about 50%-50% on this temperament.J = judgmental. P = perceptive (I think?). The population is split about 50%-50% on this temperament.However, the descriptions can be misleading.Although Extrovert and Introvert are what you would think, Sensible does not mean you have sense. Rather, it means you live completely in the real world, and can't imagine things being much different than what they are. In contrast, the iNtuitive person has a much richer imagination and thinks of the real world as only one of many possible worlds.Thinking and Feeling also mean about what you would expect. The Thinking person is not very empathetic though. The Feeling person can be influenced by his/her emotions.Finally, the Judgemental person is judgemental, but also responsible. In contrast, the Perceptive person is more care-free, but can be irresponsible.There are four temperaments and two choices for each, making a total of 16 possible types.Most heavy readers (and thinkers) are probably Introverts who are also iNtuitives with rich imaginations.That is why it is no surprise to find so many INXX people giving reviews even though they constitute only about 1% of the population.Oh, and by the way, I have taken the Myers-Briggs Test three times. The first time, I was an INTP. Years later, I took it again, and found I was an INTJ. Over a decade later, I (unkowingly) took a different version of the test, and found that I was an INFJ.These discrepancies should not lead one to conclude that the test results can fluctuate wildley over time, because they actually don't. I just happen to be on the borderline between the T-F and between the J-P.And when I read the different descriptions, they all seemed to fit my personality quite well (whereas the ESJP, for example, did not fit my personality at all)."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"so this book may take a while to do the test, but when you find out your personality you can really help yourself in ways. i am an intp, described as an architect. i didnt know what to do with my self and after i read this book i decided to become an architect, making a lot of money!!!"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"An easy to read and understand explanation of why some things appeal to us and others don't. This is a must read for anyone that supervises or leads people.Robert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"\\"Please Understand Me\\" was for me-- as it has been for many people-- the first book I read that treated the idea of \\"Personality Typing\\" with something other than \\"Academic Textbook Dryness.\\" I first read the book in the mid-1980's, and have referred back to it many times while reading books dealing with other methods of personality typing.Although it has since been updated and expanded in Keirsey's subsequent \\"Please Understand Me II\\", this original version remains a highly relevant and useful book for anyone interested in understadning more about themselves, and those around them.Keirsey's Temperament Theory is loosely based on C.G.Jung's early work on personality types, as well as the widely used Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) system. This book provides readers with a 70-item \\"self test,\\" and then goes on to outline some of the principles and history behind determining type. Keirsey explains the four \\"basic\\" temperaments: Dionysian, Epimethean, Promethean and Apollonian, from which all other subgroups are derived-- 16, in all.Once explained, he moves on to cover the impact of type on \\"mate selection,\\" children and parenting, as well as leadership and work. Finally, there is a very LONG appendix which contains detailed \\"Portraits\\" of each of the 16 personality types, using the same 4-letter designations as the Myers-Briggs system. Although many people are introduced to personality inventories in a work setting, they really provide a useful \\"roadmap\\" to self-understanding in many *other* aspects of life.A large part of my liking of this book is not merely due to the concise and easy-to-understand coverage of typology, but also due to Keirsey's call for a change in the way we view people and personality. Instead of the conventional (at the time the book was published, 1978) attitude that you could \\"change\\" yourself into any type of personality you wanted to be (the so-called \\"Pygmalion Project\\"), we should instead just accept, and work with, the basic traits and differences we were born with.Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks) for anyone seeking a basic understanding of Personality Theory. Provides some interesting insights for both the casual and serious student of personality type. Fairly easy to read, although a bit \\"stiff\\" at times.Thanks for reading!--Peter (an INFJ)"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"If you're looking for who you are, and how to deal with others, this book will give you insight on how to do it.Check it out.ENTP here!"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I'm far from a feminist, but the language is very dated and irritating.

Most of us answer questions as we prefer to see ourselves and not as we truly/innately are designed.Anyone interested in type would benefit from following Niednagel's research.

There are no references to experiments and the concepts lack precision and an evolutionary psychological framework. There is no reason given to believe such \\"character types\\" exist.Those who take the test at the beginning of this book and think the indicated character type describes them are advised to consider a few points. First, the descriptions are suffciently imprecise and flattering that I imagine most people might think more than a few fit. Try testing someone you know and then telling them they are a different type than the score suggests and see how close they think the fit is. Second, if these character types represent some sort of unchanging fundamental nature, why do so many score in such a way as to fit very different character types? This has certainly been true of me. Third, there is no reason to be confident that any evaluation of yourself based on everyday anecdotal experience should give you any confidence that you have a basis for a detailed analysis of something as complex as \\"character.\\" This book completely ignores fundamental issues regarding how the brain works and the mathematics of an approach/withdrawl motivational system. It also ignores learning theory entirely.Those interested in character and temperamental differences should look to research on attitudes with regard to risk, for example. Whether one is risk-averse, risk-seeking, or risk-neutral has important implications for how incentives and punishment motivate how one learns and makes decisions. Try Choices, Values, and Frames, edited by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. The former won a Nobel prize in economics for his work on human cognitive biases and his prospect theory, which seeks to account for nonlinear utility with respect to outcomes of linear absolute magnitude.There is such a thing as scientific, mathematical psychology with highly testable hypotheses and theories regarding the relationships of variables that can be objectively measured."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"&quot;Please Understand Me&quot; is an excellent book that walks you through your personal characteristics.

The reason this was so was because it was able to reveal things about myself that I had never been able to get any sort of reasonable hypothesis about before. There were aspects of my personality and my overall life story that just didn't make sense to me. After learning about the four temperments, SP, SJ, NT, and NF, these aspects made a lot more sense to me. I think this is the biggest value of the book. It can allow for understanding of yourself that is hard to come by in any other way. I will leave it to others to debate the question of whether this taxonomy of personality is correct. For me, it doesn't necessarily have to be provably correct. It is only necessary that it be reasonable and that it has some clear explanatory benefit, which I believe this theory does. The fact that it has been used in so many venues gives an indication of how many believe it to be useful.The book itself does a good job of explaining the four temperments and some of the ways that these temperments then influence us in various venues, including school, work, and our love lives. While it does a good job in describing and then examining the consequences of the four temperments, I believe it does not do as good a job with the sixteen Myers-Briggs types. The section describing the potential mating matchups between various types seems to be pulled out of thin air. In addition, there is no taking into account the fact that there is not an even distribution of the types. So, for instance, if an ESTJ wanted to get together with an INFP, it would be hard, simply because ESTJs are 13% of the population while INFPs are only 1% of the population. The appendix which describes the characteristics of each of the 16 types is better, but still seems to make many extrapolations that don't seem reasonable. In addition, the connection that the book makes between the four temperments and the 16 types is not clearly drawn. At the end of the appendix, there is some statement that the four SP types are all in the SP temperment and have that commonality, but there are still great differences described between the SP types that would seem not to follow from their common grounding in the SP temperment.Other than this problem, though, the book lays out its basic premise well, is quite readable, and is short enough to get to the basic points quickly enough so that you do not lose the overall theme in a blizzard of detail.In conclusion, this book, while having, in my opinion some flaws, is still quite worthy of its status as one of the classic books in the field of personality and temperment types."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I ordered these books for a very picky friend as replacement copies, since hers were so old they were beginning to fall apart.

This book will help you figure out so many people in your life. Read it!"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I have been using the 16 types as an analytical social tool for over a decade, as taught by my Jungian-influenced father. The authors here do credit Jung at moments, but they tend to ignore, underestimate, or occasionally outright reject many Jungian principles in favour of other theories. These newer theories and analyses nearly always felt wrong to me, and didn't fit with my empirical understanding of those around me. For those who care, I'm an ENTJ (close to P).Written in the late 70s, the text also suffers from some rather outrageous ( to the modern, sexually liberated female reader, at least) sexism. Overall I found the section on mating habits and motivations to be wildly inaccurate, and far too forgetful of Jungian origins. According to the authors, types match up best with their polar opposites - I don't find this to be remotely true in reality, not does it make logical sense, so their explanations were painful to read. The insistence on outdated sexual mores (women don't care about orgasm, only want to please their men, are nearly always 'happiest in the home', and so on) riled me further. The dated approach towards sexuality in general came through so strongly in this section that I felt I gained almost nothing from reading it - not even a majority of it resonated with my own thoughts or logical analysis.I agree as well with other reviewers who have criticised the clumsiness of the mythological association and naming of the great 4 types (SP, SJ, NT, NF); I have a substantial background in Greek mythology, which one wouldn't expect from an average reader, and I still found that the approach added nothing, regardless of the power of long-held archtypes. If anything, these classical trappings cluttered what should have been a more systematic and clear-cut explanation of the types. Even had that occurred, I am not sure that looking at those four specific uber-types as being the most important distinctions is accurate. From what I know of Keirsey's revised theory, which splits the types further into 8 and looks at the middle two functions - I think that's a better approach, because in terms of being able to understand people and their motivations - N/S and T/F are by far the most important, in my experience. I/E and J/P are still important, of course, but describe actions more than the thought processes of individuals. If you wonder WHY not HOW, examine those middle modalities.The book was instructive in some ways, despite these flaws; in particular, I found the sections on temperaments in childhood and development very useful and accurate relative to my own observations and conclusions. I have observed that people who focus strongly on self-improvement - especially common in the N types, if we talk about IDENTITY rather than more tangible things like skills - can be difficult to type. I believe that some succeed so significantly in balancing themselves (Ts becoming more F, Fs becoming more T, etc, applied across all the modalities though much less commonly to the N/S trait) that they can appear as adults to be a type other than their 'natural' type.But there is a difference between your innate temperament, something I think is quite firm very early on, and the desire for another temperament. This can botch the questionnaires, too, if a subject answers questions in a way which reflects how he WISHES he were, instead of how he actually is.My point in bringing up these who grow away from their fundamental temperament: you can examine them as children (via memory or talking to parents and such) and retroactively better gauge their type. This information along with current questionnaire results should determine a solid base temperament.The sections on teaching children, learning styles in childhood, and management/team work in adulthood further helped to elucidate & explain one's temperament, with decent accuracy, precision and thoroughness. Again, the use of the 4 uber-types muddles these ideas to an extent, but not too much. I still found these parts useful. Most useful of all, however, were the initial breakdown of modalities in the first section, and the more in-depth Portraits of each of the 16th types in the last section. These are the most clear-cut and logically laid-out, and a strong majority of what I read resonated with truth. I changed my assessments of various people's types based on these two sections, and I feel I now have a better understand of the modalities themselves, as well as how they combine.My next goal is to pursue the earlier, Jungian analysis in formal textual detail, because I suspect I will find that much more useful and illuminating. Still, I learned something here, and I'll keep the book on hand for reference to the type Portraits. Even if flawed, I'm glad to have the extra data and different perspectives."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I really enjoyed this book and find myself thinking in terms of it still many years after having read it the first time. Unfortunately, the only people who are likely to get really taken by it are Keirsey's &quot;NF&quot;s, the people on a constant mission of self-discovery. The rest are, as Keirsey writes, not only disinterested in what makes them tick, but wholly unable to understand why NFs are so devoted to the search. In fact, if the book became popular among the other temperaments, it would almost serve to paradoxically prove the book wrong. (What would an extroverted SP be doing inside reading a psychology book instead of out playing extreme sports?)Keirsey's book adds to the basic Briggs-Meyers test a truly engrossing discussion of temperament groups, but his attempt to bring the whole thing into the world of business management strikes me as a somewhat offensive gross over-commercialization. Not that there isn't a strong place for understanding motivation in the workplace, it's just that the discussion adds unnecessary weight to a book more useful, I think, if kept in easily consulted handbook style. And I can't help but feel it was tacked on just to get the book onto business seminars' curriculum -- and we NFs don't like to feel like our search for ultimate truth is being exploited!The book is worth a look, though, for the test itself if nothing else. The test can be eye-opening if taken seriously (as the NFs will -- for awhile at least) and is at the very least fun even if approached in the most casual way... supermarket checkout line magazines have long made a living off people's enjoyment of &quot;testing&quot; themselves, their friends, and their mates. And if by accident we get a little deeper understanding into human interrelationships, that's got to be worth a few bucks, doesn't it?"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Keirsey and Bates have provided an excellent guide to understanding Myers-Briggs.

Work group participants are able to look behind the actions of fellow group members and begin to understand how they might be approached more effectively."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Reading the rest of the reviews, with the exception of a couple, the kinds of experiences people describe reading the book I can identify with, I recognize from my own experience--even the title, &quot;The Best Book with the Worst Title Ever&quot;. I could pull out phrases from here and there and share a knowing laughter with other reviewers because of the ways Keirsey and Bates' book provides a common ground of understanding between others and me. Because of this, if you can &quot;read between the lines&quot; of all the other reviews, then you will have the kind of personality type that will most benefit from reading this book.This book is life-changing, but most powerfully so for those who are &quot;intuitives&quot; by nature. It is life changing, because it has the power to validate your life experience in a way that no book (for me) before or since has. This, because it says, clearly and unequivocably, &quot;You are right that you felt alienated, isolated, estranged from everyone else. It wasn't because you are weird, but because your way of looking at the world occurs in only a fraction of the population.&quot; It will not tell you, &quot;You're right, and everyone else is wrong.&quot; It will tell you, &quot;The different ways of looking at things are not just differences of opinion that can be overcome by argument. They go straight to the heart of how we give value to things in the world, and so do not change easily, and then almost only always by violence to the self.&quot; I honestly can't say how this book is received by other types, specifically the S-types (who call themselves realists). All I can say is that reading this book took me miles and miles from my original (horrible) home of isolation, inarticulateness and estrangement, and also made it much more possible for me to accept and understand others. A more accurate appreciation of myself and others was, therefore, the first gift of the book. This gift from the book may very well be available for you, whether or not you buy the theory of personality typing, Keirsey and Bates' description of your type, or anything else in the book. It is no accident that almost all of the reviewers are Ns (even the grumpy ones).Personality type, as described by Keirsey and Bates, amounts to saying &quot;the way in which you perceive the world and assign value or meaning to it&quot;. This means that the very language in which we speak carries the weight of our personality type, language being a reflection of personality. For example, an extravert calls himself &quot;out-going&quot;; the introvert calls him &quot;overbearing&quot;. An introvert calls herself &quot;reserved&quot;; the extravert calls her &quot;unsociable&quot;. The labels arise because of the values encoded in personality; neither are absolutely right or wrong. Realizing this, one can then communicate more effectively, dropping loaded terms and adopting the ones that your listener receives favorably, instead of as an attack. Secretly, the extravert might mean &quot;unsocial&quot; when he refers to the introvert as &quot;reserved&quot;, but at least the remark won't spark an argument, and that five dollars he's trying to borrow will actually end up in his hand. My point here is that Keirsey and Bates' book not only says, &quot;Everyone is different&quot;, but also gives you the tools to work with and even often overcome that difference. They insist that no one fits each type perfectly, and that the process of individuation is one of differentiation from the type itself; it's not about pigeonholes or sizing people up at a glance. It's about being shown a bridge between differences that otherwise seem uncrossable. It also clues you in to the fact that no spoken word is innocent; each is fraught with the values of the person uttering it. Even if you want to take issue with the specifics of Keirsey and Bates' presentation of personality typing, if you think the whole thing is off-base, it doesn't change the book's value for emphasizing how difference in personality (however you describe it) results in difference in language (however you use it), and how to negotiate around and through that fact."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Well, okay, I didn't exactly read the entire book; I just came across it (a friend had it and was raving about it) and I've read about a third of the book. I'd agree with some other reviewer, who said that the book asks you about adjectives (ten times each, just in case you don't know the definition of an adjective) and then tells you what adjectives you chose. Yes, this is an oversimplification, but not by much... Those things that are not &quot;by definition&quot; true in the descriptions (there are some), are often not very well justified (instead the authors go about rephrasing the same things).However, the book was at least quite entertaining (more so than those silly &quot;tests&quot; in, um, Cosmo and such mags, I guess --- hopefully the authors have nothing to do with those...? ;-) and although not extremely profound (in the sense I described above), was not all that uninteresting.I'm also a bit lenient in my rating, since I haven't read it entirely.

The quiz at the beginning of the book, upon which the entire text is based, has all the scientific reliability of astrology. A few dozen questions, and each is phrased in such a vague manner as to lead the reader to wonder if they were written by a self-purporting psychic. Take for example the question:\\"Are you inclined to be: (A) somewhat reserved, or (B) easy to approach?\\"Well, if you asked me that yesterday when I was facing a huge deadline and under enormous pressure, some may say that I am definitely not easy to approach. Though other people, who are more helpful to achieving that deadline, may have said I am definitely easy to approach and not reserved in the least. Or, perhaps, my pet just died and I have no interest in talking to anyone. Essentially, these questions are able to assess the moment in which they are answered (if even that), and nothing more.

I discovered my own talents and began to see the talents that come with other personality types. I actually bought many copies of this book and asked my friends and family to read it.

That explained why both of us just weren't attracted to very many men or they to us. I always wondered by some women have 4 husbands and some none and 3) that you can understand others so much better if you understand their essential nature. Their experience of life is unique and valid for them just as yours is for you.Since then I have given this little test to many people when I worked as a counselor and recently gave it to my 17 year old son. Wow. First I hadn't changed in 20 years and second, when I first read my son's type I questioned the validity of the test but when I reflected on it further, it really freed me to understand him better.

Do you want to find out what makes people tick? &quot;Please Understand Me&quot; is a book about personality types and temperaments. These are the &quot;predisposition&quot; which often influence how those people in your life may act. Reading this book could give you a better understanding in dating and marital relationships, relationships with your children, and those with whom you work. I was first introduced to Keirsey and Bates' work during a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) training course. Information on psychological type and temperament in the Keirsey and Bates book is similar to that derived from the MBTI. Of particular interest is the matter of temperament, which in this book is an aggregation of similar personality types. The book includes the Keirsey Temperament Sorter (a personality test) together with instructions on how to score the instrument. You don't have to be professionally qualified to administer this test by the publisher of the instrument like you do with the MBTI.People are different, one from the other. Different people have varying strong and weak points in their personalities. An individual is the product of his or her personality or predisposition, upbringing and training, and environment. We need to celebrate and work together with the strengths of others. There should be no discrimination against people for personality type. We should emphasize the complementary aspects of personality in a relationship, whether that relationship be a family or work relationship. Hopefully with an understanding of the personality and temperament, we can understand others, work better together, and sustain loving relationships. I am an ISTJ type with a &quot;Guardian&quot; or &quot;Epimethean&quot; (SJ) temperament. This book has helped me at home and at work.This book is one of general interest. Those who typically read &quot;Psychology Today&quot; magazine will find this book interesting. College and graduate school psychology students and HR professionals will find this book useful. The value of this book is that it will lead a reader to a professional qualified to administer the MBTI. Consulting Psychologists Press, the publisher of the MBTI, requires the completion of a rigorous training course and examination to be qualified to administer and interpret the MBTI. If you are a college graduate, graduate student, or clergyman, personnel specialist, or mental health professional, the MBTI will have value to you. The authors acknowledge the MBTI in their introduction to &quot;Please Understand Me,&quot; but suggest their book as providing answers to some questions.People who read this book will enjoy Isabel Briggs Myers' &quot;Gifts Differing&quot; and Otto Kroeger and Janet M.

The best part of this book is that it provides such a detailed explanation of the importance of temperments. The book is also extremely good at explaining how one's type can impact their behaviour, particularly in the area of communication, and the potential impact this can have on personal relationships. Reading this book gave me greater insight into myself and other people. The examples the authors give really helped to make the book interesting. The writing style can be dry at times.I have to add two caveats: First, there is a newer book, Please Understand Me II, that has been recently released. I would have to suggest, having seen this book (although I haven't read it through, or purchased it yet) that the newer book might be more worthwhile to read first. Second, this book is really geared to people who are either very familiar with the MBTI, or who are trained facilitators who are actually able to administer the test. It is a rather technical book. It gets into a lot of detail - much more than the average reader may need, at times. This book can be slow, difficult reading at times.As a result, if you aren't familiar with the MBTI, I'd have to reccommend that you start with a book like Lifetypes, or Do What You Are.

The results can be astounding. Frequently, they want to rush right out and give it to others. I think that it's interesting that they see it as a gift they want to pass on. Men give it to wives and vice versa. It's appeal is multifaceted-it doesn't LABEL, it allows you to look at, or at least consider, other sides to yourself that you were subconsciously unaware of, it can take a great deal of stress out of your life, and so on. Perhaps this is a &quot;Road Less Traveled&quot; type phenomenon for the 2000's.

If you are someone who is very interested in typology then I would recommend buying both editions. Otherwise, I would recommend forgoing this version and buying the revised edition. The reason I enjoy this original edition is because it addresses the concept of \\"opposites,\\" which is not addressed (to my recollection) in the second edition. Keirsey writes that whatever personality type you are, you possess within yourself the opposite type. But that opposite side will remain more primitive and less differentiated and will seldom come to the surface. Keirsey writes that occasionally children will be influenced to perform a type of \\"falsification of type\\" wherein they live through their opposite preference. Keirsey quotes Jung as saying that such a person will often encounter certain challenges later in life in regard to how they should interact with the world.This topic of opposites is of relevance to me because I am a \\"Counselor Idealist\\" INFJ and I only recently realized that during my childhood I was often pressured to live out my opposite type, the \\"Promoter Artisan\\" ESTP. The difficulty this has presented me in later life is that occasionally that ESTP in me comes forward and I behave in a way that an INFJ would never dream of behaving: I say exactly what is on my mind and don't care what others think; I live spontaneously; I want to make a scene and get people's attention ... and then I become exhausted and need days to recharge, and am often ashamed of the way I have behaved (Counselor Idealists are preoccupied with diplomacy, which is of little importance to the Promoter Artisan). I would estimate that for every hour I spend as an ESTP, I need a day to recover. And yet I am somewhat fond of my ESTP side and have come to accept that it may never fully disappear. Keirsey's work has helped me understand my opposite type, and understand why it occasionally \\"erupts\\" within me.I also like the fact that PLEASE UNDERSTAND ME says, \\"INFJs have vivid imaginations exercised both as memory and intuition, and this can amount to genius\\" [page 171].

The classification of typology into four categories is something which makes absolute sense given the processing style of the sixteen types: SP Artisans (the doers), SJ Guardians (the conservationists), NF Idealists (the identity seekers), and NT Rationals (the knowledge seekers).The benefits of breaking down personality into general types cannot be understated; as a reader of MBTI for several years it was next to impossible to attempt to sit down with a person and attempt to explain how preference dominates our lives-- there were simply too many ulterior motives to explore and not enough framework to do it in. I would often score as an XNTX in MBTI with definite leanings towards ENTP, a concept impossible to explain to someone (say a concrete thinker) who is new to the ideas proposed by the CPP. Explaining motivation, on the other hand, is an entirely different story. It is far easier for a concrete thinker to state \\"I am hungry, therefore I might want to eat\\" than \\"if an ESFJ were hungry, they might... as opposed to an ISFJ, whose introverted behavior will....\\"Keirsey's methodology further lends itself to the reason I became interested in personality type: communication styles between types and the need for the human brain to bias itself towards the world without, in other words, the \\"Pygmalion Project.\\" This concept is an astounding and practical look at how the mind seeks commonality with its environment (with the cost being the individuality of the persons therein) and explains in honest, easy to understand terms why we try so hard to imprint ourselves into our mates, our children, and the people around us.This book would have gotten a five star rating had it not been for the fact that \\"Please Understand Me II\\" is out and contains all of the information contained within this book plus more detailed explanations of functionality. I would recommend that anyone with an interest in MBTI start off with this one, though; Keirsey is NOT MBTI even though they have a common language."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Don't expect this book to work on audiotape because it has too many lists. The reader sounds like she is reading a scientific text, makes no attempt to do the likely impossible task of making it work without the written word. I listen to many books on audiotape and wish someone had warned me to BUY THE BOOK. Only those highly tolerant of boredom could manage to catch some valuable passages."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Recommended to me by my therapist, this book blew me away when I read the profile of my character and temperament types. There in black and white were secret thoughts and imaginings that I had never told anyone! How could they know those things? And through reading those things, I healed a lot of wounds from half a life spent being ashamed because I was not like everybody else. Through this book I learned that I am not defective, but I am just a normal INFP! If only someone had told me these things when I was a child! Every one who tries to be in a relationship or parent a child should read this book."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I'm a sucker for &quot;personality type&quot; quizzes, but this is a winner. The test went quickly, and was so astonishingly accurate about me that I found myself reading everything else I could get my hands on about the Myers-Briggs theory of personality types. Later I took the full test and had it interpreted by a qualified professional -- and the results were exactly what I discovered from the self-test in this book. The Myers-Briggs is a great tool for understanding yourself and others, and, on the basis of my experience and my reading, I'd recommend this book as the best place to get started."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"If everybody had the chance to read just one book, this one is packed full of information on understanding yourself - but mostly others - better. You learn those little things your spouse and kids do are really NOT meant to drive you crazy; they're just hardwired differently than you. I have read many books on this subject and this one, along with Type Talk, are the best. This first version is perfect for the lay person; there is a newer, updated version but it gets into a lot of psycho babble which most of us not in the field would find difficult to digest. I am thrilled the &quot;older&quot; and original version is still available; I've ordered multiple copies and handed them all out already. It's time to replenish my supply. Great for managers who are hiring, but take the time to really absorb the information."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Despite its cheesy title, this book is not only a lot of fun to read and test out on friends and family, but it's also helpful and informative. It was given to me by a guidance counselor while I was in high school, and being an INFJ, it helped me understand myself and others better. I think we should be discussing this stuff in classrooms, especially classrooms of young kids, not as a model of absolutisms or concrete scientific fact, but as a method for teaching tolerance for different types of people. I really think these temperments are legit, and it inspired me to read about Jungian psychology. I've taken the test a few different times over the span of the past several years to see if my type had changed as a way of testing the Myers-Briggs-based test itself, and I've always come up w/INFJ. At the risk of sounding narcissistic, I also find that when I compare INFJ w/other types, the profile of INFJs most closely describes me so I think the test is accurate. It's not an exact science, but it's still useful."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"Great book. So much fun to have friends and loved ones do a test.

But, few understand themselves to begin with. Know thyself! These two words are full of so much mystery. If you want to crack the code of your own psychological DNA, this book is a great start.It is a great interpretation and practical application of the Myers Briggs test and psychological theory. The test in the book is as accurate and detailed as any test you can take online. What is good about taking the manual test, is that it really improves your understanding on why you scored the way you did on each of the different four psychological axis. When you take a test online, it typically spits out a result, but you don't get to review the underlying data that you just inputted.This book can save you thousands of dollars in expensive psychological testing,and psycho analysis."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"This is an excellent introduction to the MBTI 'types' - this book has a bit more technical jargon and reads more like a handbook than the other equally excellent, yet less technical book &quot;Type Talk&quot;, which covers the same material. This book is full of interesting revalations, and when read in conjunction with 'please understand me II' and the abovementioned 'Type Talk', it is an excellent resource in helping to understand yourself and those around you."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I ran into Keirsey accidentally last year, having over the years read much of Freud and Jung. There are both limitations and useful applications to Kiersey's development of 16 'standard' personality types. The compilation is clearly a result of widescale sampling and extrapolation based on Jung's development of 'components' of personality set out in his 'General Classification of Personality Types'. The result is a highly practical guide to looking at 'types' of personalities in relation to societal norms, how they interrelate to society as a whole, what interests them vocationally and avocationally; and how they view love, responsibility and destiny. One should take out of it a sence of equilibrium of personality both at a personal and the societal level. It is a very valuable tequnique of seeing yourself in relation to others and in understanding other's motivations. This book does not convey the deep introspection and intuition of the writings of the fathers of psychological categorization and the psyche's construction, which should be read by those interested the subject, but it is an excellent way to look at one aspect of yourself and the world around you."},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"I have used and recommended this book to many others in the past many years and it is still a valuable resource in helping people to understand their strengths and areas for opportunity and personal growth"},{"Title":"Please Understand Me: Character & Temperament Types","review":"this book is a must for anyone who is interested in understanding self and others! It has definitely led me to see the world differently, ironically helping me to let go of stereotyping, and move towards accepting and understanding other people in a more respectful way. Pigeon holes are for pigeons.

I found it useful to evaluate students' knowledge of APA format before I had covered any material.Unfortunately, I was expecting more information on pedagogical methods for teaching APA Style, not just for testing students on it. The resource guide consists of multiple choices evaluations and answer keys.

Nope, I was wrong. It is about as scarce with additional information about APA style as other reviewers suggested. It is literally a book on how to go through the APA manual, not necessarily finer points about APA style. For me, it was not more helpful. It has just proven to be more paper to put on a shelf.In its defense, I may not have spent the amount of time looking through the book that I should have to find it useful."},{"Title":"Mastering Apa Style: Instructor's Resource Guide","review":"As someone else mentioned, this is a testbank more than a user manual. As an instructor, that WOULD have been great as it would have saved me a lot of time in creating tests. But HELLO, I can't use a testbank that is available to all my students through Amazon!! Most publishers of academic sources go to a lot of effort to protect the sanctity test banks, but apparently it did not occur to the APA to keep this one off of Amazon. Too bad, because now I can't use it."},{"Title":"Mastering Apa Style: Instructor's Resource Guide","review":"The American Psychological Association (APA) errored in this publication and made correction of their error as convenient for APA as possible at the expense of the customer. I had to do without a manual for over a week as APA had to receive the defective manual before sending the corrected manual. I even offered to give them my credit card information so they could charge me if they didn't receive the defective edition. I pleaded with them to no avail.

Not the most interesting characters but it has an intriguing story line."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"I should give up trying. Barbara Michaels undoubtedly has talent, but it's not on show with this book. This is a turgid, predictable, formulaic book, devoid of believable characters. It is, however, relatively well-written. She does know how to put words together. So if you are a fan of the gothic genre, and you care about English usage, you could do a heck of a lot worse.My first experience with Ms. Michaels was a little gem called &#34;Ammie Come Home.&#34; I had never heard of this author (this was several decades ago) and this was a super find. I've been looking for something from her of the same caliber ever since. I've tried half-a-dozen, with no luck."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"The reason I like gothic mysteries is because mysteries are my favorites and the gothics usually don't have more lust and explicit sex than mystery.

I love Barbara Michaels and Master of Blacktower is one of her best!"},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"I really love Barbara Micheals books in general. I have read 13 of them, and this one was quite sweet. It reminded me of Beauty and the Beast and I read it in 2 days because I simply could not put it down. So thats how beautiful I found this book to be. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the B & the B story."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"This was my first Barbara Michaels book,and won't be the last. She is a great author, spinning an exciting mystery/romance that had me buried in my kindle, ignoring the rest of the world until I could get to the end. I love her writing style - she is very articulate and descriptive. The story is told in the first person, and the heroine is both brave and funny, lending her perspective on the other very colorful characters, and I could be frequently found chuckling away as the story unfolds. Ironically, it is frightening at the same time, but not nightmare material.All in all, an excellent read. I only wish the story had continued- it ends a little abruptly, and I was left imagining what happened to the characters, as there were a few loose ends. But I would still strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"I have read many mysteries by Elizabeth Peters and am just getting to know her as \\"Barbara Michaels\\". This is a delightful mystery set in the mid-1800's that starts with a young woman left alone after the untimely death of her father. She is an independent woman and hires herself out as a secretary to a distant relative who lives in a ruin of a castle in Scotland. He is disfigured, has an invalid daughter, very strange servants, and no wife (that she knows of). Of course she falls in love with him, but there are secrets all around. The author drops lots of hints about the mystery, but I didn't figure it until the author revealed it. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

Also more interplay between the \\"Beauty\\" and the \\"Beast.\\" Nothing risque, simply more romance."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"Barbara Michaels seems to have no new ideas, if you've read a couple of her books, there is no need to read this one, it is a variation of all her other books."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"I know that Barbara Michaels (Elizabeth Peters) has written much better books since. But I was young and impressionable when I read it and it stood miles above the average paperback gothic of the period.The beginning is similar to that of Crocodile on the Sandbank, the book that later began her Amelia Peabody Emerson series. Her scholarly father dead, the heroine is setting out to make her own way in the world. However Master of Blacktower runs a more traditional course with a scarred employer whose reputation is not of the best, a remote Medieval pile in Scotland, not to mention, a missing (dead?) wife, sinister retainers and a mentally disturbed child (what happened to all of those traumatized children when they grew up?). However Michaels' irrepressible humor shines through at times. The predictable plot takes some nice twists and turns. The climax in a dangerous snowy landscape is nicely done.All in all-- not to be sneezed at."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"I have been familiar with Elizabeth Peters and her Egyptian mysteries, but I would have never guess that the woman can write some great stories under a pen name and live a double life of success! Master of Blacktower is cited to be a Gothic thriller but there is so much more to it than heavy, opulent furniture, gowns and language. Set in 1850's this tale is full of old fashioned virtues and the main heroine's way of breaking them.This is a tale reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast as another reviewer has said, where Damaris who has lost her father at a young age has decided to work as a librarian for Sir Gavin Hamilton. He a brute and barbarian with scars and wild hair who occupied a half demolished castle in Scotland and she a young and quite feisty female who wouldn't dream of living the low standard of having to marry and have as much voice as a piece of furniture in those times. She gave me quite a few chuckles but the real beauty was in the smooth flow of the story and the mysterious past that had Mr. Hamilton tangled up in and the reason for his acting in such a dark, haunted way.The mysterious disappearance and gossip about his missing wife, his crippled arrogant daughter, a castle with a black tower and full of distrustful servants were just a few of the main elements. The reader is taken on a journey of discovery and truth that has finally shone at the cold Scottish stones with the arrival of young Damaris. There were quite a few twists and turns and a lot of actions, I found myself totally enjoying this tale, reading for the entire lazy Sunday and wishing I had more of Mrs. Michael's books around. I adored the old fashioned way in which people dressesd and the hilarious way men told women what to do, what was even better was their discord when females had enough and got their way in most cases. I am sure glad I live in different times because with my snarly distaste for dictatorship I would have angered many men.This is a fun, fast read that leaves the reader feeling happy, full to the brim with love, angst and battles against surprising foes and ready for another tale such as this one. I mainly prefer horror, books about werewolves and psychos and this is probably considered to be fictional fluff but boy o boy I adored it, more please! As far as I'm concerned Barbara Michaels can spoon feed me her stories I think I will enjoy them all.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"This story is Barbara Michaels at her best.

This book just goes to show that love can happen anytime, anyplace, and to anyone! It is one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"Though this novel has all the charms, chills, romance, and mystery of Michaels' other wonderful Gothic pieces, it has a strangely rushed, abrupt feel that left me cold compared to her other novels. Though similar in length to her other works, the pace is choppy, and the reader is not as deeply drawn into the story. The two leads, Damaris and the eponymous Gavin, do fascinate and smolder with slow burning romance and character. Even the two of the servants, Betty and Ian, are intriguing, and provide a pleasant, if very minor, supporting influence. The real supporting players, however, left me scratching my head. Their presence, and the reactions to their presence, seem wholly untrue and poorly painted.In fact, many characters, like the spoiled daughter, Annabelle, are implausible sketches, not used to their potential best in the plot. (She is the duller, female version of The Secret Garden's Colin, in a random, ill-used plot line.) They are set up only to fall by the wayside as the narrative manages to both barrel and creep to a \\"resolution\\" of the slackest kind. Huge events occur without much impact. When action does occur, it seems forced an ill-fitting with the story.Shocking revelations are tumbled out at the last minute, and the end is the final jerk of a disintegrating rope. Not the kind of tug that startles the enchanted reader out of reverie, but the kind that leaves the reader holding a frayed end of a loosely woven story, wondering where the rest went.I am otherwise a huge fan of Michaels' historical Gothic novels. But The Master of Blacktower trails far behind, in desolate mist, the truly shining, exciting, yet similar, Greygallows, Black Rainbow, Wings of the Falcon, and the Wizard's Daughter. Of them all, I find Black Rainbow to be the best of the form, though I also sometimes reread Greygallows and the Wizard's Daughter. I wish she wrote more in the vein, but Victoria Holt keeps me happily supplied with historical Gothic revival fiction. From Holt, I highly recommend Night of the Seventh Moon, which I am thrilled is available on Kindle.Better yet, order yourself a shelfful (dusty old box full) of the original Holt/Carr paperbacks and hardbacks. You won't be sorry. Michaels' fans will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Master of Blacktower","review":"I love Barbara Michaels! She is one of my favorite modern writers. I also enjoy her writings as Elizabeth Peters. The Amelia Peabody Mysteries have to be one of my all time favorite mystery series. I tend to save her books as Barbara Michaels for times when I need a good dose of a modern gothic. The Master of Blacktower has to be one of my all time favorite books by Barbara Michaels. Damaris Gordon hates the thought of having to go to work for the disfigured Gavin Hamilton owner of a isolated Scottish estate, but her father's death has left her with few choices for how to take care of herself. She begins to discover the truth about his wife's \\"mysterious\\" death and his daughter's crippling injury.

The other book is still here, unread while I tore apart Love Don't Live...Love Don't Live Here No More reads like a memoir. It was a short, interesting read. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in growing up in the lifestyle that the author speaks of in this biographical novel.Fans of Snoop Dogg will likely find fault with the fact I only gave this four stars.

The book is definitely a good easy read and at times, funny as HECK! I loved the characters, especially, sweet Bing, and I could flow with it.

The lessons are set up so that you repeat things enough that you feel confident with the few phrases they provide and can even form some basic sentences on your own. Once I got to Greece, I realized most everyone there speaks English, but it was nice that I could at least understand bits of what was being said around me and could respond with the appropriate words for \\"thank you\\" \\"please\\" and \\"I don't understand Greek very well.\\" I highly recommend these CDs to someone just beginning their studies in a foreign language or taking a trip."},{"Title":"Greek (Modern): 2nd Ed.

My complaints are thus: this is audio only. For some this might be just what they want, to be able to speak only, but it drove me crazy not knowing how to spell the words I was hearing (if I didn't already know how to) Which brings me to my second complaint: there are 8 lessons on the 4 CDs and the amount of vocabulary that one learns is not very much at all. I already know some Greek and I was hoping this would really boost my ability, but I don't think it did much for me at all. Also, it never mentions anything about grammar, how to form plurals, conjugate verbs, etc. Perhaps the more complete course is better, but I have not tried it myself.Positive things about it are: you learn some basic phrases & responses, voices are native speakers (I believe), and the \\"listen & repeat\\" or feedback is excellent! (Actually, my son is in speech therapy and they also use this method.) You listen to the word or phrase and then repeat it. It might seem silly because there is no one there to hear you, but the idea is that you hear *yourself* and can adjust your own pronounciation, but also \\"complete the circuit\\" in the language center of your brain, whereby you hear it, imitate it, and hear it again (your own voice) thereby cementing not only the vocab but also the individual sounds of the language.In the end, I rated this a 3 because it is a very good beginning for those who only which to speak the language, but if you want to have a more comprehensive understanding of the language, this will disappoint you."},{"Title":"Greek (Modern): 2nd Ed.

She is a slave on loan and the teen makes a journey daily back and forth from the mistresses house and the Senator's house. On day she overhears a man talking to her neighbor about a ship that will bring her to freedom. With the assistance of Abby, her abolitionist friend she is able to escape from the plantation and get on board the Pearl, a ship which will carry her and others to freedom. However, within hours the ship is captured and Louisa's hopes of freedom seem done. However strong-willed Louisa isn't going to let that happen. She manages to escape again and once again runs to her best friend Abby for help. However Abby has got her own problems too. Her father, Gamaliel Bailey, a son of a Methodist minister writes a anti-slavery newspaper and the irratated citizens are blaming him for getting the slavery issue brought up again. Hiding in Abby's room for weeks Louisa finally decides to take a daring journey to freedom. Will she make it? What will her new life be like?Though this book focuses on Louisa it also details Abby's lifestyle as the daugter of an abolitionist.Based on the true story of the capture of the Pearl in which 76 slaves attempted to escape to freedom Freedom Calls : Journey of a Slave Girl truly gives you new insight into the Civil times and the internal and external conflicts of that time. It also teaches that friendship is a loving bond. You can tell this book was well researched as the details were very descriptive. Though Louisa is fictional she could very well be real.

This isn't just another quilting book; this book has a beautiful \\"modern\\" look and feel throughout, and all the classic quilt blocks featured here have had their look and feel gently updated. New quilt blocks and quilting techniques are also introduced in the most lovely ways - this isn't post-modern Picasso quilting and it isn't your grandmother's country quilting; it walks a careful middle road between tradition and modern tastes and it does so effortlessly.This book is huge, and every page is informative and useful. The emphasis between machine techniques and hand techniques is split fairly equally, and it's wonderful to finally find a resource which shows how to properly machine quilt a lot of traditional blocks that don't lend themselves easily to machine quilting. All the pictures are in color, with careful detail, and you can actually understand what you are being told to accomplish, step-by-step. I'm also thrilled to say that this is the first quilting book I've ever owned which actually presented an understandable, practical approach to machine applique.There's a wealth of variety here. There are plenty of beginner's blocks and quilting styles, but the author also provides suggested \\"projects\\" to practice techniques - including a gorgeous wall hanging of a basket of flowers and a butterfly, all appliqued carefully so that the butterfly wings are not attached to the picture and can \\"flap\\" gently. Definitely, this book teaches but is also gently challenges the reader to take steps in a new direction if they want to expand their repertoire.I can't recommend this quilting book highly enough. At one point, I seriously considered selling the rest of my books and only keeping this one - it's that helpful and comprehensive.

I fear, however, that no translation can do justice to the original, since much of its charm is in the vocabulary, dialect and the phraseology of the period.In &quot;Loxandra&quot;, Maria Iordanidou, then in her sixties, wrote a brilliant, loving portrait of her grandmother and ordinary life of a well to-do Greek family in Constantinoupolis of the late 1800s-early 1900s, a world gone forever. Historical events intrude in the background -revolutions, palace coups, massacres, and the great upheavals of WW1 in which Greeks saw their wildest hopes fulfilled, then dashed: for a brief time Constantinoupolis itself was regained, then lost along with all Asia Minor. Through troubles great and small, Loxandra's simple optimism, belief in her Madonna, and love of life carries her family past every difficulty - be it a sumptuous dinner for Easter or secretly giving away her savings to help persecuted Armenians. In the modern impersonal life it is heart warming to learn of a time and place where all neighbors were friends, where they could cook in each other's kitchens or take shelter in each other's cellars, and make us wish we all had a Loxandra in the family.In the sequel (which is the first in an autobiographical series) the author (using the pseudonym Anna, and only 14 at the time) goes on vacation to her uncle's house in Batoumi, Georgia, and is trapped there by the oputbreak of the war. Cut off from everyone, &quot;...Anna discovered a very strange thing - she was swallowed by Russia.&quot; She spends the next 5 years surviving the war, the revolution and the civil war by her wits and the incredible good heart of the ordinary Russians whom she meets, literally an innocent abroad. Eventually, penniless and desparate, she makes it back to her home in Constantinoupolis to find that not only has the world she left changed beyond recognition, but so has she.The greek reader will not find a better pair of books to enjoy and re-read many times.

I am pleased to state that this volume defies the trend. The stories in this volume are, on the whole, well written and imaginative. From a world where Patton didn't slap the soldier in Sicily, to a world where the League of Nations occupies parts of the American South, the stories weave entertaining might have beens. I especially liked the story where Custer meets his end at the Battle of the Bulge!"},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"I'm a bigtime Harry Turtledove fan, and eagerly grabbed this book in hopes of reading some good alternate history. For those of you unfamiliar with this term, alternate history allows the author to change an event or assumption and then write the history that would, or could, have developed with the change. Turtledove himself wrote a terrific US Civil War novel called \\"How Few Remain\\" where the South wins a crucial battle and then the war. This book takes place 20 years later with the CSA as a sovereign nation, making alliances against the USA.Now, when I pick up an anthology edited by someone who is a big name in the field, I expect to get their expert opinion along with their expert selections. I don't think Turtledove succeeded with either. There is no introduction, conclusion, or even lead-in vignettes by the editor, and that's a tremendous lack. Unlike Turtledove, I am not a history expert, I don't know each and every turn of history referred to in these stories, despite my being reasonably well-read. All he had to do was give us an intro or an afterward on the \\"branching point\\" in the story and many would have made so much more sense. Without this, this collection would be only of interest to war-stories buffs (as would be expected since each story must include a general in it), when it could also have been a cross-over to science fiction and alternate history fans like me.While some of the stories are good, most either plod, or don't have enough detail for someone who isn't an expert in the time period covered. My favorite piece by far was \\"Southern Strategy\\" by Michael F. Flynn, where post-WWII UN forces are occupying the US South, attempting to root out racial oppression. Many famous people in our timeline have different roles because of the occupation. Adlai Stevenson is a senator attempting to negotiate a compromise candidate between the Northern and Southern factions of the Democratic party. George Wallace is either a terrorist or a loyalist, as is Martin Luther King, Jr., in their own ways. Even Dick Nixon ensures he won't be kicked around, and there's a cameo by Elvis Presley, too. This story of occupation, despair, retribution, and futility haunted me for days. But the general in this story, Rommel, is mostly offstage. The real interest is following the different factions; the North, the Southern whites, the Southern blacks, and the occupying Germans.\\"Labor Relations\\" by Esther Friesner, is part fantasy, part war story, and also well-written as we should expect from her. It takes place in non-contemporary Japan, but I couldn't figure out when. It appears to be a Korean occupation. I don't know if the Japanese Empress is a real character or if one of the soldiers should have been the general in real history.\\"American Mandate\\" (James Fiscus) has the US occupying (and then withdrawing from) Turkey in 1918 at the conclusion of WWI. It's interesting and has both local color and intrigue, but like most of the stories in this book, it assumed I knew more about the time period than I did. \\"Horizon\\" (Noreen Doyle) covers ancient Egypt, and while an interesting tale, I had no idea where things had changed from our timeline. It was also far too long for a story whose point I was missing, as I couldn't identify most of the characters in the story. Chris Bunch has a story where George Custer is born years later and ends up fighting in World War II, taking Patton's place after the latter meets an early and untimely end. This was the only story to move a character in time rather than change an event, and it worked well.Turtledove's contribution to the book is \\"Uncle Alf,\\" which takes place during 1929 and a German occupation of France and Belgium (clearly they were victorious in WWI). While it's supposed to be a surprise who the narrator is, I figured it out quickly enough. Kind of a light effort for ol' Harry.It's a shame that Turtledove didn't do the editing work despite getting his name on the cover. A little bit of background would have improved this book. But the question must be asked: are there really enough good alternative histories with generals to justify a second anthology? Go buy Alternate Generals instead, as the stories are of better quality."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"In the past decade or so, a small group of science fiction authors and editors have made a sort of cottage industry of original anthologies of alternate history stories. Some are quite good, some are exceedingly mediocre. Several in this latest collection feature both an excellent grasp of historical cause and effect and writing of high quality, including &quot;American Mandate,&quot; by Jim Fiscus, in which Gens. Smedley Butler and John Pershing find themselves trying to carry out the League of Nations mandate in the old Ottoman empire against the revolutionary forces of Mustapha Kemal. Another is Joel Richards's &quot;In the Prison of His Days,&quot; which tells of the 1916 Easter Uprising in Dublin and William Butler Yeats's part in it. &quot;George Patton Slept Here,&quot; by Roland S. Green, shows a close grasp of the details of the Italian campaign in 1943, this time led by a Patton who kept his job by managing not to slap around battle-fatigued soldiers. Chris Bunch's &quot;Tarnished Glory,&quot; on the other hand, is the sort of quasi-alternate history that just irritates the hell out of me. He has George Armstrong Custer being born in 1885 so as to take part in WWII in the Patton role -- except that Custer's buddy Patton died in the influenza epidemic of 1918 and Custer screws up in the Battle of the Bulge instead of Sicily. The thing is, you can't just snatch a historical personage out of his proper time and plunk him down otherwhen, and pretend that his personality will still be what it was! Nurture matters at least as much as nature, and context counts! Anyway. There are a couple of other stories here of particular interest, especially Michael Flynn's &quot;Southern Strategy,&quot; about a League of Nations incursion into the American South, and &quot;Devil's Bargain,&quot; in which Judith Tarr allows Richard the Lion-Hearted to succeed in his quest for Jerusalem. &quot;Horizon,&quot; by Noreen Doyle, though, is a confused and not very readable story of Akhenaten as a military conqueror, written in a style presumably meant to be reminiscent of the Book of the Dead. Susan Schwartz's &quot;And the Glory of Them,&quot; about Behemond's conquest of Antioch, portrays the 11th century king as having almost 20th century attitudes. As much as I enjoy this particular sf theme -- when it's well done -- maybe it's time we gave it a rest."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"Very disappointing, but from such a wide genre not all can be to everyone's tastes. It seems to be mass produced buy beginning writers."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"I would say that only 2 or 3 of the stories were for the alternate history fan, where the difference in the story would be a large visible difference in the world today. Maybe the other stories needed a blurb on what actually happened for a better appreciation by readers with a lack of knowledge of that person or event."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"Though Harry Turtledove's name is listed on the cover, he authors just one of the thirteen short stories in this collection of alternate history tales. Though the settings range from ancient Egypt (in Noreen Doyle's \\"Horizon\\") to twentieth-century Istanbul (the setting of James Fiscus's \\"American Mandate\\"), the theme uniting them all is the different paths events might have taken should the people, choices, and settings have been any different. Like most collections, the stories are a mixed bag in terms of quality, with some working better than others. Readers will undoubtedly differ as to which stories these are, but just about any fan of the alternate history genre will find something to enjoy within the pages of this book."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"are doomed to repeat it.2.5 starsHere Turtledove does not learn from the mistakes of the first volume and repeats them. I could, changing story details, almost cut and paste my review of Alternate Generals I.Again, without an author or editor's foreword to these stories explaining the actual historical background in most cases the casual but well educated reader will be lost at sea reading some of these stories.Obscurity aside, most of the stories are languid, slow-paced with really no interest to catch the reader's attention. Including a ridiculous story about a 3 year pregnant Japanese empress. Turtledove may enjoy quiet interlude pieces about the crusades as he has included them in both volumes but I miss the appeal of them.There are again a handful of good stories saving this from being abysmal. Teddy Roosevelt and Pancho Villa together, Napoleon the Emperor of New Orleans both succeed not on the strength of their premise but by the talent of the storyteller who makes the charatcters likeable and engaging. Too many though are long, dry and feel like they were written to fill a word count with no emotional involvement from the author.I am generally a fan, and advocate, of the shorter form of storytelling but this volume just doesn't work for me."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"Alternate history can be fun, but requires a knowledge of history well beyond what most public high schools give their students.All of the stories were either fun, educational or both.

Enjoy stretching your brain."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"Alternate history is a funny thing... when it is good, it can be some of the most compelling fiction ever printed, but when it is bad it can well and truly stink up an entire room.Alternate Generals 2 falls somewhere in the middle.Some of the stories are interesting, particularly the one based on the premise of a Buonaparte empire in the new world. Others weren't nearly as good.Spend a short time with this book and you will have spent a tolerable afternoon, but only if you didn't plunk down 25 dollars for it."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"Not only are the stories of only fair to midlelin quality, many have little or nothing to do with military history much less Generals. The stories in this volume are of lesser quality of the first book but are still interesting to read. The only thing the have in common is that they are alternate history and some kind of military connection. My recommendation is wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Alternate Generals II","review":"Harry Turtledove continues his fascination with alternative history with Alternate Generals 2, which paints some very different pictures of history as it might have been.

Roberts drew on his own personal records dating from 1874, and encompassing a long life of methodical, careful observation and collection. His accounts of birding in what is now south Minneapolis are amazing: ground-nesting whip-poor-wills amid the bur oaks; hundreds of wood ducks feeding on those oaks' acorns; thousands of migrating ducks resting on the Minneapolis lakes. One of the charming features of the book is the multiple artists employed to illustrate every single bird occurring in Minnesota. All were famous at the time; the work introduced the artistry of Frances Lee Jaques to Minnesotans. Some of the information in the book is now dated, not because Roberts was wrong, but because climate change and the so-called progress of civilization has greatly affected the avifauna of Minnesota."},{"Title":"They knew the unknown","review":"I bought this book for research, and I was not disappointed. Though some of the facts don't quite match my own studies, this book is loaded with enough research pointers -- and great trivia -- to make it an invaluable resource for historians.I'm especially interested in some of the books listed for additional reading. They may contain the information I didn't have, before reading this book, and they may shed light on incidents where my own research was faulty.For researchers, this book is a must-read.However, if you're looking for a good book to read by the pool or on a chilly winter night, I'm not sure this is it. It depends on what you're looking for. The author seems to focus on unhappy aspects of each subject, or maybe some of the people he's profiled had truly (and almost relentlessly) tragic lives. Fascinating...? Yes, but not the kind of reading I like, before turning off the light for the night.Then again, tragedy and loss often provide the background that nudge (or shove) people in the direction of studying psychical phenomena. So, I can understand why Mr. Ebon focused on the sad moments rather than the successes of the individuals, even if it's not uplifting for recreational reading.For researchers, this book stands out as an important work in the field of psychical and paranormal phenomena. I'm so impressed, I've ordered another of Mr. Ebon's books.In general, this is a remarkable book and I'm glad I bought it. It's both a great reference book and captivating reading... but you're likely to sleep with the lights on, for at least a few nights after reading it."},{"Title":"CliffsQuickReview Criminal Justice","review":"I'm not sure why there hasn't been a review on this book yet, but this book is awesome if you're preparing for the DSST tests.

Today the USS Arizona remains the permanent war grave for the 1,102 men who perished on board that ship that day.My copy of this book was published in 1957. Since that time, many new avenues of research have opened for historians. One, of course, is the advent of the internet. Another is also the release of material after whatever 30 or 50 year rule were put in place. In other words, this author neither had the facilities afforded by the internet nor was he allowed access to some of the material which is available today - something which makes this book all the more remarkable for its content.Author and historian Walter Lord clearly understood the art of research and put his skills to the best possible use in producing this book. It is an excellent work. With photographs used for the very first time, we have a moment-by-moment account of the attack and how it affected people on the ground.This really was infamous for several reasons; Firstly the Japanese had not delivered any formal declaration of war against the USA. By not making such a declaration, US Forces had not been placed on a war footing and were, therefore, going about their duties - just as they would during any time of peace. Finally, not content with the knowledge they would be catching the US Fleet \\"unawares,\\" the Japanese also chose to attack on a Sunday morning - a time when US forces would, for the most part, be enjoying a day off.Infamy is one word, cowardly is another and, of all the accounts I have read, this ranks amongst the very best.NM"},{"Title":"Cat-Man's Daughter","review":"This was an amazing book, and im not a big reader either!

Each time I read it, I'm delighted once again by the warmth and charm of the writing. Cat-Man's Daughter is the story of a thirteen-year-old girl, Kate, who is forever being shuttled between her divorced parents who live on opposite coasts of the country. The parents try everything to make the transitions easy for her--except getting along. Kate wishes they would stop sniping at each other and treat her like an adult. The only person she can really confide in is her grandmother, who has a habit of taking in people who need a place to stay. Together, Kate and her grandmother make a drastic attempt to bring Kate's parents' attention to their daughter's future instead of their own sniping.Normally I don't care for books written in the present tense, but Barbara Abercrombie uses this device to involve us personally in the lives of her characters. This is not an earth-shattering novel, or one of my all-time favorites, but if it finds you at the right moment you will love this story about the value of civility and respecting children."},{"Title":"The Book of Revelation: A Study of Christ in You, the Hope of Glory","review":"A good commentary on the book of Revelation,with a spiritual perspective of the symbolic language used."},{"Title":"Youmans Neurological Surgery (Four Volume Set)","review":"This multi-volume work combines the best detailed commentary, survey and education on Neurosurgery that I have found. By the very nature of the subject it must and does include much of Neurology and Neuroanatomy. It has an extraordinary breadth and scope. It is certainly the best starting point for Neurosurgery information/answers and in some respects you may need to look no further. While this series does discuss in substantial detail Neuroimaging I would suggest combining it with the Orrison Two Volume Neuroimaging set. Together they provide a tremendous wealth of information to aid in diagnosis, testing, and treatment. These publications \\"Youmans\\" and the \\"Orrison\\" books are so well known in the field that this \\"review\\" is only useful for those who might be unfamiliar with NeuroSurgery and NeuroImaging. Their authority is unquestioned and accepted by all practitioners. The education these books provide in both fundamental concepts and advanced procedures and interpretation is vast. However the Youmans set alone gives significant exposure to Neuroimaging and Neurotesting. You actually have to use the books to appreciate the assets they provide. Over time you will realize that they address virturally every question that may arise or with the voluminous references show you where to go. This publication is the result of a vast effort by many practitioners and so reflects a combined expertise greater than most other publications. The cost of the publications is difficult but the return is well worth it. I have not found any Neurosurgery problems left untouched by Youmans and together with Orrison they are a powerful weapon. If our hospitals and facilities could only implement all this knowledge much suffering could be eliminated or reduced. Unfortunately my experience has been that the total knowledge represented by these books is way ahead of the medical care provided to many patients. Certainly every Neurosurgeon should own these books and every person needing such references could do no better.Kenneth Ellmanemail:ke@kennethellman.com"},{"Title":"Youmans Neurological Surgery (Four Volume Set)","review":"To my surprise, there are lots of chapters are quoted as a whole chapters from another books, the editor-in-chief should had known this.

I took a two semester course on the Quijote. This book is excellent in that it points out why this work of Cervantes is landmark for all world literatures in the way that it discusses fiction and metafiction, and also, the merits of the different theories about realism and verisimilitude in literature. It very simply and easily points out to the reader why the Quijote is such a masterpiece and why it continues to be. ...BW"},{"Title":"Don Quixote: The Quest for Modern Fiction (Twayne's Masterwork Studies)","review":"I picked up Johnson's book on Don Quixote because the novel is large and intimidating to me and I felt I'd need some preparation before reading it. I also felt I needed something to undo the prejudices I had formed against the main character from seeing The Man of La Mancha. Johnson provides an excellent orientation to the many things going on in the novel. His scholarship is current and insightful; the extended discussion in the chapters \\"A Book about Books\\" and \\"Readers and Reading\\" were especially helpful. I also liked his explanations about how Parts I and II relate to one another (part II is clearly more than just a sequel or \\"more adventures\\"). Johnson concludes his study by revealing his own personal reading of the text. I found it plausible (it's mostly a psychological reading), but Johnson by no means suggests that his reading is conclusive or better than any other reader's reading. This is a book I plan to keep at hand as I begin (once again) to try to make it all the way through Cervantes' classic and ground-breaking novel."},{"Title":"Don Quixote: The Quest for Modern Fiction (Twayne's Masterwork Studies)","review":"I'm a fan of the Twayne's series of studies, which offer an undergraduate course in about 100 pages. Johnson's little book on Don Quixote is one of the best. It's much better than either the Nabokov book or the studies in the Norton edition, all of which are chatty and interesting but not very helpful in coming to terms with Cervantes' long, often boring, brilliant novel. Johnson provides enough dollops of literary theory, history, biography, culture, and critical exegesis for the reader to really start to work independently. What I liked most was his final reading of Quixote as a man fleeing his incestuous desire for his niece, madly projecting and fantasizing to relieve the pressure. His description of a world where Moors and Jews lived secret lives while passing as Christians, ne'er-do-well aristocrats like Quijano suffered lives of quiet desperation, and encounters with the Other in the New World radically altered Western consciousness at the very time that print brought people into closer communion, provided grist for many hours of thought and appreciation. The sections on reader-response and literary theory were a bit more conventional, but they were clear and compelling nevertheless.

Well, all that was in the 16th Century. But still..."},{"Title":"Journey to Avalon: The Final Discovery of King Arthur","review":"This is a book that generates strong mixed emotions. On the one hand, the authors display an extensive and detailed knowledge of early Welsh lore; on the other hand, they seem to draw upon little else in their effort to reconstruct the history of of Fifth and Sixth Century Britain. In particular, they seem to have little understanding of the institutions of the late Roman period (which influenced those of the succeeding period) and they disregard most of what we know about contemporary events on the Continent (which sometimes directly impacted post-Roman Britain and which often provide useful models for studying the transition from Roman imperial rule to local independence). Thus, the authors do not recognize Emperor Constantine III and his son (the Caesar Constans) when they appear in legendary guise; they do not realize that the &quot;Republic of the Silures&quot; (&quot;res publica Silurum&quot; in Latin) was not a special political arrangement, but a normal reference to a Civitas (local governmental unit) in Britain; they confuse Saint Germanus of Gaul with his Manx namesake; and, they posit unlikely interactions among the various realms and personalities of post-Roman Britain.The authors identification of Arthur with Arthwys ap Meurig (Artvisius? son of Mauricius), a king of Gwent and Glamorgan in Seventh Century Wales, is questionable, because of the small realm and late date of this monarch. Such an identification is inconsistent with the island-wide reputation and the enormous impact of the historical Arthur, who won the epoch-defining Battle of Badon Hill around A.D. 493. It is not implausible, however, that incidents from the life of the similar-named king did influence the growth of the Arthurian legend.The book (or at least most of it) is nonetheless well worth reading. It delves very deeply into Welsh lore that is often ignored or disregarded, and it provides a number of interesting insights into the development of early Wales. I recommend buying the book, but skipping or skimming over pages 13 through 54 (where the authors shortcomings are most manifest). The remaining 300 or so pages of the book provide a fascinating look into the dim world of long-age Britain."},{"Title":"Journey to Avalon: The Final Discovery of King Arthur","review":"Barber &amp; Pykitt put forth an excellent argument (as well as excellent refutations of the others) that &quot;Arthur&quot; did exist as a leader from the ancient Welsh territory of Gwent (between Glamorgan and the Severn Sea).They really have done their research, and have limited their scope to a discussion of finding Arthur, not a detailed account of post-Roman Britain.This book is FUN. I wouldn't recommend skipping any of its pages. I like the many twists on old ideas, and the surprising new conclusions of this book. For example, the Bedwin Sands in the middle of the Severn exist today, and are remembered in the Dream of Rhonabwy from the Mabinogion collection of old Welsh tales. Wonderful! Who else (lately) ever mentioned locals gathering cupfuls of teeth from Baddington Hill in Bath, the sight of Arthur's greatest triumph over the Hwicce (Gewissei), his twelfth battle as listed in Nennius? Brilliant. The little pearls all seem to fit.Perhaps the theory is completely false, but it offers a more realistic start to the problem than anything advanced to date. Geoffrey Ashe has certainly done a lot to bring Arthur to the masses in our time, but the theory of Riothamus is not to be trusted for the reasons set forth in this little gem.We're all so used to looking at the world from the perspective of the modern map, forgetting that the Britons and Romano-British were trapped in a narrow corridor between the Anglo-Saxons, Jutes and their allies to the south and east, and the Irish Sea (Scotti) to the west. The safe travel was from north to south, from Dumbarton to Snowdon to St. David's to Cornwall to Brittany (now France). All that is vertical, and in close proximity.And finally, someone who makes the Welsh a bit easier for we mortals to understand.Shouldn't we all be going to Caerwent and Bath to DIG?I loved this book. Bring on the next improvement!"},{"Title":"Journey to Avalon: The Final Discovery of King Arthur","review":"Barber and Pykitt have a new guess as to who the historical Arthur was. Well, actually, it's not a new guess. For a long time, it was assumed that Athrwys ap Meurig *was* Arthur, but that idea fell out of favor due to dating problems. Here, Barber and Pykitt resurrect the Athrwys theory, explaining the confusion that led to some historians' belief that Athrwys lived a century too late. They add in a new revelation: according to this book, Arthur was also St Armel, whom the Bretons revere just as much as they do Arthur, not realizing they're the same guy! (This isn't a spoiler. These assertions are made in the first chapter; the rest of the book is devoted to proof and to investigating other pieces of the legend, like the location of Avalon, and the identity of some of the Knights of Camelot.)It's a fascinating theory; unfortunately, the writing runs a little dry at times, becoming an interminable list of &quot;begats&quot;. This kind of tangible proof is necessary when setting forth theories, I know. It's just that it doesn't always make for easy reading. This is a scholarly book more than it is an entertaining one; read it when you're in a &quot;brainy mood.&quot;In the end, Barber and Pykitt may be right about the original personage of Arthur. However, the legendary Arthur is a composite figure and can't be reduced to one historical man; he is an amalgam of several historical kings and a couple of pagan Welsh gods. The fact that some of the major events of &quot;Arthur's&quot; life are explained here as historical events does nothing to diminish the legendary king's mystique."},{"Title":"Journey to Avalon: The Final Discovery of King Arthur","review":"This is one of quite a number of books who have identified the real, historical Arthur II. Despite the \\"experts\\" who have made a career in the last 3 centuries, or more,who have conspired to bury Arthur's identity, the word is out, Arthur lives.I have been studying my family history in South Wales for over 23 years and have seen how the latter day \\"experts\\" have systematically conspired to erase much of the true British and, with it, world history. Once again, they have been caught in their childish and churlish games. This work has an excellent bibliography and highly useful appendices in addition to the story within. This is a must for anyone studying the history and/or genealogy in S. Wales. It points out the plethora of \\"mistakes\\" made by the \\"experts\\" over the years quite well. It provides a synopsis of the Ancient Histories and how useful they are in the study of S. Wales, while pointing out how they have been misused and misinterpreted, as they surely have. If you read between the lines, you will see how the \\"parties\\" to the obfuscation conspiracy worked their theories into becoming \\"reality\\" and how it has been accepted by the unwashed. You should seek out this book and give it 3 readings. I purchased it online, used, through Amazon and was more than pleased.

It was new, not just \\"like new\\""},{"Title":"Journey to Avalon: The Final Discovery of King Arthur","review":"I found a copy of Arthur and the Charters of the King by T. Blackett and Alan Wilson several years ago in a bookshop in Glastonbury. Hidden underneath the eccentricities was some solid evidence of the origin of Arthur. I was pleased several years ago when Journey to Avalon was published, but dismayed that it, like Charters, was too focused on the Welsh aspects. It pursued the links established in Charters. With the number of connections the authors were able to form for the various characters under their different names, it was incredible that they missed important well defined Roman and continental characters. This caused me to put it aside.I recently reread Journey and all of the alternate theories mentioned in the appendix, plus a few more. With all of it fairly fresh in my mind, I have to say, that in spite of its flaws, Journey offers far more compelling evidence than any of the alternate theories. If you ignore the world outside of the Wales and Armorica, it provides a very coherent view of Arthur's domain in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. Contrary to other opinions, I think chapters 2 and 3 may be the most plausible conjecture of Arthur's background in existence. This conjecture is done at the expense of the more established Arthurian sites, like Glastonbury and Tintagel. I suggest that anyone interested in discovering the real Arthur read this book. I also hope that someone with more knowledge of the collapsing Roman Empire, picks up this theme and provides a more scholarly exposition of the facts."},{"Title":"Journey to Avalon: The Final Discovery of King Arthur","review":"I would give this zero stars if I could. This is one of the few books I have ever actually thrown in the recycle bin. It is, how shall I say it, useless. It goes off on Geoffrey of Monmouth's dating of King Arthur to the 6th century, which disagrees with everything else Geoffrey says about the time period, which clearly places him in the 5th Century, and then tries to force an alignment with events and personages of the 6th Century that have absolutely nothing to do with King Arthur or anyone related to him. The author is either an idiot or he just has no regard for the facts of the matter. Spend your money on Geoffrey Ashe's study of Arthur. Not 100% accurate but at least useful and not recyclable . . ."},{"Title":"Showcase Presents: Superman, Vol. 1","review":"As other reviews of books in the Showcase Presents series have noted, this is DC's version of the Marvel Essentials series-- B&W reproductions of comics published decades ago. The comics in this particular edition were originally published between June '58 and Nov '59, when I was eight and nine years old and a voracious comics reader. Even now, I can actually remember reading some of the particular comics that are in this book, and while, to an adult, the stories here are simplistic and even sometimes silly, it was, for nostalgia purposes alone, a real delight to get to re-read them again for the inexpensive price of ten dollars. In fact I sort of feel sorry for children growing up now, who have to make do with comics that are kind of grim and sordid, in contrast to the clearly drawn, cheerful and good-hearted ones that existed back in the fifties and sixties."},{"Title":"Showcase Presents: Superman, Vol. 1","review":"I'm only in my 20s, definitely not the traditional age for Silver Age fans, but I've loved these simplistic, often goofy stories for years. I buy quite a few modern comics, but I always make time for things like this. DC's Showcase line is a Godsend! In this volume, we have over 500 pages of classic Silver Age stories that are brimming with endless possibilities. This was in a time where creators weren't afraid to throw logic out the window if it made for a more entertaining story. Some of my favorite moments from this book include:-Batman shopping for a birthday gift for Superman at the mall, in full costume!-President Superman solving the budget deficit by filling Fort Knox with treasure he found in wrecked pirate ships on the ocean floor.-Batman taking a week off from crimefighting so he can break into the Fortress of Solitude and play pranks on Superman.-Superman scheming to eliminate the manifestation of his new power: a tiny version of himself that grows out of his hand, and steals his thunder!-Superman becoming a lion.-Superman using his super vision to see through the time barrier!this book is filled with such craziness, from cover to cover.

Clark Kent was all of these things in 1958--kind of corny, huh? Then I guess, Corny is good--especially when you talk about our kids.But I love these stories for the cheezy (by today's standards) mysteries. How did Superman know ...? And some of the stories are classics, the first Metallo, first Supergirl, his first real proposal to (guess who)...And I love the turmoil Clark experiences guarding his greatest secret. Clark wants to tell Lois \\"I'm Superman, let's get married and live happily ever after.\\" But no; if the world knew his identity, then his friends would be in constant danger. So Clark sacrifices his own desires for the safety of his friends and the good of his country.That's right, I said country.

One thing I would like to see added is some biographical information, particularly for unsung writers like Bill Finger.

Many coloring these days is done by computer and it shows, you simply cannot compare older comics' coloring with the average comics of today. Now if modern comics would just drop the 'we have to be so incredibly intense and violent all the time' everything would be in great shape. Not that I have anything against these things, it would just be nice if it wasn't every comic I read today from front to back. I love the Dark Knight Returns, but I also love wacky older Batman stories and the Batman TV show.

But something has ALWAYS been bothering me about the reviews......I believe that there should be a button to click if over 40 or under 40. How are we to know what time of life a person is in in order to judge a review. Myself over 40, is not going to NEED nor LIKE a book that i.e. a 16. 20 year old is raving about. I'm sure there are others out there who have at some time had the same thoughts, which often renders 'reviews' useless really, unless we know from whence it came, AND also what part of the world they're from [and what state if in America, which is also very different lifestyles and mentalities.... wish also education level but I KNOW that's too much to ask, and am not going THAT far, lol]......I LOVE Amazon's reviews, so don't misunderstand, and always come here FIRST to read about a book no matter where I came across it, but there are certain subjects and genres which DO require at least an age range to get a better perspective of from what vantage point a reviewer is speaking......Actually my opinion is for ALL books, although some more than others.......I hope you see this, Amazon, and take the suggestion HEAVILY into consideration and pass it on, when evaluating whether to print it or not, because this is more important a matter than even a single 'review', and please pass this request on......because whatever one person requests, are coming from 100's of thousands of others as well, but who don't bother to write or suggest things, but would love the same concept.....I'm SURE I speak for everyone, but especially the one's over 40 who can just instantly see the age range of someone FIRST, then move past it if inappropriate for our mind frame and maturity. We all don't need, nor benefit from everyone's opinions, only from those in the same stage of life. Just being ''over 18'' really doesn't help us [and I don't think even that 'shows' in the actual printed review, but would be too vast a range anyway, even if it did]. OVER 40 or UNDER 40, [a simple button of only two for every reviewer to click] would be PERFECT to be able to see on EACH and every review. Thanks so much."},{"Title":"Ford GT40: Production and Racing History, Individual Chassis Records","review":"OK we are speaking GT-40 here! Any one who buys this book is certainly a die hard GT-40 enthusiast. The book being out of production is not inexpensive. However what you get from this publication by Trevor Legate is the evolution of the marque when Shelby was still building Cobra Roadsters. This is a serious publication that delivers a thorough documentation of the live of this machine that beat Ferrarirace cars that had dominated Le Mans and so many other sports car racing venues.You get individual chassis histories and the history of hard knocks learned byan American mind set of oval NASA car and drag strip racing to GT class racing in Europe. This was uncharted territory that took it time to develop, but like \\"The Moon Landing in 1969 \\" it was an historical event. There are many black and White and color period photos frozen in time.This publication also goes into the Road Cars and the present day Ford GT Cars. There is even seriously a parts break down in the back of this book. like I said this is speaking GT-40 for the serious Ford Enthusiast.Bob Gecoford Enthusiast"},{"Title":"Our stories: The soul of sign language interpreting","review":"&quot;Our Stories&quot; is a really great book!

The 1993 \\"update\\" is so painful to read because the new author, Bobbe Sommer literally QUOTES Maxwell Maltz repeatedly while trying to add her own insightful messages. For example, on page 3 of her \\"update\\", she states:\\"Whether we realize it or not,\\" Maltz wrote, \\"each of us carries...\\"Well, if you just read the original 1960's book, your eyeballs don't waste time on the \\"Maltz wrote\\" phrase altogether... duh!...because Maxwell was the one who wrote it!The only reasons to endure Bobbe Sommer's endless \\"Maltz said....; Maltz learned that...; Maltz studied...; Maltz wrote...; Maltz realized...\\" is if she added some totally mindblowing ideas OR contradicted his work. In my opinion she didn't.BTW, I was not prejudiced by reading the original first and then reading the 1993 update to see if it was any better; I actually (and unfortunately) read the 1993 book first. I thought the 1960 original was out of print but I accidentally stumbled on the original copy at Border's Books. I read a chapter and realized his true words were so much more inspirational. Not dry and academic like Bobbe Sommer's version. I think the publisher of the new book was deliberately trying to confuse the public by making the cover look the same as the old one. I think it's borderline unethical...buyer beware!Apparently, Amazon's algorithm to link up user reviews with books is heavily based on the book's title. Most of the time, this works great when there's a paperback and a hardcopy version of the same book. But in this case, the 1960's book and the 1993 are completely different and should not point to the same user reviews! All the glowing reviews listed below? They are the same for both titles. You really don't know which book the reviewers were praising. I'm going to guess it's the 1960's version. See for yourself, plug in either ISBN #s and you'll get the identical list of user reviews.BTW, this Amazon loophole gives me a great idea: I can write a new book about how to become a master at appraising and certifying jewelry like wedding bands and title it \\"Lord of the Rings\\"--and shazam--Amazon's engine will give my book the 5 stars and all the wonderful reviews of Tolkien's classic.I give 5 stars for Maltz's 1960 original. I give 2 stars for Bobbe Sommer's update. Again, if the ISBN is 0671700758 click \\"add to cart\\". If it says ISBN 156731306X, try again."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"I have not read the original book by Maxwell Maltz yet, but after reading this book I will.I was a newcomer to the conceptual ideas contained in this book. In the UK no-one seemed to know Maltz or his theory.The ideas and the way this book was written are conducive to a clear understanding and application of Maltz's theory. As a newcomer I can recomend this book on it's own merits. It is clearly written, the theory is clearly laid out and in simple terms.The theory itself is breathtakingly simple, but the repercussions on areas such as goal setting and goal attainment are INCREDIBLE. I had always grown up to understand that it is Willpower that will conquer all, and goal success can only be attained by using willpower. Everytime I tried to use willpower I seemed to fail. This theory explains why failure will occur, and what to do about it, and how to set goals and achieve them.If you are a failed goal setter, who habitually prefers procrastination than action, this book and application of the theory, will change your life.Application of the theory contained in the book will have a profound affect on your life.Highly Recomended"},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"I read the origional book by Maltz 15 years ago and it really helped to change my life. I'm always picking up self help books because I believe if you get at least one new idea from it,then it is worth it. Well I can't really say that I got much from this book, nothing actually.I picked it up mainly because I wanted to see how Dr. Maltz's ideas are viewed with the advancements in the field of psycology. I saw that it mentioned something about the right and left hemispheres of the brain which was something that the original did not touch on.This version by Bobbe Sommer is long and drawn out, just filled with story after story after story, that really never address anything. A book just needs to tell a person the technics, don't give a thousand case studies. Sure the origional version gives a few examples, be they had a point to them.The author claims that this book speaks in a language that people can understand today and not in the \\"outdated language\\" of the origional. All she does is use a few references that have happened since the origional and mention a few modern appliances that weren't around back then.If you want something that will make a difference, buy the origional Psyco-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz. The ideas were true then and they are true now. If some of the expressions seem outdated, you know how to update it in you own mind. The truth of the book still stands strong today. I'm pulling my old copy off of shelf and reading it again."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"I read the original Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz in the early 70's. I read it again last month and then read Bobbe Sommer's version. I think the original is better. Maltz keeps it simple and focuses on the subconscious as the primary goal seeking mechanism. I thought Sommer's book diluted the message with cross messages from other self help techniques. Maltz's method works great. It's simple and effective. It's not a self help book, it's a book about reprogramming yourself. Sommer seems to turn the science into a self affirmation exercise."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"This book is so instrumental that I plan order additional copies for family and freinds.The results I have achieved are fascinating.The techniques are simple and effective but you must take action! Just reading the book will not do, you must apply the imformation.I've used this book to improve my self esteem,release stress, improve focus and master the art of goal setting.I highly recommend it for those serious about changing their life.I would also recommend&quot;Psychology of Winning and Nine Empowering Secrets of Successful Living-Dennis Waitley,Think and Grow Rich-Napoleon Hill and Awaken the Gaint Within and Unlimited Power-Anthony Robbins&quot;.I would also recommend Using your Brain for a Change-Richard Bandler-a teacher to Anthony Robbins,covers the subject of NLP.Take back your life and read this book!"},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"This book is a complete spin-off of the original PSYCHO CYBERNETICS By Maxwell Maltz, which was a classic. Don't buy this book as it's just a get-rich-quick scheme by the author Bobbe Sommer as she adds nothing substantial to the original material, just her own boring stories. I have the original book by Maxwell Maltzand it is one of the best self help book I have ever read. Bobbe Sommer has just ruined the PSYCHO CYBERNETICS philosophy by adding her own crap in this book."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"This work draws on the work of Dr. Maxwell Maltz in helping an individual see how self-perception can improve one's quality of life. In the introduction we're told, &quot;by expanding your self-image, you expand the limits of your talents and capabilities.&quot; The liberating news for those seeking to change a negative self-image is that it is viewed as a habit which can be changed in six weeks. For those of us who are already familiar with the importance of maintaining a healthy self-image, this book reinforces our beliefs. Sommer explains she was first introduced to the concepts of psycho-cybernetics while in graduate school.The first chapter explains how self-image creates an individual's reality regardless of how accurate it is. It is true to the one who believes it to be so. She goes on to briefly trace the work in the field which came before Maltz's book. She emphasizes that our actions grow out of our beliefs. &quot;People always feel, act and behave according to what they imagine to be true about themselves and their circumstances,&quot; she reminds us.This book is easy to read, yet scholarly based. Her sources are identified and documentation can be traced back to orginal sources for those seeking to explore the topic further. The subject matter is practical. In all this is a good book that teaches you how to improve the quality of your life through the thoughts you think."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"I have read the original and I have read this one. The original is great. This one is better. It has concrete steps and explains how exactly to implement Maltz's revolutionary ideas of self-image enhancement. I got the feeling with the original that Maxwell Maltz was so turned on and excited by these new discoveries that he was eager to just \\"get it out there\\" and worry about the details later. The creators of Psycho-Cybernetics 2000, having had the opportunity to see Maltz's ideas applied in the field for 33 years, show us concrete examples of how actual people applied Psycho-Cybernetics to improve their actual experience. The example about the good-looking guy who couldn't get it up was a gem. I am not a flag-defender (I call people who are more interested in explaining why one methodology is better than another instead of just using whatever method to get results, flag-defenders) and many of the negative reviews seem to be written by these people. In PC 2000 you will find a much clearer language as to how to actually put Maltz's ideas into practice. That being said, the original is great for giving you the backgroud for the power of the self-image. In short, if I were to choose an action book, get PC 2000; if you want a theroy book with a few applicable ideas, get Maltz's original PC."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"Came across Psych-Cybernetics 2000 by accident and decided to take a look hoping to give it to my youngest daughter at high school graduation. The message here is certainly Dr. Maltz's but the presentation and writing are too dry, too wordy, too nineties, and too gimmicky for me. The original Psycho-Cybernetics published in the sixties virtually changed my life and how I look at myself and the world. I was happy to find that the original is still in print and decided to give that one to my daughter instead. My yellowing tattered old copy is still in my personal library having travelled all over the country with me from house to house to house and surviving several major bookshelf lightenings over the past thirty-five years. The late Dr. Maltz should be canonized for his insightful and timeless therapeutic messages, and his excellent presentation of his various theses. While Dr. Sommer's Psycho-Cybernetics 2000 brings his message a little more up to date, the original book is by no means dated except for an innocently pre-feminist, mostly male, fifties/sixties orientation. But Psycho-Cybernetics 2000 just doesn't flow as smoothly as the original, nor is is as compellingly written. Though it might, however, be better received by those not familiar with the original, I was probably spoiled by what I think is a more inspirational presentation. Either way, the psycho-biological message is unassailable in my professional biologist eyes. Maybe both books should be on one's library shelves since Pscho-Cybernetics 2000 is written from a somewhat different utilitarian perspective than the original Psycho-Cybernetics."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],P={key:0},B={key:1};function E(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",P,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const q=u(M,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-8eb52b70"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/36.md","filePath":"drive/36.md"}'),L={name:"drive/36.md"},D=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{N as __pageData,D as default};
